5|$|Ellen Biddle Shipman {{designed}} the Italian Garden in May 1931. It features {{two rows of}} clipped evergreens between two long, rectangular reflecting pools. It has a focal point {{at the end of}} the garden in the form of a marble fountain surrounded by an arched gloriette. There are also a number of statues, ornaments, tubs of <b>small</b> <b>trees,</b> and flowers.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{about one}} percent of the total {{vegetation}} in the park consisted of grasses, bracken, thistle, and fireweed in sections of the forest cleared two to five years earlier. Another two percent had reached the shrub stage, between three and thirty years old, with <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> dominated by such plants as thimbleberry, salmonberry, and blackberry. Forest areas 10 to 30years old that contained tall alder and maple trees and smaller conifers accounted for about 20percent of the park.|$|E

5|$|On November 16, 2011, the {{production}} received a fine (between $343–$3,440) from the Bulgarian {{environmental protection agency}} for unlawfully removing shrubs and <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> from the entrance of Devetashka Cave. Although permits had been obtained allowing sets {{to be built in}} the area (including a bridge to the cave), environmentalists complained that filming could damage the cave (home to about 40 endangered species). To avoid further problems, the producers agreed not to film explosions, car chases and fires near the cave.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the core}} collections. One site {{contains}} Red Maple (Acer rubrum), Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum), Silver Maple (Acer saccharinum), and Striped Maple (Acer pensylvanicum). Another contains an overstory of Acer x freemanii with an understory of shade-loving maples, including snakebark maples (Acer davidii and Acer tegmentosum) and <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> similar to the Japanese maple, such as Acer shirasawanum and Acer pseudosieboldianum. A third site consists primarily of small Asian Maples.|$|E
5|$|A former film studio {{located on}} Eastern Avenue was {{designated}} as a temporary detention centre for individuals arrested during the summit. Toronto Police Service announced that Trinity Bellwoods Park would be the designated protest area, but following opposition from local residents, police relocated the designated protest zone to {{the northern part of}} Queen's Park. Canada Post declared that it would remove post boxes in the security zone. Toronto Parking Authority removed some parking meters as well. <b>Small</b> <b>trees</b> along sidewalks around the convention centre were removed to prevent them from being used as weapons by protesters. Other removed municipal properties include 745 newspaper boxes, 200 public trash cans, 70 mailboxes, 29 bus shelters, and 5 public information boards.|$|E

5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. <b>Small</b> <b>trees</b> may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar cane, and this has affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited on food crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} of Santa María de Óvila were well-to-do farmers who cared little for the {{buildings}}. For a brief time, the former monastery {{was used as}} a hostel, but mainly, the buildings were subjected to hard agricultural use as barns sheltering livestock. The chapter house served as a manure pit. Other buildings were used as storage. In the early 20th century <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> were seen to be growing in the dirt packed atop the monastery roofs—the protective roof tiles had long since been taken down and sold.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance to Tropical Storm Dean produced 1.07inches (27mm) {{of rain in}} Saint Thomas, where winds reached 40mph (64km/h) with gusts to 48mph (77km/h). On Saint Croix, {{the system}} produced 0.49inches (12mm) of rain and peak wind gusts of 47mph (76km/h). There, minor flooding was reported. Moderate wind gusts downed <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> and branches in Saint Croix and Saint John, and some roads were damaged in Saint John, as well. Heavy rains and gusty winds caused power outages throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands. The passage of Tropical Storm Dean resulted in minor damage totaling to $20,000 (2001USD, $24,400 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{purposes}} of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise {{of effort and}} ingenuity (for the grower). Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping {{of one or more}} <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> growing in a container, beginning with a cutting, seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai and a miniature deciduous forest can even be created using such species as Japanese maple, Japanese zelkova or hornbeam.|$|E
5|$|They live {{throughout}} rainforest, dry sclerophyll (Eucalyptus) forest, open woodland, Pandanus thickets, paperbarks, mangroves, watercourses, and wetter {{areas of}} semi-arid regions, {{as well as}} parks, gardens, and golf courses in urban areas. The understory in eucalypt-dominated woodland where the blue-faced honeyeater is found is most commonly composed of grasses such as Triodia, but sometimes it {{is made up of}} shrubs or <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> such as grevilleas, paperbarks, wattles, Cooktown ironwood (Erythrophleum chlorostachys) or billygoat plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana). One study in Kakadu National Park found that blue-faced honeyeaters inhabited mixed stands of eucalypts and Pandanus but were missing from pure stands of either plant.|$|E

5|$|Two villages {{situated}} on the southern boundary were shifted to the Firozpur–Manpur area {{situated on}} Ramnagar–Kashipur highway during 1990–93; the vacated areas were designated as buffer zones. The families in these villages were mostly dependent on forest products. With the passage of time, these areas began {{to show signs of}} ecological recovery. Vines, herbs, grasses and <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> began to appear, followed by herbaceous flora, eventually leading to natural forest type. It was observed that grass began to grow on the vacated agricultural fields and the adjoining forest areas started recuperating. By 1999–2002 several plant species emerged in these buffer zones. The newly arisen lush green fields attracted grass eating animals, mainly deer and elephants, who slowly migrated towards these areas and even preferred to stay there throughout the monsoon.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla {{is grown}} on small patches of land {{both as a}} single crop {{as well as an}} inter crop. As it needs lot of water for growth, it is largely grown on the rainier {{windward}} side of the island. Initially, vanilla is planted next to <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> until its vines grow to some height, at which point it is cut down closer to the soil so that it spreads across the ground. It starts to flower when about three years old; the flowering period is from July to August.|$|E
5|$|The Hell Creek, Lance and Scollard Formations {{represent}} different {{sections of}} the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway that divided western and eastern North America during the Cretaceous. They represent a broad coastal plain, extending westward from the seaway to the newly formed Rocky Mountains. These formations are composed largely of sandstone and mudstone, which {{have been attributed to}} floodplain environments. The regions where Ankylosaurus and other Late Cretaceous ankylosaurs have been found had a warm subtropical/temperate climate, which was monsoonal, had occasional rainfall, tropical storms, and forest fires. In the Hell Creek Formation, many types of plants were supported, primarily angiosperms, with less common conifers, ferns and cycads. An abundance of fossil leaves found at dozens of different sites indicates that the area was largely forested by <b>small</b> <b>trees.</b> Ankylosaurus shared its environment with dinosaurs including the ceratopsids Triceratops and Torosaurus, the hypsilophodont Thescelosaurus, the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus, an indeterminate nodosaur, the pachycephalosaurian Pachycephalosaurus, and the theropods Struthiomimus, Ornithomimus, Troodon, and Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The first cacti {{are thought}} to have been only {{slightly}} succulent shrubs or <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> whose leaves carried out photosynthesis. They lived in tropical areas that experienced periodic drought. If Pereskia clade A is a good model of these early cacti, then, although they would have appeared superficially similar to other trees growing nearby, they had already evolved strategies to conserve water (some of which are present in members of other families in the order Caryophyllales). These strategies included being able to respond rapidly to periods of rain, and keeping transpiration low by using water very efficiently during photosynthesis. The latter was achieved by tightly controlling the opening of stomata. Like Pereskia species today, early ancestors may have been able to switch from the normal C3 mechanism, where carbon dioxide is used continuously in photosynthesis, to CAM cycling, in which when the stomata are closed, carbon dioxide produced by respiration is stored for later use in photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Volvariella surrecta {{is a rare}} species, {{even though}} its major host is quite common; the {{conditions}} required for the parasite to produce fruit bodies are not well known. Some authors have suggested that it may grow equally well as a parasite or a saprobe. V.surrecta has been found on its host in several different habitat types, including birch woodlands, pine plantations, scrub, thickets of <b>small</b> <b>trees</b> or shrubs beside roads, and under brambles. No definite preference for soil type has been determined, having been found in sands, clay, gravels, and peat. In 1867, Worthington George Smith {{reported that he had}} successfully cultivated the species by partially burying fruit bodies under water-soaked rotting fir leaves that were placed in a bell-glass in a warm room. According to his account, a white mycelium grew over the leaves and eventually formed small white pins (immature, undifferentiated fruit bodies) that grew into fully formed mushrooms about two weeks after starting.|$|E
