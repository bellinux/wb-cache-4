40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of grapefruit juice and <b>seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice on dextromethorphan (DM) pharmacokinetics. Eleven healthy volunteers were studied over a 3 -week period consisting of 5 study days each separated by a three-day washout. All subjects refrained from drinking caffeine containing beverages (coffee, soda, etc.) 8 h before orally taking DM (30 mg) with 200 ml water, 200 ml grapefruit juice, 200 ml water, 200 ml <b>seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice, and 200 ml water on Study Days 1 to 5. Aliquots of urine samples were assayed and analysed for DM, and the DM metabolites dextrorphan, 3 -methoxymorphinan and 3 -hydroxymorphinan using a validated HPLC method employing a phenyl column and a fluorescence detection. Results suggests that DM could provide some useful information on P-glycoprotein or related membrane efflux protein activity in the human gastro-intestinal tract. Bioavailability (F) of DM increased significantly with grapefruit and <b>seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice, but only returned to half the baseline value after three days of washout. This confirms that grapefruit and <b>seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice are long-lasting and perhaps irreversible inhibitors of gut CYP 3 A/P-glycoprotein.

50|$|Imatinib (Gleevec): Although {{no formal}} studies with imatinib and {{grapefruit}} juice have been conducted, {{the fact that}} grapefruit juice is a known inhibitor of the CYP 3A4 suggests that co-administration may lead to increased imatinib plasma concentrations. Likewise, although no formal studies were conducted, co-administration of imatinib with another specific type of citrus juice called <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice (SOJ) may lead to increased imatinib plasma concentrations via inhibition of the CYP3A isoenzymes. <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice is not usually consumed as a juice because of its sour taste, but it is found in marmalade and other jams. <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice {{has been reported to}} be a possible inhibitor of CYP3A enzymes without affecting MDR1 when taken concomitantly with ciclosporin.|$|R

50|$|According to the Beefeater website, Beefeater Gin {{contains}} {{nine different}} botanicals: juniper, angelica root, angelica seeds, coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, orris root, <b>seville</b> <b>oranges,</b> and lemon peel. Unique to Beefeater’s production is the steeping of the peel of lemons and <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges,</b> whole juniper berries {{and other natural}} botanicals for a full 24 hours prior to distillation. This long process allows for a full extraction of flavour from the botanicals, capturing {{a wide range of}} volatile oils. The distillation itself takes around eight hours to complete, overseen by master distiller Desmond Payne - with the spirit then taken to Scotland where it is blended and bottled at 40% ABV.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{labeling}} for colchicine (indicated for acute gout flares or prophylaxis) includes strict advisories regarding drug–drug and drug–food interactions, including warnings against consuming grapefruit or {{grapefruit juice}} during treatment. Two of the furocoumarins in grapefruit juice and <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice can inhibit intestinal cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isozyme 3 A 4 and P-glycoprotein (involved in colchicine metabolism and transport). Severe toxicities in patients consuming these juices while taking other drugs metabolized through these pathways have been reported. ObjectiveTwo Phase I studies assessed {{the effects of}} multiple daily consumptions of <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice or grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetic properties of colchicine in healthy volunteers. MethodsHealthy volunteers were enrolled in 2 open-label, Phase I studies. Undiluted juice (240 mL) was administered twice daily for 4 days. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained following a single 0. 6 -mg dose of colchicine before the administration of juice and again following a single 0. 6 -mg dose of colchicine {{on the final day}} of juice administration. In each study, blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected before dosing with colchicine and at 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose. All subjects were monitored for adverse events (AEs) throughout the confinement portion of the study and were queried at the outpatient visits. AEs were coded according to corresponding MedDRA-coded system organ classes. ResultsForty-four subjects received either grapefruit juice (72. 7 % male; 90. 9 % white) or <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice (62. 5 % female; 100 % white). Although it is considered to be a moderate concentration-dependent CYP 3 A 4 inhibitor, grapefruit juice did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of colchicine. When colchicine was administered with <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice, a moderate inhibitor, Cmax and AUC were decreased by ∼ 24 % and ∼ 20 %, respectively. <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice also caused, on average, a 1 -hour delay in Tmax. Colchicine in combination with grapefruit or <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice was well tolerated. There were no significant treatment-related AEs reported, and the most likely AEs were general gastrointestinal events. ConclusionsIn contrast to label warnings based on the literature, grapefruit juice did not affect the pharmacokinetics of colchicine. <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice paradoxically reduced absorption of colchicine and increased Tmax, but the clinical significance of this is unknown. Contrary to the expected effects of inhibiting the enzymes that metabolize colchicine, neither juice increased exposure to colchicine. However, the absence of a positive control in these studies dictates that caution should be used when applying these results clinically.

Other widely known uses are enhancing stamina in athletes. C. aurantium extract is widely known as C. aurantium extract, a product that {{is derived from the}} immature green fruits of the <b>Seville</b> <b>orange.</b> C. aurantium is a small citrus tree, about 5  m tall, with scented white flowers. C. aurantium is too sour to be popular for eating, but the ripe fruit is eaten in Iran and in Mexico and fresh fruits are sometimes eaten with salt and chili paste.|$|R

50|$|After {{the almost}} instant {{success of the}} gin, it was soon made the James Burrough Company’s {{flagship}} product. The original Beefeater recipe book dated 1895, specifies that nine botanicals are essential (juniper, angelica root, angelica seeds, coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, orris root, <b>seville</b> <b>oranges</b> and lemon peel) to create the full-bodied and robust flavour so distinct in this gin.|$|E
50|$|Both {{sweet oranges}} and bitter oranges {{appear to be}} mandarin-pomelo hybrids,. Bitter oranges (such as the <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges</b> often used in marmalade) can {{interfere}} with drugs including etoposide, a chemotherapy drug, some beta blocker drugs used to treat high blood pressure, and cyclosporine, taken by transplant patients to prevent rejection of their new organs.

50|$|Grapefruit, <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges,</b> bergamot, and {{possibly}} other citrus also contain {{large amounts of}} naringin.

This is problematic as a 4 oz portion of grapefruit contains enough naringin to inhibit the metabolism of substrates of CYP3A4. Nagarin is a flavonoid which contributes to the bitter flavour of grapefruit.|$|E

50|$|This can be {{a problem}} for those who can eat only some citrus varieties. Drug {{interactions}} with chemicals found in some citrus, including grapefruit and <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges,</b> make the ancestry of citrus fruit of interest; many commonly sold citrus varieties are grapefruit hybrids or pummello-descended grapefruit relatives.
