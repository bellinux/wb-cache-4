25|$|These brakes {{are simple}} and {{effective}} for relatively narrow tyres but have significant flex and resulting poor performance if the arms are made {{long enough to}} fit wide tyres. If not adjusted properly, low-quality varieties tend to rotate to one side during actuation and tend to stay there, {{making it difficult to}} evenly <b>space</b> <b>brake</b> shoes away from the rim. These brakes are now used on inexpensive bikes; before the introduction of dual-pivot caliper brakes they were used on all types of road bikes.|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Space Shuttle fleet was {{originally}} intended {{to have a life}} of 100 flights for each vehicle, lasting over a 10 -year period, with minimal scheduled maintenance or inspection. The first space shuttle flight was that of the Space Shuttle Columbia (OV- 102), launched April 12, 1981. The disaster that destroyed Columbia occurred on its 28 th flight, February 1, 2003, nearly 22 years after its first launch. In order to minimize risk of losing another Space Shuttle, a probabilistic life and reliability analysis was conducted for the <b>Space</b> Shuttle rudder/speed <b>brake</b> actuators to determine the number of flights the actuators could sustain. A life and reliability assessment of the actuator gears was performed in two stages: a contact stress fatigue model and a gear tooth bending fatigue model. For the contact stress analysis, the Lundberg-Palmgren bearing life theory was expanded to include gear-surface pitting for the actuator as a system. The mission spectrum of the <b>Space</b> Shuttle rudder/speed <b>brake</b> actuator was combined into equivalent effective hinge moment loads including an actuator input preload for the contact stress fatigue and tooth bending fatigue models. Gear system reliabilities are reported for both models and their combination. Reliability of the actuator bearings was analyzed separately, based on data provided by the actuator manufacturer. As a result of the analysis, the reliability of one half of a single actuator was calculated to be 98. 6 percent for 12 flights. Accordingly, each actuator was subsequently limited to 12 flights before removal from service in the Space Shuttle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Anti-locking {{brake systems}} (ABS) are well {{established}} in the automotive industry as a safety feature. ABS generally offers superior vehicle safety by limiting the longitudinal wheel slip in a braking event with deep slip condition.

At the same time, this solution improve the dynamic of ABS regulator of the vehicle, allowing an increase of frequency of work and, implicit the reducing the <b>braking</b> <b>space.</b> Drivers would have better directional control of the vehicle equipped with ABS. The performances of constructive solution depending on achieving own resonance frequency are presented and confirmed in this paper by means of results obtained experimentally.

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} road vehicle with hydrodynamic brakes on road slopes, containing disturbances such as the variable load and {{the angle of the}} slope, is presented. The input is the oil filling and the output is the vehicle velocity. A {{mathematical model}} of the filling sump controlled by the proportional spool valve is developed. Using different geometry of the valve output port, the optional geometry is defined so that the pressure response in the chamber are sufficiently linear and quick. The effects of the nonlinear flow through the valve and the air compressibility in the chamber were carefully considered. Finally, a model connecting the control signal in the control unit of the hydrodynamic brake with the pressure in the sump, i. e. with the oil filling in the working <b>space</b> of the <b>brake,</b> is developed, thus completing the modelling and simulation process. The braking torque depends on the oil filling and the number of revolution of the brake rotor. The mathematical models of both the vehicle and the brake are nonlinear, but the analysis is carried out using linear equations valid in corresponding areas limited with nominal values of the model parameters...|$|R

Existing systems only use exchanged data to produce warnings for drivers when needed. Then, data is considered obsolete and is deleted.

40|$|Scuffing-like {{damage has}} been found on the tooth {{surfaces}} of gears 5 and 6 of the NASA <b>space</b> shuttle rudder/speed <b>brake</b> power drive unit (PDU) number 2 after the occurrence of a transient back-driving event in flight. Tests were conducted using a pair of unused spare flight gears in a bench test at operating conditions up to 2866 rpm and 1144 in. -lb at the input ring gear and 14, 000 rpm and 234 in. -lb at the output pinion gear, corresponding to a power level of 52 hp. This test condition exceeds the maximum estimated conditions expected in a backdriving event thought to produce the scuffing damage. Some wear marks were produced, but they were much less severe than the scuffing damaged produced during shuttle flight. Failure to produce scuff damage like that found on the shuttle {{may be due to}} geometrical variations between the scuffed gears and the gears tested herein, more severe operating conditions during the flight that produced the scuff than estimated, the order of the test procedures, the use of new hydraulic oil, differences between the dynamic response of the flight gearbox and the bench-test gearbox, or a combination of these.

40|$|First {{investigations}} on {{the dynamic}} response of bridges due to moving loads {{were motivated by}} the collapse of the Chester railway bridge in the UK {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century. This failure made evident the need to gain some insight on how bridges and vehicles interact, and derived into the first models of moving loads by Willis (1849) and Stokes (1849). These models consisted of a concentrated moving mass where the inertial forces of the underlying structure were ignored. The latter were introduced for simple problems of moving loads on beams in the first half of the 20 th century (Jeffcott, 1929; Inglis, 1934; Timoshenko & Young, 1955). Although Vehicle-Bridge Interaction (VBI) problems were initially addressed by railway engineers, they rapidly attracted interest in highway engineering with the development of the road network and the need to accommodate an increasing demand for heavier and faster vehicle loads on bridges. In the 1920 ’s, field tests carried out by an ASCE committee (1931) laid the basis for recommendations on dynamic allowance for traffic loading in bridge codes, and further testing continued in the 50 ’s as part of the Ontario test programme (Wright & Green, 1963). However, site measurements are insufficient to cover all possible variations of those parameters affecting the bridge response, and VBI modelling offers a mean to extend the analysis to a wide range of scenarios (namely, the effect of road roughness or expansion joints, the effect of vehicle characteristics such as suspension, tyres, speed, axle <b>spacing,</b> weights, <b>braking,</b> or the effect of bridge structural form, dimensions and dynamic properties). A significant step forward took place in the 50 ’s and 60 ’s with the advent of computer technology. It is of particular relevance the work by Frýba (1972), who provides an extensive literature review on VBI and solutions to differential equations of motion of 1 -D continuous beam bridge models when subjected to a constant or periodic force, mass and sprung vehicle models. At that time, VBI methods were focused on planar beam and vehicle models made of a limited number of degrees of freedom (DOFs). From the decade of the 70 ’s, the increase in computer power has facilitated the use of numerical methods based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) and more realistic spatial models with a large number of DOFs. This chapter reports on the most widely used finite element techniques for modelling road vehicles and bridges, and for implementing the interaction between both...|$|R
