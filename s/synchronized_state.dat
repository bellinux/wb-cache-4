50|$|All {{these forms}} of {{synchronization}} share the property of asymptotic stability. This means that once the <b>synchronized</b> <b>state</b> has been reached, {{the effect of a}} small perturbation that destroys synchronization is rapidly damped, and synchronization is recovered again. Mathematically, asymptotic stability is characterized by a positive Lyapunov exponent of the system composed of the two oscillators, which becomes negative when chaotic synchronization is achieved.|$|E

Anticipated synchronization may occur between chaotic oscillators whose dynamics is described by delay differential equations, coupled in a drive-response configuration. In this case, the response anticipates the dynamics of the drive. Lag synchronization may occur when the strength of the coupling between phase-synchronized oscillators is increased.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the emergence of}} different kinds of imperfect <b>synchronized</b> <b>states</b> and chimera states in two interacting populations of nonlocally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. We find that the complete synchronization in population-I and existence of solitary oscillators which escape from the synchronized group in population-II lead to imperfect <b>synchronized</b> <b>states</b> for sufficiently small values of nonisochronicity parameter. Interestingly, on increasing the strength of this parameter further there occurs an onset of mixed imperfect <b>synchronized</b> <b>states</b> where the solitary oscillators occur from both the populations. Synchronized oscillators from both the populations are locked to a common average frequency. In both the cases of imperfect <b>synchronized</b> <b>states</b> <b>synchronized</b> oscillators exhibit periodic motion while the solitary oscillators are quasi-periodic in nature. In this region, for spatially prepared initial conditions, we can observe the mixed chimera states where the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations occur from both the populations. On the other hand, imperfect <b>synchronized</b> <b>states</b> are not always stable, and they can drift aperiodically due to instability caused by an increase of nonisochronicity parameter. We observe that these states are robust to the introduction of frequency mismatch between the two populations. Comment: Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

We report these clustered states in experiments involving an ensemble of sixteen mercury beating heart (MBH) oscillators. These oscillators interact via resistors and are subjected to two different network schemes: 1) All to all and 2) Nonlocal. For the all to all network, the coupling strengths were inhomogeneously distributed, whereas for the nonlocal network scenario, each oscillator was coupled, with an identical coupling strength, with four of its nearest neighbors in either direction. For both of these network schemes, partially <b>synchronized</b> <b>states</b> results into grouping of these oscillators, wherein some oscillators are synchronized and rest are unsynchronized. For all to all network, the partially <b>synchronized</b> <b>states</b> are observed, for the intermediate inhomogeneities, when subjected to the power law and the 'U' shape profiles of coupling strengths. Irrespective of the coupling profile chosen, low inhomogeneities in the coupling strengths leaves all the oscillators in a single coherent state whereas for the high inhomogeneities scenarios oscillators {{are located in the}} incoherent domain. In comparison, for the nonlocal network partially <b>synchronized</b> <b>states</b> emerge when the coupling constant is appropriately. chosen. The experimental results for both these network scenarios have been analyzed using the redox time series (chemical activity) and the time evolution of the normalized areas for the mercury drop (mechanical activity).
