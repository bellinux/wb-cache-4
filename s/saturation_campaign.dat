5000|$|During the Great Depression, Sam and Albert Abrams, chemists and {{entrepreneurs}} from Brooklyn, took over an ailing boot polish maker, the Knomark Manufacturing Company of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In 1938 they purchased the Esquire brand. After a <b>saturation</b> advertising <b>campaign</b> in 1944, the company became the best selling shoe polish manufacturer in the US. A 1951 advertising campaign featured the singer and television star Kate Smith. In the late 1950s, they sold the Esquire brand and the 1914-built Esquire Building on 330 Wythe Avenue in Brooklyn. In 1957, Revlon acquired the Esquire brand which made {{annual sales of}} 15 million dollars. Revlon sold the Esquire shoe polish brand and other Esquire product brands in 1969. The Sara Lee company purchased the Esquire brand in 1987, which discontinued it in favor of their Kiwi brand. In 1994, Papercraft Corp. of Pittsburgh purchased the Esquire brand from Sara Lee.|$|R

40|$|In urban areas, {{air quality}} is {{the outcome of}} {{multiple}} emission sources, each emitting a different combination of air pollutants. The result is a complex mixture of pollutants with a different spatiotemporal variability for each constituent. Studies exploring average spatial patterns across urban areas typically rely on air quality monitoring networks of a few sites, short multi-site <b>saturation</b> monitoring <b>campaigns</b> measuring {{a limited number of}} pollutants and/or air quality models. Each of these options has limitations. This study elucidates the main complexities of urban air quality with respect to small scale spatial differences for multiple pollutants so as {{to gain a better understanding}} of the variability in exposure estimates in urban areas. Mobile measurements of 23 air pollutants were taken at high resolution in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and examined with respect to space, time and their interrelationships. The same route was systematically followed on 34 measurement days spread over different seasons and measurements were compared to adjacent air quality monitoring network stations. This approach allowed linkage of the mobile measurements to the network observations and to generate average maps that provide reliable information on the typical, annual average spatial pattern. Sharp differences in the spatial distribution were found to exist between different pollutants on the sub-urban scale, i. e. the neighbourhood to street scales, even for pollutants usually associated with the same specific sources. Nearby microenvironments may have a wide range in average pollution levels varying by up to 300 %, which may cause large misclassification errors in estimating chronic exposures in epidemiological studies. For example, NO 2 measurements next to a main road microenvironment are shown to be 210 – 265 % higher than levels measured at a nearby urban background monitoring site, while black carbon is higher by 180 – 200 % and ultrafine particles are 300 % higher. For some pollutants (e. g. SO 2 and benzene), there is good correspondence on a large scale due to similar emission sources, but differences on a small scale in proximity to these sources. Moreover. hotspots of different pollutants were identified and quantified. These results demonstrate the ability of an independent heavily instrumented mobile laboratory survey to quantify the representativeness of the monitoring sites to unmonitored locations, reveal the complex relationships between pollutants and understand chronic multi-pollutant exposure patterns associated with outdoor concentrations in an urban environment...|$|R
40|$|Few could seriously {{claim that}} Australians are not toiling with 'hearts and hands'. Per capita hours worked by Australians are now amongst {{the highest in}} the GECD and there is {{evidence}} that work has intensified for most (see Watson et aI, 2003). There are high levels of temporal, numerical and functional flexibility and corporate profits are booming (ABS, Catalogue 5676. 0, 2005). It is, therefore, unsurprising that the Howard Government's WorkChoices industrial relations reforms have been greeted with widespread antipathy by all but fractions within the business community (Lewis, 2005). The efforts of the, Howard government to prove an impetus for these reforms seems unlikely to accord with the actual working experiences of Australians, many of whom have already traded away conditions and provided employers with considerable flexibility under previous bargaining rounds or individual contracts or through the award simplification process. The $ 50 m. <b>saturation</b> advertising <b>campaign,</b> designed to selI the reforms to the electorate, has had little impact on public sentiment (Humphries, 2005), Nonetheless, the Coalition's slim majority in the Senate means that WorkChoices is likely to proceed into law with few concessions. In recent years the Senate {{has proved to be a}} significant check on the Coalition's more ambitious industrial relations plans, with just 15 out of 56 introduced bills passing into law between 1997 and 2004. The Coalition's remarkable victory in the October 2004 election though has secured a majority in both houses (the first time since 1981, [Singleton, 1996 : 2]) and the Howard Government now claims a mandate to implement wide ranging reforms to industrial relations not seen since the introduction of decentralised wage determination in 1991. Among its other reforms, the Howard Government proposes to replace the 'no disadvantage test' with a new standard against which collective agreements and individual contracts are to be measured, known as the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard (AFPCS). This new standard and its likely impact in Australian Industrial Relations is the subject of this article. We begin our analysis of the AFPCS by placing its introduction in the historical context of the gradual weakening of protective regulation since decentralised bargaining was introduced. Our argument is that the AFPCS is the latest reduction in the steady decline over the last thirteen years of regulation formerly designed to protect wages and conditions from falling. Labor and Coalition governments have both contributed to the dilution of this regulation, although its declining force has been most marked under the Howard government. We contend that, although the steady decline of this regulation has been claimed to stimulate more bargaining by simplifying 'agreement making procedures', it has had adverse implications for procedural and substantive fairness. The AFPCS continues this trend of weakening protective regulation which will only exacerbate existing inequities, especially for the most vulnerable. More particularly, we argue that the impact of the AFPCS must be evaluated in the context of the other introduced reforms, especially the unfair dismissal law exemption. The following analysis also considers the development of the AFPCS in an international context. Prime Minister Howard has asserted that the passage of the WorkChoices reforms will still leave the Australian labour market more regulated than that of the UK and New Zealand. Implicit in this argument is that these are the countries we should be using as benchmarks against which to assess the legislation. So it is important to look at the evidence on the extent of regulation designed to protect wages and conditions in the decentralised bargaining environments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand Drawing together these strands of analysis, the paper concludes that, over time, the AFPCS is likely to result in deleterious bargaining outcomes, particularly for those with little bargaining power in the Australian labour market...|$|R
