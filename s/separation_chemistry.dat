40|$|Uranium oxide {{particles}} were dispersed {{into the}} environment from a factory in Colonie (NY, USA) by prevailing winds during the 1960 ’s and ’ 70 ’s. Uranium concentrations and isotope ratios from bulk soil samples have been accurately measured using inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS) {{without the need for}} analyte <b>separation</b> <b>chemistry.</b> The natural range of uranium concentrations in the Colonie soils has been estimated as 0. 7 – 2. 1 μg g- 1, with a weighted geometric mean of 1. 05 ± 0. 06 μg g 1; the contaminated soil samples comprise uranium up to 500 ± 40 μg g- 1. A plot of 236 U/ 238 U against 235 U/ 238 U isotopes ratios describes a mixing line between natural uranium and depleted uranium (DU) in bulk soil samples; scatter from this line can be accounted for by heterogeneity in the DU particulate. The end-member of DU compositions aggregated in these bulk samples comprises (2. 05 ± 0. 06) x 10 - 3 235 U/ 238 U, (3. 2 ± 0. 1) x 10 - 5 236 U/ 238 U, and (7. 1 ± 0. 3) x 10 - 6 234 U/ 238 U. The analytical method is sensitive to as little as 50 ng g- 1 DU mixed with the natural uranium occurring in these soils. The contamination footprint has been mapped northward from site, and at least one third of the uranium in a soil sample from the surface 5 cm, collected 5. 1 km NNW of the site, is DU. The distribution of contamination within the surface soil horizon follows a trend of exponential decrease with depth, which can be approximated by a simple diffusion model. Bioturbation by earthworms can account for dispersal of contaminant from the soil surface, in the form of primary uranium oxide particulates, and uranyl species that are adsorbed to organic matter. Considering this distribution, the total mass of uranium contamination emitted from the factory is estimated to be c. 4. 8 tonnes...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{is to provide a}} scientific basis for safely processing complexant-containing high-level tank wastes for disposal. Our key goals are to identify a means to prepare realistic complexant-containing tank waste simulants, and to use those simulants to determine the relative importance of organic complexants and their breakdown products on the partitioning of important radionuclides. These goals will be accomplished by artificially aging complexant-containing tank waste simulants using microwave, ultrasound, and photolysis techniques. The simulants will be compared to samples of actual Hanford tank wastes to determine the most realistic aging methods, {{on the basis of the}} organic fragmentation and the partitioning behavior of important radionuclides. Also, we will use our simulant aging process to investigate the relative effects of chelator degradation products on the partitioning of important radionuclides from the waste. Using NMR-active labels in the chelators, we will use a combinatorial approach of generating multiple chelator fragments in a single experiment and then determining which fragments have a negative effect on the <b>separations</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Our successful completion of this goal will specifically identify the most problematic organic fragments in complexant-containing waste and provide the basis for developing successful treatment strategies for these wastes...|$|R
5000|$|The {{test was}} so well {{received}} that Bio-Rad created a second {{arm of the}} company, focused on the growing area of diagnostics. With its technical expertise in <b>separations</b> <b>chemistry,</b> Bio-Rad was now positioned {{to contribute to a}} developing clinical diagnostics market. With the T-4 test, Bio-Rad recognized that laboratory diagnostics was evolving into “applied biochemistry”, in which the knowledge and techniques of research are applied to medicine and diagnostics. It was a turning point for the industry—and the company. [...] Bio-Rad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring instrument systems through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s. In 1999, Bio-Rad purchased Pasteur Sanofi Diagnostics. This strengthened the company’s position in the HIV and infectious disease diagnostic product market. In 2000 and 2004, Bio-Rad divested its semiconductor, optoelectronic metrology, and confocal microscopy product lines. In late 2007, Bio-Rad acquired Switzerland-based DiaMed Holding AG, enhancing Bio-Rad’s position in the immunohematology market. In January 2013, Bio-Rad purchased AbD Serotec, a division of MorphoSys AG. This added Serotec’s more than 15,000 antibodies, kits, and accessories to Bio-Rad’s portfolio of research and clinical diagnostic products.|$|R
