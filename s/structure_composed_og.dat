3000|$|Aiming {{to develop}} the {{proposed}} reduced-rank approach for implementing Volterra filters, we first consider that the kernel implementation strategy introduced in Section 3.1 {{can be used to}} decompose any higher-order kernel (with p≥ 3) into a parallel <b>structure</b> <b>composed</b> exclusively of second-order kernels. This decomposition is straightforward for the third-order kernel, since, by using p= 3 in (35), one obtains a <b>structure</b> <b>composed</b> of N second-order kernels, as described by (31)–(34). In the case of the fourth-order kernel, (35) can be used first for obtaining a <b>structure</b> <b>composed</b> of N third-order kernels and then for decomposing each of these third-order kernels into second-order kernels.

It is proposed that the 30 -year old suggestion of Smagina and reiterated by Kuznicki and others, be adopted: that cilia and eukaryotic flagella be called “undulipodia. ” The term flagella ought to be restricted to prokaryotic organelles, bacterial flagella and spirochaete axial filaments: solid <b>structures</b> <b>composed</b> of flagellin which protrude through the plasma membrane and lack intrinsic motility throughout their length.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of an analytical model for the symbolic computation of the stresses and the strains in a <b>structure</b> <b>composed</b> by spokes. Each spoke is connected to other spokes at the centre of the structure. The spoke tips that are far from the centre of the structure are connected to the ground by means of springs. Given the generalized forces acting at the centre of the structure, the internal forces acting inside the spokes (represented as beams) are computed symbolically. The analytical formulae referring to such internal forces are given for a <b>structure</b> <b>composed</b> by 3 spokes. A validation of the symbolic computation is performed both for the 3 and for the 5 spokes structure. The proposed symbolic computational method may be applied to <b>structures</b> <b>composed</b> by a generic number of spokes. The derived analytical formulae pertaining to the 3 spokes structure have been successfully employed for the design of an innovative six axes load cell...|$|R
