40|$|Digital {{games have}} been used in the {{international}} development industry for over a decade, yet they have received little scholarly attention. This dissertation uses the Half the Sky Movement’s (HTSM) digital games as a case study to understand the production and use of games for development purposes. In doing so, it analyzes the games both as texts that extend the discourse of development, and as material objects with important political economic implications. Specifically, it looks at how the narratives embedded in these games disrupt or reinforce dominant narratives already at play in the development industry, and it considers how the private/public relationships created through the production of the games <b>shape</b> <b>game</b> content and impact both the gaming and development industries. The study uses critical qualitative methods, including textual analysis and in-depth interviews, and a political economic approach to complete this work...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years there has been an {{increase}} in game scholarship conducted in and focussed on areas outside of Western Europe and North America. This scholarship has been recognized and supported by the establishment of regional research networks and regular regional conferences, and has been collected in edited books and journal special issues. Drawing on Edward Casey’s philosophical history of space and place we label this trend “regional game studies” and identify in it a number of general characteristics: regional game studies investigates games and gaming cultures at a range of scales and identifies connections across and between these scales; it highlights and addresses unequal global relations within gaming culture and within the academic study of games; and it enriches the field with new perspectives drawn from regional cultural contexts. The article provides a number of examples of regional game scholarship that demonstrate these characteristics and illustrate the potential of regional game studies to influence game scholarship and <b>shape</b> <b>game</b> studies as a field...|$|E

40|$|Videogame play {{requires}} {{the negotiation of}} multiple synchronic points-of-view enabled {{through the use of}} cameras, avatars, interfaces, and vignettes (the cut-scenes, dialogue, and other attributes normally attributed to the “story”). Concurrent mastery of these points-of-view contributes to the game field of play and enables a greater possibility to complete the game’s goals. Using Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Asheron’s Call as examples, this paper examines the interface as one of the various mechanisms that establish and control the player’s point-of-view in videogames. By understanding the use of point-of-view as one of many components that establish game fiction, we can theorize the imaginary inventions that <b>shape</b> <b>games,</b> even those that do not resemble more traditional narrative forms...|$|R
