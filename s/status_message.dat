Anderson revealed that Alvarez had been using his position as a lawmaker to urge Faeldon, the BoC commissioner, to appoint Alvarez's recommendations. [...] The accusation came after Mandy Anderson had been criticized and scolded in a congressional hearing by Majority Leader, Farinas, due to a Facebook <b>status</b> <b>message,</b> wherein she called Alvarez an [...] "imbecile" [...] for threatening to dissolve the court of appeals. Alvarez has refuted Anderson's claims, saying that he does not know the Customs Officers whose promotion he endorsed and he only knew him through his resume.|$|E

30|$|In COMAC, the {{clustering}} algorithm {{does not}} require any additional messages other than the dissemination of vehicles' <b>status</b> <b>messages.</b> Therefore, when vehicles {{are on the road}} for the first time, they start sending their <b>status</b> <b>messages</b> without an elected cluster head.

Here, we elaborate a novel method for measuring the contagion of emotional expression. With data from millions of Facebook users, we show that rainfall directly influences the emotional content of their <b>status</b> <b>messages,</b> and it also affects the <b>status</b> <b>messages</b> of friends in other cities who are not experiencing rainfall. For every one person affected directly, rainfall alters the emotional expression of about one to two other people, suggesting that online social networks may magnify the intensity of global emotional synchrony. © 2014 Coviello et al...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>status</b> <b>message</b> is a {{function}} of some instant messaging applications whereby a user may post a message that appears automatically to other users if they attempt to make contact. A <b>status</b> <b>message</b> can tell other contacts the user's current status, such as being busy or what the user is currently doing. [...] It is analogous to the voice message in an answering machine or voice mail system. However, status messages may be displayed even if the person is present. They are often updated much more frequently than messages in answering machines, and thus may serve as a means of instant, limited [...] "publication" [...] or indirect communication.Generally Available status is denoted by a green dot while the busy status is denoted by a red dot on most of the Instant Messengers ...|$|E

This version was released to internal beta testers and was not available to the public. Windows Live Web Messenger featured the Windows Live 2.0 user interface, integrated Personal <b>Status</b> <b>Message</b> and display picture functionalities, and allowed tabbed conversations in a [...] "conversation workspace". Windows Live Web Messenger was officially discontinued on October 30, 2008 and its capabilities were integrated into Windows Live Hotmail and Windows Live Contacts. However many functionalities in the beta version of Windows Live Web Messenger, such as tabbed conversations, were unavailable in the Windows Live Contacts and Hotmail version.|$|E
5000|$|The {{graphical}} view, animated in {{real time}} at around 6 frames per second, is composed of 8×8 pixel black-and-white characters, so the view is roughly square, taking a 25×24 area on the 32×24 text screen. Sub-character resolution of the ZX81 pseudo-graphics character set makes the resolution doubled in each dimension (making the view consist of 50×48 [...] "larger pixels"). Using the 6 pseudo-graphics with a dithering pattern also {{made it possible for}} the game author to incorporate a third colour (grey) in the black-and-white picture. Part of the screen is reserved for the score count, and a one-line <b>status</b> <b>message</b> is occasionally overlaid {{at the bottom of the}} graphical view. The player always runs along the corridor's centreline, and looks in the current direction only, which simplifies the rendering task.|$|E
50|$|Watch Outline Updates are relayed (and at {{the initial}} watch issuance, issued) by the Storm Prediction Center, however it is the local National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices that decide what {{counties}} (in their warning area) are included or excluded in the watch, via {{a conference call with}} the SPC. As a result, watch products will sometimes display counties inside the watch outline that are not included in the counties listed, and vice versa; however the local Weather Forecast Office will need to expand to add these counties into the watch. A Watch <b>Status</b> <b>Message</b> works in a similar fashion; the SPC designates which areas it thinks where a threat still exists (the most common designation for this is {{on the basis of the}} location of surface features such as cold fronts and drylines that would delineate where the threat of severe thunderstorms has ended and where it will remain a possibility), and the NWS offices decide what counties to remove from the watch (the local offices will almost always follow the SPC recommendation on the status messages).|$|E
