30|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{activity of}} sample T 3 was further demonstrated by its bactericidal {{effect on the}} viability of E. coli cells and {{compared with that of}} sample T 0 and P 25 TiO 2. The photocatalytic inactivation experiments on E. coli were conducted by exposing the cells suspended in the buffer solution with various photocatalysts under visible-light illumination (λ > 400 nm) for varying time intervals. The <b>survival</b> <b>ratio</b> of E. coli was determined by the ratio of Nt/N 0, where N 0 and Nt are the numbers of colony-forming units at the initial time and each following time interval, respectively. Figure[*] 4 c shows the E. coli <b>survival</b> <b>ratio</b> under various treatments. P 25 TiO 2 showed no obvious bactericidal effect under visible-light illumination. After a 2 -h treatment, the E. coli <b>survival</b> <b>ratio</b> was still around 95 %. The sample T 0 showed a slightly better photocatalytic inactivation effect on E. coli under visible-light illumination compared with P 25 TiO 2 nanoparticles. After a 2 -h treatment, the E. coli <b>survival</b> <b>ratio</b> was around 85 %. The sample T 3 demonstrated a much better photocatalytic inactivation effect on E. coli under visible-light illumination. The <b>survival</b> <b>ratio</b> of E. coli showed a continuous decreasing trend with the increase of visible-light illumination time. After a 2 -h treatment, the <b>survival</b> <b>ratio</b> of E. coli dropped to around 50 %. This observation is in agreement with the photocatalytic degradation experiment results demonstrated in Figure[*] 4 b. Thus, the combination of the large specific area due to their nanosize, high percentage of active { 001 } facets, and enhanced visible-light adsorption due to nitrogen/sulfur co-doping optimized the photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 under visible-light illumination.|$|E

Comparing survival for all cancer sites combined is challenging, because the primary cancer site and age distribution of patients may differ among areas or change over time. Cancer survival indices (CSIs) are summary measures of survival for cancers of all sites combined and are used in England and Europe to monitor temporal trends and examine geographic differences in survival. We describe the construction of the North American Cancer Survival Index and demonstrate how {{it can be used to}} compare survival by geographic area and by race. MethodsWe used data from 36 US cancer registries to estimate relative <b>survival</b> <b>ratios</b> for people diagnosed with cancer from 2006 through 2012 to create the CSI: the weighted sum of age-standardized, site-specific, relative <b>survival</b> <b>ratios,</b> with weights derived from the distribution of incident cases by sex and primary site from 2006 through 2008.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the prognostic value of lymph node ratio (LNR) in patients with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer treated with radical resection. Material and Methods: The characteristic and pathologic parameters of 280 patients operated on for nonmetastatic colorectal cancer at our service were recorded retrospectively. Patients were stratified into 4 groups according to the LNR quartiles of 1 / 12, ¼, ½ and 1. Distribution of demographic data and probability tables were made by ANOVA and χ 2 tests. The cumulative <b>survival</b> <b>ratios</b> for LNR, N stage and TNM stage were calculated by the Kaplan Meier method and survival difference between groups were calculated by the log rank test. Results: There was a statistically significant correlation ratio between metastatic lymph node count and LNR. In 173 of all patients (61. 8 %) fewer than 12 lymph nodes were harvested. One hundred sixtysix (59. 3 %) patients were evaluated as N 0, 79 (28. 2 %) were N 1 and 35 (12. 5 %) were N 2. The number of patients in 4 groups of LNR were 174 (62. 1 %), 72 (25. 7 %), 22 (7. 9 %) and 12 (4. 3 %) respectively.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Knowledge of the {{long-term}} excess mortality in pediatric aneurysm patients is lacking. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess {{the long-term}} excess mortality of 102 pediatric patients with cerebral aneurysm treated at the department of neurosurgery at Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1937 and 2009. Methods—Patients were followed from diagnosis until death or the end of the year 2010. Relative <b>survival</b> <b>ratio</b> provided the measure of excess mortality in these patients compared with mortality of the general Finnish population matched by age, sex, and calendar time. Results—A majority of the patients (n 89) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Aneurysms (n 118) were treated operatively (n 79), endovascularly (n 1), or conservatively (n 36). The mean follow-up time was 26. 8 years (range, 0 – 55. 6 years). By the end of follow-up, 34 of the 102 patients had died; 26 of these deaths (76 %) were aneurysm-related. There was overall excess mortality of 10 % (cumulative relative <b>survival</b> <b>ratio,</b> 0. 90; 95 % CI, 0. 80 – 0. 96) and 19 % (cumulative relative <b>survival</b> <b>ratio,</b> 0. 81; 95 % CI, 0. 66 – 0. 91) at 20 and 40 years after the diagnosis among the 1 -year subarachnoid hemorrhage survivors, respectively. The excess mortality was particularly high in boys. There was no long-term excess mortality among patients with unruptured aneurysms. Aneurysm-related deaths included rebleedings from open or partially occluded aneurysms, epileptic seizures, de novo and recurrent aneurysms, or sequelae of subarachnoid hemorrhage...|$|E

40|$|Increased {{mortality}} from ischaemic {{heart disease}} (IHD) {{has been found}} in previous studies among divorced, widowed, and unskilled middle-aged Finnish men. In this study all cases of IHD in men aged 40 - 64 during 1972 were analysed by linking death certificates and hospital records (7499 cases with 3136 deaths). Age-adjusted incidence, mortality, and survival rates of the first and third year were calculated by marital status and social class. The highest mortality rate was found among unskilled workers, the highest incidence among widowers and those in the lower professional classes, and the lowest survival rate among divorcees, single persons, and unskilled workers. The ratio of mortality by marital status (1. 77) was in part due to <b>survival</b> (<b>ratio</b> 1. 44) and in part due to incidence (ratio 1. 32). The ratio of mortality by social class (1. 44) seemed to be due more to differences in incidence (ratio 1. 36) than to differences in <b>survival</b> (<b>ratio</b> 1. 18). The distribution of conventional risk factors of IHD by marital status and social class seems to explain only part of the mortality differences...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveWe {{report the}} {{long-term}} results of left ventricular surgical restoration in which 2 different strategies were used, which had restoration of ventricular volume or ventricular shape as their target. MethodsFrom 1988 to 2008, 308 patients with anterior scars underwent elective left ventricular surgical restoration. Before 2002, a Dor procedure {{was performed in}} 107 cases to reduce left ventricular volume (group V); from 1998 to 2001, a Guilmet procedure was performed in 32 patients to rebuild a left ventricular conical shape (group S). From 2002, 169 patients (group S) underwent left ventricular surgical restoration to reshape a conical left ventricle {{by means of the}} Dor procedure (n =  29, septoapical scars) or septal reshaping (n =  140, when the septum was more involved than the anterior wall). The 2 groups were similar for all features but age, mitral regurgitation grade, mitral valve surgery rate (higher in group S), and ejection fraction (higher in group V). ResultsEarly mortality was 7. 8 % (11. 2 % in group V vs 6. 0 % in group S, P = . 102). Logistic regression showed that volume reduction was significantly related to higher early mortality. Five-year cardiac survival, cardiac event–free survival, and event-free survival were higher in group S. Cox analysis showed that the choice of volume reduction provided lower <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio,</b> 2. 1), cardiac <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio,</b> 3. 0), cardiac event–free <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio,</b> 2. 7), and event-free <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio,</b> 2. 2). When 30 -day events were excluded, volume reduction was still a risk factor for cardiac event–free <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio,</b> 2. 2).

40|$|Published {{survival}} {{curves of}} Listeria monocytogenes under several constant {{temperatures in the}} range of 50 – 65 °C could be described by the model Log 10 [S(t) ]=−b(T) tn(T), where S(t) is the momentary <b>survival</b> <b>ratio,</b> and b(T) and n(T) coefficients whose temperature dependence was expressed by empirical models. When the temperature history T(t) is also expressed algebraically, b(T) and n(T) are transformed into time dependent terms, b[T(t) ] and n[T(t) ] respectively. If there is no growth and damage repair during the heating process, and the momentary inactivation rate only depends on the momentary temperature and <b>survival</b> <b>ratio,</b> then the solution of the differential equation dLog 10 [S(t) ]/dt=−b[T(t) ]*n[T(t) ]*{−Log 10 [S(t) ]/b[T(t) ]}∧{(n[T(t) ]− 1) /n[T(t) ]} provides the survival curve under the specified non-isothermal conditions. The validity of this model is demonstrated by the agreement of its predictions, calculated numerically using Mathematica®, to reported survival data of Listeria during heating at a constant and varying rates.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{mechanisms}} by which andrographolide inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, we employed the gastric cell line SGC 7901 to investigate the anticancer effects of andrographolide. The cell <b>survival</b> <b>ratio,</b> cell migration and invasion, cell cycle, apoptosis, and matrix metalloproteinase activity were assessed. Moreover, western blotting and real-time PCR were {{used to examine the}} protein expression levels and the mRNA expression levels, respectively. The <b>survival</b> <b>ratio</b> of cells decreased with an increasing concentration of andrographolide in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent results were also obtained using an apoptosis assay, as detected by flow cytometry. The cell cycle was blocked at the G 2 /M 2 phase by andrographolide treatment, and the proportion of cells arrested at G 1 /M was enhanced as the dose increased. Similarly, wound healing and Transwell assays showed reduced migration and invasion of the gastric cancer cells at various concentrations of andrographolide. Andrographolide can inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, block the cell cycle, and promote apoptosis in SGC 7901 cells.

40|$|Binding of {{platelet}} receptor glycoprotein Iba (GPIba) to the A 1 {{domain of}} von Willebrand factor (vWF) {{is a critical}} step in both physiologic hemostasis and pathologic thrombosis, for initiating platelet adhesion to subendothelium of blood vessels at sites of vascular injury. Gain-of-function mutations in GPIba contribute to an abnormally high-affinity binding of platelets to vWF {{and can lead to}} thrombosis, an accurate complication causing heart attack and stroke. Of various antithrombotic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting human GPIba, 6 B 4 is a potent one to inhibit the interaction between GPIba and vWF-A 1 under static and flow conditions. Mapping paratope to epitope with mutagenesis experiments, a traditional route in researches of these antithrombotic mAbs, is usually expensive and time-consuming. Here, we suggested a novel computational procedure, which combines with homology modeling, rigid body docking, free and steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to identify key paratope residues on 6 B 4 and their partners on GPIba, with hypothesis that the stable hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are the important linkers between paratope and epitope residues. Based on a best constructed model of 6 B 4 bound with GPIba, the <b>survival</b> <b>ratios</b> and rupture times of all detected hydrogen bonds and salt bridges in binding site were examined via free and steered MD simulations and regarded as indices of thermal and mechanical stabilizations of the bonds, respectively.

40|$|Survival of {{microorganisms}} in aerobiological samples is often assessed by a <b>survival</b> <b>ratio</b> (SR), {{which is the}} ratio between the viable or metabolic active number (MA) {{of microorganisms}} to the total number (TOT) of microorganisms. A method to determine survival ratios with flow cytometry was developed for Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia. F. tularensis is a fastidious bacteria that can be transmitted by aerosol and constitute as such a valid model organism for aerobiological studies. The total number of F. tularensis cells was determined by specific targeting with monoclonal antibodies and detected by phycoerytrine (PE) conjugated secondary antibodies. The metabolic active part of the targeted F. tularensis cells was quantified by staining with rhodamine 123 (Rh 123).

40|$|By {{representing}} damage induction by ionizing {{particles and}} its repair by the cell, the probabilistic two-stage model provides {{a detailed description}} of the main processes involved in cell killing by radiation. To link this model with issues of interest in hadron radiotherapy, a simple physical model is used. Energy loss, its straggling, and the attenuation of the primary particle fluence are represented in a simplified way, based on semi-phenomenological formulas and energy-loss tables. An effective version of the radiobiological model is joined with the simple physical model to estimate cell survival along ions' penetration depth. The predicted <b>survival</b> <b>ratios</b> for CHO cells irradiated by carbon ions are presented, showing very good agreement with experimental data.

40|$|Background and objectives: Home {{dialysis}} {{is often}} {{recognized as a}} first-choice therapy for patients initiating dialysis. However, studies comparing clinical outcomes between peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis have been very limited. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: This Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplantation Registry study assessed all Australian and New Zealand adult patients receiving home dialysis on day 90 after initiation of RRT between 2000 and 2012. The primary outcome was overall survival. The secondary outcomes were on-treatment survival, patient and technique survival, and death-censored technique survival. All results were adjusted with three prespecified models: multivariable Cox proportional hazards model (main model), propensity score quintile–stratified model, and propensity score–matched model. Results: The study included 10, 710 patients on incident peritoneal dialysis and 706 patients on incident home hemodialysis. Treatment with home hemodialysis was associated with better patient survival than treatment with peritoneal dialysis (5 -year survival: 85 % versus 44 %, respectively; log-rank P< 0. 001). Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis, home hemodialysis was associated with superior patient <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio</b> for overall death, 0. 47; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 38 to 0. 59) as well as better on-treatment <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio</b> for on-treatment death, 0. 34; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 26 to 0. 45), composite patient and technique <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio</b> for death or technique failure, 0. 34; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 29 to 0. 40), and death-censored technique <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio</b> for technique failure, 0. 34; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 28 to 0. 41). Similar results were obtained with the propensity score models as well as sensitivity analyses using competing risks models and different definitions for technique failure and lag period after modality switch, during which events were attributed to the initial modality. Conclusions: Home hemodialysis was associated with superior patient and technique survival compared with peritoneal dialysis. Annie-Claire Nadeau-Fredette, Carmel M. Hawley, Elaine M.

40|$|Tat-interacting protein 30 (TIP 30) is a tumor {{suppressor}} {{protein that}} {{has been found to}} be expressed in a wide variety of tumor tissues. TIP 30 is involved in the control of cell apoptosis, growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, DNA repair, and tumor cell metabolism. The methylation of the TIP 30 promoter is also associated with tumor prognosis. To evaluate this topic further, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis to explore the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of TIP 30 for tumor patients. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for eligible studies. We manually searched for printed journals and relevant textbooks. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the region, manuscript quality, methods of vasculogenic mimicry identification, pathology, and number of patients. Fourteen studies with 1705 patients were included in this meta-analysis. A significant association was observed between high expression of TIP 30 in patients with cancer with a good overall <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio</b> = 0. 53, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 41 - 0. 69), and good recurrence-free survival or disease free <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio</b> = 0. 49, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 37 - 0. 66). Lack of expression of TIP 30 had an association with lymph node metastasis (odds ratio = 3. 90, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 21 - 6. 89) and high tumor node metastasis clinical stage (odds ratio = 2. 10, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 68 - 2. 62). The methylation of the TIP 30 promoter did not significantly influence the overall <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio</b> = 0. 99, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 88 - 1. 13) or disease free <b>survival</b> (hazard <b>ratio</b> = 0. 62, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 19 - 2. 02). TIP 30 expression is associated with a good prognosis in patients with tumors. Clinical studies with large samples are needed worldwide and standardized protocols should be adopted in the future to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between tumor prognosis and TIP 30...|$|R
