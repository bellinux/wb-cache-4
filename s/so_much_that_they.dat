Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E

Tank Girl was filmed primarily in White Sands, New Mexico, and Tucson, Arizona. The film's critically praised soundtrack was assembled by Courtney Love, and the Rippers' makeup and prosthetics team was headed by Stan Winston.

In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885.|$|E

5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; {{he did not like}} the idea of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to attract more attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E
5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} March 1958 {{to enlarge the}} village to house a {{population}} of 15,000 and the basics were completed {{by the time that}} the French granted independence on 28 November 1960. Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième Quartier (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.|$|E

The film had a similar reception both at OutFest a week later, and at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.

Later the film was released in several other countries and shown at numerous gay film festivals, namely in Barcelona and Madrid (where {{it was also a}} popular pick) and Mexico City. Since its initial release it had received nine best film awards, as Cox mentioned in 2005 on a featurette included on the UK DVD.|$|E
5|$|Urse {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for extortion and financial exactions. During the reign of William II, he was considered {{second only to the}} king's minister Ranulf Flambard in his rapacity. The first mention of his exactions is in Hemming's Cartulary. Further details were given by the medieval chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Gerald of Wales, both of whom relate Ealdred's curse. His exactions were also mentioned in Domesday Book, where an entry in the survey for Gloucestershire noted that his oppression prevented the inhabitants of Sodbury <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unable to pay their customary rents. He intimidated the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter into granting him a lease of two of their estates, Greenhill and Eastbury. Urse was one of a new breed of royal official, one who was not opposed to royal power but rather welcomed it, as it helped his own position.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{attracted}} the attention of Bartholomew Iscanus, Bishop of Exeter, who made him archdeacon at Totnes in about 1161, after Baldwin's father's death. Baldwin was known as a canon lawyer during his holding of Totnes. He received a letter from John of Salisbury in 1167, complaining about Bartholomew's conduct during the Becket controversy. John accused Bartholomew of not properly supporting Thomas Becket the Archbishop of Canterbury in his dispute with the king, urging Baldwin to influence the bishop to increase his support, and not to sign any appeal by the English bishops against Becket. Other letters from John dealt with rumours concerning Roger, the Bishop of Worcester, who John had heard was speaking badly of Becket. John's purpose seems to have been to have Baldwin pass along a warning from Becket to Roger about his behaviour; John was a supporter of Becket's during the latter's exile. In 1169 Baldwin was once again peripherally involved in the Becket dispute, when he objected to Becket's excommunication of a number of noblemen and clergy for opposing Becket's cause. Baldwin's objection was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were excommunicated, but that no warning had been given that such an action was contemplated.|$|E
