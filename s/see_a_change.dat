25|$|After the {{independence}} of many Latin American countries, there was conflict between {{the people and the}} government, much of which can be reduced to the contrasting ideologies between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatism was the dominant system of government prior to the revolutions and it was founded on having social classes, including governing by kings. Liberalists wanted to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in the ruling systems, and to move away from monarchs and social classes in order to promote equality.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognisable}} aspects of My Bloody Valentine's music is Shields' guitar sound, which [...] "use texture more than technique to create vivid soundscapes." [...] During the late 1980s, Shields began customising the tremolo systems for his Fender Jaguars and Jazzmasters; extending the tremolo arm and loosening it considerably, {{to allow him to}} manipulate the arm while strumming chords, which resulted in excessive pitch bending. Shields used a number of alternate and open tunings that together with his tremolo manipulation achieved [...] "a strange warping effect that makes the music wander in and out of focus", according to Rolling Stone. Shields' most notable effect is reverse digital reverb, sourced from a Yamaha SPX90 effects unit. Together with the tremolo manipulation and distortion, he created a technique known as [...] "glide guitar". Shields effects rig, which is composed largely of distortion, graphic equalizers and tone controls, consists of at least 30 effects pedals and is connected to a large amount of amplifiers, which are often set to maximum volume to increase sustain. During live performances, and in particular the closing song [...] "You Made Me Realise", My Bloody Valentine perform an interlude of noise and excessive feedback, known as [...] "the holocaust", which would last for half an hour and often reached 130db. Shields later remarked [...] "it was so loud it was like sensory deprivation. We just liked the fact that we could <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in the audience at a certain point." ...|$|E

According to Micronesia's U.N. deputy ambassador, the country has since sought close bilateral relations with Israel in areas such as agriculture, technical training and health care training.

2500|$|In January 2010, several {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that The Jay Leno Show would be shortened to 30 minutes and begin airing weeknights at 11:35 pm ET, with Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon's shows following it beginning at 12:05 am. The scheduling change {{would have been}} implemented on February 28 after the 2010 Winter Olympics (which preempted much of NBC's primetime and late-night lineup).

2500|$|Birdman {{director}} Alejandro G. Iñárritu originally {{conceived the}} film as a comedy filmed in a single shot set in a theatre. The original choice behind the film's genre, which was subsequently re-adapted to concentrate on Riggan's final emotional tail spin, came from the director wanting to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in his approach. All his previous films were dramas, and after directing Biutiful, {{he did not want}} to approach his new film in the same tragic manner again. The decision to make the film appear as a single shot came from his realization that [...] "we live our lives with no editing." [...] By presenting {{the film as}} a continuous shot he could [...] "submerge the protagonist in an 'inescapable reality' and take the audience with him". Iñárritu shared his idea with the Argentine screenwriters/cousins Nicolás Giacobone and Armando Bo, as well as playwright Alexander Dinelaris Jr., who had all worked with him on his previous film. Their first reaction was to tell him the continuous-shot idea could not work. According to Dinelaris and Giacobone, [...] "huge" [...] and [...] "important" [...] people told him to not even try the project for the same reason. Iñárritu himself described the technique as [...] "almost suicidal", worrying that it would be distracting instead of immersive. Dinelaris later said that had they truly paused and considered the idea, they might have talked Iñárritu out of it.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1999 autobiography, I Ain't Got Time to Bleed, Ventura {{suggested}} {{he did not}} plan on running for President of the United States but did not rule out such an idea.

[...] In 2011, Ventura expressed interest in running with Ron Paul for the 2012 presidential elections if the latter decided to run as an independent. On November 4, 2011, Ventura said at a press conference about the dismissal of his court case against the Transportation Security Administration for what he claims are illegal searches of air travelers, that he was [...] "thinking about" [...] running for president. There had been reports that officials from the Libertarian Party have tried to persuade Ventura to run for the presidency on a Libertarian ticket although the party chairman Mark Hinkle said, [...] "Jesse is more interested in 2016 than he is in 2012. But I think he's serious. If Ron Paul ran as a Libertarian, I think he definitely would be interested in running as a vice presidential candidate. He's thinking, ‘If I run as the vice presidential candidate under Ron Paul in 2012, I could run as a presidential candidate in 2016." ...|$|E
