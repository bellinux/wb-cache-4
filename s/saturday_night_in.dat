5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E

25|$|The Socialist Party of Washington did {{not limit}} itself to dry group {{meetings}} and polemicizing {{in the party}} press. Special events such as May Day were the cause for mass meetings with a parade of energetic speakers who stirred the juices of the crowd. Dances were sponsored regularly on <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> Seattle, at which young Socialists could socialize, and the {{effort was made to}} put together a Socialist orchestra and a Socialist choir.

25|$|The Cougars {{opened their}} MVC {{schedule}} on a <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> Chicago at #17 Loyola {{in a battle}} of the top two defenses in the conference.

SIUE had two near misses at tying the score, including a Jambga shot off the post, but Loyola remained the only unbeaten, untied team in Division I.|$|E

25|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} and certainly most popular night of Selichot in the Ashkenazi tradition is the first night, when many women and girls as well as men and boys attend the late-night service on <b>Saturday</b> <b>night.</b> <b>In</b> some communities, the hazzan wears a kittel and sings elaborate melodies. In some congregations, {{it is not unusual for}} a choir to participate in this first night's service. In the Eastern Ashkenazic tradition, this night also has more Selichot than any other night prior to Rosh Hashanah eve. The other nights are more sparsely attended and those services are often led by a layperson, rather than a trained musician, and with melodies that are less elaborate than the first night.|$|E
25|$|On November 16, Glacier, Kanyon, and Wrath reunited for {{the first}} and only time since the demise of Blood Runs Cold, when Glacier and Kanyon were {{scheduled}} to face each other on Nitro after Wrath fought Raven in the previous match, but Raven's refusal to wrestle, despite goading by Kanyon, saw it called off. Wrath then took out his frustration by pummeling both Glacier and Kanyon inside the ring before their opening bell, but the match commenced nonetheless with Kanyon ultimately scoring the pin. Glacier made his final WCW pay-per-view appearance with a loss to Wrath at World War 3 on November 22, and closed out the year with another series of matches against Saturn on Thunder and <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night,</b> <b>in</b> which Miller's manager, Sonny Onoo, repeatedly interfered.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} only one game {{televised}} each <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> any particular locality and up to 1968, regular season games were still not broadcast in their entirety. In the 1950s, the HNIC telecast followed the lead of the radio broadcast by coming on the air at 9 p.m. ET, with the game typically being joined in progress either just {{prior to the start of}} or during the early portion of the second period. In the early 1960s, the broadcast time was moved ahead to 8:30p.m. ET, which allowed the game to be joined in progress late in the first period. Starting in the fall of 1968, regular-season games were shown in their entirety with a broadcast start time of 8 p.m. ET. Beginning with the 1966–67 NHL season, all games broadcast on HNIC were in colour.|$|E

I’d like to get Eric Johnson involved in this project. They’re guys that I’ve known for years, and great guitar players, but I’d like to put them in another environment, in a situation that they’ve never been in before. And I’d like to get some sax players—jazz players and other kinds. And I’ll definitely use Shankar Mahadevan, the amazing vocalist who appears on Remember Shakti’s <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>in</b> Bombay. I’ve been thinking about this underground thing for three years but I just haven’t had time to do it. I’m dying to get it out. It’s like giving birth." ...|$|E
500|$|Jack {{spent much}} of his youth in Youngstown. He {{observed}} in his autobiography that his experiences there molded his sensibilities. Warner wrote: [...] "J. Edgar Hoover told me that Youngstown in those days was one of the toughest cities in America, and a gathering place for Sicilian thugs active in the Mafia. There was a murder or two almost every <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> our neighborhood, and knives and brass knuckles were standard equipment for the young hotheads on the prowl." [...] Warner claimed that he briefly belonged to a street gang based at Westlake's Crossing, a notorious neighborhood located just west of the city's downtown area. Meanwhile, he received his first taste of show business in the burgeoning steel town, singing at local theaters and forming a brief business partnership with another aspiring [...] "song-and-dance man". During his brief career in vaudeville, he officially changed his name to Jack Leonard Warner. Jack's older brother Sam disapproved of these youthful pursuits. [...] "Get out front where they pay the actors," [...] Sam Warner advised Jack. [...] "That's where the money is." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott Matthewman, {{writing for}} The Stage, gave a mixed {{review of the}} episode. He thought that [...] "pretty much the only {{surprise}} {{in the way the}} humans who made up the Ood Corporation were presented came as PR girl Solana (Ayesha Dharker) escaped with the Doctor and Donna, only to betray their position by calling for the guards," [...] and [...] "the revelation that Ryder (Adrian Rawlins) has been working to infiltrate the Corporation is thrown away... as quickly as it is revealed." [...] However, he thought Donna was becoming [...] "fast... one of the strongest and most well-rounded companions in the series’ history", and [...] "there were some nice interpretations of the Ood’s natural development". Caitlin Moran of The Times thought the episode was [...] "really really good... – one that will have you staring at your screen and asking, once again, 'How can something so good be happening so early on a <b>Saturday</b> <b>night,</b> <b>in</b> my own front room?'". She enjoyed the scene where the Doctor and Donna talk about slaves in contemporary culture, saying that Tate [...] "really, really isn’t that bad when she says [...] ". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five. Rawson-Jones opened his review by saying [...] "Doctor Who can occasionally transcend the properties of a mere family television show to reach out and give viewers a poignant, beautiful epiphany and greater sense of the world they inhabit," [...] citing Donna's reaction on seeing the uncultivated Ood as the moving part of the episode.|$|E
