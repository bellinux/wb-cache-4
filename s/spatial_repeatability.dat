40|$|Statistical <b>spatial</b> <b>repeatability</b> (SSR) is an {{extension}} to the well known concept of <b>spatial</b> <b>repeatability.</b> SSR states that the mean of many patterns of dynamic tyre force applied to a pavement surface is similar for a fleet of trucks of a given type. A model which can accurately predict patterns of SSR could subsequently be used in whole-life pavement deterioration models {{as a means of}} describing pavement loading due to a fleet of vehicles. This paper presents a method for predicting patterns of SSR, {{through the use of a}} truck fleet model inferred from measurements of dynamic tyre forces. A Bayesian statistical inference algorithm is used to determine the distributions of multiple parameters of a fleet of quarter-car heavy vehicle ride models, based on prior assumed distributions and the set of observed dynamic tyre force from a `true? fleet of 100 simulated models. Simulated forces are noted at 16 equidistant pavement locations, similar to data from a multiple sensor weigh-in-motion site. It is shown that the fitted model provides excellent agreement in the mean pattern of dynamic force with the originally generated truck fleet. It is shown that good predictions are possible for patterns of SSR on a given section of road for a fleet of similar vehicles...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} {{reported}} low repeatability of BOLD activation measures during emotion processing tasks. It is not clear, however, whether low repeatability {{is a result of}} changes in the underlying neural signal over time, or due to insufficient reliability of the acquired BOLD signal caused by noise contamination. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of “cleaning” the BOLD signal, by correcting for physiological noise and for differences in BOLD responsiveness, on measures of repeatability. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned on two different occasions, performing an emotion provocation task with faces (neutral, 50 % fearful, 100 % fearful) followed by a breath-hold paradigm to provide a marker of BOLD responsiveness. Repeatability of signal distribution (<b>spatial</b> <b>repeatability)</b> and repeatability of signal amplitude within two regions of interest (amygdala and fusiform gyrus) were estimated by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Significant repeatability of signal amplitude was only found within the right amygdala during the perception of 50 % fearful faces, but disappeared when physiological noise correction was performed. <b>Spatial</b> <b>repeatability</b> was higher within the fusiform gyrus than within the amygdala, and better at the group level than at the participant level. Neither physiological noise correction, nor consideration of BOLD responsiveness, assessed through the breath-holding, increased repeatability. The findings lead to the conclusion that low repeatability of BOLD response amplitude to emotional faces is more likely to be explained by the lack of stability in the underlying neural signal than by physiological noise contamination. Furthermore, reported repeatability might be a result of repeatability of task-correlated physiological variation rather than neural activity. This means that the emotion paradigm used in this study might not be useful for studies that require the BOLD response to be a stable measure of emotional processing, for example in the context of biomarkers...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanistic}} {{empirical method}} of flexible pavement design/assessment uses {{a large number}} of numerical truck model runs to predict a history of dynamic load. The pattern of dynamic load distribution along the pavement is a key factor in the design/ assessment of flexible pavement. While this can be measured in particular cases, there are no reliable methods of predicting the mean pattern for typical traffic conditions. A simple linear quarter car model is developed here which aims to reproduce the mean and variance of dynamic loading of the truck fleet at a given site. This probabilistic model reflects the range and frequency of the different heavy trucks on the road and their dynamic properties. Multiple Sensor Weigh-in-Motion data can be used to calibrate the model. Truck properties such as suspension stiffness, suspension damping, sprung mass, unsprung mass and tyre stiffness are represented as randomly varying parameters in the fleet model. It is used to predict the statistical distribution of dynamic load at each measurement point. The concept is demonstrated by using a pre-defined truck fleet to calculate a pattern of statistical <b>spatial</b> <b>repeatability</b> and is tested by using that pattern to find the truck statistical properties that generated it...|$|E
40|$|Multipath {{hemispherical}} map (MHM) {{is a kind}} of multipath mitigation {{approach that}} takes advantage of the <b>spatial</b> <b>repeatability</b> of the multipath effect under an unchanged environment. This approach is not only suitable for static environments, but also for some kinematic platforms, such as a moving ship and airplane, where the dominant multipath effects come from the platform itself and the multipath effects from the surrounding environment are considered minor or negligible. Previous studies have verified the feasibility of the MHM approach in static environments. In this study, we expanded the MHM approach to a kinematic shipborne environment. Both static and kinematic tests were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the MHM approach. The results indicate that, after MHM multipath mitigation, the root mean square (RMS) of baseline length deviations are reduced by 10. 47 % and 10. 57 %, and the RMS of residual values are reduced by 39. 89 % and 21. 91 % for the static and kinematic tests, respectively. Power spectrum analysis has shown that the MHM approach is more effective in mitigating multipath in low-frequency bands; the high-frequency multipath effects still exist, and are indistinguishable from observation noise. Taking the observation noise into account, the residual reductions increase to 41. 68 % and 24. 51 % in static and kinematic tests, respectively. To further improve the performance of MHM for kinematic platforms, we also analyzed the influence of spatial coverage and resolution on residual reduction...|$|E

Up to one half wavelength shifts are possible with active phase compensation. With feedback control, a phase modulator stabilizes the system within the linear range. Calibrated receptivity experiments are performed in a Mach 4 quiet-flow Ludwieg tube. Laser-generated thermal spots are used as repeatable, controlled perturbations to the subsonic region behind the bow shock of both a hemispherical nose and a forward-facing cavity. Thermal spot amplitudes, <b>spatial</b> characteristics, and <b>repeatability</b> are measured. Both on-axis and off axis surveys of the subsonic region indicate damped oscillations with both blunt nose configurations. With the forward-facing cavity, a characteristic frequency based on the cavity geometry is detected. The results from both configurations correlate with nose-mounted and cavity base-mounted pressure transducer measurements, and thus remove frequency ambiguity from the pressure transducer experiments. High speed synchronous schlieren images show the thermal spot evolution and impingement at the hemispherical nose. Additionally, the thermal spot in freestream is modeled based on the experimental measurements. Quantitative comparisons with CFD simulations of these experiments show similar characteristics. CFD agreement is expected to improve with future use of the advanced thermal spot model. ...|$|R

Infrared thermography (IRT) and laser Doppler (LD) have both been reported to be useful in assessing the active, inflammatory stage of LS. We developed and validated a protocol using these techniques for the assessment of unilateral LS activity in children. METHOD: We investigated the <b>spatial</b> variability and <b>repeatability</b> of LD measurements from adult control forearm skin, and the inter- and intra-operator reproducibility of both LD blood flow trace analysis and IRT skin temperature analysis. Software was developed to produce overlay images of thermograms onto digital photographs of skin sites. In a group of seven adult control subjects, we established the normal range for skin temperature and LD blood flow at six standardised sites (forehead, cheek, abdomen, back, arm and leg), and measured contralateral differences in readings. In a group of 34 children with LS, we investigated the skin temperature and LD blood flow in unaffected skin at the same six sites. RESULTS: In adults, physiological variability in LD blood flow and skin temperature between the two sides of the body was found to be greater than the uncertainty introduced into the measurements by (inter alia) limited intra- or inter-operator reproducibility. The cheek displayed the highest mean asymmetry in both skin temperature (0. 5 degrees C) and LD blood flow (40 %).

40|$|Rapid {{changes in}} video {{technology}} have {{allowed for the}} development of sophisticated, efficient methods for surveying fish communities, including systems that use single or stereo video cameras, which are baited or unbaited and used remotely, by divers or on Remote Operated Vehicles. Video methods are non-extractive and their deployment can be standardised. As a result of the <b>spatial</b> and temporal <b>repeatability</b> of video techniques they are often used to monitor the biodiversity, assemblage composition and size structure of marine fishes. Because of the biases and sampling efficiencies of different configurations, consideration is required as to which is the most appropriate design for the objectives of a particular study. Baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs), which record across the seascape, and downward-facing single camera baited underwater video systems (downward-BUVs) were deployed in temperate reef habitats on the west coast of Australia to compare the numbers of species and individuals, the assemblage composition, and the relative abundances and size distributions of focal species recorded by both techniques. Stereo-BRUVs sampled a different assemblage composition of fishes than downward-BUVs, observing significantly more species (84 vs 63) and individuals (7321 vs 4490). In general, stereo-BRUVs sampled a greater range of trophic groups than downward BUVs, including species not directly attracted to the bait (e. g. herbivores). Some carnivores that were recorded on the stereo-BRUVs were rarely, or never observed by downward-BUVs. This is attributed to the increased numbers of fish and species recorded in the broader field of view of the stereo-BRUVs. The power to detect a 20, 50 or 100 % change (at α = 0. 05) in numbers of species and individuals was comparable between methods, but typically greater for stereo-BRUVs for some of the focal species. Length distributions of focal species differed significantly between methods in most cases, with stereo-BRUVs providing accurate and precise measurements, while downward-BUVs often over-estimated lengths. We conclude that forward-facing stereo-BRUVs were superior to downward-facing single camera BUVs in virtually all aspects tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between road surface roughness and heavy vehicles results in dynamic wheel loading (DWL), which increases pavement damage. The magnitude of DWL {{is dependent on}} the level of surface roughness and its characteristics and the properties and speeds of heavy vehicles. The measurement of DWL under normal operating conditions is costly, and the estimation of the resultant pavement damage is difficult because of the great variation in heavy vehicle fleet characteristics operating on the network. Additional damage caused by DWL is reflected in increased pavement deterioration over time. Deterioration is apparent in changes in the surface profile characteristics, which have a determining influence on dynamic loading and the degree of its <b>spatial</b> <b>repeatability.</b> The suitability of a number of profile indices as indicators of dynamically loaded pavement sections was assessed. Several regression models were developed with different profile indices used as predictors of different measures of pavement damage caused by DWL. The international roughness index and heavy articulated truck index were among the indices tested. The magnitudes of the simulated DWL were represented by such measures as dynamic load coefficient and dynamic aggregate force coefficient. This approach could help road authorities identify sections that are subject to high DWL and to take appropriate measures to reduce the impact. The heavy articulated truck index, measured with the dynamic aggregate force coefficient, proved to be the best predictor of pavement damage caused by DWL. rehabilitation treatments to control accelerated wear caused by DWL...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the repeatability of hypoxia PET imaging with [18 F]HX 4 in patients with head and neck and lung cancer. Methods Nine patients with lung cancer and ten with head and neck cancer were included in the analysis (NCT 01075399). Two sequential pretreatment [18 F]HX 4 PET/CT scans were ac-quired within 1 week. The maximal and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) were defined and the tumor-to-background ratios (TBR) were calculated. In addition, hypoxic volumes were determined as the volume of the tumor with a TBR> 1. 2 (HV 1. 2). Bland Altman analysis of the uptake parameters was performed and coefficients of repeatability were calculated. To evaluate the <b>spatial</b> <b>repeatability</b> of the uptake, the PET/CT images were registered and a voxel-wise comparison of the uptake was performed, providing a correla-tion coefficient. Results All parameters of [18 F]HX 4 uptake were significantly correlated between scans: SUVmax (r= 0. 958, p< 0. 001), SUVmean (r= 0. 946, p< 0. 001), TBRmax (r= 0. 962, p< 0. 001) and HV 1. 2 (r= 0. 995, p< 0. 001). The relative coefficients of repeatability were 15 % (SUVmean), 17 % (SUVmax) and 17 % (TBRmax). Voxel-wise analysis of the spatial uptake pattern within the tumors provided an average correlation of 0. 65 ± 0. 14. Conclusion Repeated hypoxia PET scans with [18 F]HX 4 provide reproducible and spatially stable results in patients with head and neck cancer and patients with lung cancer.

However, HCCI operation {{is not possible}} at all conditions due to the inability to control the autoignition process and new understanding is required. A high-swirl low-compression-ratio, optically accessed engine that can produce overall fuel lean, axially stratified charge (richer fuel mixture close to the cylinder head was achieved using port injection against open valve and homogeneous mixture during injection against closed valve timing) was operated in HCCI mode without and with spark-assist mixture ignition. The present study investigates {{the differences in the}} HCCI autoignition process and the propagation of the autoignition front with homogeneous mixture or fuel charge stratification, internal Exhaust Gas Recirculation (iEGR) (introduced by utilizing different camshafts) and spark-assisted iEGR lean combustion. In order to visualize the HCCI process, chemiluminescence flame images, phase-locked to a specific crank angle, were acquired. In addition, time-resolved images of the developing autoignition flame front were captured. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was applied to the acquired images to investigate the temporal and <b>spatial</b> <b>repeatability</b> of the autoignition front and compare these characteristics to the considered scenarios. The eigenvalues of the POD modes provided quantitative measure of the probability of the corresponding flame structures. The first POD mode showed higher probability of single autoignition sites originating from a particular location (depending on the scenario). However, the contribution from other modes cannot be neglected, which signified multiple locations of the single autoignition and also, multiple sites of self-ignition of the fuel-air mixture. It was found that increasing iEGR resulted in random combustion (multiple autoignition sites and fronts), which, however, became significantly non-random due to addition of spark-assisted ignition. It was identified in the POD analysis of the time-resolved flame images that the presence of inhomogeneity either in the temperature or the mixture fraction distribution increases the probability of random combustion during the very early stages of flame development. Thus, the fluctuations of heat release is higher during this period...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{and demonstrates}} {{the application of}} a recently designed mobile streambed temperature measurement system. The apparatus, called the High Resolution Temperature Mapping Device (henceforth HI-RES TMD) was built to increase the resolution of established temperature sampling methods and instantaneously acquire 32 equally distributed temperature measurements within 3 m 2 (0. 3 m grid spacing) at the streambed interface. Sampling is done under wadable flow conditions, and can be completed every 4 - 5 minutes. This allows sampling of any spatial extent such as full morphological units or the reach scale within hours or days respectively. The HI-RES TMD is able to overcome many of the short comings of previous sampling methods such as the range of investigation of a given study, or require the insertion of temperature probes into the substrate which considerably increased sampling time. The HI-RES TMD has been field tested in two mountain streams located along the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, in southeastern British Columbia, Canada to examine temporal repeatability of thermal streambed patterns. A dataset of more than 80, 000 individual streambed temperature measurements was obtained using the HI-RES TMD. A series of analysis were then completed to determine whether the spatial variability of streambed temperature plays a role in the choice of spawning locations for fish. Both rivers are characterized by intense spawning of two salmonid species: cutthroat trout (oncorhynchus clarkia) and bull trout (salvelinus confluentus). This was confirmed during three consecutive seasons of spawning site surveys completed between 2012 and 2014 with the help of expert fisheries biologists at which time the precise locations of all the spawning locations (i. e., redds) within the study areas were surveyed. Analysis of streambed temperature patterns on the morphological features presented correlations between the average thermal distributions and spawning density and <b>repeatability.</b> <b>Spatial</b> autocorrelation analysis was completed to identify hot spots and cold spots within the study areas. It was found that bull trout redd density and repeatability were significantly correlated to the cold spots. As presence of colder areas on the streambed may be related to hyporheic flow or groundwater emergence, recommendations for improvements of the HI-RES TMD present an opportunity to determine if the bull trout redds are also correlated to groundwater emergence...|$|R

In addition, factors influencing grassland bird nesting success have been investigated mostly in small-scale and short-duration studies. To develop management guidelines for grassland birds, we tested the <b>spatial</b> and temporal <b>repeatability</b> of the influence of patch size and landscape composition on density and nesting success of 3 grassland passerines, after controlling for local-scale vegetation structure, climate, and- when analyzing nest successbird density. We conducted our study during 4 years (1998 - 2001) in 44 study plots that were set up in 3 regions of the northern tallgrass prairie in Minnesota and North Dakota, USA. In these study plots we measured density and nesting success of clay-colored sparrows (Spizella pallida), Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolinks (Dolichonyx olyzivorus). Statistical models indicated that density was influenced by patch size, landscape, region, and local vegetation structure more so than by local vegetation structure alone. Both magnitude and direction of the response of density to patch size varied among regions, years, and species. In contrast, the direction of landscape effects was consistent among regions, years, and between Savannah sparrows and bobolinks. In each species, this landscape effect was independent of patch size. Nesting success was not cleariy influenced by patch size or landscape composition, and none of the factors that influenced avian density also influenced nesting success in any of the 3 species. General statements on 2 ̆ 2 optimal habitat 2 ̆ 2 for grassland birds should therefore be viewed cautiously. Instead, long-tern studies in different regions as well as {{a deeper understanding of the}} local system are needed to determine which factors are most important for grassland birds in a particular are...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} new method of 3 D printing. This method is a mix between Fused Deposition Modelling and {{freeform}} printing, using a 6 degree-of-freedom articulated robot and a pellet-based extruder to mix and distribute the biopolymer, to create commercial quality thin-shelled parts with aesthetic aspects unique to the process and with a reduced amount of material wastage. There is the potential for many industries to benefit from this new technology. Initially this project is focused on applications for artists as thin-shelled designs rarely provide the physical properties required for functional parts. An artist has provided a design to test the printer. The hopper is designed to work with a range of different polymer pellets. It is based off a previous student’s design and mimics the operation of an injection moulder by pushing the pellets through a heating chamber with an auger. The robot controlling the movement of the platform is an ABB IRB 120. This robot has six degrees-of-freedom that allows it to reach several positions that would otherwise be impossible with a Cartesian system. The IRB 120 has a very high <b>spatial</b> accuracy and <b>repeatability.</b> The design’s original format is converted to a flattened 2 D format and the lines are interpolated to produce a 2 D set of points. The overlaps in the shapes are removed {{to reduce the number of}} times the nozzle traces over previous paths, which helps to keep the layer thicknesses the same. These shapes are filled in with points so the contours are not empty. The points are then projected onto a mathematical model of the platform to produce a 3 D point cloud. Finally, these points are converted into data for the robot to read. The design data points stream to the robot, which interprets them on the fly. Many iterative changes and improvements were done to the hardware and software as the result of continuous testing of the process and analysis of the print. The pellet-based extruder is an elementary design with numerous variables that affect the resulting extrusion. After many design iterations and improvements to the extruder, the extruder can produce a continuous strand of material, with relatively constant flow. The software accurately converts a design from the given format into a path for the contours, and another path to fill the contours. These paths are projected onto a model of the moulded platform. Each point along the path is put through multiple affine transforms to generate a location and orientation for the end effector of the robot. The robot is moved by streaming each point to the robot one at a time. The extruder was controlled simultaneously to create a printed design. The printed design is geometrically correct. However, the width of the extrusion path needs to be improved to increase the accuracy of the design to the reference one. The current prints achieve the correct visual properties in the extrusion. However, they require a secondary process to improve the surface finish. This project has produced a new 3 D printing process, mixing Fused Deposition Modelling and freeform printing. This process can be adapted to be used in a wide range of applications. It has also produced a low-cost, effective pellet-based extruder that can be used to test a range of different materials, and their effectiveness in being used for 3 D printing...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{mechanistic}} design model that analyzes the structural performance of flexible pavements under moving dynamic loads generated by heavy vehicles. It assumes a {{linear viscoelastic behavior}} of flexible pavements. The model expands the framework formulated by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for the mechanistic design program called VESYS. It applies Boltzman's superposition principle to translate the pavement response from a stationary load to pavement response from a moving load of time-dependent amplitude. Experimental dynamic load data obtained using the instrumented vehicle developed by the National Research Council of Canada (NRCC) are used as input in the model. [...] The variable dynamic responses along the longitudinal axis of the pavement are translated into fatigue cracking and rutting by assuming <b>spatial</b> <b>repeatability</b> of the dynamic loads. The 90 th percentile of the cumulative damage values is assumed to represent the overall damage of pavement section. This damage value is then compared with {{the damage caused by}} moving loads of constant magnitude (static) through a relationship called Pavement Life Ratio (PLR). This is defined as the ratio of the accumulated number of load repetitions to failure due to static load divided by repetitions to failure due to dynamic loads. [...] Furthermore, the model is used to investigate the performance of two suspension types (Air and Rubber) on three types of flexible pavements with different structural strengths. The effects of other vehicle characteristics on pavement damage is also investigated. [...] Results from the analysis show that, moving dynamic loads are more crucial to pavement damage than static loads and the magnitude of the damage is dependent on the suspension type. It was found that, rubber suspension causes greater pavement damage than air suspension and the difference can be as much as 43 %. Moreover pavement surface roughness and vehicle parameters like speed, axle spacing and axle configuration substantially influence the suspension type to increase pavement damage. For multiple axles, unequal load-sharing between the individual axles further increase pavement damage...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is intended to investigate the effects of fuel properties, injection strategy and timing on autoignition and combustion characteristics of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine with a negative valve overlap (NVO) strategy. Conventional (pressure-transducer based) measurements and passive optical research have contributed to understanding of the chemical-physical sites of HCCI autoignition and combustion. This experimental work was undertaken on matching thermal and optical single cylinder research engines in configurations derived from a production Jaguar V 8 engine. A thermal engine study using a range of fuels including conventional gasoline and primary reference fuels has been performed to gain insight into autoignition and combustion characteristics of various chemically dissimilar blends or components. This was done at different operating conditions by varying the engine speed {{and the proportion of}} residuals trapped. These measurements have shown that the autoignition and combustion characteristic of an HCCI operated engine are highly dependent on fuel blend composition and are also affected by engine operating conditions. It was found that the autoignition process type which the mixture undergoes, whether it is one- or two-step, depends very strongly both on fuel blend composition and on engine operating conditions. More specifically the presence and also proportion of particular chemical compounds in a blend could significantly contribute to the alteration of the process type. Similar experiments using the chosen engine operating points were repeated on the optical engine using passive optical diagnostics such as imaging and spectroscopy. Thereby it was possible to gain insight into the chemistry of one-step and two- step ignition processes. The image analysis of the port fuel injected (PFI) HCCI operation have been carried out for stoichiometric and lean conditions. A crank-angle resolved high-speed imaging technique was employed a piston crown window for optical access to the combustion chamber. The <b>spatial</b> <b>repeatability</b> nature of autoignition occurrence and the directions of combustion progress were evaluated using especially developed image processing technique. The insight into the expansion rates of burned areas and of the spreading velocities of reacting structures fronts was also gained by introducing two new image processing techniques. Various direct injection strategies (single and split injection) and timings, including fuel injection prior to and during the negative valve overlap period were optically investigated. The comprehensive study included the application of three diagnostic instruments: the Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) high-speed colour imager, the intensified Charge Couple Device (CCD) and the imaging spectrograph. Among the other observations the applied passive techniques, the imaging and the spectroscopy in conjunction with adequate image processing techniques have shown that the combustion behaviour and also the colour of the burning mixture are dependent on the fuel injection scheme. With the investigated split (double) injection, when some of fuel is injected prior to TDC NVO the combustion behaviour is significantly different than when it is injected during even at TDC (NVO). There is a strong indication that a form of incandescence occurs during the NVO, which probably comes from the glowing soot. This is further supported by a quantification of the emitted luminescence and spectroscopic measurements during this phase...|$|E
