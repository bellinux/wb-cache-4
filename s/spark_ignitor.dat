40|$|Results {{of ongoing}} {{experimental}} studies {{are reported in}} which a 125 -millimeter-diameter-advanced-bearing test rig simulating an engine sump {{is being used to}} find the critical range of conditions for fires to occur. Design, material, and operating concepts and techniques are being studied with the objective of minimizing the problem. It has been found that the vapor temperature near a <b>spark</b> <b>ignitor</b> is most important in determining ignition potential. At temperatures producing oil vapor pressures below or much above the calculated flammability limits, fires have not been ignited. But fires have been routinely started within the theoretical flammability range. This indicates that generalizing the sump-fire problem may make it amenable to analysis, with the potential for realistic solutions...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} detail the {{development}} and testing of a "green" monopropellant booster ignition system. The proposed booster ignition technology {{eliminates the need for}} a pre-heated catalyst bed, a high wattage power source, toxic pyrophoric ignition fluids, or a bi-propellant <b>spark</b> <b>ignitor.</b> The design offers the simplicity of a monopropellant feed system features non-hazardous gaseous oxygen (GOX) as the working fluid. The approach is fundamentally different from all other "green propellant" solutions in the aerospace in the industry. Although the proposed system is more correctly a "hybrid" rocket technology, since only a single propellant feed path is required, it retains all the simple features of a monopropellant system. The technology is based on the principle of seeding an oxidizing flow {{with a small amount of}} hydrocarbon. 1 The ignition is initiated electrostatically with a low-wattage inductive spark. Combustion gas byproducts from the hydrocarbon-seeding ignition process can exceed 2400 C and the high exhaust temperature ensures reliable main propellant ignition. The system design is described in detail in the Hydrocarbon-Seeded Ignition System Design subsection...|$|E
40|$|The Augmented <b>Spark</b> <b>Ignitor</b> (ASI) is a LOX/H 2 /electrical spark {{system that}} {{functions}} as an ignition source and sustainer for stable combustion. It {{is used in}} the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) preburner combustor, the SMME main combustion chamber, the J- 1 and J- 2 engines, as well as proposed designs of the Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) main combustor and gas generators. An undertaking to characterize the flow of the ASI is documented. The code consists of a marriage of the Implicit-Continuous Eulerian/Arbitrary Lagrangian Code (ICE-ALE) Navier-Stokes solver with the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) Methodology for tracking of two immiscible fluids with sharp discontinuities. Spray droplets are represented by discrete numerical parcels tracked in a Lagrangian fashion. Numerous physical sub-models are also incorporated to describe the processes of atomization, droplet collision, droplet breakup, evaporation, and droplet and gas phase turbulence. An equilibrium chemistry model accounting for 8 active gaseous species is also used. Taking advantage of this symmetry plane, half of the actual ASI is modeled with a 3 -D grid that geometrically resolves the LOX ports, the spark plug locations, and the hydrogen injection slots...|$|E

40|$|The {{operating}} {{characteristics of the}} semiconductor <b>spark</b> gap <b>ignitor</b> plug used to initiate the discharge in a pulsed plasma thruster are investigated. Current and voltage waveform measurements for the ignitor plug alone, and for the plug mounted in the thruster cathode indicate an average dynamic impedance of 0. 2 ohms {{for a wide range}} of operating conditions, and a trigger circuit energy transfer efficiency to the plug on the order of 25 %. Two modes of trigger ignition are found which are related to the rise time of the applied voltage pulse. Analysis of plasma characteristics reveals plug erosion to occur primarily in the semiconductor and anode regions, by mechanisms including plug metal embrittlement, plasma sputtering and vaporization caused by the discharge current pulse. Measurements also indicate a plume velocity on the order of 1580, 000 cm/sec which increases with trigger circuit stored energy. The results establish levels of performance for future applications of semiconductor <b>spark</b> gap <b>ignitor</b> plugs in plasma devices...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results from a new {{diagnostic}} tool for investigating the efiects of ignition on the discharge symmetry in gas-fed pulsed plasma thrusters (GF-PPTs). Using a fast-framing camera, up to 16 indi-vidual pictures of a single GFPPT discharge can be captured at frequencies as high as 20 MHz. This high framing rate capability allows the discharge initiation and current sheet formation to be visualized with a large degree of temporal resolution. Varying the frame rate, number and size of pictures per discharge, {{as well as the}} trigger delay sent to the camera al-lowed multiple discharges at difierent stages to be vi-sualized. Various conflgurations of GFPPT electrode geometry and discharge ignition systems were pho-tographed in operation. It is shown that the large sur-face °ash-over ignitors used in early GFPPT designs are unreliable in providing a constant, symmetric dis-charge initiation. Smaller semi-conductor <b>spark</b> gap <b>ignitors</b> used in later GFPPT designs have demon-⁄Research supported by the Air Force O–ce of Scientiflc Re...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} changes in the input {{parameters}} (air leakage flow rate and temperature and lubricating oil inlet flow rate and temperature) over a specified range on the flammability conditions within an aircraft engine bearing sump was investigated. An analytical study was performed to determine the effect of various parameters on the generation rate of oil vapor from oil droplets in a hot air stream flowing in a cylindrical tube. The ignition of the vapor-air mixture by an ignition source was considered. The experimental investigation demonstrated that fires would be ignited by a <b>spark</b> <b>ignitor</b> over the full range of air and oil flow rates and air temperatures evaluated. However, no fires could be ignited when the oil inlet temperature was maintained below 41. 7 K (290 F). The severity of the fires ignited were found to be directly proportional to the hot air flow rate. Reasonably good correlation was found between the mixture temperature in the sump at the ignitor location and the flammability limits as defined by flammability theory; thus a fairly reliable experimental method of determining flammable conditions within a sump was demonstrated. The computerized mathematical model shows that oil droplet size and air temperature have the greatest influence on the generation rate of oil vapor...|$|E
50|$|Some magnetos have {{a second}} coil of wire located next to the first, called a {{secondary}} coil. This coil is usually much longer than the primary loop, accomplished by many more loops around the magnetic core. As the magnetic field is built, it induces a current in the secondary coil as well. When the contact breaker opens the circuit, the magnetic field collapses, causing a high electric voltage in the primary and secondary coils. However, due to the greater number of turns of the secondary coil, the voltage is much higher, causing a larger <b>spark</b> at the <b>ignitor</b> or <b>spark</b> plug, meaning more assured ignition.|$|R
