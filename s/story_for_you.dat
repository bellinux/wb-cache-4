500|$|War for Cybertron was {{announced}} December 16, 2009, {{and was released}} in North America on June 22, 2010 with the PAL region release following on June 25, 2010. It is powered by Unreal Engine 3. [...] Physics for the game are handled using the Havok physics library. A demo was released on June 10, 2010 which allowed for players to play various multiplayer matches using two of the game's character classes. [...] Developer High Moon Studios designed the friendly AI so that as a player progresses through the story any accompanying characters will help the player, but still require the player to advance through the game. [...] "The buddies don't advance the <b>story</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> [...] They {{get to the point}} to kinda show you where to go, but then they'll take up defensive positions and wait for you to progress the story" [...] said Game Director Matt Tieger. [...] "They're not finishing objectives for you, but they like to stay near you, they'll heal you if you get too wounded, they're pretty smart." ...|$|E

I will preface his story by reading the report of Colonel Wilberforce, commanding at Coimbra, {{of the state of}} efficiency of his command." ...|$|E

Notwithstanding that, they neither of them appeared again. I sat there, believe me, with my eyes fastened upon that path, and when the train started I leaned out of the window until we had rounded the curve and we were out of sight, but I never saw either of those two men again.

[...] "I presume I may as well tell you my <b>story,</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> are bound to hear it sooner or later," [...] he went on. [...] "About four years ago my father went out hunting in the forest {{to the north of}} our plantation. He was out with two friends, but about {{the middle of the day}} the party {{separated}} and my father found himself alone. Then he saw something that to him looked like a wildcat on a big rock. He fired quickly, and when he drew closer he saw to his horror that he had shot and killed a man--an old hunter named Blazen.|$|E

He hardly spoke a word all the way,--only led me about, and poked me {{in and out of}} the carriage, as if I was blind already; it put me almost in a rage. Then as soon as we came home,--about half an hour ago, I should think,--he told it all {{straight}} out to my mother, did not mince matters, I assure you: indeed, I believe they both forgot I was there. They are apt to forget me, you know. He regularly stormed about the neglect, and told her it was all her fault; and while this was going on, I found I had heard the worst, and I did not want to be pitied, so I came out here. And so there is the whole <b>story</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> Marian, and a pretty one it is! A fine sort of life I shall have instead--" ...|$|E

He was so beastly {{familiar}} that I took out my glass, and I got him into a cafe for fear some one would see me with him. 'My dear fellow,' said he, 'you did me the turn of my life.--How can I ever repay you?' 'Hang your impudence,' said I, but I wanted to hear what he had to say. 'Don't lose your temper, old chap,' he laughed; 'you took a few liberties with my name, and there was no good reason why I shouldn't take some with yours. Was there? When I think of it, the thing was most decidedly convenient; it was the hand of Providence.' 'You took liberties with my name,' I cried. With that he coolly called to the waiter to fill our glasses. 'Now,' said he, 'I've got a <b>story</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Do you remember the cotillon, or whatever it was, that Cooke gave? Well, that was all in the Chicago papers, and the [...] "Miles Standish" [...] agent there saw it, and he knew pretty well that I wasn't West. So he sent me the papers, just for fun. You may imagine my surprise when I read that I had been leading a dance out at Mohair, or some such barbarous place in the northwest. I looked it up on the map (Asquith, I mean), and then I began to think. I wondered who in the devil it might be who had taken my name and occupation, and all that. You see, I had just relieved the company of a little money, and it hit me like a clap of thunder one day that the idiot was you. But I couldn't be sure. And as long as I had to get out very soon anyway, I concluded to go to Mohair and make certain, and then pile things off on you if you happened to be the man.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Lieve Verbeeck, a {{linguist}} studying Mayan language, {{witnessed the}} modern {{version of the}} game being played by Mopan and Kekchi Maya in Belize:But neither can I give you hard evidence that the corn game, {{as it is now}} still played by the Mopan and K'ekchi' Mayans, (who are neighbours), was known in the ancient times. There is linguistic evidence that the ancient Mayans used to play games of chance. The name of BUL occurs in several Mayan languages and always means to play with dice. Sometimes, by extension, it means [...] "to lose with gambling". There is archaeological evidence that the Mayans knew the square- and oval-shaped patolli boards. There are many sites throughout the Maya area where archaeologists found patterns of patolli boards carved in floors or benches. Unfortunately there are no BUL boards found (yet??) ... Anyway I don't have any thrilling <b>stories</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> about famous BUL contests in the ancient times. Only three Maya manuscripts were safeguarded from the Spanish conquerors. Up till now no reference to Maya board games was found. Of course there are a few pictures displaying priests throwing corn or seeds for divination ... Culin's version of BUL is quite accurate. I observed the game being played by 10 men. They placed 25 grains of corns in a row. The game lasted for 3 hours, because they played 5 variants.|$|R
