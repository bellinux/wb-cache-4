6000|$|Towards the {{beginning}} of this century, in the vigorous times of the old French wars, there was a Monsieur Appert, who had his attention directed to the preservation of things that ordinarily perish, such as meats and vegetables, and in fact he laid the foundation of our modern method of preserving meats; and he found that if he boiled any of these substances and then tied them so as to exclude the air, that they would be preserved for any time. He tried these experiments, particularly with the must of wine and with the wort of beer; and he found that if the wort of beer had been carefully boiled and was stopped {{in such a way that}} the air could not get at it, it would never ferment. What was the reason of this? That, again, became the subject of a long string of experiments, with this ultimate result, that if you take precautions to prevent any solid matters from getting into the must of wine or the wort of beer, under these circumstances--that is to say, if the fluid has been boiled and placed in a bottle, and if you stuff the neck of the bottle full of cotton wool, which allows the air to go through and stops anything of a <b>solid</b> <b>character</b> however fine, then you may let it be for ten years and it will not ferment. But if you take that plug out and give the air free access, then, sooner or later fermentation will set up. And there is no doubt whatever that fermentation is excited only by the presence of some torula or other, and that that torula proceeds in our present experience, from pre-existing torulae. These little bodies are excessively light. You can easily imagine what must be the weight of little particles, but slightly heavier than water, and not more than the two-thousandth or perhaps seven-thousandth of an inch in diameter. They are capable of floating about and dancing like motes in the sunbeam; they are carried about by all sorts of currents of air; the great majority of them perish; but one or two, which may chance to enter into a sugary solution, immediately enter into active life, find there the conditions of their nourishment, increase and multiply, and may give rise to any quantity whatever of this substance yeast. And, whatever may be true or not be true about this [...] "spontaneous generation," [...] as it is called in regard to all other kinds of living things, it is perfectly certain, as regards yeast, that it always owes its origin to this process of transportation or inoculation, if you like so to call it, from some other living yeast organism; and so far as yeast is concerned, the doctrine of spontaneous generation is absolutely out of court. And not only so, but the yeast must be alive in order to exert these peculiar properties. If it be crushed, if it be heated so far that its life is destroyed, that peculiar power of fermentation is not excited. Thus we have come to this conclusion, as the result of our inquiry, that the fermentation of sugar, the splitting of the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid, glycerine, and succinic acid, is the result of nothing but the vital activity of this little fungus, the torula.|$|E
6000|$|Few poets {{during their}} {{lifetime}} {{have been at}} once so much admired and so much abused as Pope. Some writers, destined to oblivion in after-ages, have been loaded with laurels in their own time; while others, on whom Fame was one day to [...] "wait like a menial," [...] {{have gone to the}} grave neglected, if not decried and depreciated. But it was the fate of Pope to combine in his single experience the extremes of detraction and flattery--to have the sunshine of applause and the hail-storm of calumny mingled on his living head; while over his dead body, as over the body of Patroclus, there has raged a critical controversy, involving not merely his character as a man, but his claims as a poet. For this, unquestionably, there are some subordinate reasons. Pope's religious creed, his political connexions, his easy circumstances, his popularity with the upper classes, as well as his testy temper and malicious disposition, all tended to rouse against him, while he lived, a personal as well as public hostility, altogether irrespective of the mere merit or demerit of his poetry. [...] "We cannot bear a Papist to be our principal bard," [...] said one class. [...] "No Tory for our translator of Homer," [...] cried the zealous Whigs, [...] "Poets should be poor, and Pope is independent," [...] growled Grub Street. The ancients could not endure that a [...] "poet should build an house, but this varlet has dug a grotto, and established a clandestine connexion between Parnassus and the Temple of Plutus." [...] "Pope," [...] said others, [...] "is hand-in-glove with Lords Oxford and Bolingbroke, and it was never so seen before in any genuine child of genius." [...] "He is a little ugly insect," [...] cried another class; [...] "can such a misbegotten brat be a favourite with the beautiful Apollo?" [...] "He is as venomous and spiteful as he is small; never was so much of the 'essence of devil' packed into such a tiny compass," [...] said another set; [...] "and this, to be sure, is England's great poet!" [...] Besides these personal objections, there were others of a more <b>solid</b> <b>character.</b> While all admitted the exquisite polish and terse language of Pope's compositions, many felt that they were too artificial--that they were often imitative--that they seldom displayed those qualities of original thought and sublime enthusiasm which had formed the chief characteristics of England's best bards, and were slow to rank the author of [...] "Eloisa and Abelard," [...] with the creator of [...] "Hamlet," [...] "Othello," [...] and [...] "Lear;" [...] the author of the [...] "Rape of the Lock" [...] with the author of [...] "Paradise Lost;" [...] the author of the [...] "Pastorals," [...] with the author of the [...] "Faery Queen;" [...] {{and the author of the}} [...] "Imitations of Horace," [...] with the author of the [...] "Canterbury Tales." [...] On the one hand, Pope's ardent friends erred in classing him with or above these great old writers; and on the other, his enemies were thus provoked to thrust him too far down in the scale, and to deny him genius altogether. Since his death, his fame has continued to vibrate between extremes. Lord Byron and Lord Carlisle (the latter, in a lecture delivered in Leeds in December 1850, and published afterwards) have placed him ridiculously high; while Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Bowles, have underrated him. It shall be our endeavour, in our succeeding remarks, to steer a middle course between the parties.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Motif {{patterns}} of maximal saturation emerged originally in contexts of pattern discovery in biomolecular sequences and have recently proven a valuable notion {{also in the}} design of data compression schemes. Informally, a motif is a string of intermittently <b>solid</b> and wild <b>characters</b> that recurs more or less frequently in an input sequence or family of sequences. Motif discovery techniques and tools tend to be computationally imposing, however, special classes of "rigid" motifs have been identified of which the discovery is affordable in low polynomial time. Results In the present work, "extensible" motifs are considered such that each sequence of gaps comes endowed with some elasticity, whereby the same pattern may be stretched to fit segments of the source that match all the <b>solid</b> <b>characters</b> but are otherwise of different lengths. A few applications of this notion are then described. In applications of data compression by textual substitution, extensible motifs are seen to bring savings {{on the size of the}} codebook, and hence to improve compression. In germane contexts, in which compressibility is used in its dual role as a basis for structural inference and classification, extensible motifs are seen to support unsupervised classification and phylogeny reconstruction. Conclusion Off-line compression based on extensible motifs can be used advantageously to compress and classify biological sequences. </p...|$|R
