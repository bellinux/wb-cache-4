50|$|IBM 3767 Communication Terminal is a <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> {{terminal}} {{that employed}} wire matrix print-head technology and, {{for the first}} time, the Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) communications protocol set under IBM's Systems Network Architecture(SNA). It was introduced in 1974 and was used widely during the late 1970s to 1990s, for attachment to IBM System/360 and System/370 mainframe computers and IBM System/7 as a 2741 terminal.|$|E
50|$|It was 8 MHz {{faster than}} its predecessor, the PowerBook 145B. It lacked an ADB port {{and used a}} lower quality passive matrix display than other current offerings, both to reduce the price. It also lacked {{external}} monitor support. Like the Duos & PowerBook 100 before it, the 150 only had a single <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> port, however, a third party adapter was available {{for use in the}} optional modem slot.|$|E
50|$|The StyleWriter was {{the first}} of Apple's line of inkjet <b>serial</b> <b>printers,</b> {{targeted}} mainly towards consumers. The feed mechanism was removable, and paper could be fed through manually in a virtually straight line.|$|R
50|$|The StyleWriter 1200 was {{the third}} of Apple's line of inkjet <b>serial</b> <b>printers,</b> {{released}} after the StyleWriter II. Based on the same Canon engine, this model had faster printing speed than its predecessor, but used the same ink cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, a {{terminal}} server was {{a device that}} attached to serial RS-232 devices, such as [...] "green screen" [...] text terminals or <b>serial</b> <b>printers,</b> and transported traffic via TCP/IP, Telnet, SSH or other vendor-specific network protocols (e.g., LAT) via an Ethernet connection.|$|R
5000|$|A user would {{normally}} use the [...] "(L)oad" [...] command to load a bootstrap loader (i.e., for CP/M) from a floppy or the fixed disk. One could also access a [...] "(T)ypewriter" [...] mode for direct interface with the <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> port and basic typing on screen. [...] "(H)ost terminal" [...] {{would allow the}} 820-II to interface as a terminal via either of the serial ports, as specified, at up to 19.2 kbit/s.|$|E
50|$|The 165 added a 33 MHz {{processor}} and larger standard hard drive. Along with the PowerBook 145B, {{this would be}} the last of the true 100 series PowerBooks and the last Apple laptop to include two <b>serial</b> (<b>printer</b> and modem) ports. Its entry level descendant, the PowerBook 150, would continue to sell for another year and though it used the 140 case design, its internals were actually based on the PowerBook Duo and PowerBook 190, a 100-series PowerBook in name only as it used the PowerBook 5300's motherboard and case as well.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{needs to}} use a new more {{efficient}} communications protocol set and to make available a more efficient and reliable remote printer and display terminals. To satisfy such needs, IBM 3767 <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> and IBM 3770 communications system (including a line printer) became available {{as part of the}} [...] "Advanced Communications Function" [...] (ACF) announcement which included the new System Network Architecture (SNA) and Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) communications protocol set, followed by another announcement in July, 1975, which included IBM 3760 Data Entry Station and the new models of IBM 3270 display stations, and IBM 3790 communication system.|$|E
50|$|Connectors {{mounted on}} DTE {{are likely to}} be male, and those mounted on DCE {{are likely to be}} female (with the cable {{connectors}} being the opposite). However, this is far from universal; for instance, most <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> have a female DB25 connector, but they are DTEs.|$|R
50|$|The COMX Printer card allowed {{connection}} of parallel and <b>serial</b> <b>printers.</b> Depending on {{what type of}} printer was connected the firmware ROM was selected either with the parallel firmware between memory location @C000-@CFFF and the serial firmware between memory location @D000-@DFFF or the other way around.|$|R
5000|$|Serial Communications Extender - Allows {{communication}} with standard serial ports and devices {{attached to them}} (such as modems, lab equipment, other computers, <b>serial</b> terminals, <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> and X-10 home controllers). Built in modem support to communicate with most standard modems, including support for a few file transfer methods such as Zmodem.|$|R
50|$|DECserver 250The DECserver 250 was {{a network}} server for {{printers}} for Ethernet Local Area Networks, {{consisting of a}} single box that provided the following: (2) Digital Parallel printer ports, each of which used a male 37-pin connector, (4) EIA RS-232-C/CCITT V.24 asynchronous line interfaces for connecting three serial printers and one <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> or terminal, and (1) Ethernet interface transceiver port. The DECserver 250 implemented the Local Area Transport (LAT) protocol for communication with service nodes that implemented this protocol on the same Ethernet. Software that ran on the DECserver 250 was down-line loaded over the network from a Phase IV DECnet load host.|$|E
50|$|After this {{successful}} product, {{the company}} embarked on introducing high-performance add-in cards, {{most notably the}} LIM (Lotus, Intel Microsoft standard) which extended DOS out to 1M, Multi-purpose network cards that included RAM, clock, <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> ports and Network COAX TCPIP capabilities. Orchid developed its own operating system {{as well as one}} of the first 5 OEM's of Novell. Other products included PC Turbo, TinyTurbo and TurboVGA enhancement cards that included 186 and 286 processors. As the operating systems took on more resources Orchid made a switch back to its roots as PC board manufacturer. From 1984 1986 the company switched to an Autocad video board manufacturer. Later, a variety of memory and video cards were introduced.|$|E
50|$|The VT101 and VT102 were cost-reduced, non-expandable {{follow-on}} versions. The VT101 {{was essentially}} a base-model VT100, while the VT102 came standard with the AVO and <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> port options pre-installed. The VT105 contained a simple graphics subsystem known as waveform graphics which was mostly compatible with same system in the earlier VT55. This system allowed two mathematical functions to be drawn to the screen {{on top of the}} normal text display, allowing text and graphics to be mixed to produce charts and similar output. The VT125 added an implementation of the byte-efficient Remote Graphic Instruction Set, ReGIS, which used custom ANSI codes to send the graphics commands to the terminal, rather than requiring the terminal to be set to a separate graphics mode like the VT105.|$|E
5000|$|... 7502 {{consisted}} of a system enclosure containing up to eight PCB's (CPU card, memory cards, peripheral controllers and video cards). It was similar in size to a desk side or tower PC, but was mounted horizontally. As {{it was intended to}} function in an office environment, steel-framed, wood-veneered cabinets and furniture were available for the processor and peripheral units. The 7502 system enclosure had two levels to include space for the dual, 8-inch floppy disc unit. The interior of the cabinet was covered with acoustic-absorbent foam material to cut the noise from the cooling fans. The maximum connectivity was 8 x 7561 VDU stations and four <b>serial</b> <b>printers,</b> but in the early systems it was necessary to reduce the VDU attachments if floppy disc storage was attached. The rear of the 7502 system carried the connectors for VDUs, modem and <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> and a set of 8 [...] "engineer's switches" [...] which could be used to input data and set options for [...] "teleloading" [...] software.|$|R
50|$|Robust XON is a {{technique}} to restart communication, just in case it was stopped by an accidentally received XOFF. The receiving unit sends periodic XON characters when it can receive data, and the line is idle. One common use is by <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> (like HP LaserJet II) to indicate they are online and ready to receive data. The XON is sent every 1 to 30 seconds depending on the printer's firmware design.|$|R
50|$|The StyleWriter is Apple Inc.'s line of inkjet <b>serial</b> <b>printers,</b> {{targeted}} mainly towards consumers. They produced print {{quality that}} {{was better than}} the dot matrix ImageWriters, and were cheaper than the LaserWriters. All but a few models contained Canon print engines, while the last few were re-badged HP DeskJet printers. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he discontinued most of the company's accessory product lines, including the StyleWriter and LaserWriter.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the first}} PowerBook series to use a Motorola 68LC040 CPU (simultaneous with Duo 280) and be {{upgradeable}} to the PowerPC architecture via a swap-out CPU daughter card (with the PowerPC and 68040 upgrades for sale), use 9.5-inch Dual Scan passive color/B&W displays, 16-bit stereo sound with stereo speakers, have an expansion bay, PC Card capability, two battery bays (and a ten-minute sleep/clock battery, which allowed for main batteries to be swapped out while in sleep mode), full-size keyboard with F1-F12 function keys, {{be able to sleep}} while connected to an external monitor and have a battery contact cover included on the actual batteries. It included a single serial port which could be to connect to a <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> or a network via Apple's LocalTalk. In another first, it also included an AAUI port for connecting to non-LocalTalk (usually Ethernet) networks.|$|E
50|$|BNU is a {{high-performance}} communications device driver {{designed to provide}} enhanced support for serial port communications. The BNU serial port driver was specifically targeted for use with early (late 1980s - 1990s) DOS-based BBS software. The reason for BNU and other similar enhanced serial port drivers was to provide better support for serial communications software than what was offered by the machine's BIOS and/or DOS being used on the machine. Having serial port support as provided by BNU and other similar drivers allowed the communications software programmers {{to spend more time}} on the actual applications instead of the depths and details of how to talk to the serial ports and the modems connected to them. Sending communications data across a modem link was a lot more involved than sending data to a <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> which was basically all that was originally capable of being done with the existing serial port software support.|$|E
5000|$|Epson advertised the HX-20 with a {{photograph}} of the computer on two facing magazine pages with the headline [...] "Actual size". With about the footprint of an A4 size page, the Epson HX-20 features a full-transit keyboard, rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries, a built-in 120 × 32-pixel LCD which allowed 4 lines of 20 characters, a calculator-size dot-matrix printer, the EPSON BASIC programming language, two Hitachi 6301 CPUs at 614 kHz which is essentially a souped up Motorola 6801, 16 kB RAM expandable to 32 kB, two RS-232 ports at a maximum of 4800 bits/s for the first 8-pin DIN connector intended for modem or <b>serial</b> <b>printer</b> with the second port capable of 38400 bits/s using a 5-pin DIN connector which was mainly for use with external floppy drive and video display an early concept of docking station, a 300 bit/s acoustic coupler was available, built-in microcassette drive, barcode reader connector. Uses a proprietary operating system, which consists of the EPSON BASIC interpreter and a monitor program, and weighs approximately 1.6 kg. Known colours of the machine are silver and cream, while some prototypes were dark grey. The HX-20 was supplied with a grey or brown carry case. An external acoustic coupler, the CX-20, was available for the HX-20, as was an external floppy disk drive, the TF-20, and an external speech synthesis Augmentative Communication Device (ACD), ‘RealVoice’. Another extension was the serially connected 40 × 24 character video. It used a special protocol, EPSP, which was also used by the external floppy disk drive.The battery life of the HX-20 was approximately 50 hours running BASIC and less using the microcassette, printer or RS-232. Data integrity could be preserved in the 4.0 - 6.0 V range. The power supply was rated for 8 W. Operating and charging it would tolerate 5 - 35 °C. Data integrity could be preserved at -5 - 40 °C. The HX-20 could be stored between -20 - 60 °C.|$|E
5000|$|To {{alleviate}} the C64's somewhat limited memory capacity when running complex software, Vizastar included a ROM cartridge that provided an additional 4K RAM and {{also served as}} a form of copy protection. [...] This allowed the program to remain compatible with third-party floppy disk drives for the C64, such as the Indus GT and MSD Super Disk, unlike many copy protected packages. Commodore <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> were supported, as were RS-232 and Centronics printers with the appropriate interface.|$|R
50|$|Only COM1: and COM2: {{addresses}} {{were defined}} by the original PC. Attempts to share IRQ3 and IRQ4 to use additional ports require special measures in hardware and software, since shared IRQs were not defined in the original PC design. The most typical devices plugged into the serial port were modems and mice. Plotters and <b>serial</b> <b>printers</b> were also among the more commonly used serial peripherals, and there were numerous other more unusual uses such as operating cash registers, factory equipment, and connecting terminals.|$|R

The Power Macintosh G 3 line stayed in production until August 1999, {{and was replaced}} by the Power Macintosh G 4, which used the same chassis. The Power Macintosh G 3 originally cost between $ 1599 and $ 2900 depending on options. The three original Power Macintosh G 3 models shipped with a 300 MHz, 350 MHz, or 400 MHz PowerPC 750 (G 3) processor. Just pull on the small round handle {{on the side of the}} tower, and the entire side of the computer opens up. The G 3 's motherboard is mounted on that surface, giving you easy access for upgrading RAM or installed PCI cards. Apple added new ports (USB and the much-anticipated FireWire) that took the place of historic, and quickly becoming antiquated, Mac <b>serial</b> (<b>printer</b> and modem) ports. The Power Macintosh G 3 has two USB (12 Mbps) ports, two FireWire (400 Mbps) ports, one 10 / 100 BaseT Ethernet port, an RJ- 11 jack for an optional 56 K modem, a sound out and sound in jack, and one ADB (Apple Desktop Bus) port.

50|$|Some companies, such as Printek, DASCOM, WeP Peripherals, Epson, Okidata, Olivetti, Compuprint, Lexmark, and TallyGenicom still produce <b>serial</b> <b>printers.</b> Printronix is now {{the only}} {{manufacturer}} of line printers. Today, a new dot matrix printer actually costs more than most inkjet printers and some entry level laser printers. Despite this initial price difference, the printing costs for inkjet and laser printers are a great deal higher than for dot matrix printers, and the inkjet/laser printer manufacturers effectively use their monopoly over arbitrarily priced printer cartridges to subsidize the initial cost of the printer itself. Dot matrix ribbons are a commodity and are not monopolized by the printer manufacturers themselves.|$|R
