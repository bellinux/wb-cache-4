2500|$|Pakistan {{deployed}} {{no additional}} air defense assets other than one light antiaircraft [...] "Ack-Ack" [...] regiment {{and a few}} additional batteries to assist the PAF in 1971. The 6th Light Ack-Ack guarded Dhaka, the 46th Light Ack-Ack battery was in Chittagong, and elements of the 43rd Ack-Ack were present in areas around East Pakistan. The caliber of the regiment was not enhanced to heavy, and no surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) were deployed in East Pakistan. The only long-range radar, a Russian P-35 model, was also taken to West Pakistan, {{along with all the}} C-130 Hercules transport planes. Several dummies were deployed at the airbases to deceive the IAF, however. To augment <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>radar</b> cover, which could provide only 3–5 minutes warning to the planes, observers were deployed around the country, armed with radios and telephones. These were exposed to Mukti Bahini attacks, however, which tended to reduce their effectiveness. The IAF had flown reconnaissance flights over East Pakistan since June 1971, and had engaged their opponents earlier in the east than they did in the west, having clashed with PAF over the Salient of Boyra in West Bengal on 22 November. Between then and 3 December 1971, there were no engagements of the two air forces. Pakistan had lost 3 planes (2 shot down and 1 damaged) on 22 November over Boyra, and as no replacement aircraft had been sent from West Pakistan, were down to 16 operational Sabres by December 1971.|$|E

2500|$|These two effects {{tend to be}} at {{odds with}} each other, and {{it is not easy to}} combine both good <b>short</b> <b>range</b> and good long range in a single radar. This is because the short pulses needed for a good minimum range {{broadcast}} have less total energy, making the returns much smaller and the target harder to detect. This could be offset by using more pulses, but this would shorten the maximum <b>range.</b> So each <b>radar</b> uses a particular type of signal. Long-range radars tend to use long pulses with long delays between them, and <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>radars</b> use smaller pulses with less time between them. As electronics have improved many radars now can change their pulse repetition frequency, thereby changing their <b>range.</b> The newest <b>radars</b> fire two pulses during one cell, one for <b>short</b> <b>range</b> (about [...] ) and a separate signal for longer ranges (about [...] ).|$|R
