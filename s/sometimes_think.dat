5|$|The game also {{remains the}} only {{national}} championship game to have featured three of the NBA 50 Greatest Players – Jordan, Ewing and Worthy – chosen in 1996 to mark the NBA's 50th anniversary. In addition to Jordan's, Ewing's and Worthy's Hall of Fame NBA careers with the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers respectively (including a combined 9 NBA championships), Floyd was named an NBA All-Star and still holds playoff records for most points in a quarter and half, while Perkins played in the league for 17 seasons. For Jordan's part, his game-winner is often seen as the launching point of his career - the moment that gave him the confidence to become what many {{believe to be the}} greatest basketball player of all time, in no small part due to his clutch performance. Jordan has said multiple times that before he would take game-winning shots with the Bulls, he would <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> back to his shot in the 1982 game that propelled North Carolina past Georgetown.|$|E

However, the same comment also hints that she was not unaware that her choice was at the cost of her children.|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Hattersley, {{a friend}} of Huntingdon's, marries Milicent because he wants a quiet wife who will let him do what he likes with no word of reproach or complaint. He mistreats his wife.

But after he reforms himself he becomes a loving husband and father.|$|E
2500|$|Wieringo {{explained}} the philosophy behind his drawing style thus: [...] "I {{just try to}} keep things fun. I like to do fun comics. It doesn't have to be realistic to be believable. In fact, I <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> that funny [...] might actually add something to certain books." [...] When he began illustrating the Rogue miniseries, he was intimidated by the dark tone of that book's story, but once he finished the first issue, the editors decided to light up the [...] "grim and gritty" [...] tone of the story.|$|E

2500|$|He also advises {{his readers}} that they [...] "will not find all my adventures. I have left out those {{which would have}} {{offended}} the people who {{played a part in}} them, for they would cut a sorry figure in them. Even so, there are those who will <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> me too indiscreet; I am sorry for it." [...] And in the final chapter, the text abruptly breaks off with hints at adventures unrecorded: [...] "Three years later I saw her in Padua, where I resumed my acquaintance with her daughter on far more tender terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1925, he {{completed}} 53 climbs in the Sierra Nevada, and told Francis Farquhar that [...] "I <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> I climbed enough peaks {{this summer to}} render me a candidate for a padded cell—at least some people look at the matter in that way. [...] However, I {{get a lot of}} enjoyment from this rather strenuous form of diversion." [...] In 1926, he climbed in Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, the Beartooth Mountains and Absaroka Range of Montana, and the Sawtooth Range of Idaho. [...] He made several additional first ascents in California that year.|$|E
2500|$|Psychologist Stuart Sutherland {{wrote that}} cases of telepathy can be {{explained}} by people underestimating the probability of coincidences. According to Sutherland, [...] "most stories about this phenomenon concern people who are close to one another - husband and wife or brother and sister. Since such people have much in common, it is highly probable that they will <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> the same thought at the same time." [...] Graham Reed, a specialist in anomalistic psychology, noted that experiments into telepathy often involve the subject relaxing and reporting the 'messages' to consist of colored geometric shapes. Reed wrote that these are a common type of hypnagogic image and not evidence for telepathic communication.|$|E

2500|$|Also in this game, Maradona {{scored a}} second goal, voted in 2002 {{as the best}} goal in World Cup history, before English striker Gary Lineker pulled one back, but England could not score again and lost 2–1. Despite the skill of his second goal, Maradona wrote in his {{autobiography}} that, [...] "I <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> I preferred the one with my hand... It was a bit like stealing the wallet of the English." [...] He also wrote, {{in reference to the}} Falklands conflict, that [...] "it was as if we had beaten a country, not just a football team... Although we had said before the game that football {{had nothing to do with}} the Malvinas war, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds.

2500|$|Of the work, Andrew Sullivan wrote [...] "you cannot read [...] on Romeo and Juliet or Antony and Cleopatra {{without seeing}} those {{works in a}} new light. You cannot read his account of Rousseau's La {{nouvelle}} Heloise without wanting {{to go back and}} read it—more closely—again...Bloom had a gift for reading reality—the impulse to put your loving face to it and press your hands against it". Recollecting his friend in an interview, Bellow said [...] "Allan inhaled books and ideas the way the rest of us breathe air...People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled. When critics proclaim the death of the novel, I <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about. [...] Allan was certainly one." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{considered}} an attacking batsman who could score all around the wicket with [...] "a style that is entirely his own". He scored quickly when on form and was an [...] "ideal cricketer". His cover drive {{was considered}} particularly effective and hard hitting as well as attractive - A. A. Thomson wrote of him: [...] "Though a crabbed unemotional Northerner, I <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> that if one last fragment of cricket had to be preserved, as though in amber, {{it should be a}} glimpse of K. L. Hutchings cover-driving under a summer heaven." [...] According to David Denton and George Hirst, he hit the ball harder than any other player of their time (and they were contemporaries of Gilbert Jessop, one of the harder hitting batsmen of the Golden Age of cricket).|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{extremely}} well received and lauded by the UK music magazines {{at the time}} of its original release. Sounds awarded Signing Off five stars out of five, claiming that [...] "it is an (almost) perfect album... It's rare to find a debut album so detailed, so excellently played and so packed with bite – I <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> it hasn't really happened since The Clash." [...] NME described the album as [...] "a courageous debut... Their radical sentiments and trenchant lyrics are given all the more force by the soft-fist of UB40's measured musical delivery... The music might be mellow, but the hard-backed sentiments are hardly those of the nice reggae band you may have pigeonholed the UBs as." [...] Melody Maker said [...] "The UBs, chirpy and still fully independent, have wrapped up their initial promise and persuasion and delivered a well-girthed winner of a debut album... Certainly the music of UB40 benefits far more in both quality and quantity from the exacting freedom of an LP than any of their close contemporaries... the band have broadened out the unique, shy commerciality of the two singles, [...] "King" [...] and [...] "Food for Thought"... to an approach that sharpens the shape of their music and magnifies the message." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smoky black, a {{horse with}} a black base coat and one copy of the cream allele, is less {{well-known}} than the two golden shades. [...] Since a single copy of the cream gene primarily affects red pigment, with only a subtle effect on black, smoky blacks can be quite difficult to identify. Smoky blacks may have reddish guard hairs inside their ears, and experienced horse persons may detect something [...] "off" [...] about the coat of a smoky black, though the slightly burnished look is often chalked up to sun bleaching, which {{can also be seen}} in true blacks. The palest can be mistaken for bays or liver chestnuts, especially if exposed to the elements. Smoky black coats tend to react strongly to sun and sweat, and many smoky blacks turn a chocolate color with particularly reddish manes and tails. Bleaching due to the elements means that the legs retain their color better, and can take on an appearance of having dark points like a bay horse. Smoky blacks, however, will lack rich red tones in the coat, instead favoring chocolate and orange tones. [...] Because smoky blacks are often not recognized as such, breeders <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> that the cream gene [...] "skipped" [...] generations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Bianca Jackson has received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike. EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer has described Bianca as [...] "one {{of the most}} popular characters EastEnders has ever had", while James Rampton, journalist for The Independent, has commented that she is [...] "adored". Palmer has suggested that viewers [...] "rooted" [...] for Bianca because [...] "people love a stroppy girl". In 2000, she commented, [...] " [...] makes them laugh. A character like that is about living out your fantasies. Everybody would love to be like Bianca and really say what they think." [...] Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to EastEnders, as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, [...] "It makes me feel bad. I <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> I should go back [...] for everyone else's sake." [...] When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the Birmingham Evening Post said [...] "Good riddance!" [...] She described Bianca as a [...] "king-sized pain in the backside [...] A screeching and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain" [...] and a [...] "prize slapper [...] tormented all those whose paths [...] crossed." ...|$|E

2500|$|A famous {{quotation}} of Clarke's {{is often}} cited: [...] "One {{of the great}} tragedies of mankind is that morality has been hijacked by religion." [...] He was quoted in Popular Science in 2004 as saying of religion: [...] "Most malevolent and persistent of all mind viruses. We should {{get rid of it}} as quick as we can." [...] In a three-day [...] "dialogue on man and his world" [...] with Alan Watts, Clarke stated that he was biased against religion and said that he could not forgive religions for what he perceived as their inability to prevent atrocities and wars over time. In his introduction to the penultimate episode of Mysterious World, entitled [...] "Strange Skies", Clarke said: [...] "I <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> that the universe is a machine designed for the perpetual astonishment of astronomers," [...] reflecting the dialogue of the episode, in which he stated this concept more broadly, referring to [...] "mankind". [...] Near the very end of that same episode, the last segment of which covered the Star of Bethlehem, he said that his favourite theory was that it might be a pulsar. Given that pulsars were discovered in the interval between his writing the short story, [...] "The Star" [...] (1955), and making Mysterious World (1980), and given the more recent discovery of pulsar PSR B1913+16, he said: [...] "How romantic, if even now, we can hear the dying voice of a star, which heralded the Christian era." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, critics {{focused on}} the {{technique}} of the poem and how {{it relates to the}} meaning. In 1941, G. W. Knight claimed that [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] "needs no defence. It has a barbaric and oriental magnificence that asserts itself with a happy power and authenticity too often absent from visionary poems set within the Christian tradition." [...] Humphrey House, in 1953, praised the poem and said of beginning of the poem: [...] "The whole passage is full of life because the verse has both the needed energy and the needed control. The combination of energy and control in the rhythm and sound is so great" [...] and that Coleridge's words [...] "convey so fully the sense of inexhaustible energy, now falling now rising, but persisting through its own pulse". Also in 1953, Elisabeth Schneider dedicated her book to analysing the various aspects of the poem, including the various sound techniques. When discussing the quality of the poem, she wrote, [...] "I <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> we overwork Coleridge's idea of 'the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities.' I have to come back to it here, however, for the particular flavor of [...] "Kubla Khan", with its air of mystery, is describable in part through that convenient phrase. Yet, the 'reconciliation' does not quite occur either. It is in fact avoided. What we have instead is the very spirit of 'oscillation' itself." [...] Continuing, she claimed, [...] "The poem is the soul of ambivalence, oscillation's very self; and that is probably its deepest meaning. In creating this effect, form and matter are intricately woven. The irregular and inexact rhymes and varied lengths of the lines play some part. More important is the musical effect in which a smooth, rather swift forward movement is emphasized by the relation of grammatical structure to line and rhyme, yet is impeded and thrown back upon itself even from the beginning". She then concluded: [...] "Here in these interwoven oscillations dwells the magic, the 'dream,' and the air of mysterious meaning of [...] "Kubla Khan". I question whether this effect was all deliberately [...] out by Coleridge, though it might have been. It is possibly half-inherent in his subject ... What remains is the spirit of 'oscillation,' perfectly poeticized, and possibly ironically commemorative of the author." [...] Following in 1959, John Beer described the complex nature of the poem: [...] "'Kubla Khan' the poem is not a meaningless reverie, but a poem so packed with meaning as to render detailed elucidation extremely difficult." [...] In responding to House, Beer claimed, [...] "That there is an image of energy in the fountain may be accepted: but I cannot agree that it is creative energy of the highest type." ...|$|E
