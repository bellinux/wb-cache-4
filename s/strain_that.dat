5|$|The type-IV {{secretion}} apparatus also injects the cag PAI-encoded protein CagA {{into the}} stomach's epithelial cells, where it disrupts the cytoskeleton, adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, cell polarity, and other cellular activities. Once inside the cell, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues {{by a host}} cell membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (TK). CagA then allosterically activates protein tyrosine phosphatase/protooncogene Shp2. Pathogenic strains of H. pylori {{have been shown to}} activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a TK domain. Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. A C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell gene transcription, independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A great deal of diversity exists between strains of H. pylori, and the <b>strain</b> <b>that</b> infects a person can predict the outcome.|$|E

40|$|Four {{synthetic}} oligonucleotide probes representing {{different regions}} of the Shiga-like toxin I (SLT-I) structural genes and one oligonucleotide derived from the SLT-II gene of Escherichia coli serotype O 157 :H 7 strain 933 were examined for the identification of E. coli <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> produce cytotoxins for Vero or HeLa cells. E. coli <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> synthesize SLT-I alone or O 157 :H 7 isolates that coexpress SLT-I and SLT-II hybridized with all four probes that were complementary to the SLT-I genes, suggesting that they have toxin genes with great homology in all the regions examined. In colony hybridization tests, these oligonucleotide probes did not react with E. coli <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> were nontoxigenic for Vero cells or that produced cytotoxins belonging to the SLT-II family. The probe derived from the slt-IIA gene distinguished E. coli <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> produced SLT-II alone from SLT-I-producing strains and hybridized to all E. coli O 157 :H 7 <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> produced both SLT-I and SLT-II. Using two of these oligonucleotide probes that were complementary to slt-IA or slt-IIA sequences, we identified 50 of 52 cytotoxin-producing strains, whereas none of 416 nontoxigenic E. coli strains was reactive.

40|$|A murine {{model for}} Streptococcus suis {{infection}} in pigs was validated by inoculating groups of 5 BALB/c and 5 CF 1 mice with 107 CFU/ml of 13 different S. suis serotype 2 strains. The pathogenicity of these strains {{had been established}} in a standardized pig model of S. suis infection using one- week-old gnotobiotic pigs. We inoculated groups of mice intraperitoneally with 4 <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> were highly virulent for pigs and belonged to the phenotype MRP+EF+, with 4 <b>strains,</b> <b>that</b> were weakly virulent for pigs and belonged to the phenotype MRP+EF*, and with 5 <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> were non- virulent for pigs and belonged to phenotype MRP - EF -. The S. suis <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> were highly virulent for pigs caused high morbidity and an intermediate mortality in mice, the S. suis <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> were weakly virulent for pigs caused high morbidity but low mortality, and the <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> were non- virulent for pigs, induced highest morbidity and mortality. These results were comparable in both breeds of mice. In contrast to the pathology of S. suis infection in pigs with specific lesions, lesions in mice were histologically often characterized as non-specific, i. e., necrotizing encephalitis and focal or diffuse hepatitis sometimes with abscesses. Irrespective of breed (BALB/c vs. CF 1), the murine model used for S. suis infection was incompatible with the pig model. This indicates that virulence of S. suis type 2 for mice and pigs is host-specific. Therefore, we regard the presently available murine models unsuitable for studying S. suis infections in pigs...|$|R
40|$|In {{a cohort}} study of 200 young {{children}} in Guinea-Bissau, it was previously found that some enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains were more pathogenic than others, {{depending on the type}} of toxin that they could produce, and that natural ETEC infections induced substantial protection against new infections with ETEC <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> had the same combination of toxins and colonization factors (CFs). We wanted to describe the clonal relatedness of the ETEC strains isolated during this study and to investigate whether the protective antigens and the virulence factors that were responsible for the pathogenic traits were common to <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> were clonally closely related or whether they were more likely to be encoded by the ETEC virulence plasmids that normally encode the toxins and the CFs. By performing repetitive sequence-based PCR analysis of strains representing 452 infections, we found <b>that</b> <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> had the same toxin-CF profile were usually closely related, although a few were unrelated. <b>Strains</b> <b>that</b> did not have the same toxin-CF profiles but that were positive for a given toxin or for a given CF were not consistently more closely related to each other than to <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> were negative for the same toxin or CF. Our results indicate that the pathogenic traits of ETEC were mainly attributed to genes carried on the ETEC virulence plasmids. Because most <b>strains</b> <b>that</b> had the same toxin-CF profile were closely related, it seems likely that the toxin-CF-specific protection was clonal and was not targeting antigens encoded by the virulence plasmids. These results are of relevance to the ETEC vaccine development effort...|$|R
