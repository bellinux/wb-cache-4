50|$|Temple Hill, Churchyard Lane, and Ballintemple itself {{derive their}} names from an ecclesiastical and burial site {{at the top}} of Temple Hill. While some {{historical}} texts suggest that this graveyard was sited at an early medieval church of the Knights Templar, this is not supported by other texts, and modern historians assert that this association is incorrect, and if a medieval church did exist here, it was {{more likely to have been}} associated with the Knights Hospitaller. Whatever the case, while the graveyard remains, no archaeological evidence of an adjoining church has been subject to modern survey. The graveyard itself has been <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>survey,</b> and while it may have been used in the early medieval period, the earliest recorded burial event was that of the entrails of Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton who was killed in the 1690 Siege of Cork and whose intestines were removed and buried here to preserve the body prior to transport back to England. The earliest remaining extant burial markers (with discernable dates) are dated to the early 18th Century. The antiquary and folklorist Thomas Crofton Croker surveyed the graveyard in the early 19th century. Croker records a folksong relating to the graveyard as well as documenting a marker for an 18th-century burial of a Lieutenant Henry Richard Temple who died with his young wife during a journey from the Caribbean (via Ireland) to England. During one such survey in the early 1800s, Croker was chased by locals who mistook his survey for grave robbery. The graveyard is accessible but closed to new burials (save to a few families with existing burial rights).|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is Large-area {{protected}} areas {{of nature in}} western Bohemia and eastern Bavaria. Within this topic, the thesis focuses mainly on less strict categories of these areas, i. e. on Czech landscape protected areas ("chráněná krajinná oblast") and Bavarian nature parks ("Naturpark"). From each of these two categories, I chose one particular representative area to deal more in detail with. These representative areas are Český les Landscape Protected Area and the neighbouring Bavarian Nördlicher Oberpfälzer Wald (Northern Upper Palatinate Forest) Nature Park. The aim of this thesis is to describe, analyse and compare the aforementioned protected areas, and - as the result - to evaluate the level of protection of these {{on both sides of}} the Czech-Bavarian border, as well as to potentially find inspirations for improving the relevant Czech legislation. The thesis is composed of seven Parts, whereas Parts Three to Six are further divided into chapters and (except Part Six) subchapters. The first - introductory - Part is followed by Part Two, geographically determining the region <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>survey.</b> Part Three contains a general treatise on legal regulation of large-area protected areas of nature in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany, including the Free State of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We present initial {{results from}} the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), a four-band all-sky thermal {{infrared}} survey that produces data well suited for measuring the physical properties of asteroids, and the NEOWISE enhancement to the WISE mission allowing for detailed study of solar system objects. Using a NEATM thermal model fitting routine, we compute diameters for over 100, 000 Main Belt asteroids from their IR thermal flux, with errors better than 10 %. We then incorporate literature values of visible measurements (in {{the form of the}} H absolute magnitude) to determine albedos. Using these data we investigate the albedo and diameter distributions of the Main Belt. As observed previously, we find a change in the average albedo when comparing the inner, middle, and outer portions of the Main Belt. We also confirm that the albedo distribution of each region is strongly bimodal. We observe groupings of objects with similar albedos in regions of the Main Belt associated with dynamical breakup families. Asteroid families typically show a characteristic albedo for all members, but there are notable exceptions to this. This paper is the first look at the Main Belt asteroids in the WISE data, and only represents the preliminary, observed raw size, and albedo distributions for the populations considered. These distributions are <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>survey</b> biases inherent to the NEOWISE data set and cannot yet be interpreted as describing the true populations; the debiased size and albedo distributions will be the subject of the next paper in this series...|$|E
40|$|As {{computers}} {{continue to}} increase in adoption and usage, people are spending large amounts of their time interacting in virtual environments. In such environments, people often make use of and represent themselves with virtual identities such as online shopping accounts, social networking profiles, and video game avatars. Despite being technically "virtual," {{research has shown that}} virtual identities can reflect and influence peoples' values and preferences that they possess outside of virtual environments (i. e., the "real world"). It is a major challenge to identify and quantify such values and preferences. While qualitative methods (e. g., self-reported surveys) may be employed to gain insight into users' preferences, they are often intrusive and may be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>survey</b> bias. I present a data-driven approach that combines artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with cognitive categorization theories to develop computational models of users' values and preferences. Such models overcome the aforementioned limitations-and more importantly-enable new ways for such insights to be obtained and understood. For example, they can concretely model how much an application like a videogame may be implicitly biased against a particular user group by analyzing its underlying data structures; they {{can also be used to}} reveal how users conform to or subvert conventions by analyzing telemetry data collected from a given application. The software developed for this research can be viewed as computational tools for social analysis. They can enable developers to concretely evaluate if a given system is inequitable (e. g., marginalizing a particular user group); they can also be used to guide developers in resolving such issues. This dissertation includes a comprehensive report on several case-studies of applying these approaches and tools to both (a) publicly available data from commercial sources and (b) data obtained from self-designed experiments conducted in laboratory settingsby Chong-U Lim.

Maybe they donate because “that’s what everyone else is doing. ” This study is on how people react differently to social pressures in face-to-face communication and computer mediated communication when faced with the opportunity to donate money to a cause. This study aims to examine how social factors influence donation habits and measure the impact of said influence in both in-person and online donation opportunities. It is hypothesized that people are more influenced by their peers in face-to-face interactions and therefore more likely to donate in person than online. Participants will be males and females between the ages of 18 and 30. Participants will be <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>surveys</b> and interviews, in which their current donation habits will be recorded and their potential donation habits compared based on demographics and interest.
