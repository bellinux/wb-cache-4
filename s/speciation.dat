5|$|<b>Speciation</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature. In sexually reproducing organisms, <b>speciation</b> results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence. There are four primary geographic modes of <b>speciation.</b> The most common in animals is allopatric <b>speciation,</b> which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by habitat fragmentation or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms. As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated {{from the rest of}} their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.|$|E
5|$|The second mode of <b>speciation</b> is peripatric <b>speciation,</b> {{which occurs}} when small populations of organisms become {{isolated}} {{in a new}} environment. This differs from allopatric <b>speciation</b> in that the isolated populations are numerically {{much smaller than the}} parental population. Here, the founder effect causes rapid <b>speciation</b> after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on Gould moved away from wedding punctuated {{equilibrium}} to allopatric <b>speciation,</b> particularly as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of <b>speciation.</b> Gould was particularly attracted to Douglas Futuyma's work {{on the importance of}} reproductive isolating mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Based on its tooth morphology, Aegyptonycteris {{was most}} likely a generalistic omnivore. Unlike other {{contemporary}} bats such as Witwatia, it lacks <b>speciations</b> towards carnivory, as well as <b>speciations</b> in other extreme lifestyles displayed by modern bats, such as frugivory or nectarivory. Instead, its molars are fairly generalised, with a few <b>speciations</b> towards crushing, suggesting a diet involving both animal and plant matter.|$|R
50|$|Though they haven't {{become as}} large as Taeniolabis, lambdopsalids were still large by multituberculate standards, the largest species {{weighting}} around 30 kg. They are notable for their unique dental <b>speciations</b> such as hypsodonty, which seem to imply <b>speciations</b> towards grazing. Lambdopsalis is notable for offering direct evidence of hair and enamel and tooth prism patterns among multituberculates.|$|R
40|$|In {{the book}} based on {{original}} data <b>speciations</b> of iron, manganese, zinc and copper in dissolved and suspended phases, {{as well as}} in biota are under consideration. It is shown that migration forms of metals in river runoff and ocean water are determined by fundamentally different geochemical processes. Great importance of the "river - sea" geochemical barrier in transformation of original (i. e. in the river run-off) <b>speciations</b> of metals is established. It is shown that distribution of the studied elements in the ocean is closely connected with processes of biological production. Regular changes in <b>speciations</b> of the studied elements in ocean water column are revealed. Role of biological processes in transportation of the elements in the ocean water column is estimated...|$|R
5|$|Finally, in {{sympatric}} <b>speciation</b> species diverge without {{geographic isolation}} or changes in habitat. This form is rare since {{even a small}} amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population. Generally, sympatric <b>speciation</b> in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non-random mating, to allow reproductive isolation to evolve.|$|E
5|$|Hybridization may be {{important}} in <b>speciation</b> in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid <b>speciation</b> (not {{increasing the number of}} sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to <b>speciation,</b> a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E
5|$|Interspecific hybrids are the {{offspring}} from interspecies mating; these sometimes result in hybrid <b>speciation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Darwinopterus, {{like most}} wukongopterids, is a {{terrestrial}} pterosaur lacking <b>speciations</b> for piscivory; ergo, {{it was early}} on recognised {{to have been a}} terrestrial form. Originally, it was described as a raptorial hawking carnivore; however, posterior analyses have found no <b>speciations</b> towards aerial predation. Instead, it {{appears to have been a}} saltatorial insectivore, hopping around both in the trees and on the ground, akin to some modern songbirds. D. robustidens in particular might have preferred hard-shelled beetles.|$|R
25|$|Schowalteria is a Late Cretaceous species {{almost as}} large if not larger than R. giganticus that shows <b>speciations</b> towards herbivory, {{comparable}} to those of modern ungulates.|$|R
40|$|<b>Speciations</b> {{of sulfur}} (sulfide S, pyrite S, sulfate S) and of {{reactive}} iron (Fe 3 +, Fe 2 +, sulfide Fe) in bottom sediments {{have been studied}} in gravity cores and drill cores collected on the shelf of the southwest Caspian Sea. It {{has been shown that}} intensity of reduction processes, in particular sulfate reduction, as well as <b>speciations</b> of S and reactive Fe reflect the change of transgressive and regressive stages of the Caspian basin. Characteristic features for the investigated area are high sedimentation rate and high reactivity of organic matter entering bottom sediments...|$|R
5|$|<b>Speciation</b> is {{the process}} where a species diverges into two or more {{descendant}} species.|$|E
5|$|The third mode is parapatric <b>speciation.</b> This {{is similar}} to peripatric <b>speciation</b> in that a small {{population}} enters a new habitat, but differs in {{that there is no}} physical separation between these two populations. Instead, <b>speciation</b> results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations. Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, which can undergo parapatric <b>speciation</b> in response to localised metal pollution from mines. Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement, which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as character displacement, which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.|$|E
5|$|Basing {{himself on}} revised data, Sampson in 1995 {{estimated}} that the layers investigated represented {{a longer period of}} time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's Brachyceratops quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the Einiosaurus beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed <b>speciation</b> took place, with the populations splitting. These time intervals were still short enough to indicate that the rate of <b>speciation</b> must have been high, which might have been true of all centrosaurines of the late Campanian.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} neochoristoderes, Ikechosaurus has a rather simple dentition, lacking the <b>speciations</b> seen in latter species. It also has parasphenoid palatal teeth, a feature {{not seen in}} any other choristodere.|$|R
50|$|Ecteniniidae is an extinct {{family of}} probainognathian cynodonts from the Triassic of South America. They are notable for their large size, {{as well as}} for being among the first synapsids with <b>speciations</b> towards cursoriality.|$|R
50|$|The authors {{hypothesized}} that scaphognathines specialized as aerial predators in inland freshwater habitats. However, more recent publications have suggested scaphognathines lacked <b>speciations</b> towards piscivory, and were likely terrestrial predators of small vertebrates or corvid-like generalists.|$|R

5|$|It was {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the woolly hare(Lepus oiostolus),but is now {{treated as a}} separate species. Cai and Feng (1982) and Wang(1985) elevated it to species status based on morphological and ecological differences from the woolly hare. In 2005, {{it was found that}} molecular phylogenetics indicated the Yunnan hare and the woolly hare to be sister taxa, and they may exhibit allopatric <b>speciation</b> or parapatric <b>speciation.</b> It might also be related to the Indian hare (Lepus nigricollis) and probably be its northern form.|$|E
30|$|Anthropogenic infochemicals: metalochlor (51218 - 45 - 2), copper {{compounds}} (various <b>speciations),</b> carbaryl (63 - 25 - 2), D-limonene (5989 - 27 - 5), benzaldehyde (100 - 52 - 7), tridecanone (593 - 08 - 8).|$|R
40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatography and {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometric method was established for analyz-ing 4 arsenic <b>speciations</b> in water of agricultural environment, including As(Ⅲ) ，MMA, DMA and As(V). The {{results showed that the}} method had a wide linear range(1 ~ 300 μg·L- 1) and the linear coefficients were more than 0. 999 0. The detection limits were very low (0. 7 - 0. 9 μg·L- 1). All of the relative standard deviations(RSD) were less than 5 %. The recoveries were between 94 % and 112 %. The analysis results showed that As(V) and As(Ⅲ) were the main arsenic <b>speciations</b> existed in the waste water of agricultural environment...|$|R
50|$|Though {{frequently}} {{feeding on}} slow-moving animals like snails, shrimps and worms, sirenids are unique among salamanders for having developed <b>speciations</b> towards herbivory, such as beak-like jaw ends and extensive intestines. They feed on algae and other soft-plants in the wild, and easily eat offered lettuce.|$|R
5|$|Multiple <b>speciation</b> events {{create a}} tree {{structured}} system {{of relationships between}} species. The role of systematics is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{continue}} a pattern present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of <b>speciation</b> into lowland and specialist upland species: Murray cod are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist upland species. The pattern is slightly blurred in the cod species because, being adaptable and successful fish, Murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats, while the now endangered trout cod stray (or did stray, before their decline) well down the upland/lowland transition zone, {{which can be}} extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the basic pattern of <b>speciation</b> into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present.|$|E
5|$|One type of {{sympatric}} <b>speciation</b> involves crossbreeding of {{two related}} species {{to produce a}} new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it {{is more common in}} plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form polyploids. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each parent's chromosomes are represented by a pair already. An example of such a <b>speciation</b> event is when the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica. This happened about 20,000 years ago, and the <b>speciation</b> process has been repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. Indeed, chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation, as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This article {{deals with}} the {{theoretical}} size distribution (of number of sub-taxa) of a fossil taxon arising from a simple null model of macroevolution. Model New species arise through <b>speciations</b> occurring independently and at random at a fixed probability rate, while extinctions either occur independently and at random (background extinctions) or cataclysmically. In addition new genera are assumed to arise through <b>speciations</b> of a very radical nature, again assumed to occur independently and at random at a fixed probability rate. Conclusion The size distributions of the pioneering genus (following a cataclysm) and of derived genera are determined. Also {{the distribution of the}} number of genera is considered along with a comparison of the probability of a monospecific genus with that of a monogeneric family. </p...|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} being a basal taeniodont, Schowalteria is fairly derived, perhaps more so than later taenidonts. It shares with them similar <b>speciations</b> towards {{herbivory}} and possibly fossoriality, but unlike them it also possesses evidence of transverse (ungulate-like) mastication, making it even more specialised towards processing vegetation.|$|R
40|$|Without {{studying}} {{the causes of}} the F/F boundary mass extinction, the precise analysis of ostracod species shows evolutionary process only discernable it the global scale. About 75 % of ail species disappeared in the Uppermost Frasnian in all studied regions of the world. Others survived, with some geographic changes, owing to littoral refuges (Lazarus effect). Deep benthic ostracods seem almost untouched by this event. We show that new post-event species resulted front allopatric <b>speciations</b> by migration between neritic provinces or along continental slopes towards deeper environments. During the event, surviving lineages show a continuous gradation from unscathed species to chronocline species, to phyletic subspeciations or <b>speciations</b> (=pseudo-extinctions) and even to new genera. The durability of lineages is controlled by the migration of populations. (C) 1999 Academie des sciences...|$|R
5|$|<b>Speciation</b> {{requires}} {{a degree of}} reproductive isolation—that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic {{to the concept of}} a species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution of reproductive isolation, a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in allopatric <b>speciation</b> with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. E. B. Poulton realized in 1903 that reproductive isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create reproductive isolation, leading to the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of <b>speciation</b> directly.|$|E
5|$|The Colias eurytheme and C. philodice {{butterflies}} {{have retained}} enough genetic compatibility to produce viable hybrid offspring. Hybrid <b>speciation</b> may have produced the diverse Heliconius butterflies, {{but that is}} disputed.|$|E
