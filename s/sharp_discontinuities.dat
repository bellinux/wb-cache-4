5|$|In 1828 Alexandre Brongniart's son, the {{botanist}} Adolphe Brongniart, {{published the}} introduction to a longer work {{on the history of}} fossil plants. Adolphe Brongniart concluded that the history of plants could roughly be divided into four parts. The first period was characterized by cryptogams. The second period was characterized by the appearance of the conifers. The third period brought emergence of the cycads, and the fourth by the development of the flowering plants (such as the dicotyledons). The transitions between each of these periods was marked by <b>sharp</b> <b>discontinuities</b> in the fossil record, with more gradual changes within the periods. Brongniart's work is the foundation of paleobotany and reinforced the theory that life on earth had a long and complex history, and different groups of plants and animals made their appearances in successive order. It also supported the idea that the Earth's climate had changed over time as Brongniart concluded that plant fossils showed that during the Carboniferous the climate of Northern Europe must have been tropical.|$|E

Overall, they found only a low level of genetic differentiation between subpopulations, and differences which did exist were characterised by a strong continent-wide correlation between geographic and genetic distance. In addition, they found that diversity was greatest in southern Europe due a larger effective population size and/or population expansion from southern to northern Europe. The researchers take this observation to imply that genetically, Europeans are not distributed into discrete populations.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>sharp</b> regression <b>discontinuity</b> design, a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (FRDD) {{does not require a}} <b>sharp</b> <b>discontinuity</b> in the probability of assignment but is applicable as long as the probability of assignment is different.

30|$|In {{this section}} we {{describe}} the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the phase field method for brittle fracture proposed in [17, 22].

5000|$|Any signal with an {{impulsive}} autocorrelation can be {{used for}} this purpose, but signals with high crest factor, such as the impulse itself, produce impulse responses with poor signal-to-noise ratio. It's commonly assumed that the MLS would then be the ideal signal, as it consists of only full-scale values and its digital crest factor is the minimum, 0 dB. [...] However, after analog reconstruction, the <b>sharp</b> <b>discontinuities</b> in the signal produce strong intersample peaks, degrading the crest factor by 4-8 dB or more, increasing with signal length, making it worse than a sine sweep. [...] Other signals have been designed with minimal crest factor, though it's unknown if it can be improved beyond 3 dB.|$|E

50|$|To {{summarize}} {{in other}} terms: The resonance {{is a form}} of digital hard sync, composed of a sine wave at the resonant frequency, amplitude enveloped by and hard-synced to a window function at the fundamental frequency. The window function can take various shapes, including sawtooth and triangle, thus determining the 'basal' spectrum upon which the resonant effect is superimposed. Since the amplitude of all available window functions ends at zero, this removes <b>sharp</b> <b>discontinuities</b> in the synced sine wave, which is a well-known way to reduce aliasing in digital sync. However, some aliasing is still present due to discontinuities in the function's derivatives. Thus, filter sweep effects are generated the same way as sync effects: by modulating the frequency of the resonance (DCW envelope), the timbre changes, adding and subtracting harmonics to/from the chosen fundamental spectrum around the chosen resonant frequency.|$|E

5000|$|Carl Sargent {{reviewed}} Wilderness Survival Guide for White Dwarf No. 85, {{stating that}} a good wilderness adventure rulebook is hard to write, {{because of the lack}} of <b>sharp</b> <b>discontinuities</b> as opposed to dungeon adventures, although [...] "Mohan has pulled it off brilliantly." [...] Sargent called the weather system [...] "splendid", and felt that the rules on encumbrance and movement rates [...] "make sense and work easily". He noted some odd details, such as a draft horse being able to carry 80% of the load of an elephant, and the fact that druids gain wilderness proficiencies slower than any other class. However, he felt that [...] "for every error there are a dozen good points of details; the WSG gets proficiency checks 'right', correcting a major DSG error". He felt that the book provides valuable material not only for AD&D, but for any D&D, RuneQuest, or Middle-earth Role Playing game master. Sargent praised Kim Mohan's writing style, calling the book [...] "the best written rulebook I've ever read; indeed, for style and content the WSG is the best AD&D book to date". Sargent concluded his review by stating, [...] "This book will revolutionize wilderness adventuring. It makes the wilderness more challenging, dangerous and exciting than almost any dungeon … Simply, the Wilderness Survival Guide is absolutely terrific.” ...|$|E
5000|$|This is an {{iterative}} CT reconstruction algorithm with edge-preserving TV regularization {{to reconstruct}} CT images from highly undersampled data obtained at low dose CT through low current levels (milliampere). In {{order to reduce}} the imaging dose, one of the approaches used is {{to reduce the number of}} x-ray projections acquired by the scanner detectors. However, this insufficient projection data which is used to reconstruct the CT image can cause streaking artifacts. Furthermore, using these insufficient projections in standard TV algorithms end up making the problem under-determined and thus leading to infinitely many possible solutions. In this method, an additional penalty weighted function is assigned to the original TV norm. This allows for easier detection of <b>sharp</b> <b>discontinuities</b> in intensity in the images and thereby adapt the weight to store the recovered edge information during the process of signal/image reconstruction. The parameter [...] controls the amount of smoothing applied to the pixels at the edges to differentiate them from the non-edge pixels. The value of [...] is changed adaptively based on the values of the histogram of the gradient magnitude so that a certain percentage of pixels have gradient values larger than [...] The edge-preserving total variation term, thus, becomes sparser and this speeds up the implementation. A two-step iteration process known as forward-backward splitting algorithm is used. The optimization problem is split into two sub-problems which are then solved with the conjugate gradient least squares method and the simple gradient descent method respectively. The method is stopped when the desired convergence has been achieved or if the maximum number of iterations is reached.|$|E
30|$|The {{remaining}} {{sources of}} high-magnitude residuals are magnetic sources that are high-magnitude {{relative to the}} remainder of the sample.

40|$|The {{single layer}} model of GPS ionospheric data {{processing}} is {{compared with the}} International Reference Ionosphere í 1990 and the attached Diffusive Equilibrium model of Plasmasphere (IRI- 90 +DEP) which {{proved to be a}} good supplement to GPS data processing. These models can be used to estimate the single layer height and to improve the mapping function in day-time. The code delays estimated from IRI- 90 +DEP models are compared with GPS measurements carried out by TurboRogue receiver. These models can be used to estimate the preliminary receiver biases {{especially in the case of}} cross-correlation tracking mode. The practical drawback of the IRI- 90 model is the <b>sharp</b> <b>discontinuity</b> of the ion components during sunset and sunrise at an elevation of 1000 km, because it also causes a <b>sharp</b> <b>discontinuity</b> in the TEC values computed from the DEP model.

50|$|Once {{sufficiently}} powerful marine motors {{had been}} developed to allow powerboats to plane, {{it was found that}} the flat underside of a chined boat provided maximum hydrodynamic lift, while the <b>sharp</b> <b>discontinuity</b> at the chine enabled spray to be deflected away as opposed to riding up the sides of the boat.

5000|$|Whilst haploid markers such as mtDNA and Y-DNA {{can provide}} clues about past {{population}} history, they only represent a single genetic locus, compared {{to hundreds of}} thousands present in nuclear, autosomes. Although autosomal analyses often sample a small number of Bulgarians, by multiple autosomes multiple ancestral lines may be traced by an individual's 21 autosomes as opposed to one identical mtDNA or Y DNA sex chromosome, whose inheritance although clinal, demonstrates genetic drift often in statistics. Analyses of autosomal DNA markers gives the best approximation of overall 'relatedness' between populations, presenting a less skewed genetic picture compared to Y DNA haplogroups. This atDNA data shows that there are no <b>sharp</b> <b>discontinuities</b> or clusters within the European population. Rather there exists a genetic gradient, running mostly in a southeast to northwest direction. A study compared all Slavic nations and combined all lines of evidence, autosomal, maternal and paternal, including more than 6000 people for and at least 700 Bulgarians from previous studies, of which 13 were used for autosomal analysis (right image). The overall data situates the southeastern group (Bulgarians and Macedonians) in a cluster with Romanians, and they are at similar proximity to Gagauzes, Montenegrins and Serbs who are not part of another cluster but are described as 'in between' clusters. Macedonians and Romanians consistingly keep being among most related to Bulgarians by au, mt, and Y-DNA a conclusion backed also by a pan-European autosomal study investigating 500,568 SNP (loci) of 1,387 Europeans and including 1 or 2 Bulgarians, other more or less extensive data sets situate Bulgarians and Romanians as their nearest [...] Per HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies Bulgarians are also in a cluster with the same populations. The Balto-Slavic study itself calculated genetic distance by SNP data of the multiple autosomes and ranked most proximal to Bulgarians the Serbs, followed by Macedonians, Montenegrins, Romanians, Gagauzes, Macedonian Greeks apart from Thessaloniki, the rest of the South Slavs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs, and then by Greeks from Thessaloniki, Central Greece and Peloponese. The East Slavs and Poles cluster together remaining less proximal to Bulgarians than Germans, among whom Slav admixture is also observed. Balts, however, according to the PCA analysis are less proximal to Bulgarians than Italians for example are. Bulgarians are also only modestly close to their eastern neighbours - the Anatolian Turks, suggesting the presence of certain geographic and cultural barriers between them. Despite various invasions of Altaic-speaking peoples in Europe, no significant impact from such Asian descent is recorded throughout southern and central Europe.|$|E
