5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while <b>soda-lime</b> <b>glass</b> has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E

25|$|Sodium {{borosilicate}} glass, Pyrex: silica + boron trioxide (B2O3) + soda (Na2O) + alumina (Al2O3). Stands {{heat expansion}} {{much better than}} window glass. Used for chemical glassware, cooking glass, car head lamps, etc. Borosilicate glasses (e.g. Pyrex, Duran) have as main constituents silica and boron trioxide. They have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25/°C as compared to about 9/°C for a typical <b>soda-lime</b> <b>glass),</b> making them more dimensionally stable. The lower {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) also makes them less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion, thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock. They are commonly used for reagent bottles, optical components and household cookware.|$|E
25|$|Addition of lead(II) oxide lowers melting point, lowers {{viscosity}} of the melt, {{and increases}} refractive index. Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides {{and is used}} in colored glasses. The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glasses); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders. The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than <b>soda-lime</b> <b>glass</b> (108.5 vs 106.5Ω⋅cm, DC at 250°C).

25|$|Most ceramic {{materials}} are almost entirely immune to corrosion. The strong chemical bonds that hold them together leave very little free chemical {{energy in the}} structure; they {{can be thought of}} as already corroded. When corrosion does occur, it is almost always a simple dissolution of the material or chemical reaction, rather than an electrochemical process. A common example of corrosion protection in ceramics is the lime added to <b>soda-lime</b> <b>glass</b> to reduce its solubility in water; though it is not nearly as soluble as pure sodium silicate, normal glass does form sub-microscopic flaws when exposed to moisture. Due to its brittleness, such flaws cause a dramatic reduction in the strength of a glass object during its first few hours at room temperature.|$|E

2500|$|Fused quartz is a glass {{made from}} chemically-pure silica. It has {{excellent}} resistance to thermal shock, {{being able to}} survive immersion in water while red hot.

The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (CaO, calcium oxide, generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a <b>soda-lime</b> <b>glass.</b> Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} microstructures of several glasses by {{measuring}} the Young's modulus and internal friction {{as a function of}} temperature, using the impulse excitation technique (IET). IET is based on the analysis of the resonant vibration of a solid material sample, induced by an impulse excitation. IET determines the mechanical resonant frequencies (f(x)) from which the elastic moduli can be calculated, and for each f(x) the corresponding internal friction (Q(- 1)). It was found that the stiffness of quartz and borosilicate glasses increases with temperature. The stiffness of <b>soda-lime</b> and alumino-silicate <b>glasses</b> decreases with the increase of temperature. The change of stiffness of quartz and aluminosilicate glasses during heat-treatment is reversible, but that of borosilicate and <b>soda-lime</b> <b>glasses</b> is not. Explanations for the irreversibility are suggested based on the Q (1) -features of the glasses. Diffusion of network modifier ions in the glass network holes is proposed to cause a non-reversible stiffness change, whereas localised anelastic relaxation of network modifier ions leads to a reversible stiffness change.

2500|$|Ordinary <b>soda-lime</b> <b>glass</b> appears colorless to {{the naked}} eye when it is thin, {{although}} iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3) additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide.

2500|$|The {{addition}} of lead oxide to potash glass also reduces its viscosity, rendering it more fluid than ordinary soda glass above softening temperature (about [...] ), with a working point of [...] The viscosity of glass varies radically with temperature, {{but that of}} lead glass is roughly 100 times {{less than that of}} ordinary soda glasses across working temperature ranges (up to [...] ). From the glassmaker’s perspective, this results in two practical developments. First, lead glass may be worked at a lower temperature, leading to its use in enamelling, and second, clear vessels may be made free from trapped air bubbles with considerably less difficulty than with ordinary glasses, allowing the manufacture of perfectly clear, flawless objects. When tapped, lead crystal makes a ringing sound, unlike ordinary glasses. Consumers still rely on this property to distinguish it from cheaper glasses. Since the potassium ions are bound more tightly in a lead-silica matrix than in a <b>soda-lime</b> <b>glass,</b> the former when struck absorbs more energy. This causes the lead crystal to oscillate, thereby producing its characteristic sound. Lead also increases the solubility of tin, copper, and antimony, leading to its use in colored enamels and glazes. The low viscosity of lead glass melt is the reason for typically high lead oxide content in the glass solders.|$|E

No heat treatment was done, to apply this method to cover real historical glasses, which could be irreversibly damaged by high temperature. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary ions mass spectrometry analyses show that the films present an almost homogeneous in depth distribution of calcium or magnesium. Magnesium adsorbed films also present a decrease of free non-bridging oxygen (SiOH groups). By atomic force microscopy it was observed that the average roughness is low (around 10 AA).
