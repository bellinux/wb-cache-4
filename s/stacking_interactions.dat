5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base <b>stacking</b> <b>interactions,</b> which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E

The binding of rimonabant involves direct aromatic <b>stacking</b> <b>interactions</b> between its 2,4-dichlorophenyl ring and the Trp279/Phe200/Trp356 residues {{on the one}} side and the para-chlorophenyl ring and the Tyr275/Trp255/Phe278 residues on the other side. The lipophilic piperidinyl moiety fits nicely in a cavity formed by the amino acid residues Val196/Phe170/Leu387 and Met384 (Figure 4).|$|E
25|$|Exciplexes {{provide one}} of the 3 dynamic {{mechanisms}} by which fluorescence is quenched. A regular exciplex has some charge-transfer (CT) character, and in the extreme case there are distinct radical ions with unpaired electrons. If the unpaired electrons can spin-pair to form a covalent bond, then the covalent bonding interaction can lower {{the energy of the}} charge transfer state. Strong CT stabilisation has been shown to lead to a conical intersection of this exciplex state with the ground state in a balance of steric effects, electrostatic interactions, <b>stacking</b> <b>interactions,</b> and relative conformations that can determine the formation and accessibility of bonded exciplexes.|$|E

30|$|Here, we {{have shown}} a model for {{plausible}} intermolecular interactions where the benzene ring of the benzyl groups shows π-π <b>stacking</b> <b>interaction</b> with the benzene ring of the benzyl group of another dipeptide. The hydrogen bonding occurs between the N-H of the amide group and the oxygen atom of the backbone carbonyl. The importance of hydrogen bonds and π-π <b>stacking</b> <b>interaction</b> {{in the formation of}} nanotubes has been recognized and emphasized in the literature. It was pointed out that the formation of the hydrogen bonds is the necessary controlling factor in the formation of cylindrical shape. In this present system, the assembled phenyl rings could generate the possibilities of π-π <b>stacking</b> <b>interaction</b> between the nearby dipeptide, which leads to the circular ring of the self-assemblies, though no β-sheet structure formed in solution phase.

25|$|Two common motifs {{involving}} coaxial stacking are kissing {{loops and}} pseudoknots. In kissing loop interactions, the single-stranded loop regions of two hairpins interact through base pairing, forming a composite, coaxially stacked helix. Notably, this structure allows {{all of the}} nucleotides in each loop to participate in base-pairing and <b>stacking</b> <b>interactions.</b> This motif was visualized and studied using NMR analysis by Lee and Crothers. The pseudoknot motif occurs when a single stranded region of a hairpin loop basepairs with an upstream or downstream sequence within the same RNA strand. The two resulting duplex regions often stack upon one another, forming a stable coaxially stacked composite helix. One example of a pseudoknot motif is the highly stable Hepatitis Delta virus ribozyme, in which the backbone shows an overall double pseudoknot topology.|$|E

2500|$|... “Tetraloop {{receptor}} motifs” are long-range tertiary interactions [...] {{consisting of}} hydrogen bonding between the bases in the tetraloop to stemloop sequences in distal sections of the secondary RNA structure. [...] In addition to hydrogen bonding, <b>stacking</b> <b>interactions</b> are {{an important component of}} these tertiary interactions. [...] For example, in GNRA-tetraloop interactions, the second nucleotide of the tetraloop stacks directly on an A-platform motif (see above) within the receptor. [...] The sequence of the tetraloop and its receptor often covary so that the same type of tertiary contact can be made with different isoforms of the tetraloop and its cognate receptor.|$|E
2500|$|When Kevlar is spun, the {{resulting}} fiber has a tensile strength of about 3,620 MPa, and a relative density of 1.44. [...] The polymer owes its high strength {{to the many}} inter-chain bonds. These inter-molecular hydrogen bonds form between the carbonyl groups and NH centers. [...] Additional strength is derived from aromatic <b>stacking</b> <b>interactions</b> between adjacent strands. These interactions have a greater influence on Kevlar than the van der Waals interactions and chain length that typically influence the properties of other synthetic polymers and fibers such as Dyneema. The presence of salts and certain other impurities, especially calcium, could interfere with the strand interactions and care is taken to avoid inclusion in its production. Kevlar's structure consists of relatively rigid molecules which tend to form mostly planar sheet-like structures rather like silk protein.|$|E

2500|$|This unfortunate lack of scope would {{eventually}} be overcome largely because of two major advancements in nucleic acid research: the identification of ribozymes, {{and the ability to}} produce them via in vitro transcription. [...] Subsequent to Tom Cech's publication implicating the Tetrahymena group I intron as an autocatalytic ribozyme, and Sidney Altman's report of catalysis by ribonuclease P RNA, several other catalytic RNAs were identified in the late 1980s, including the hammerhead ribozyme. [...] In 1994, McKay et al. published the structure of a 'hammerhead RNA-DNA ribozyme-inhibitor complex' at 2.6 Ångström resolution, in which the autocatalytic activity of the ribozyme was disrupted via binding to a DNA substrate. [...] In addition to the advances being made in global structure determination via crystallography, the early 1990s also saw the implementation of NMR as a powerful technique in RNA structural biology. [...] Investigations such as this enabled a more precise characterization of the base pairing and base <b>stacking</b> <b>interactions</b> which stabilized the global folds of large RNA molecules.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the advances being made in global structure determination via crystallography, the early 1990s also saw the implementation of NMR as a powerful technique in RNA structural biology. [...] Coincident with the large-scale ribozyme structures being solved crystallographically, a number of structures of small RNAs and RNAs complexed with drugs and peptides were solved using NMR. In addition, NMR was now being used to investigate and supplement crystal structures, as exemplified by the determination of an isolated tetraloop-receptor motif structure published in 1997. Investigations such as this enabled a more precise characterization of the base pairing and base <b>stacking</b> <b>interactions</b> which stabilized the global folds of large RNA molecules. [...] The importance of understanding RNA tertiary structural motifs was prophetically well described by Michel and Costa in their publication identifying the tetraloop motif: [...] "..it should not {{come as a surprise}} if self-folding RNA molecules were to make intensive use of only a relatively small set of tertiary motifs. [...] Identifying these motifs would greatly aid modeling enterprises, which will remain essential as long as the crystallization of large RNAs remains a difficult task".|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Walter and Turner {{determined}} the free energy contributions of nearest neighbor <b>stacking</b> <b>interactions</b> within a helix-helix interface {{by using a}} model system that created a helix-helix interface between a short oligomer and a four-nucleotide overhang {{at the end of a}} hairpin stem [...] Their experiments confirmed that the thermodynamic contribution of base-stacking between two helical secondary structures closely mimics the thermodynamics of standard duplex formation (nearest neighbor interactions predict the thermodynamic stability of the resulting helix). The relative stability of nearest neighbor interactions can be used to predict favorable coaxial stacking based on known secondary structure. Walter and Turner found that, on average, prediction of RNA structure improved from 67% to 74% accuracy when coaxial stacking contributions were included. Turner and colleagues later used an explicit quantification of stacking based on x-ray crystal structure databases to define such stacking and study kinetics in molecular dynamics simulations. [...] Theories of coaxial stacking can be tested using the technique of helical fusion. This approach was used by Murphy and Cech to confirm a coaxial stacking interaction between the P4 and P6 helices within the catalytic center of the Tetrahymena group I intron.|$|E

Although {{this is the}} traditionally used approach, it has limitations. There are still no reliable models that describe the gelation {{for all kinds of}} organogelators in all media. An alternate approach is to promote self-assembly by triggering changes in intermolecular interactions, i.e. cis-trans isomerization, hydrogen bonding, donor-acceptor π-π <b>stacking</b> <b>interaction,</b> electrostatic interactions etc. Matsumoto et al. and Hirst et al. have reported gelation using light-induced isomerization and by incorporating additives into the system to influence molecular packing, respectively.|$|R

2500|$|In the mid-1960s, {{the role}} of tRNA in protein {{synthesis}} was being intensively studied. [...] At this point, ribosomes had been implicated in protein synthesis, {{and it had been}} shown that an mRNA strand was necessary for the formation of these structures. [...] In a 1964 publication, Warner and Rich showed that ribosomes active in protein synthesis contained tRNA molecules bound at the A and P sites, and discussed the notion that these molecules aided in the peptidyl transferase reaction. However, despite considerable biochemical characterization, the structural basis of tRNA function remained a mystery. [...] In 1965, Holley et al. purified and sequenced the first tRNA molecule, initially proposing that it adopted a cloverleaf structure, based largely on the ability of certain regions of the molecule to form stem loop structures. The isolation of tRNA proved to be the first major windfall in RNA structural biology. [...] Following Robert W. Holley's publication, numerous investigators began work on isolation tRNA for crystallographic study, developing improved methods for isolating the molecule as they worked. [...] By 1968 several groups had produced tRNA crystals, but these proved to be of limited quality and did not yield data at the resolutions necessary to determine structure. In 1971, Kim et al. achieved another breakthrough, producing crystals of yeast tRNAPHE that diffracted to 2-3 Ångström resolutions by using spermine, a naturally occurring polyamine, which bound to and stabilized the tRNA. [...] Despite having suitable crystals, however, the structure of tRNAPHE was not immediately solved at high resolution; rather it took pioneering work in the use of heavy metal derivatives and a good deal more time to produce a high-quality density map of the entire molecule. [...] In 1973, Kim et al. produced a 4 Ångström map of the tRNA molecule in which they could unambiguously trace the entire backbone. [...] This solution would be followed by many more, as various investigators worked to refine the structure and thereby more thoroughly elucidate the details of base pairing and <b>stacking</b> <b>interactions,</b> and validate the published architecture of the molecule.|$|E
