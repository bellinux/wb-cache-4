Based on Social Code Book III, §  10 (‘Freie Förderung’; hereafter ‘discretionary measures’), local employment agencies were allowed to administer locally specialized programs. This strategy partly deviated from the generally centralized German labor market policy. In general, the discretionary measures offered a framework that allowed employment agencies to concentrate on <b>special</b> <b>industries</b> or target <b>groups</b> and permitted them to address specific regional problems.
