The Jewish community in Atlanta was the largest in the Southern United States, and the Franks belonged to a cultured and philanthropic <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge. Although the Southern United States was not specifically known for its antisemitism, Frank's northern culture and Jewish faith added to the sense that he was different.|$|E
5|$|An infant's <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> {{relates to}} his or her later {{language}} development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E

The framework is general enough to analyse both non- cooperative and cooperative games. We identify a number of shortcomings of existing solution concepts that are used for <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> and propose a new concept called social rationalizability. The concept aims to identify the consequences of common knowledge of rationality and farsightedness within the framework of <b>social</b> <b>environments.</b> The set of socially rationalizable outcomes is shown to be non-empty for all <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> and it can be computed by an iterative reduction procedure. We introduce a definition of coalitional rationality for <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> and show that it is satisfied by social rationalizability. ...|$|R

The paper is concerned with the particular role of <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> for brand communities previously neglected in literature. Grounded in a social-constructivist interpretive framework, a multi-perspective study was conducted to explore how the HUMMER brand community and its <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> discursively construct, situate, and legitimate one another. Findings reveal brand communities as powerful, socially embedded phenomena that continuously negotiate a set of core distinctions with and against their <b>social</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R
5|$|Multifactorial sex {{determination}} occurs in numerous Neotropical species and involves both XY and ZW systems. Multifactorial systems involve rearrangements of sex chromosomes and autosomes. For example, the darter characine has a ZW multifactorial system where the female {{is determined by}} ZW1W2 and the male by ZZ. The wolf fish has a XY multifactorial system where females are determined by X1X1X2X2 and the male by X1X2Y. Some teleosts, such as zebrafish, have a polyfactorial system, where there are several genes which {{play a role in}} determining sex. Environment-dependent {{sex determination}} has been documented in at least 70 species of teleost. Temperature is the main factor, but PH levels, growth rate, density and <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> may also play a role. For the Atlantic silverside, spawning in colder waters creates more females, while warmer waters create more males.|$|E
5|$|Large green-head ant colonies exhibit age caste polyethism, {{where the}} younger workers act as nurses {{and tend to}} the brood and the older workers go out and forage. In smaller colonies, age caste polyethism does not occur, with nursing and {{foraging}} initiated by both younger and older workers. These results show that ageing is not the mechanism that drives labour among colonies. The emergence of age polyethism in larger colonies {{is a result of}} worker specialisation. Workers in small colonies usually tend to the brood much more than those in larger colonies, but {{this is due to the}} differentiated <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> between small and large societies. In contrast, old workers from large colonies forage for significant periods of time, and those in small colonies forage less. A predatory species such as the green-head ant may not be able to increase prey retrieval within its environment, even if there is a larger foraging force. This means that the workers may have to spend more time foraging to retrieve any prey item. Contact among nestmates also differs between small and large colonies, strongly suggesting that colony size regulates contact rates. Higher contact rates allow colonies to scan their environment and determine their needs more quickly, which makes a colony react faster. Task allocation patterns (referring to the way that tasks are chosen) are different in small and large colonies, which may determine the contact rate.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{emotional}} approach coping may {{signal to the}} <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> that an individual {{is in need of}} support. The responsiveness of the <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> will determine the adaptiveness {{of emotional}} approach coping. Emotional expression that is met with empathetic concern may lead to better adjustment than emotional expression met by rejection. Some evidence from the research suggests this could be a potential mechanism. For women with breast cancer who perceive their <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> to be highly receptive, coping through emotional expression predicts improved quality of life.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that former foster care youth are at risk for poor outcomes (e. g., more problem behaviors, more depression, lower self-esteem, and poor social relationships). It is not clear, however, whether these findings reflect preemancipation developmental deficits. This study used 163 preemancipation foster care youth and a matched sample of 163 comparison youth. Results showed that foster-care youth did not differ from the comparison sample on measures of well-being, including depressed mood, problem behavior, and self-esteem. Foster care youth reported higher levels of work orientation, but lower levels of academic achievement, aspirations, and expectations. In addition, compared to the matched sample, foster care youth perceived better <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> with respect to their important nonparental adults (VIPs) and peers, but poorer <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> relating to their parents. These differences in <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> may have offset each other and resulted in similar levels of psychological well-being for the two groups of youth. Regression analyses further showed that <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> were linked to selected adolescent outcomes, and nonparental VIPs were especially important for the foster care sample. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc...|$|R

Similarly, a 1972 ground-breaking study by Oscar Newman on a Defensible Space Theory described {{ways to improve the}} <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> and security of neighbourhoods and streets. In a practical application of his theory at Five Oaks, the neighbourhood's grid pattern was modified to prevent through traffic and create identifiable smaller enclaves while maintaining complete pedestrian freedom of movement. The positive outcome of these changes reinforces Appleyard's findings and the need to reduce or prevent through traffic on neighbourhood streets; a need that cannot be met with a typical, uniform, open grid.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} how {{the questions and}} concepts used in social communications research affect data collection. It begins by offering conceptual definitions of two types of <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> – networks and contexts – {{that are used to}} define the boundaries of the field and to highlight its diversity. From this starting point, the implications of these definitions for three methodological issues are discussed: 1) choosing an environmental unit of analysis, 2) selecting cases of <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> for inclusion in a study, and 3) establishing causality. The organizing theme of this chapter is that social communications research is best served by focusing on deep measurement of <b>social</b> <b>environments.</b> Although this advice has the consequence of slowing the development of a unified research program, it prioritizes better measurement and conceptual development that will place the subfield on solid footing...|$|R

40|$|Neighborhood environments {{have been}} {{associated}} with a variety of health outcomes, but much of the existing research has relied on cross-sectional data or used non-specific measures of the neighborhood. This dissertation uses longitudinal data on specific measures of neighborhood physical and <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to explore how neighborhood environments change over time and how specific neighborhood environments affect blood pressure. The first analysis investigated how changes in four survey-based measures of neighborhood environments (availability of healthy food, walking <b>environment,</b> <b>social</b> cohesion, and safety) were patterned by area socio-demographic characteristics (area socioeconomic status [SES], percentage of Black residents, and percentage of Hispanic residents). After adjusting for individual-level characteristics, we found that lower SES neighborhoods and neighborhoods with more minority residents generally had poorer physical and <b>social</b> <b>environments,</b> and that these disparities were stable or increasing over time. The second analysis used proportional hazards models to explore neighborhood physical and <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> in relation to incident hypertension using survey-based measures of neighborhood environments and GIS-based measures of the density of favorable food stores and recreational activity resources. After adjustment for individual and neighborhood-level covariates, one standard deviation higher healthy food availability was associated with a 12 % lower rate of hypertension (HR = 0. 88, 95 % CI 0. 82 - 0. 95); other neighborhood environment measures were not related to incidence of hypertension. The third analysis used linear mixed models to describe how neighborhood survey- and GIS-based measures of physical and <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> were associated with baseline levels and changes over time in systolic blood pressure (SBP). Using imputed values for SBPs influenced by antihypertensive medication use, we found that better neighborhood food and physical activity environments were associated with lower SBPs at baseline, while better neighborhood <b>social</b> <b>environments</b> were associated with higher SBPs at baseline. There was little evidence that neighborhood environments affected SBP trajectories over time. The results of this dissertation add new evidence on the way that neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics relate to neighborhood physical and <b>social</b> <b>environments,</b> and how those environments affect cardiovascular health; these results may shape interventions to reduce social disparities in health...|$|R
