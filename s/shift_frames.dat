40|$|This paper {{considers}} the uplink pilot overhead {{in a time}} division duplexing (TDD) massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) mobile systems. A common scenario of conventional massive MIMO systems is a Base Station (BS) serving all user terminals (UTs) in the cell with the same TDD frame format that fits the coherence interval of the worst-case scenario of user mobility (e. g. a moving train with velocity 300 Km/s). Furthermore, the BS has to estimate all the channels each time-slot for all users even for those with long coherence intervals. In fact, within the same cell, sensors or pedestrian with low mobility UTs (e. g. moving 1. 38 m/s) share the same short TDD frame and thus are obliged to upload their pilots each time-slot. The channel coherence interval of the pedestrian UTs with a carrier frequency of 1. 9 GHz can be as long as 60 {{times that of the}} train passenger users. In other words, conventional techniques waste 59 -uploaded pilot sequences for channel estimation. In this paper, we are aware of the resources waste due to various coherence intervals among different user mobility. We classify users based on their coherence interval length, and we propose to skip uploading pilots of UTs with large coherence intervals. Then, we <b>shift</b> <b>frames</b> with the same pilot reused sequence toward an empty pilot time-slot.

40|$|The primary {{translation}} {{products of}} retroviral pol genes are polyproteins initiated in an upstream gene (gag). To investigate {{the manner in}} which the gag-initiated polyproteins of the mouse mammary tumor virus are produced, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1. 8 -kilobase DNA fragment that spans the region between gag and pol in the C 3 H strain of mouse mammary tumor virus. The sequence reveals three overlapping open reading frames: the first encodes products of gag (p 27 gag and p 14 gag); the second encodes a protein domain of unknown function (termed X) that is highly related to a similarly positioned sequence in simian type D retroviruses and the viral protease (pro); and the third encodes the reverse transcriptase. The reading frames are organized to permit uninterrupted readthrough from gag to pol if ribosomal frameshifts occur in the - 1 direction within each of the two overlapping regions, one of which is 16 nucleotides in length and the other 13 nucleotides. Cell-free translation of RNA containing these overlap regions shows that fusion of the reading frames by ribosomal frameshifting occurs efficiently: about one-fourth of the ribosomes traversing the gag-X/pro overlap and one-tenth traversing the X/pro-pol overlap <b>shift</b> <b>frames,</b> generating gag-related polyproteins in ratios similar to those observed in vivo.

40|$|This {{multiple}} {{case study}} focused on the lives and experiences of four women who participated in an adult literacy program. This case study approach used critical ethnography as an analytic tool employing grounded theory leading {{to the development of}} a substantive theory. In-depth, semi-structured interviews and researcher 2 ̆ 7 s reflective journal were employed to collect data for this study that critically examined the impact of the transformative process of its participants and its influence on their socio-cultural context. Results revealed that participants did not necessarily experience a disorienting dilemma as contended by Mezirow (1978, 1991, and 2000). Rather participants experienced a series of integrating circumstances that led to the transformative experience. Moreover, the study indicated that unlike Mezirow 2 ̆ 7 s assumption that individuals need to have a high cognitive or educational level to experience a transformation these participants with little or no education experienced a transformation. Overall, the purpose of this study was to generate grounded theory on the impact of the transformative experience on the participants and their socio-cultural context. From the findings of the study, a substantive theory emerged revealing profound changes: a metamorphosis. Thus, the substantive theory is: Metamorphosis: Given the opportunity to <b>shift</b> <b>frames</b> of reference, one has the innate capacity to alter one 2 ̆ 7 s life and impact one 2 ̆ 7 s socio-cultural context creating possibilities for self and others. In light of this, all participants related experiences that reflect the core elements of transformative learning as first posited by Mezirow. These elements included exploration of new roles or actions, self-confidence in new roles, development of a plan of action and reintegration into life based on their new frames of reference. Major themes that emerged from the data are self-esteem and assertiveness, discovery of self, great personal sacrifice, development of sense of possibility for self and family, beliefs and values, increased spirituality, self-sufficiency, role model, opportunity for social action. As the women became empowered, the changes affected their socio-cultural context resulting in changes with their children, family and community. Finally, this study has far-reaching implications for policy-makers and practitioners in particular for strategic improvement of life for low-income families and family relationships.

40|$|This {{research}} {{responds to}} calls {{for the establishment of}} an overriding rationale, or raison d'être, for public relations practice. Several scholars are suggesting that the construct of legitimacy provides an overarching rationale that would link public relations practice across organisations, industries and countries (Boyd, 2000 ; Massey, 2001 ; Metzler, 1995, 2001 ; van Ruler & Vercic, 2005 ; Vercic, van Ruler, Butschi, & Flodin, 2001). However, existing public relations studies using legitimacy have focused on the communicative aspects, with little emphasis on long term and societal level effects for organisations. In seeking to accommodate these challenges, the central research question of this thesis is: Does legitimacy provide a rationale for public relations practice, and if so, in what ways? This study draws on institutional theory, with its central imperative of legitimacy, to address this question. Institutional theory considers the relationship between organisations and environments from a social constructionist perspective. Institutions created through the social construction of reality are based on shared, rational myths of legitimacy which drive organisational and social action, and with which organisations need to demonstrate compliance through their organisational ceremonies or practices. These two central contributors to legitimacy [...] rational myths and ceremonies [...] provide the framework guiding the study. The study was conducted around issues about the corporate social responsibility (CSR) of the four major Australian banks. In order to consider relationships between public relations practice and legitimacy as an institutional concept, Giddens' theory of structuration is used as a theoretical apparatus to straddle the rational myths of legitimacy at the level of institution, with public relations practice related to ceremonies at the level of action. 'Structuring moments' identified in media coverage provide sites of microanalysis of the intense social construction of rational myths of legitimacy that include organisations and publics. Through these theoretical devices, a number of guiding research questions shape the study: RQ i) : What is learned about the social construction of rational myths about legitimacy by studying media coverage about CSR in Australian banking? RQ ii) : What is learned about legitimacy by studying public relations practices in relation to media coverage about CSR in Australia banking? A longitudinal, qualitative, case study approach was taken to explore the research questions in this study. As legitimacy was viewed as a process of ongoing social construction, a temporal bracketing strategy (Langley, 1999) was used to examine the relationships between the level of institution and of action over the six year period of the study. Media coverage, annual and social impact reports, and interviews were used as sources of data to examine the institutionalisation of corporate social responsibility in the Australian banking industry. The findings of the study show that there is a dynamic relationship between public relations and legitimacy at both theoretical and practical levels. Through the duality of structure lens, theoretically public relations can be conceived as agency and legitimacy as structure. The influence of these two dynamically interrelated levels of agency and structure is both constituted by human agency and is the medium of the institutions (Sewell, 1992). Public relations practices, therefore, can be seen as human agency that both shapes and is shaped by legitimacy. If legitimacy represents a dominant concept of organisational success, it is also a rationale for public relations practice as an act of human agency that seeks to create alignment between organisations and publics in their environment. As such, public relations practices are not just activities. Rather, public relations practices constitute a central resource that organisations can access to exert power to create and manage their legitimacy within the broader environment. Public relations practices, therefore, are resources because they are embedded within the deep structures of society that influence organisational practice, but also are actions that allow the organisation to shape those structural arrangements. This process takes place within webs of communication and relationships between organisations and publics that form institutionalised legitimacy. This study also found that public relations practice is a balance between the demands of time and space. The traditional focus of public relations studies has been on incidents of compressed time and space, such as crises and campaigns. This study suggests that expanded periods of time and space are also integral to how and why public relations make a contribution as, over time, there were shifts to the institutional arrangements that guide public relations practices. This suggests that there is a compression of time and space as organisations and publics communicate in their relationship and an expansion of time and space to <b>shift</b> <b>frames</b> of social structures and legitimacy. It is through this juxtaposition of time and space, and across dual levels of structure, that legitimacy provides a rationale for public relations practices. The conclusions of this research make a major contribution to public relations theory by building a model for considering how legitimacy provides a raison d'être for public relations practices. As such, the model developed in this research provides a theoretical framework of how public relations practices contribute to organisational legitimacy at a societal level. The study also provides deeper insights to the role of public relations practices in managing organisational legitimacy at the level of action. In doing so, it addresses theoretical and methodological issues of the conflation of publics and environment. A number of opportunities for further research are presented by this study in understanding drivers of public relations practices and the role of inspection forums in processes of legitimacy. For practice, there are implications of taking a longer term perspective to considering the role of public relations practices, its impact on organisational success and, therefore, how it is evaluated...|$|E

The circular code in the reading frame, noted X, which can deduce the 2 other circular codes in the <b>shifted</b> <b>frames</b> by permutation, is the information used for analysing frameshift genes, i. e. genes with a change of reading frame during translation.

This second mechanism suggested that in some cases the first + 1 frame tRNA could have an active role in frameshifting. We found that overproducing this tRNA can drive frameshifting, surprisingly regardless of whether frameshifting occurs by peptidyl-tRNA slippage or out-of-frame binding of aminoacyl-tRNA.

In {{addition to}} an improved camera detective quantum efficiency, acquisition of DDD movies allows for correction of movement of the specimen, due both to instabilities in the microscope specimen stage and electron beam-induced movement. Unlike specimen stage drift, beam-induced movement is not always homogeneous within an image. Local correlation in the trajectories of nearby particles suggests that beam-induced motion is due to deformation of the ice layer. Algorithms have already been described that can correct movement for large regions of frames and for > 1 MDa protein particles. Another algorithm allows individual < 1 MDa protein particle trajectories to be estimated, but requires rolling averages to be calculated from frames and fits linear trajectories for particles. Here we describe an algorithm that allows for individual < 1 MDa particle images to be aligned without frame averaging or linear trajectories. The algorithm maximizes the overall correlation of the <b>shifted</b> <b>frames</b> with {{the sum of the}} <b>shifted</b> <b>frames.</b> The optimum in this single objective function is found efficiently by making use of analytically calculated derivatives of the function. To smooth estimates of particle trajectories, rapid changes in particle positions between frames are penalized in the objective function and weighted averaging of nearby trajectories ensures local correlation in trajectories. This individual particle motion correction, in combination with weighting of Fourier components to account for increasing radiation damage in later frames, can be used to improve 3 -D maps from single particle cryo-EM.
