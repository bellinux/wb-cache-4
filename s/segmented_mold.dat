40|$|Summary: Although nasoalveolar molding is {{commonly}} performed before cleft lip surgery, customized palatal plate availability is limited for patients {{far from a}} hospital. This case report describes a preformed extraoral nasoalveolar molding (PENAM) appliance and treatment approach for presurgical nasoalveolar molding in newborns with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate. A 12 -day-old boy presented with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate. The PENAM device was supported by an adhesive-taped upper lip, which consisted of a lip nasal stent made from a 0. 5 -mm stainless steel wire. The spring was activated monthly. The shape of the cartilaginous septum, alar cartilage tip, medial crus, lateral crus, and alveolar <b>segments</b> was <b>molded</b> to resemble the normal shape of these structures. The 9. 3 -mm alveolar gaps were reduced and approximated. The approximation mostly came from the major alveolus segment with approximately 6. 4 -mm movement. Cleft side nostril height increased 5. 5 [*]mm and deviation of the columella was corrected by 42 °. PENAM {{can be helpful in}} infants with unilateral cleft lip and palate because it has benefits for long-term forced delivery, requires less frequent activations, and is suitable for patients who live far from a hospital...|$|R
40|$|In the mid- 1990 s, NASA {{plans to}} orbit a giant telescope, whose {{aperture}} {{may be as}} great as 30 meters, for infrared and sub-millimeter astronomy. Its primary mirror will be deployed or assembled in orbit from a mosaic of possibly hundreds of mirror segments. Each segment must be shaped to precise curvature tolerances so that diffraction-limited performance will be achieved at 30 micron (nominal operating wavelength). All panels must lie within 1 micron on a theoretical surface described by the optical precipitation of the telescope's primary mirror. To attain diffraction-limited performance, the issues of alignment and/or position sensing, position control of micron tolerances, and structural, thermal, and mechanical considerations for stowing, deploying, and erecting the reflector must be resolved. Radius of curvature precision influences panel size, shape, material, and type of construction. Two superior material choices emerged: fused quartz (sufficiently homogeneous with respect to thermal expansivity to permit a thin shell substrate to be drape molded between graphite dies to a precise enough off-axis asphere for optical finishing on the as-received a segment) and a Pyrex or Duran (less expensive than quartz and formable at lower temperatures). The optimal reflector panel size is between 1 - 1 / 2 and 2 meters. Making one, two-meter mirror every two weeks requires new approaches to manufacturing off-axis parabolic or aspheric <b>segments</b> (drape <b>molding</b> on precision dies and subsequent finishing on a nonrotationally symmetric dependent machine). Proof-of-concept developmental programs were identified to prove the feasibility of the materials and manufacturing ideas...|$|R
40|$|Injection molding {{is widely}} used to {{manufacture}} plastic parts with good surface finish, dimensional stability and low cost. The common examples of parts manufactured by injection molding include toys, utensils, and casings of various electronic products. The process of mold design to generate these complex shapes is iterative and time consuming, and requires great expertise in the field. As a result, {{a significant amount of}} the final product cost {{can be attributed to the}} expenses incurred during the product’s design. After designing the <b>mold</b> <b>segments,</b> it is necessary to machine these segments with minimum cost using an efficient tool-path. The tool-path planning process also adds to the overall mold cost. The process of injection molding can be simplified and made to be more cost effective if the processes of mold design and tool-path generation can be automated. This work focuses on the automation of mold design from a given part design and the automation of tool-path generation for manufacturing <b>mold</b> <b>segments.</b> The hypothesis examined in this thesis is that the automatic identification of mold features can reduce the human efforts required to design molds. It is further hypothesised that the human effort required in many downstream processes such as mold component machining can also be reduced with algorithmic automation of otherwise time consuming decisions. Automatic design of dies and molds begins with the part design being provided as a solid model. The solid model of a part is a database of its geometry and topology. The automatic mold design process uses this database to identify an undercut-free parting direction, for recognition of mold features and identification of parting lines for a given parting direction, and for generation of entities such as parting surfaces, core, cavity and side-cores. The methods presented in this work are analytical in nature and work with the extended set of part topologies and geometries unlike those found in the literature. Moreover, the methods do not require discretizing the part geometry to design its <b>mold</b> <b>segments,</b> unlike those found in the literature that result in losing the part definition. Once the mold features are recognized and parting lines are defined, core, cavity and side-cores are generated. This work presents algorithms that recognize the entities in the part solid model that contribute to the design of the core, cavity and side-cores, extract the entities, and use them in the design of these elements. The developed algorithms are demonstrated on a variety of parts that cover a wide range of features. The work also presents a method for automatic tool-path generation that takes the designed core/cavity and produces a multi-stage tool-path to machine it from raw stock. The tool-path generation process begins by determining tool-path profiles and tool positions for the rough machining of the part in layers. Typically roughing is done with large aggressive tools to reduce the machining time; and roughing leaves uncut material. After generating a roughing tool-path for each layer, the machining is simulated and the areas left uncut are identified to generate a clean-up tool-path for smaller sized tools. The tool-path planning is demonstrated using a part having obstacles within the machining region. The simulated machining is presented in this work. This work extends the accessibility analysis by retaining the topology information and using it to recognize a larger domain of features including intersecting features, filling a void in the literature regarding a method that could recognize complex intersecting features during an automated mold design process. Using this information, a larger variety of new mold intersecting features are classified and recognized in this approach. The second major contribution of the work was to demonstrate that the downstream operations can also benefit from algorithmic decision making. This is shown by automatically generating roughing and clean-up tool-paths, while reducing the machining time by machining only those areas that have uncut material. The algorithm can handle cavities with obstacles in them. The methodology has been tested on a number of parts...|$|R
40|$|Only {{a limited}} number of {{structural}} studies have been performed on polyurethanes using scanning probe techniques to determine both the microstructure and the corresponding distribution of hard and soft segments within samples. This type of information is needed to better understand the mechanical properties of these materials and to facilitate modeling. In order to address these issues, we have fabricated a series of compression <b>molded</b> <b>segmented</b> poly(ester urethane) samples with hard (HS) to soft segment ratios from 19 to 100 %. Samples were examined using scanning probe phase imaging techniques to obtain the topography and corresponding distribution of hard domains before and after heating at 100 C. A number of significant differences were observed between the pre- and post-heat treated samples. Variations in structure and heat-induced morphological changes were directly related to HS content. Fine strand- or fibril-like structures were most prominent in the 23 and 19 % HS sample but first appeared at 30 % HS. Harder, thicker elongated structures dominated the surface of the 100 % HS sample and were seen to a limited extent on all samples, especially after annealing and quenching. The 23 % HS sample surface structure depended on quenching rate and time after treatment...|$|R
40|$|Large Area Maskless Photopolymerization (LAMP) is a {{technology}} being developed to fabricate integrally-cored ceramic molds for the investment casting of turbine airfoils. In LAMP, ultraviolet (UV) {{light in the}} form of bitmap images is projected from a spatial light modulator (SLM) onto a photocurable ceramic material system (PCMS). Exposed and unexposed regions are determined through black and white portions of the bitmaps, respectively. UV light induces photopolymerization and the formation of an insoluble solidified network. Three-dimensional structures are built layer-by-layer through sequential application and curing of PCMS layers of 100 micron thickness. To date, ceramic molds fabricated using LAMP have been successfully implemented in investment casting of single-crystal turbine airfoils without internal cooling schemes. Two particularly important challenges for the fabrication of airfoil molds with internal cooling passages are: (a) fabrication of unsupported structures in the mold geometry and; (b) mitigation of internal stresses that arise during layer-by-layer build-up due to volumetric shrinkage during photopolymerization. Unsupported geometries arise in nearly every cored airfoil mold and often in a location where support structures cannot be easily removed after fabrication. Internal stresses generated by volumetric shrinkage can lead to cracking during binder burnout (BBO), sintering and casting. This thesis aims to simultaneously address these challenges through the investigation of grayscale exposure to control the degree of monomer conversion during photopolymerization of single and multiple layers. The effective intensity of the UV light incident on the monomer system can be reduced by selectively turning off pixels within the nominally "white" or "on" regions of the projected bitmaps, effectively producing an exposure with a lower light intensity. In an effort to reduce internal stresses in the mold, the grayscale exposure can be tuned to create regions of uncured or partially cured monomer within the mold geometry to reduce the connectivity between cured regions and thus reduce the net effect of volumetric shrinkage. Grayscale exposure {{can also be used to}} generate support structures with a low degree of polymerization to create a gel state beneath and surrounding the unsupported <b>segments</b> of the <b>mold,</b> which can be washed away after completion of mold fabrication. In order to successfully utilize grayscale techniques in LAMP, the cure depth must be predicted. This is accomplished through cure depth measurements at different exposure times to develop a "working curve. " In addition, the degree of monomer conversion and its relation to cure depths resulting from grayscale exposure must be understood. Measurements of the degree of conversion are obtained through Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Empirical models are developed and compared to theoretical predictions. Also, the scattering length pixelation model is introduced as a technique to predict the light intensity distribution within the PCMS for exposure patterns at multiple length scales. Results from these grayscale investigations are then applied to LAMP and the effectiveness of grayscale to fabricate unsupported geometries and internal stresses from volumetric shrinkage is discussed.
