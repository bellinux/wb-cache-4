5|$|Even Born was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> Paul Dirac {{had been}} {{thinking}} {{along the same lines}} as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E

He is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs {{to help in the}} pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a {{dangerous}} spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on their}} {{experience}} with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous impact craters in Voyager 1s first images of Io. The density of impact craters across Io's surface would have given clues to Io's age. However, they were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> the surface was almost completely lacking in impact craters, but was instead covered in smooth plains dotted with tall mountains, pits of various shapes and sizes, and volcanic lava flows. Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io's surface was covered {{in a variety of}} colorful materials (leading Io to be compared to a rotten orange or to pizza) from various sulfurous compounds. The lack of impact craters indicated that Io's surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface; volcanic materials continuously bury craters as they are produced. This result was spectacularly confirmed as at least nine active volcanoes were observed by Voyager 1.|$|E

They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E

Original Ideals When Joachim Savelsberg first broached the question of an ASA section on the Sociology of Law, we struggled with two questions. What was its justification on its own terms? And what distinctive contribution could it make that was not already being made by the Law and Society Association, since it made no sense to duplicate functions or to compete? The answers to the first question were straightforward. After all, sociology’s theoretical tradition since the 19 th century took law seriously, perhaps most notably in Weber’s sociology of law and the economy. Echoes of this centralit...|$|R

This article tells the story of how this promise was fulfilled, but in very unexpected ways. One of the analysis students (George Boros), older than the rest and for many years a part-time instructor in the area, had finally decided to pursue a Ph. D. in mathematics. He was well known in New Orleans mathematical circles as “the person who can compute any integral. ” Having spent my graduate-student years at Courant Institute, I was comfortably unaware of integrals and did not think that this could be serious mathematics. I was wrong. At the end of the academic year this student asked me to be his adviser. I agreed but cautioned: “George, nobody is {{going to give you a}} doctorate in mathematics for computing integrals. ” His response was that he was aware of this and if I was willing to suggest a general topic for the qualifiers, he would accept my choice. At that time Henry McKean and I were in the process of writing the book [6], so I suggested that George read the manuscript and that his qualifiers be related to elliptic curves. After a successful exam it came time for a thesis problem, and when I started to suggest some possibilities, he interrupted me with: “I have my own problems. ” This was a surprise.

A debt to Tywin is a problem since, regardless of his familial relationship with the king, Tyrion fears he will not forgive the debt despite the crown's dire straits.
