5|$|Hawks's {{military}} {{records were}} {{destroyed in the}} 1973 Military Archive Fire, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> account of his military service is his own. According to Hawks, he spent 15 weeks in basic training at the University of California in Berkeley where he was trained to be a squadron commander in the air force. When Pickford visited Hawks at basic training, his superior officers were so impressed {{by the appearance of}} the celebrity that they promoted him to flight instructor and sent him to Texas to teach new recruits. Bored by this work, Hawks attempted to secure a transfer {{during the first half of}} 1918 and was eventually sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia. The Armistice was signed in November of that year, and Hawks was discharged as a Second Lieutenant without having seen active duty.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 October, Warren sighted two of the French frigates {{standing}} out of Donegal Bay and went after them, directing Moore in Melampus to stay behind to search for stragglers. Hindered by contrary winds, Melampus scoured the bay until well after nightfall, and at 23:30 {{was surprised by the}} sudden appearance directly in front of her of Immortalité and Résolue near St. John's Point. Immortalité soon spotted Melampus and made sail, but Captain Bargeau of Résolue had not seen the British ship, and was hesitant about following his compatriot in the dark. In the gloom and confusion, he mistook Melampus for Immortalité and came alongside, only realising his mistake when Melampus opened fire. Because of the heavy seas, Résolues guns had been tied down below decks, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> return fire she could offer was from her handful of quarterdeck guns. Bargeau, whose ship was still leaking badly, recognised that further resistance was futile and surrendered in minutes, having lost ten men and much of his rigging. Melampus put aboard a prize crew and then departed in pursuit of Immortalité.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{service was}} operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding {{doors at the}} ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned {{that there was nothing}} to look at in the tunnels, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, the C had no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a flat fare of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of the}} Aérotrain {{was similar}} to that of the {{magnetic}} levitation train: to suspend the train above the tracks <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> resistance is that of air resistance. Consequently, the Aérotrain could travel at very high speeds without the technical complexity and expensive tracks of magnetic levitation.|$|E
25|$|Although {{some members}} of the {{resistance}} tried to organize new political parties after the war to reshape the political order in Denmark, they were unable to do <b>so.</b> <b>The</b> <b>only</b> party that appeared to receive a significant boost from resistance was the Communist Party. The Communists received about one-eighth of the popular vote in the October 1945 elections.|$|E

25|$|However, {{it was in}} fictional {{entertainment}} {{where the}} legend of Spring-heeled Jack exerted the most extensive influence, owing to his allegedly extraordinary nature. Three pamphlet publications, purportedly based on the real events, appeared almost immediately, during January and February, 1838. They were not advertised as fiction, though they likely were at least partly <b>so.</b> <b>The</b> <b>only</b> known copies {{were reported to have}} perished when the British Library was hit during The Blitz, but their catalog still lists the first one.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the W and Z bosons was considered a major success for CERN. First, in 1973, came the observation of neutral current interactions as predicted by electroweak theory. The huge Gargamelle bubble chamber photographed the tracks of a few electrons suddenly starting to move, seemingly of their own accord. This is interpreted as a neutrino interacting with the electron by the exchange of an unseen Z boson. The neutrino is otherwise undetectable, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> observable effect is the momentum imparted to the electron by the interaction.|$|E
25|$|A hybrid form of {{coordination}} and anti-coordination is the discoordination game, where one player's incentive is to coordinate {{while the other}} player tries to avoid this.

In {{each of the four}} possible states either player 1 or player 2 are better off by switching their strategy, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Nash equilirium is mixed. The canonical example of a discoordination game is the matching pennies game.|$|E

Although his sentence was commuted to a jail sentence, Amnesty International reports that he has been tortured. A Christian lobby group says that about 300 Christians caught attending unregistered house churches were in jail in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The Mount Lowe Railway opened officially on July 4, 1893. Folks amassed {{themselves}} at the remote Mountain Junction. Up to this point {{there was only one}} means of public transportation from the valleys below to the hillside community of Altadena. It was the Los Angeles Terminal Railway which by this time was running from Terminal Island in San Pedro to Mountain Junction. The trains ran twice a day and, at that, very irregularly, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> sure means of getting to Altadena on time was by your own horse and buggy. This lack of transportation coupled with Lowe’s inability to establish any at all would be in part the downfall of the railway.|$|E
25|$|If human {{understanding}} were {{restricted to}} discursive or verbal arguments, then Plato's dialectical discussions could at most {{have reached the}} conclusion that the highest principle was demanded by his metaphysics but also that human understanding could never arrive at that transcendental Being. If <b>so,</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> remaining way that the One might be reached (and the Good, if that {{is the same as the}} One) is through the possibility of some nonverbal, 'intuitive' access. It is debated whether or not Plato in fact took this route. If he did, he thereby renounced the possibility of justifying every step made by our knowledge with philosophical arguments that can be expressed discursively in words.|$|E

25|$|After {{the match}} {{there were reports}} in the media that Australia had batted {{conservatively}} in their final 8 overs after the final re-start, to avoid losing wickets rather than maximising their numbers of runs, in belief that this would further increase the Netherlands' par score. However, if this is true, this belief was mistaken, {{in the same way}} that conserving wickets rather than maximising runs in the final 8 overs of a full 50-over innings would be a mistake. At that point the amount of resource available to each team was fixed (as long as there were no further rain interruptions), <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> undetermined number in the formula for Netherlands' par score was Australia's final score, so they should have tried to maximise this.|$|E
25|$|As a pilot project, the Trillium Line {{system was}} {{built at the}} cost of $21 million, {{relatively}} little compared with {{the hundreds of millions of}} dollars usually required to build a new transit line. It runs on an existing Canadian Pacific Railway track (Ellwood and Prescott subdivisions,) <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> construction work necessary was to build the stations themselves and the passing tracks necessary to allow trains to operate in both directions. The downside to this, however, is that much ground pollution remains from the track’s previous use. This will become a liability one day when the city has to pay to clean it up, which it has thus far avoided by not digging into the ground under the tracks.|$|E
