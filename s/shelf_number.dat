5000|$|As {{part of its}} {{inventory}} management, NSS developed [...] "NSS Stock Numbers", allowing NSS to {{more easily}} store and find items for individual films among its <b>shelves.</b> These <b>numbers</b> consisted of a two-digit number representing the year of release, followed by a slash, then a one-to-four digit number assigned to the specific film. If the numbers were preceded by the letter [...] "R", then the poster was from a re-release of the film. One good example is Star Wars; its original release number is [...] "77/21", meaning it was released in the year 1977 and was the 21st movie assigned a stock number for that year. Movie advertising typically had the number in two places: stamped on the back by NSS, and printed in the lower-right corner. The NSS stock number is often mistaken for a [...] "Limited Edition" [...] number.|$|R
50|$|The {{occupation}} of the Netherlands led to the dismissal of curator Hirschel and his assistant M.S. Hillesum (1894-1943) in November 1940, and {{the closing of the}} reading room in the summer of 1941. The reading room was closed and a number of seals had been attached, but most of the Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana was kept in the book storage depot. Some of the Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana's manuscripts and incunables had already been placed in crates below the book depot since {{they were part of a}} single organisational unit along with those of the University Library. Herman de la Fontaine Verwey, the University librarian during the war, made plans with Hirschel to smuggle the most valuable books out of the reading room, using old seals discarded when new ones were applied. To their advantage, the only complete catalogue was a handwritten card index in Hebrew that they shuffled thoroughly in order to render it useless. Furthermore, the reading room was overstocked and had no <b>shelf</b> <b>numbers,</b> so they were able to remove a number of books without leaving noticeable gaps. These books were then placed with the University's other valuable books in a shelter in Castricum. Nevertheless, in June 1944 the order came for the Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana to be removed. Through a fortunate combination of the enterprising nature of de la Fontaine Verwey, the cooperation of library staff, and the ignorance of those sent to pack up the library, the Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana's journals, brochures, pictures and prints were saved. The collection was earmarked for the Institute for Study of the Jewish Question and was transported to Germany. Thankfully nothing had yet been done with the books by the time the war ended, and most of the boxes of books were recovered in storage in Hungen, near Frankfurt am Main, and sent back to Amsterdam. The same could not be said for the curator, his assistant, and their families, who had also been deported.|$|R

5000|$|Commercial {{publishers}} {{in industrialized}} countries generally assign ISBNs to their books, so buyers may presume that the ISBN {{is part of}} a total international system, with no exceptions. However, many government publishers, in industrial as well as developing countries, do not participate fully in the ISBN system, and publish books which do not have ISBNs. A large or public collection requires a catalogue. Codes called [...] "call numbers" [...] relate the books to the catalogue, and determine their locations on the <b>shelves.</b> Call <b>numbers</b> are based on a Library classification system. The call number is placed on the spine of the book, normally a short distance before the bottom, and inside. Institutional or national standards, such as ANSI/NISO Z39.41 - 1997, establish the correct way to place information (such as the title, or the name of the author) on book spines, and on [...] "shelvable" [...] book-like objects, such as containers for DVDs, video tapes and software.|$|R
