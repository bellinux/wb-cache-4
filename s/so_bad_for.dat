25|$|The US {{team was}} Culbertson {{and his wife}} Josephine, Theodore Lightner and Waldemar von Zedwitz. All {{the members of the}} American team would be {{recognised}} as outstanding players in the years that followed. Both their partnerships were experienced and organised; the result of the match was not long in doubt. Culbertson won by 4,845 points over a week's play of 200 deals (total points scoring): not quite <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> Buller as it might have been.|$|E
25|$|While Don Quixote is {{unconscious}} in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, {{the parish}} curate {{and the local}} barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. A large part of this section consists of the priest deciding which books deserve to be burned and which to be saved. It is a scene of high comedy: If the books are <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> morality, how does the priest know them well enough to describe every naughty scene? Even so, this gives an occasion for many comments on books Cervantes himself liked and disliked. For example, Cervantes' own pastoral novel La Galatea is saved, while the rather unbelievable romance Felixmarte de Hyrcania is burned. After the books are dealt with, they seal up the room which contained the library, later telling Don Quixote {{that it was the}} action of a wizard (encantador).|$|E
500|$|Everyone reminisces {{about the}} huge meal and much fun ("This Was a Real Nice Clambake"). [...] Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks {{in at the}} wrong moment, and {{declares}} that he is finished with her ("Geraniums In the Winder"), as Jigger jeers ("There's Nothin' <b>So</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>for</b> a Woman"). The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that [...] "he's your feller and you love him" [...] ("What's the Use of Wond'rin'?"). [...] Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt. [...] She begs him {{to give it to}} her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.|$|E
6000|$|... "No true," [...] {{answered}} the Onondago, a little sternly, though a very little; for, {{while he and}} Jaap disputed daily, they never quarrelled. [...] "No true, <b>so.</b> Flog <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that I care a cent--I'm not {{jealous of}} her. I ain't <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> off <b>for</b> company as she is. She can't take anybody away from me, {{but she must}} go and break down my faith in the judge." ...|$|R

[496] ["It {{is still}} more {{difficult}} to say which form of government is the worst--all are <b>so</b> <b>bad.</b> As <b>for</b> democracy, it is {{the worst of the}} whole; for what is (in fact) democracy?--an Aristocracy of Blackguards."--See [...] "My Dictionary" [...] (May 1, 1821), Letters, 1901, v. 405, 406.] ...|$|R
500|$|The Red Sox's {{win in the}} World Series {{ended the}} [...] "Curse of the Bambino", which {{supposedly}} had afflicted the team ever since the Red Sox sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees in 1919. Pitcher Derek Lowe and other players said that the team would no longer hear [...] "1918!" [...] at Yankee Stadium ever again. Kevin Millar said to all Red Sox fans: [...] "We {{wanted to do it}} <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the city of Boston. To win a World Series with this on our chests, it hasn't been done since 1918. So rip up those '1918!' posters right now." [...] Members of previous Red Sox teams who had fallen short immediately acclaimed the 2004 team, including Pesky – who had been the shortstop responsible for a fatal checking error that had allowed the Cardinals' Enos Slaughter to complete his [...] "Mad Dash" [...] to score the winning run in Game 7 at the old Sportsman's Park in 1946. Pesky watched the game from the visiting clubhouse and was immediately embraced by Millar, Wakefield, Schilling and others as a living representative of those previous teams as he joined the celebrations.|$|E
500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E
2500|$|The supply {{situation}} became <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the Japanese that, according to Gailey, [...] "the normal rice ration of 750 grams of rice for each soldier {{was cut in}} April 1944 to 250 grams, and beginning in September there was no rice ration. A {{large portion of the}} available army and naval personnel had to be put to work growing food. Allied pilots took delight in dropping napalm on these garden plots whenever possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For all that," [...] replied his dragoman, [...] "it is {{the best}} we can give you; {{anything}} which induces the detached mood of which you spoke, has been banned from the stage {{since the days of the}} Great Skirmish; it is <b>so</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I like Master Headley and Kit Smallbones well enough," [...] said Stephen, rather gloomily, [...] "and if {{a gentleman}} {{must be a}} prentice, weapons are not <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> a craft <b>for</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it, and that's {{what makes}} it <b>so</b> infernally <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> me. Forgive me, won't you? Think of me, old fellow, as the wretchedest ass you ever met, but not such a cad as this would make me!" [...] As Mainwaring stepped out from the {{moonlight}} towards him with extended hand, Bradley grasped it warmly.|$|R
2500|$|The {{region was}} home to a mostly-rural, {{heterogeneous}} population. The landowning families and 80 {{percent of the population}} of the port city of Latakia were Sunni Muslim; however, in rural areas 62 percent of the population were Alawite peasants. There was considerable Alawite separatist sentiment in the region, evidenced by a 1936 letter signed by 80 Alawi leaders addressed to the French Prime Minister which said that the [...] "Alawite people rejected attachment to Syria and wished to stay under French protection". Among the signatories was Sulayman Ali al-Assad, father of Hafez al-Assad. Even during this time of increased Alawite rights, the situation was still <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the group that many females had to leave their homes to work for urban Sunnis – many becoming mistresses to their employers – which is why it was estimated that 25% of all Alawite children in the 1930s and 40s had Sunni fathers.|$|E
2500|$|A. J. Allmendinger {{held off}} a hard {{charging}} Marcos Ambrose with two laps remaining to score his first career Sprint Cup Series victory. [...] "My gosh, I can't believe we've won a NASCAR Sprint Cup race," [...] Allmendinger said. [...] "With this whole 47 team, [...] Tad Geschickter, Jody Geschickter, Brad Daugherty, {{all the great}} sponsors we have, our first Cup victory together, my first victory...I love these guys. I just wanted it <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> them and this team. They work so hard. I wasn't gonna let Marcos take that from me." [...] "First of all, congratulations to AJ and the 47 team," [...] Ambrose said. [...] "They deserved that win. I left nothing on the table. I tried to rattle his cage and couldn't shake him. We raced fair and square to the end there. It was a tough couple laps but it was fair. We were both giving it to each other pretty hard. No harm, no foul. We just came up a little short." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now I {{am having}} my little moment of comfort! These special {{business}} conversations after dinner are <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the digestion!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it." [...] He {{returned}} her smile. [...] "Mine {{are not quite}} <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> as yours; <b>for</b> yours are really, my dear man, in a state I can't see through at all. But mine will do--for a mess." ...|$|R
60|$|After that, he tempted him to kill himself, on a Pretence that {{he might}} not fall into the Hands of the Uncircumcised; as if Self-Murther was not half <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> either <b>for</b> Sin against God, or Disgrace among Men, as being taken Prisoner by a Philistine! A Piece of Madness none but the Devil could have brought Mankind to submit to, tho' some Ages after that, he made it a Fashion among the Romans.|$|R
50|$|Agitation {{in rural}} areas was almost {{constant}} during the conflict, but the peasant uprisings multiplied in the 1590s, as in Champagne, in the North and East of Paris, in Lower Normandy, Dauphine, Vivare, and Provence. The intensification and extension of the riots are noted around 1594, affecting {{most of the country}} within a broad movement of recurring revolts. In addition, the year 1593 had been particularly cold and rainy, <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> crops <b>for</b> the second consecutive year were expected.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mortimer, I feel a draft. I feel it distinctly. There {{is nothing}} <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> this disease as a draft. Please move the crib {{in front of}} the fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> a beginner," [...] said Kate, {{taking it}} {{and putting it}} in a drawer. She took some {{needlework}} from another drawer, and, sitting down, began busily stitching.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then why {{knock on}} the floor?' said Annette, turning to go. 'It is <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> my ceiling,' she said over shoulder. 'I thought you would not mind my {{mentioning}} it. Good afternoon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The line broke only in one place, before St. Quentin," [...] {{said the}} doctor, as {{he hung up}} the receiver, [...] "and the British troops are {{retreating}} in good order. That's not <b>so</b> <b>bad.</b> As <b>for</b> the shells that are falling on Paris, they are coming {{from a distance of}} seventy miles--from some amazing long-range gun the Germans have invented and sprung with the opening offensive. That is all the news to date, and Dr. Holland says it is reliable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, Mademoiselle," [...] said Annot, [...] "but he {{certainly}} wasn't <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> last night, <b>for</b> {{he might have}} killed them all had he chosen: and instead of that he didn't kill any one, or let any of his party kill them either, only he frightened poor old Momont nearly to death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Altogether! I {{think that}} {{probably}} he did pawn his commission. That is bad, but it isn't <b>so</b> very <b>bad.</b> As <b>for</b> the other charge against him, I doubt it." [...] So said Lord Burton, and Sir Harry determined that the accusation should go for nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, Mr. Barnet,' she said, {{almost in}} tears, 'don't revive {{the subject to}} me; I am the wrong one to console you--think, sir,--you should not be here--it would be <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> me if it were known!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Artie,' he said {{rising from}} the chair slowly, 'Artie, that's not <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> a parson, I can tell you. I hope the Archbishop won't be tempted to cite you for {{displaying}} an amount of originality unworthy of your cloth.' ...|$|E
60|$|Reece was {{the first}} person to {{institute}} inquiries, and if everybody had resembled him, matters would not have been <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> Gethryn. Reece possessed a perfect genius for minding his own business. The dialogue when they met was brief.|$|E
6000|$|... "My child," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "you {{ought to}} {{consider}} my nerves! You {{know very well}} that the sudden mention of any one whom I dislike <b>so</b> intensely is <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> me. I am surprised at you, Beatrice. You show a culpable lack of consideration for my infirmities." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Everybody {{sitting up}} here {{would say we}} want (Earnhardt's team) to win, and they're so close to winning and both times they had a chance. We {{are going to do}} {{what we have to do}} to win the races, and today it all just worked out strategy-wise that we won. But I feel <b>so</b> stinking <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> him, and I know how bad he wants it. But it'll happen. They keep running like that, it'll happen." [...] Kevin Harvick, {{speaking}} after the race.|$|R
60|$|And {{then the}} contrast! From Sausalito, over excellent, park-like boulevards, through the splendid redwoods and homes of Mill Valley, across the blossomed hills of Marin County, along the knoll-studded picturesque marshes, past San Rafael resting warmly among her hills, over the divide {{and up the}} Petaluma Valley, {{and on to the}} grassy feet of Sonoma Mountain and home. We covered fifty-five miles that day. Not <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> eh, <b>for</b> Prince the Rogue, the paint-removing Outlaw, the thin-shanked thoroughbred, and the rabbit-jumper? And they came in cool and dry, ready for their mangers and the straw.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We didn't {{come by the}} train.' And Felix and Cherry {{smiled at}} one another as they {{detected}} that Wilmet's economical soul was vexed. 'I wanted Lance to see his doctor again, and the railway seems <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> his head that I drove.' ...|$|E
60|$|Honora was {{infinitely}} relieved {{at having}} bestowed {{this piece of}} advice, on which she had agreed with Robert as {{the only means of}} insuring Phoebe's being sheltered from society that Mervyn might not esteem <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> his sister as they did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Trixy, did you really? How sweet of you!" [...] And her liquid eyes regarded, with {{an almost}} equal affection, first the master and then the dish. [...] "I'll take a little," [...] she said weakly; [...] "it's <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> my gout." ...|$|E
6000|$|Had {{the full}} force of this {{remarkable}} adjuration burst upon Mr. Stenner all at once it might have carried him away, which would not have been <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> a thing <b>for</b> San Francisco; but as the meaning had to percolate slowly through a dense dyke of ignorance, it produced no other immediate effect than the exclamation, [...] "Well, I'll be bust!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'One {{does get}} {{so tired of}} mutton and rice-pudding,' {{answered}} the less observant Miss Fulmort, who was but dimly conscious of any one's existence save her own, and could not have credited a governess laughing at her; 'but really this is not <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> after all, <b>for</b> a change; and some pale ale. You don't mean that you exist without pale ale?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have it as {{you will}} then, Alice," [...] he answered, smiling. [...] "Maybe we are {{borrowing}} trouble. While I {{do not like the}} looks of things on board this ship, they may not be <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> after all, <b>for</b> {{it is possible that the}} 'Ancient Mariner' was but voicing the desires of his wicked old heart rather than speaking of real facts.|$|R
