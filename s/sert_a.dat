25|$|Sertraline is an SSRI, but, uniquely {{among most}} antidepressants, it shows {{relatively}} high (nanomolar) {{affinity for the}} DAT {{in addition to the}} <b>SERT.</b> <b>As</b> such, {{it has been suggested that}} clinically it may weakly inhibit the reuptake of dopamine, particularly at high dosages. For this reason, sertraline has sometimes been described as a serotonin–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SDRI). This is relevant as dopamine is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression, and increased dopaminergic neurotransmission by sertraline in addition to serotonin may have additional benefits against depression.|$|R

50|$|The most {{commonly}} prescribed antidepressant drugs are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which act by blocking the high affinity <b>SERT.</b> <b>A</b> proposed {{explanation for the}} limited efficacy of SSRIs {{is the presence of}} the low affinity transporters OCT and PMAT, which limit the ability of SSRIs to increase extracellular serotonin. Decynium-22 blocked serotonin uptake via these auxiliary transporters, and when used in conjunction with SSRIs, decynium-22 enhanced the effects of SSRIs to inhibit serotonin clearance. A similar effect was seen in SERT knock-out mice, which resulted in an improvement of social behavior. When OCT3 was knocked out in mice, however, decynium-22 was ineffectual, indicating that the anti-depressant effects of decynium-22 are dependent upon its blockage of the OCT3.|$|E

It is said that theirs was an immediate bond of like souls, and Misia was attracted to Chanel by [...] "her genius, lethal wit, sarcasm and maniacal destructiveness, which intrigued and appalled everyone". Both women were convent schooled, and maintained a friendship of shared interests and confidences. They also shared drug use. By 1935, Chanel had become a habitual drug user, injecting herself with morphine on a daily basis, a habit she maintained {{until the end of}} her life. According to Chandler Burr's The Emperor of Scent, Luca Turin related an apocryphal story in circulation that Chanel was [...] "called Coco because she threw the most fabulous cocaine parties in Paris".|$|E

50|$|Horschitz et al. {{examined}} reuptake inhibitor selectivity {{among the}} rat serotonin reuptake protein (SERT) expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-SERT). They presented SERT with varying doses of either citalopram (an SSRI) or desipramine (an inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake protein, NET). By examining the dose-response curves (using a normal medium as control), {{they were able}} to quantify that citalopram acted on <b>SERT</b> as <b>an</b> SSRI, and that desipramine had no effect on <b>SERT.</b> In <b>a</b> separate experiment, Horschitz et al. exposed HEK-SERT with citalopram on a long-term basis. They noticed that long-term exposure led to a down-regulation of binding sites. These results suggest some mechanism for long-term changes in the pre-synaptic neuron after drug therapy. Horschitz et al. found that after removing citalopram from the system, normal levels of SERT binding site expression returned.|$|R

40|$|François Raillon The {{coming to}} power of Soekarno's daughter, Megawati, in July 2001, marked a new stage in Indonesia's era of reformation. A two-pronged process {{occurred}} : while Soekarnoism was mobilized as an ideology meant to help maintain the country's unity and independence, elements of Soeharto's New Order were brought back to power to restore stability. Associates of the former president and authoritarian ways that recalled his regime were reestablished, among them a freer hand {{was given to the}} military. This double restoration taking place under Megawati's auspices has been an attempt to overcome what is felt as a multidimensional crisis of a troubled nation, at the same time reining in reformation.

40|$|The {{handling}} of serotonin [5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) ] {{depends on the}} serotonin transporter (<b>SERT).</b> <b>A</b> SERT knockout (KO) rat is a useful model {{to test the hypothesis}} that SERT is the primary mech-anism for arterial 5 -HT uptake and to investigate the impact of SERT removal on blood pressure. Wild-type (WT) and KO rats were used to measure 5 -HT content (plasma, raphe, aorta, carotid, and mesenteric artery), aortic isometric contraction, and blood pressure. HPLC sup-ported the lack of circulating 5 -HT in plasma (ng/ml plasma, WT, 310 96; and KO, 1. 0 0. 5; P 0. 05). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses validated the presence of the SERT protein in the WT rats and a lesser expression in the KO rat. The aorta isolated from KO rats had a normal contraction to phenylephrine and norepi-nephrine and a normal relaxation to the endothelium-dependent ago-nist acetylcholine compared with the aorta from WT. In contrast, the potency of 5 -HT was increased in the aorta from KO rats compared with WT rats [log EC 50 (M); WT, 5. 71 0. 08; and KO, 6. 7 0. 18] and maximum contraction was reduced [%phenylephrine (10 M...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to follow parallelly the clinical status of a patient and the dynamics of the serotonin transporter (<b>SERT),</b> <b>a</b> likely player in the effect of electroconvulsive treatment (ECT), a powerful tool against deep depression. A patient affected by major depression with catatonic features, not responding to pharmacological therapy, underwent ECT. Evaluations of the binding of labelled paroxetine to venous blood platelet SERT were parallel to the assessments of clinical improvements. The density of platelet SERT, starting from a low level before ECT, displayed an initial steep increase peaking the day after the third electroconvulsive session (5 days after the start of ECT). This was followed by a rapid decrease, which seemed to precede the process of clinical recovery. These results were found in a case of unavoidable ECT treatment. If generalizable, they suggest interesting ideas about the still mysterious mechanism of ECT antidepressant action. Electroconvulsive therapy (Cerletti, 1941, 1950) is recognized as the most efficacious treatment in cases of major depressions accompanied by catatonic features with a life threat for the patient (APA, 2001; Abrams, 2002). We describe a case of an elderly woman affected by major depression and catatonic signs successfully treated with ECT. The course of the eight electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) sessions at alternate days was accompanied by marked changes in the density of platelet membrane serotonin transporter (SERT) ...|$|E
40|$|Crystal {{structures}} of LeuT, a bacterial homologue of mammalian neurotransmitter transporters, show a molecule of bound substrate that is essentially {{exposed to the}} extracellular space but occluded from the cytoplasm. Thus, there must exist an alternate conformation for LeuT in which the substrate is accessible to the cytoplasm and a corresponding mechanism that switches accessibility {{from one side of}} the membrane to the other. Here, we identify the cytoplasmic accessibility pathway of the alternate conformation in a mammalian serotonin transporter (<b>SERT)</b> (<b>a</b> member of the same transporter family as LeuT). We also propose a model for the cytoplasmic-facing state that exploits the internal pseudosymmetry observed in the crystal structure. LeuT contains two structurally similar repeats (TMs 1 – 5 and TMs 6 – 10) that are inverted with respect to the plane of the membrane. The conformational differences between them result in the formation of the extracellular pathway. Our model for the cytoplasm-facing state exchanges the conformations of the two repeats and thus exposes the substrate and ion-binding sites to the cytoplasm. The conformational change that connects the two states primarily involves the tilting of a 4 -helix bundle composed of transmembrane helices 1, 2, 6, and 7. Switching the tilt angle of this bundle is essentially equivalent to switching the conformation of the two repeats. Extensive mutagenesis of SERT and accessibility measurements, using cysteine reagents, are accommodated by our model. These observations may be of relevance to other transporter families, many of which contain internal inverted repeats...|$|E
