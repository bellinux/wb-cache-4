5|$|Similar {{photographs}} were taken of Anita Ekberg and <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren,</b> among others. According to The Guardian, Bardot's photographs in particular turned Saint-Tropez into the beachwear {{capital of the}} world, with Bardot identified as the original Cannes bathing beauty. Bardot's photography helped to enhance the public profile of the festival, and Cannes in turn {{played a crucial role}} in her career.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren</b> and Marion Cotillard are {{the only}} actresses to win an Academy Award for Best Actress for foreign {{language}} performances, Italian and French, respectively. Cotillard is the only actor to receive two Oscar nominations for foreign films without having her films nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. She is also the only actor to be nominated for a Belgian film ("Two Days, One Night").|$|E
5|$|In 1966 Donen {{made another}} Hitchcock-inspired film: Arabesque, {{starring}} Gregory Peck and <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren.</b> The film {{was written by}} Julian Mitchell and Stanley Price, with an uncredited rewrite by Peter Stone. Peck plays an American professor at Oxford University who {{is an expert in}} ancient hieroglyphics. He is approached by a Middle Eastern prime minister to investigate an organization that is attempting to assassinate him and uses hieroglyphic codes to communicate. The investigation leads Peck to one mystery after another, often involving the prime minister's mysterious mistress (Loren). The film was Donen's second consecutive hit.|$|E
5|$|Six {{actors have}} had {{multiple}} Academy Award nominations for foreign-language performances: Marcello Mastroianni (three Best Actor nominations for Italian-language performances), <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren</b> (one Academy Award for Best Actress for Two Women and another Best Actress nomination for Marriage Italian-Style, both for Italian-language performances), Liv Ullmann (two Best Actress nominations for Swedish-language performances), Isabelle Adjani (two Best Actress nominations for French-language performances), Javier Bardem (two Best Actor nominations for Spanish-language performances) and Marion Cotillard (one Academy Award for Best Actress for La Vie en Rose and another Best Actress nomination for Two Days, One Night, both for French-language performances).|$|E

Artists Bill Harley and Jim Dale, along with audio engineer David Correia, are the other musicians to win the award more than once, all winning it twice. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton has also won the award, along with Mikhail Gorbachev and <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren,</b> for their work on the album Wolf Tracks and Peter and the Wolf at the 2003 installment of the awards.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Martin {{published}} a memoir, All You Need is Ears (co-written with Jeremy Hornsby), that described {{his work with}} the Beatles and other artists (including Peter Sellers, <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren,</b> Shirley Bassey, Flanders and Swann, Matt Monro, and Dudley Moore), and gave an informal introduction to the art and science of sound recording. In 1993 he published Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt Pepper (published in the U.S. as With a Little Help from My Friends: The Making of Sgt Pepper, co-authored with William Pearson), which also included interview quotations from a 1992 South Bank Show episode discussing the album. Martin also edited a 1983 book called Making Music: The Guide to Writing, Performing and Recording.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} antics {{are another}} recurring theme in popular culture. On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial bumpers has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren</b> staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous eyebrow at the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. The photo of <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren</b> sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set. The meeting between Mansfield and Anton LaVey, the founder and high priest of the Church of Satan, was a much publicized and oft quoted event of her life, {{as well as the}} history of the Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, this unwieldy {{and confusing}} system {{was replaced by}} the current system in which an actress is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year. One actress has been nominated posthumously, Jeanne Eagels. Only three film characters have been nominated more than once in this category: Elizabeth I of England (two times by Cate Blanchett), Leslie Crosbie in The Letter, and Esther Blodgett in A Star Is Born. Six women on the list have received an Honorary Academy Award for their acting; they are Greta Garbo, Barbara Stanwyck, Mary Pickford, Deborah Kerr, Gena Rowlands, and <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren.</b>|$|E
5|$|Janice Dickinson {{describes}} her early life where she suffered {{child abuse and}} physical abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. She writes that her three sisters and mother also experienced abuse from her father. She recounts her ups and downs during her career while finding success in the fashion industry. She emphasizes how bravery is important to success, and explains how she remained firm on her request for US$20,000 for a modeling position when the market figure at the time was only $5,000. Throughout the process she experiences emotional pain from relationships that lack depth, and learns for herself about the harms of substance dependence. Incidents related to her drug addiction problems include ingesting heroin from Gia Carangi prior to a photography session in Italy, and an experience in a state of alcohol intoxication falling off a fashion runway for Valentino Garavani and landing upon <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s. Set on an ocean liner, it starred Marlon Brando as an American ambassador and <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren</b> as a stowaway found in his cabin. The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format, while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward. He also signed a deal with Universal Pictures and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer. Chaplin was paid $600,000 director's fee as well {{as a percentage of the}} gross receipts. A Countess from Hong Kong premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure. Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film, which turned out to be his last.|$|E
5|$|The {{residential}} {{units were}} more successful, and 95% of the 263 condominiums {{were sold in}} the first four months after it opened, despite their high prices—the cost of condominiums at the tower started at $600,000 and ranged up to $12 million, with the penthouse being sold for $15 million in 1985. The tower attracted many rich and famous residents, including Johnny Carson, David Merrick, <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren,</b> and Steven Spielberg. At least one unidentified resident, who lived on the same floor as Johnny Carson, built a private swimming pool in their unit. In total, Trump received $300 million from the sale of the condominiums, which more than offset the $200 million cost of construction. However, by 1991, Trump was already involved in lawsuits against residents: in October of that year, he successfully sued actor Pia Zadora and her husband, businessman Meshulam Riklis, to collect $1 million in unpaid rent.|$|E

The opera's story, but not its music, {{was used as the}} basis for a 1998 musical of the same name written by Elton John and Tim Rice.|$|E
25|$|Along with Elizabeth Taylor and <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren,</b> Welch {{was among}} the {{candidates}} considered {{for the role of}} Alexis Carrington on the ABC prime time drama Dynasty which began in 1981, before the producers settled on Joan Collins.

500|$|Like Esther Williams did {{a decade}} earlier, Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot all used {{revealing}} swimwears as career props {{to enhance their}} sex appeal, and it became more accepted in parts of Europe when worn by fifties [...] "love goddess" [...] actresses such as Bardot, Anita Ekberg and <b>Sophia</b> <b>Loren.</b> British actress Diana Dors had a mink bikini made for her during the 1955 Venice Film Festival and wore it riding in a gondola down Venice's Grand Canal past St. Mark's Square.|$|E
