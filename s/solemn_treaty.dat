60|$|It is {{impossible}} to suppose that a State of Russia's power and antecedents would tolerate a privileged community (of, to Russia, unnational complexion) within {{the body of the}} Empire. All history shows that such an arrangement, however hedged in by the most <b>solemn</b> <b>treaties</b> and declarations, cannot last. In this case it would lead to a tragic issue. The absorption of Polonism is unthinkable. The last hundred years of European History proves it undeniably. There remains then extirpation, a process of blood and iron; and the last act of the Polish drama would be played then before a Europe too weary to interfere, and to the applause of Germany.|$|R

60|$|It being admitted, {{that the}} power which formed the government, was legitimate, we obtain one of the purest {{compacts}} for the organization of human society that probably ever existed. The ancient allegiance, under which the Colonies had grown up to importance, had been extinguished by <b>solemn</b> <b>treaty,</b> and the States met in Convention, sustained by all the law they had and backed in every instance by institutions that {{were more or less}} popular. The history of the world cannot, probably, furnish another instance of the settlement of the fundamental compact of a great nation under circumstances of so much obvious justice. This gives unusual solemnity and authority to the Constitution of 1787, and invests it with additional claims to our admiration and respect.|$|E

60|$|In this metamorphosis, {{the first}} thing done by Spain, in the honey-moon of her new servitude, was, with all the hardihood of pusillanimity, utterly to defy the most <b>solemn</b> <b>treaties</b> with Great Britain and the {{guaranty}} of Europe. She has yielded the largest and fairest {{part of one of}} the largest and fairest islands in the West Indies, perhaps on the globe, to the usurped powers of France. She completes the title of those powers to the whole of that important central island of Hispaniola. She has solemnly surrendered to the regicides and butchers of the Bourbon family what that court never ventured, perhaps never wished, to bestow on the patriarchal stock of her own august house.|$|R

It is so that justice demands vindication, and necessity forces us to take it. May the monsters that infest Colombian soil, and have covered it with blood disappear for good; may their punishment be equal to the magnitude of their treason, so that the stain of our ignominy is washed off, and to show {{the nations of the}} universe that the sons of America cannot be offended without punishment.|$|R

We have left behind us the inhabitants of Benares, after having seen them driven into rebellion by tyranny and oppression, and their country desolated by our misrule. Your Lordships, I am sure, have had the map of India before you, and know that the country so destroyed and so desolated was about one fifth {{of the size of}} England and Wales in geographical extent, and equal in population to about a fourth.

At the same time, they expressed their unwillingness to receive him, unless they could bind him, by a <b>solemn</b> <b>treaty,</b> to take a very different course of conduct, in the future management of his government, from that which he had pursued before. Ethelred and Emma were eager to regain, on any terms, their lost throne. They sent over embassadors empowered to make, in Ethelred's name, any promises which the English nobles might demand; and shortly afterward the royal pair crossed the Channel and went to London, and Ethelred was acknowledged there by the Saxon portion {{of the population of the}} island once more as king.|$|E

60|$|The learned counsel asks, {{with an air}} of triumph, {{whether these}} ladies possessed these treasures by jointure, dower, will, or settlement. What was the title?

They paid a sum of money, applied to your use, for that guaranty. They had a treble title,--by possession, by guaranty, by purchase.|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} after this Genghis Khan {{assembled}} all the magistrates and principal citizens of the town, and made a speech to them from an elevated stand or pulpit which was erected for the purpose.

He {{then went on to}} denounce the perfidious conduct of the sultan toward him in making a <b>solemn</b> <b>treaty</b> of peace with him and then treacherously murdering his merchants and embassadors. He said that the sultan was a detestable tyrant, and that God had commissioned him to rid the earth of all such monsters. He said, in conclusion, that he would protect their lives, and would not allow his soldiers to take away their household goods, provided they surrendered to him fairly and honestly all their money and other treasures; and if any of them refused to do this, or to tell where their treasures were hid, he would put them to the torture, and compel them to tell.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the wish}} {{of almost every}} Englishman that the Mahratta peace {{might lead to a}} general one; because the Mahratta war was only a part of a general confederacy formed against us, on account of the {{universal}} abhorrence of our conduct which prevailed in every state, and almost in every house in India. Mr. Hastings was obliged to pretend some sort of acquiescence in this general and rational desire. He therefore consented, in order to satisfy the point of honor of the Mahrattas, that an article should be inserted to admit Hyder Ali to accede to the pacification. But observe, Sir, the spirit of this man,--which, if it were not made manifest by a thousand things, and particularly by his proceedings with regard to Lord Macartney, would be sufficiently manifest by this. What sort of article, think you, does he require this essential head of a <b>solemn</b> <b>treaty</b> of general pacification to be? In his instruction to Mr. Anderson, he desires him to admit [...] "a vague article" [...] in favor of Hyder. Evasion and fraud were the declared basis of the treaty.

[...] It proclaimed that all Peninsular people in Spanish America who didn't actively participate in favor of its independence would be killed, and all South Americans would be spared, even if they had cooperated with the Spanish authorities. (See below for full declaration). The document's ultimate goal was to assure the Venezuelan elites that they would not be unfavorably treated for having collaborated with Domingo de Monteverde and the royalist authorities. The Decree was the first step in transforming the common and legal view of the Venezuelan war of liberation from a mere rebellion (or at best a civil war) taking place in one of Spain's colonies, to a full-fledged international war between two distinct countries, Venezuela and Spain.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after the}} {{revolution}} which had seated Mir Jaffier on the viceroyal throne, {{the spirit of the}} Mogul empire began, as it were, to make one faint struggle before it finally expired. The then heir to that throne, escaping from the hands of those who had held his father prisoner, had put himself at the head of several chiefs collected under the standard of his house, and appeared in force on the frontiers of the provinces of Bengal and Bahar, upon both which he made some impression. This alarmed the new powers, the Nabob Mir Jaffier, and the Presidency of Calcutta; and as in a common cause, and by the terms of their mutual alliance, they took the field against him. The Nabob's eldest son and heir-apparent commanded in chief. Major Calliaud commanded the English forces under the government of Calcutta. Mr. Holwell was in the temporary possession of the Presidency. Mr. Vansittart was hourly expected to supersede him. Mr. Warren Hastings, a young gentleman about twenty-seven years of age, was Resident for the Company at the durbar, or court, of Mir Jaffier, our new-created Nabob of Bengal, allied to this country by the most <b>solemn</b> <b>treaties</b> that can bind men; for which treaties he had paid, and was then paying, immense sums of money.
