5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> {{the financial}} statements {{in the same year}} when other members of its global network apparently refused to give clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar's {{marketing}} department had allocated space on their {{stand at the}} motor show for the XJ220, but {{had not seen the}} vehicle until its arrival. Jaguar chairman John Egan and Roger Putnam, {{who was in charge of}} Jaguar's racing activities, were shown the vehicle the week before the motor show and <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> the concept, allowing its unveiling. The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production. Ferrari's display of their F40 model at the same event was overshadowed; an estimated 90,000 additional visitors came to see the Jaguar XJ220.|$|E

5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound {{just a few}} weeks before the roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that he was aware that the roof was at risk of caving in, but altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first, Australia scored 236 before Johnston took 6/15 from 12.5 overs. He took {{the last four}} wickets as the home team fell from 6/81 to be all out for 85. Johnston bowled four wicketless overs in the second innings as Australia {{completed}} victory without needing to bat for a second time. In the second match, he <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> his tour in a low key manner, taking a wicket in each innings to end with a match total of 2/48 as Australia completed another innings triumph.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, {{three months}} after the work was {{originally}} scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given the green light. The sports minister <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> £31million to complete the project. The redevelopment finally got under way on 6 May 2014 after the 2013–14 domestic season had finished, eight months later than originally planned. The work is due to be completed in 2015. On 31 March 2015, the West Stand of the stadium was sealed off after cracks in the structure were discovered. Construction work related to the stadium redevelopment had been ongoing behind the stand in the weeks prior to the damage, but it was not known if that was directly related. Originally planned for refurbishment as part of the redevelopment, it was later decided that the West Stand would be demolished and eventually replaced.|$|E

5|$|The Court of King's Bench did {{act as an}} appellate body, hearing appeals {{from the}} Court of Common Pleas, eyre circuits, assize courts and local courts, but was not a court of last resort; its own records were sent to Parliament to be <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on.</b> The {{creation}} of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1585 created a court from which King's Bench decisions could be appealed to, and with {{the expansion of the}} Exchequer Chamber's jurisdiction in 1830 the King's Bench ceased to be an appellate court. Thanks to the Bill of Westminster and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> all of Zahorchak's proposals {{except for}} his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E
5|$|No great {{compromise}} reached Taylor's desk {{during his}} presidency; instead, his last days were {{overshadowed by the}} Galphin affair. Before joining the Taylor cabinet, Secretary of War Crawford {{had served as a}} lawyer. He had been involved in a fifteen-year case, representing the descendants of a colonial trader whose services to the British crown had not been repaid {{at the time of the}} American Revolution. The British debt to George Galphin was to be assumed by the federal government, but Galphin's heirs only received payment on the debt's principal after years of litigation, and were unable to win an interest payment from the Polk administration. Treasury Secretary Meredith, with the support of Attorney General Johnson, finally <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> the payment in April 1850. To the president's embarrassment, this payment included a legal compensation of nearly $100,000 to Crawford; two cabinet members had effectively offered a tremendous chunk of the public treasury to another. A House investigation cleared Crawford of any legal wrongdoing, but nonetheless expressed disapproval of his accepting the payment. Taylor, who had already been sketching out a re-organization of his cabinet, now had an unfolding scandal to complicate the situation.|$|E

In the summer of 1830, Jackson urged the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Creek to sign individual treaties accepting removal from their homelands.

25|$|Early {{design work}} {{on what would}} become the Aurora began as early as the late 1980s and {{manifested}} itself with a 1989 engineering concept known as the Oldsmobile Tube Car designed by Bud Chandler. Beyond the overall similar shape, the Tube Car featured many detailed elements that were later found on the production automobile, including a full-width taillamp, wraparound rear windshield, and frameless windows. Unlike the eventual production car, the Tube Car was of a pillarless hardtop design with suicide doors.
