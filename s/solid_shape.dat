25|$|In the {{two-point}} linear implosion, {{the nuclear}} fuel is cast into a <b>solid</b> <b>shape</b> and placed within {{the center of}} a cylinder of high explosive. Detonators are placed {{at either end of the}} explosive cylinder, and a plate-like insert, or shaper, is placed in the explosive just inside the detonators. When the detonators are fired, the initial detonation is trapped between the shaper and the end of the cylinder, causing it to travel out to the edges of the shaper where it is diffracted around the edges into the main mass of explosive. This causes the detonation to form into a ring that proceeds inwards from the shaper.|$|E

2500|$|A {{well-known}} example {{occurred in}} the postwar reconstruction of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, in which the planned Kreschatik avenue and its central square (Ploschad Kalinina) were to form a single rich space enclosed by Stalinist construction. However, as the buildings enclosing the latter were in completion, the architects were forced to alter their plans and the area was left unfinished until the early 1980s. In particular Hotel Ukrayina, which was to crown the square with a look similar to one of Moscow's [...] "Seven sisters", was left as a <b>solid</b> <b>shape</b> without a top spire or any rich external decoration.|$|E

The blue star originally was a <b>solid</b> <b>shape</b> until a white line and blue border was added in 1964. The logo has remained the same since. Today, the blue star has been extended to not only the Dallas Cowboys, but owner Jerry Jones' AFL team, the Dallas Desperados that have a similar logo based on the Cowboys. The blue star also is used on other entries like an imaging facility and storage facility.|$|E
60|$|Somewhere {{about two}} in the morning a squall had burst upon the castle, a clap of {{screaming}} wind that made the towers rock, and a copious drift of rain that streamed from the windows. The wind soon blew itself out, but the day broke cloudy and dripping, and when the little party assembled at breakfast their humours appeared to have changed with the change of weather. Nance had been brooding on the scene at the river-side, applying it in various ways to her particular aspirations, and the result, which was hardly to her mind, had taken the colour out of her cheeks. Mr. Archer, too, was somewhat absent, his thoughts were of a mingled strain; and even upon his usually impassive countenance there were betrayed successive depths of depression and starts of exultation, which the girl translated in terms of her own hopes and fears. But Jonathan was the most altered: he was strangely silent, hardly passing a word, and watched Mr. Archer with an eager and furtive eye. It seemed as if the idea that had so long hovered before him had now taken a more <b>solid</b> <b>shape,</b> and, while it still attracted, somewhat alarmed his imagination.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Congenital {{anophthalmos}} {{is a rare}} {{condition in}} which intervention {{at an early age}} can stimulate orbital expansion and maximise facial symmetry. Much is still unknown, however, regarding the degree of soft tissue and bony orbital growth achieved using the orbital expanders presently available. METHODS [...] A retrospective review of 59 congenitally anophthalmic orbits in 42 patients was carried out. RESULTS [...] The soft tissue and bony orbital expansion achieved using serial <b>solid</b> <b>shapes</b> is reported, and experience with hydrophilic expanders and inflatable silicone expanders is reviewed. CONCLUSION [...] Although serially fitted <b>solid</b> <b>shapes</b> in the orbit lead to increased expansion of orbital soft tissue and bone compared with no orbital implant, further orbital tissue enlargement is required. The inflatable silicone expander may allow more rapid and extensive orbital tissue expansion, but design changes are needed to achieve this...|$|R

50|$|A {{silhouette}} is {{the image}} of a person, animal, object or scene represented as a <b>solid</b> <b>shape</b> of a single color, usually black, with its edges matching the outline of the subject. The interior of a silhouette is featureless, and the whole is typically presented on a light background, usually white, or none at all. The silhouette differs from an outline, which depicts the edge of an object in a linear form, while a silhouette appears as a <b>solid</b> <b>shape.</b> Silhouette images may be created in any visual artistic media, but were first used to describe pieces of cut paper, which were then stuck to a backing in a contrasting colour, and often framed.|$|E
