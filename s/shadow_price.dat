One concept {{that is hard to}} understand is that of <b>shadow</b> <b>prices,</b> especially when they are used to reflect the imputed worth of scarce resources. Students should be taught that <b>shadow</b> <b>prices</b> must be interpreted as premiums over and above the costs of resources, as reflected by the coefficients in the linear program’s objective function.

50|$|The {{value of}} the <b>shadow</b> <b>price</b> can provide {{decision-makers}} with insights into problems. For instance if a constraint limits the amount of labor available to you to 40 hours per week, the <b>shadow</b> <b>price</b> {{will tell you how}} much you should be willing to pay for an additional hour of labor. If your <b>shadow</b> <b>price</b> is $10 for the labor constraint, for instance, you should pay no more than $10 an hour for additional labor. Labor costs of less than $10/hour will increase the objective value; labor costs of more than $10/hour will decrease the objective value. Labor costs of exactly $10 will cause the objective function value to remain the same.|$|E
50|$|Less formally, <b>shadow</b> <b>price</b> can {{be thought}} of as the cost of {{decisions}} made at the margin without consideration for the total cost.

The general expression derived makes no assumption about {{the objective of the}} firm, nor about the relationship between prices and associated marginal values. It can therefore accommodate, in addition to various firm objectives, the introduction of <b>shadow</b> <b>pricing</b> into the measurement of productivity growth. The theory is applied to the case of the Australian National Railways Commission (AN Rail), where excess staff levels, and the delivery of certain 'community service obligations' provide examples of the application of <b>shadow</b> <b>prices.</b> Rates of TFP growth are calculated by applying both the traditional formulation and the more general one accommodating any divergence between actual and <b>shadow</b> <b>prices.</b> When <b>shadow</b> <b>pricing</b> is accounted for, the average compound rate of TFP growth in AN Rail falls by up to 37 %. ...|$|R

50|$|More formally, the <b>shadow</b> <b>price</b> is {{the value}} of the Lagrange {{multiplier}} at the optimal solution, which means that it is the infinitesimal change in the objective function arising from an infinitesimal change in the constraint.

40|$|In a {{competitive}} constant-returns small open economy world prices are the appropriate <b>shadow</b> <b>prices</b> for traded goods in public sector cost-benefit analysis. If {{there are at}} least as many factors of production as there are goods produced and traded, it is straightforward to derive 'foreign-exchange-equivalent' factor <b>shadow</b> <b>prices.</b> Bertrand (American Economic Review, 1979) has argued that the case of more goods being produced and traded than there are factors (referred to as 'diversification' below) is of greater empirical relevance, and that in this case it is impossible to define factor <b>shadow</b> <b>prices.</b> In this paper, I argue that this view is incorrect, in the sense that if the economic forces which bring about the diversification of production are consistently and explicitly modelled, just enough information is available to define the factor <b>shadow</b> <b>prices.</b> The cases considered are: (i) a small open economy in which the government's objective is to influence the distribution of income, in which case diversification could only result from an irrational use of the policy tools available to the government; (ii) a small open economy in which there are political constraints on production levels in some activities, in which case world prices are not the correct <b>shadow</b> <b>prices</b> for the constrained activities; and (iii) a closed economy (which {{can be thought of as}} a model in which world prices are endogenous) in which the <b>shadow</b> <b>prices</b> of goods are not world prices.
