A small amount of phosphate was supplied during the extended fermentation, maintaining an active culture, by the normal autolysis of spent cells.

There have been many investigations on the interaction between the cutting edge and the material in the first and the second deformation zones {{in order to understand the}} mechanics of the process. Investigations on the third deformation zone, on the other hand, have been limited although it may have significant effects on the process and the machined part. Especially in finishing operations where <b>slow</b> <b>feed</b> rates are used, the contributions of the edge and flank contacts on the total cutting force can be substantial. Furthermore, the third zone determines the surface quality and the integrity due to its direct contact with the finished surface. Despite of these important effects of the third zone, there is lack of analytical and practical methods for modeling and predictions of the third deformation zone in metal cutting which is the focus of the thesis. In this study, an experimental analysis of cutting forces along with the thermal investigation of third deformation zone is presented. An orthogonal cutting model including a thermo-mechanical model with sticking and sliding contact zones is developed in order to determine the effects of hone radius and flank contact on cutting forces.

In Pacific Panama, Vitularia salebrosa attacks mollusks by drilling through their shells. The duration of attacks estimated by isotope sclerochronology of oyster shells collected during attacks in progress range from 90 to 230 days, while experimental observation of interactions documented one attack greater than 103 days. The prolonged nature of attacks suggests that V. salebrosa is best characterized as an ectoparasite than as a predator, which is the ancestral condition in the Muricidae. An ectoparasitic lifestyle is also evident in the unusual interaction traces of this species, which include foot scars, feeding tunnels and feeding tubes, specialized soft anatomy, and in the formation of male-female Pairs, which is consistent with protandrous hermaphroditism, as is typical in sedentary gastropods. To delay death of its host, V. salebrosa targets renewable resources when feeding, such as blood and digestive glands. A congener, Vitularia miliaris from the Indo-Pacific, has an identical feeding biology The origin and persistence of extremely <b>slow</b> <b>feeding</b> in the tropics challenges our present understanding of selective pressures influencing the evolution of muricid feeding behaviors and morphological adaptations. Previously, it has been suggested that faster feeding is advantageous because it permits predators to spend a greater proportion of time hiding in enemy-free refugia or to take additional prey, the energetic benefits of which could be translated into increased fecundity or defenses. The benefits of exceptionally <b>slow</b> <b>feeding</b> have received little consideration. In the microhabitat preferred by V. salebrosa (beneath boulders), it is possible that prolonged interactions with hosts decrease vulnerability to enemies by reducing the frequency of risky foraging events between feedings.

The two SBRs were operated in parallel under the same conditions of organic load (0. 85 gCOD l(- 1) d(- 1)) and sludge age (about 10 d), the only difference being {{the length of the}} feed: less than 1 min vs. 5 h. In this way the conditions of a plug flow reactor and of a completely mixed reactor were simulated. The two systems were compared on sludge settleability (related to filaments abundance and floc morphology), substrate uptake rates and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) storage rates. The main difference between the two systems was in the settling properties of the sludge: both SVI and effluent solids were higher in the system with <b>slow</b> <b>feed.</b> With regard to filamentous microorganisms, even though both reactors were inoculated with the same sludge with high concentration of filaments, they were rapidly washed out from both systems. Microscopic observations showed that the reason for the different settling properties of the two sludges was in the floc structure, which was more compact in the system operated with fast feed. These data support the theory of the role of diffusion inside the flocs in determining the settling properties of the sludge. The maximum substrate uptake rates and PHA storage rates were similar in the two systems, showing that also the microorganisms grown at a constant and low substrate concentration were able to quickly increase their activity and to store PHAs when {{in the presence of a}} sudden change in substrate concentration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Broiler breeder hens are {{subjected}} to feed withdrawal as production declines after about 30 weeks of age. This study investigated effects of fast and <b>slow</b> <b>feed</b> withdrawal rates in both high and low weight hens, since body weight influences energy needs and nutrient stores. Daily allotments accounted for weight differences {{between high and low}} weight groups while decreasing 20. 2 g per hen (12. 8 %) from peak production to 60 weeks in the slow withdrawal treatment, and 40. 4 g per hen (25. 6 %) in the fast withdrawal treatment. From 31 - 60 weeks, weight gain was greatest in slow (702 g), intermediate in high-fast (351 g), and least in the low-fast treatment (219 g). Egg production began earlier and was greater in the high than low weight treatment from 23 - 30 weeks, was unaffected by treatments from 31 - 40 weeks, was greater in the slow than fast withdrawal treatment from 41 - 50 weeks and was greater in the low than high weight treatment from 51 - 60 weeks. Total production was unaffected by weight but 4. 6 eggs per hen less in the fast relative to slow withdrawal treatment. The egg weight increase from 30 - 60 weeks was 1. 4 g less in the fast relative to slow withdrawal treatment. Feed efficiency was better in the low than high weight treatment, but only marginally reduced by the fast relative to slow withdrawal treatment. These results indicate low weight breeder hens produce similar egg numbers with greater efficiency than high weight hens. In addition, doubling the typical feed withdrawal rate limits body and egg weight increases, but since it reduces egg production it only minimally improves feed efficiency...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{enteral feeding}} {{practices}} are potentially modifiable {{risk factors for}} necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Observational studies suggest that conservative feeding regimens, including slowly advancing enteral feed volumes, {{reduce the risk of}} NEC. However, <b>slow</b> <b>feed</b> advancement may delay establishment of full enteral feeding and may be associated with metabolic and infectious morbidities secondary to prolonged exposure to parenteral nutrition. OBJECTIVES: To determine effects of slow rates of enteral feed advancement on the incidence of NEC, mortality, and other morbidities in very preterm or VLBW infants. SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard Cochrane Neonatal search strategy to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to June 2017), Embase (1980 to June 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to June 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, previous reviews, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that assessed effects of slow (up to 24 mL/kg/d) versus faster rates of advancement of enteral feed volumes upon the incidence of NEC in very preterm or VLBW infants. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently extracted data. We analysed treatment effects in individual trials and reported risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous data, and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with respective 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analyses and explored potential causes of heterogeneity via sensitivity analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence at the outcome level using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 10 RCTs in which a total of 3753 infants participated (2804 infants participated in one large trial). Most participants were stable very preterm infants of birth weight appropriate for gestation. About one-third of all participants were extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight (ELBW), and about one-fifth were small for gestational age (SGA), growth-restricted, or compromised in utero, as indicated by absent or reversed end-diastolic flow velocity (AREDFV) in the fetal umbilical artery. Trials typically defined slow advancement as daily increments of 15 to 20 mL/kg, and faster advancement as daily increments of 30 to 40 mL/kg. Trials generally were of good methodological quality, although none was blinded. Meta-analyses did not show effects on risk of NEC (typical RR 1. 07, 95 % CI 0. 83 to 1. 39; RD 0. 0, 95 % CI - 0. 01 to 0. 02) or all-cause mortality (typical RR 1. 15, 95 % CI 0. 93 to 1. 42; typical RD 0. 01, 95 % CI - 0. 01 to 0. 03). Subgroup analyses of extremely preterm or ELBW infants, or of SGA or growth-restricted or growth-compromised infants, showed no evidence of an effect on risk of NEC or death. <b>Slow</b> <b>feed</b> advancement delayed establishment of full enteral nutrition by between about one and five days. Meta-analysis showed borderline increased risk of invasive infection (typical RR 1. 15, 95 % CI 1. 00 to 1. 32; typical RD 0. 03, 95 % CI 0. 00 to 0. 05). The GRADE quality of evidence for primary outcomes was "moderate", downgraded from "high" because of lack of blinding in the included trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Available trial data do not provide evidence that advancing enteral feed volumes at daily increments of 15 to 20 mL/kg (compared with 30 to 40 mL/kg) reduces the risk of NEC or death in very preterm or VLBW infants, extremely preterm or ELBW infants, SGA or growth-restricted infants, or infants with antenatal AREDFV. Advancing the volume of enteral feeds at a slow rate results in several days of delay in establishing full enteral feeds and may increase the risk of invasive infection...|$|E
40|$|Production of {{polygalacturonic acid}} (PGA) trans-eliminase was greatly stimulated under {{conditions}} of restricted growth of Aeromonas liquefaciens. This was accomplished either by substrate restriction in a continuous-feeding culture or by restricting divalent cations in a batch culture, {{with the use of}} PGA as the sole source of carbon in a chemically defined medium containing inorganic nitrogen. <b>Slow</b> <b>feeding</b> of glucose, glycerol, or PGA to carbon-limited cultures allowed PGA trans-eliminase to be formed at a maximum differential rate 500 times greater than in batch cultures with excess substrate present.

Therefore, PGA trans-eliminase produced by A. liquefaciens, contrary to the current view, appears to be constitutive. These observations also indicate that production of PGA trans-eliminase is subject to catabolite repression and that limiting the substrate reverses this repression. It was also found that, {{under conditions of}} unrestricted growth, any compound which the bacteria can use as a source of carbon and energy repressed constitutive PGA trans-eliminase production.

50|$|When a {{microorganism}} {{is provided}} with a rapidly metabolizable carbon-energy source such as glucose, the resulting increase in the intracellular concentration of ATP leads to the repression of enzyme(s) biosynthesis, thus causing a slower metabolization of the energy source. This phenomenon is known as catabolite repression. Many enzymes, especially those involved in catabolic pathways, are subject to this repressive regulation. A powerful method of overcoming the catabolite repression in the enzyme biosynthesis is a fed-batch culture in which glucose concentration in the culture liquid is kept low, where growth is restricted, and the enzyme biosynthesis is derepressed. <b>Slow</b> <b>feeding</b> of glucose in penicillin fermentation by Penicillium chrysogenum is a classical example in the category.|$|R

However, the strategy based on the CuAAC methodology has not been guided by theory and relies on the very <b>slow</b> <b>feed</b> of polymer into a highly dilute reaction mixture of solvent and Cu catalyst. This leads to the production of monocyclic polymer in very low concentrations {{over long periods of time}} (> 10 h) and at high temperatures (> 100 degrees C). In this work we use the Jacobson-Stockmayer theory to predict the % monocyclic polystyrene (c-PSTY) in a one-pot reaction at 25 degrees C and find from an empirical relationship based on experimental diffusion-controlled rate coefficients for cyclization and condensation of alpha,omega-polymer chains that the Jacobson Stockmayer theory is applicable for the CuAAC reaction. This means the % monocyclic can be predicted from theory and is independent of reaction rate parameters (such as catalytic concentration and temperature) and only dependent on polymer concentration. Given this quantitative knowledge, we investigated the effect of 1 -PSTY concentration, temperature, feed rate, Cu(I) Br concentration, and linear-PSTY molecular weight to find the optimum conditions for the synthesis of monocyclic polymers. It was found that for feed rates greater than or equal to the reaction rate high % monocyclic polymers could be formed. Our strategy allowed us to produce c-PSTY (with 51 monomer units) with high purity (> 95 %) at a concentration of 1. 85 x 10 (- 3) M in less than 9 min at 25 degrees C.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} worpiece temperature and distortion in minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) deep-hole drilling. Due to {{the advantages of}} reducing machining cost and environmental impact, MQL has been widely implemented in production. However, deep-hole drilling is technically challenging for MQL application due to the poor capability for workpiece cooling. This research focuses on quantifying the heat flow to the workpiece {{as a function of}} depth and time and the associated thermal distortion in MQL deep-hole drilling. Heat sources in deep-hole drilling are not only from the drill-workpiece interface on the hole bottom surface (HBS), but also through the hole wall surface (HWS) due to high temperature chips and drill margin friction. The resulting heat flux from these factors on HWS is solved by the inverse heat transfer method. This method has demonstrated to be able to estimate the temporal and spatial distributions of HWS heat flux in both dry and MQL conditions. The importance of HWS heat flux in deep-hole drilling of ductile iron has also been analyzed. 	In MQL deep-hole drilling, air pressure and feed rate are important in HWS heat flux and workpiece temperature. These effects are investigated in a production MQL system and analyzed by the inverse heat transfer method. Chip accumulation under <b>slow</b> <b>feed</b> rate and low air pressure has shown to increase the heat flux on HWS significantly without being inspected by drilling torque and thrust force. Although the high air pressure can maintain a smooth chip evacuation under a slow drilling feed rate, it does not provide further improvement when the chips are evacuated properly under a high feed rate. 	Based on the heat flux calculation, a 3 -D finite element model is developed to predict the workpiece thermal distortion. This model excludes the advection removal of elements and the mechanical contact between drill and workpiece, thus it is more practical for implementation due to the reduced computation time. The accuracy of the model prediction is validated by measuring the distortion of an aluminum workpiece after drilling four deep-holes. Potential applications of this model include error compensation, optimization of clamping design and machining sequenc...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has made}} two {{significant}} contributions {{to the field of}} reactive crystallisation. First, new data from batch cooling crystallisation and semi-batch reactive crystallisation experiments of mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP) were obtained to describe the key factors that influence crystal nucleation and growth rates, crystal size distribution (CSD), and crystal shape. The second contribution is the development of a numerical scheme for solving the population balance equations, which can be used to describe the evolution of CSD during the crystallisation process. This scheme combines the finite difference method with a wavelet method, and is the first reported application of this approach for crystallisation modelling and simulation. Experiments into the batch cooling crystallisation of MAP were conducted both with and without seed crystals. The effects of key factors such as cooling rate, initial level of supersaturation and seeding technique, including seed concentration and seed size, on the real time supersaturation, final CSD, crystal yield and crystal shape were investigated. It was found that a seed concentration of 20 - 30 % effectively suppressed nucleation. The growth and nucleation rate were estimated by using an isothermal seeded batch approach and their parameters were calculated by non-linear optimisation techniques. The second series of experiments involved the semi-batch reactive crystallisation of MAP. Both single-feed and dual-feed systems were investigated. In the single-feed arrangement, an ammonia solution was fed into a charge of phosphoric acid. In the dual-feed system, phosphoric acid and ammonia solution were fed into a charge of saturated MAP solution. The molar ratio of the reactants, initial supersaturation, presence or absence of seed crystals, initial MAP concentration, reactants’ flow rate, feeding time and stirring speed were varied, and the effects upon the real time supersaturation, final CSD, crystal yield, crystal shape and solution temperature were measured. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that MAP can be produced in both the single-feed and dual-feed arrangements. For the single feed system, the N/P mole ratio controlled the degree of reaction and the CSD of the product. Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) was not be observed in the single-feed system due to its high solubility. In the dual-feed system, a seeded solution with <b>slow</b> <b>feed</b> addition, moderate stirring speed and a low initial supersaturation provided the most favourable conditions for generating a desirable supersaturation profile, and thus obtaining a product with good CSD and crystal shape. A comparative numerical study was undertaken in order to evaluate the existing numerical schemes for solving the population balance equations (PBE) that describe crystallisation. Several analytical solutions to the PBE were used to benchmark the following numerical schemes: Upwind Finite Difference, Biased Upwind Finite Difference, Orthogonal Collocation with Finite Elements, and Wavelet Orthogonal Collocation. The Wavelet Finite Difference (WFD) method has been applied {{here for the first time}} for solving PBE problems. The WFD scheme was adapted to solve the batch cooling and the semi-batch reactive crystallisation models, and the solutions were validated against experimental data that we obtained. In summary, the experimental data provide an improved understanding of MAPreaction and crystallisation mechanisms. The adaptability of the WFD method has beendemonstrated validating the two crystallisation systems, and this should help extendthe application of wavelet-based solutions beyond crystallisation processes and intomore diverse areas of chemical engineering...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} more complex, {{tailor-made}} macromolecules has increased, based on the everrising number of applications for synthetic polymers in biomedical fields and materials science. Recent advances in living radical polymerization (LRP) techniques have allowed for the synthesis of well-defined polymers and complex polymer architectures, especially when combined with coupling techniques such as the copper-catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). This ability has opened an investigative opportunity for controlling macromolecular self-assembly in solution by means of architectural design. Therefore, {{the main focus of}} this thesis was to synthesize polymers with complex architectures and to examine their self-association properties in water. Initially, five polymeric architectures with a systematic increase in architectural complexity were synthesized utilizing the CuAAC reactions from a toolbox of functional linear polymers and low molecular weight linkers. The amphiphilic architectures ranged from a simple 3 -miktoarm star block copolymer to the more complex third generation dendrimer-like block copolymer, consisting of polystyrene (PSTY) and polyacrylic acid (PAA). Subsequent micellization of these structures in water and characterization of the resultant spherical micelles provided insights into the effect of polymer architectural parameters on the self-assembly process. The next step was to investigate the influence of cyclic topology on the associative properties of polymers in water. The synthesis of cyclic polymers by coupling the end-groups of a linear polymer together using the CuAAC reaction has been used for many polymer systems. However, the strategy based on the CuAAC methodology has not been guided by theory and involved a very <b>slow</b> <b>feed</b> of polymer into a highly dilute reaction mixture of solvent and Cu catalyst. Therefore, as a first step, the Jacobson−Stockmayer theory was used to predict the percentage of monocyclic polystyrene (c-PSTY) in a one-pot reaction at 25 °C and a more appropriate empirical relationship based on experimental diffusion-controlled rate coefficients for cyclization and condensation of α,ω-polymer for the CuAAC reaction. Given this quantitative knowledge, the effect of l-PSTY concentration, temperature, feed rate, Cu(I) Br concentration and linear-PSTY molecular weight was investigated to find the optimum conditions for the synthesis of highly-pure monocyclic polymers. Strategies were also developed to produce high percentage of monocyclic polystyrene from parent l-PSTY with higher molecular weights. The kinetic simulations were then conducted {{to examine the effects of}} various experimental conditions on cyclization during the feed of α,ω-telechelic polymers into a reaction mixture. The simulations showed that the interplay between the feed rate and rate coefficients for cyclization and multiblock formation were the dominant and controlling parameters. The simulations were in good agreement with experimental results on cyclization of α,ω-telechelic polystyrene with different molecular vii weights by the CuAAC reaction. They also showed that high dilution was not a necessary condition for cyclization and that high percentages of monocyclic could be rapidly produced in solutions that are more concentrated. The theoretical and practical knowledge acquired for producing monocyclic polymers in high purity was utilized to develop a methodology for the synthesis of more complex architectures from functional linear and cyclic PSTY polymeric building blocks. Various topologies (from paddle-like to 3 -arm stars) could be produced with high conversion at 25 oC in short reaction times. Remarkably, this approach overcame significant steric hindrance, linking polymeric cyclic structures with high coupling efficiency. Finally, the synthesis of AB, AB 2 and A 2 B type block and miktoarm star copolymers was demonstrated, in which block A consisted of linear poly(tert-butyl acrylate) PtBA and block B consisted of cyclic polystyrene c-PSTY. These structures were produced using the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) to make telechelic polymers that, after modification, were further coupled together by copper catalyzed ‘click’ reactions with high coupling efficiency. Deprotection of PtBA to poly(acrylic acid) PAA afforded amphiphilic miktoarm structures that when micellized in water gave vesicle morphologies when the block length of PAA was 21 units. Increasing the PAA block length to 46 units produced spherical core-shell micelles. Analysis of AB 2 miktoarm star by AFFF showed that the packing density of the c-PSTY in the core was 4 times greater than that of its linear counterpart (a 4 times greater aggregation number for relatively similar micelle hydrodynamic diameter), the PAA corona arms extended into the water phase beyond the normal Gaussian chain conformation and were more compact on the surface. These results provided insights into the effect of a hydrophobic cyclic polymer attached to a hydrophilic linear block on the self-assembly process in water...|$|E

The wafers account for {{one third of the}} total module cost, as high purity (thus expensive) silicon is required. One way to decrease the solar electricity cost is to decrease the amount of silicon needed for a wafer, for instance by sawing thinner wafers. Another way is to increase the solar cell production line yield by producing stronger wafers and hence reducing the breakage rate. From a technological point of view, both ways are equivalent, as thinner wafers have to be comparatively stronger to sustain the processing stresses. The core of this work is the analysis and understanding of the impact of wire-sawing parameters on the wafer’s mechanical properties with the aim of sawing thinner and stronger wafers. Wafer wire-sawing consists of a wire transporting a slurry, made of abrasive silicon carbide particles and lubricant, through a silicon brick. Such a process is complex, as it involves dynamic processes, fracture mechanics, fluid dynamics as well as tribological aspects on various length-scales. In {{the first part of the}} work, characterisation methods were developed to quantify the wafer quality: roughness, crack depth distribution, breakage stress, wafer thickness and Raman measurements were carried out. Furthermore, a TEM study was made to get a precise view of the silicon just below the wafer surface, and the surface at the top of the sawing groove was analysed to get a fundamental understanding of the material removal mechanisms. Two parametric studies were carried out to get insight into the influence of the sawing parameters on these wafer properties. The parameters that were studied were the abrasive size distribution, the slurry density, the wire tension and the feed rate. The first campaign focused on large parameter variations in order to have a global view of the variables determining wire-sawing, whereas the second campaign concentrated on lower variations and a more thorough study of these parameters closer to their standard values. From these data, mechanisms of crack creation are proposed and a novel semi-analytical model describing the wafer strength as a function of the sawing parameters is given. It is based on physical interactions and allows a deeper understanding of the sawing mechanisms. Furthermore, the effect of the sawing parameters on the wafer thickness is analysed. From these campaigns, it is seen that stronger wafers are obtained by using a fine abrasive, a low wire tension and a <b>slow</b> <b>feed</b> rate. A third study about the silicon debris impact on the wafer quality was carried out. It is found that below a given debris amount, they have no effect, but over this threshold, sawmarks appear and the wafer strength quickly decreases. This is put in relation with the findings from the two first sawing campaigns and a novel mechanism explaining the saw-mark creation is proposed: the debris prevents the abrasive particles from removing silicon as fast as required by the feed rate. This makes the wire pressure on the particle increase, until a second material removal mechanism appear. This mechanism is faster than the usual one and allow the wire bow (as well as the pressure on the particles) to decrease so that the sawing proceeds in fits and stops. From all the analysis done, a better general picture of the sawing process was gained. Differences between the top and the side of the sawing groove are explained, as well as differences between the wire entrance and exit side of the ingot. At the top of the groove, the roughness is lower and presents more facets and sharp angles than at the side (which is also the wafer surface). This is explained by a faster material removal rate at the top of the groove and by a lower maximal pressure on the particles. At the side, the particles can apply large pressure on the silicon when there is not enough room for the wire and several large particles overtaking each other. On the other hand, the slow material removal rate at the groove side leaves the smaller particles enough time to smooth the angles. The particles are progressively ejected from the groove side, which accounts for a roughness diminution and a wafer thickness increase in the first half of the wafer length. In the second half of the wafer length, the roughness is constant but the thickness still increases, indicating that the abrasive particle volume fraction in the slurry diminishes, without a notable change in particle size. Finally, near the wafer edges, the wire vibrations outside the silicon also account for a thickness deacrease. In the last part, diamond-wire wafering was studied as an alternative to the standard slurry sawing. The wafer surface characteristics were analysed and compared with slurrysawn wafers. On the diamond-wire sawn wafer, a thick layer of amorphous silicon was found. It has repercussions on topography, as smooth grooves are forming the surface, but also on the internal stress near the wafer surface: large stress has been measured by Raman spectroscopy and by EBSD, over 1 GPa. By applying the conclusions from this work, it is possible to saw thin and strong wafers. This study brings a better understanding of the material removal process at the micrometer level, helping the optimisation of the sawing. Furthermore, the developped semi-analytical model giving the impact of the sawing parameters on the wafer strength is a useful tool for producing stronger wafers. Finally, the presented study on diamond-wire sawn wafers brings relevant insights into the challenges that have to be faced before this technology can be successfully used by the industry...|$|E

30|$|AIM interneurons are {{reported}} to mediate swim initiation by serotonin signaling (Vidal-Gadea et al. 2011) and mate-searching behavior of males by PDF- 1 neuropeptide signaling (Barrios et al. 2012). In contrast, {{little is known about}} their functions in feeding regulation. Here, we identified that AIM interneurons were inhibited by the crucial feeding modulator tyramine, and that resulted in feeding suppression. The tyraminergic neurons RIM/RIC share no direct synaptic connections with AIM neurons. But given the fact that these neurons localized very close to each other, {{it is possible that the}} signal transmission may be mediated by extrasynaptic tyramine receptors on AIM neurons. AIM interneurons are equipped with two kinds of classical neurotransmitters, glutamate and serotonin, as well as several neuropeptides (Li and Kim 2008; Serrano-Saiz et al. 2013; Sze et al. 2000). Among them, serotonin is known as a crucial neuromodulator that facilitates feeding (Avery and Horvitz 1990; Sze et al. 2000). The inhibition of AIM may block the serotonin release and result in <b>slower</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluorinated core−shell spheres {{have been}} {{synthesized}} using a novel semibatch emulsion polymerization protocol employing <b>slow</b> <b>feeding</b> of the initiator. The synthesis results in aqueous dispersions of highly monodisperse spheres bearing a well-defined poly(ethylene glycol) graft (PEGylation). Measurements {{are consistent with}} the synthesis achieving a high grafting density that moreover consists of a single PEG layer with the polymer significantly elongated beyond its radius of gyration in bulk. The fluorination of the core of the particles confers a low index of refraction such that the particles can be refractive index matched in water through addition of relatively small amounts of a cosolvent, which enables the use of optical and laser-based methods for studies of concentrated systems. The systems exhibit an extreme stability in NaCl solutions, but attractions among particles can be introduced by addition of other salts, in which case aggregation is shown to be reversible. The PEGylated sphere dispersions are expected to be ideally suited as model systems for studies of the effect of PEG-mediated interactions on, for instance, structure, dynamics, phase behavior, and rheology...|$|R

The evolution of the feeding kinetics of these protozoa shows a phase of adaptation of the predator to the prey, with a <b>slow</b> <b>feeding</b> rate and a phase of accelerate of feeding. The two phases are separated by a short period of recognition. The polynomial functions of the kinetics of predation show that C. uncinatum and P. africanum graze faster on E. coli than on Staphylococcus sp., meanwhile N. gigas feeds slowly on E. coli than on Staphylococcus sp. The time of contact between the ciliated protozoa and the bacteria, the predatory protozoa specie and the specie of the bacteria, should be considered simultaneously when evaluating the variation of bacterial concentrations in aquatic environment being purified...|$|R

Analysis of the end products showed an accumulation of ethyl alcohol in addition to butyrate and acetate, whereas, in the nonsporulating cultures, acetate and butyrate were the principal products. Incorporation of uniformly labeled 14 C-glucose by sporulating cells was three to four times higher than by nonsporulating cells. The efficiency of acetate assimilation into the lipid fraction of sporulating cells was at least two times higher than that of glucose. When starch was used as the carbon source, the growth rate was reduced; sporulation occurred, and the end products and carbon distribution were similar. Alcohol dehydrogenase, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were preferentially formed by sporulating cells. In vegetative cells, the formation of these enzymes was repressed if the glucose concentration in the medium was increased. The change in enzyme activity appeared to be related to a morphological change in the cells and indicated an altered metabolic pattern for sporulating cells...|$|R
40|$|Inducible {{synthesis}} of extracellular pectate lyase occurs in Erwinia carotovora, a bacterial soft-rot pathogen of plants, and, {{to a lesser}} extent, in a nonpathogenic isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens. A combination of pectin and a heat-labile factor in fresh potato tissue or acetone powders of the tissue provided the best carbon source for induction. Yields of inducible pectate lyase were much greater than those usually reported. The pathogen, but not the saprophyte, produced {{a small amount of}} constitutive enzyme when grown on glucose. The relatively low level or absence of constitutive synthesis in these bacteria did not result from catabolite repression. Attempts were made to relieve any existing catabolite repression by restricting growth through <b>slow</b> <b>feeding</b> of glucose or by growing the organisms on glycerol. These conditions did not significantly alter the differential rate of lyase synthesis compared with changes observed in the presence of inducers. Previous growth history did not affect induction in the pathogen. However, P. fluorescens previously cultured on glucose required 10 to 20 generations of growth on inducing medium before appreciable lyase synthesis occurred. Differences between the pathogen and nonpathogen suggest that regulation of pectate lyase synthesis is related to pathogenicity of soft-rot bacteria...|$|R

To investigate the mechanism of this early susceptibility, several cohorts of larvae at WCH were monitored for stable isotope incorporation and biochemical composition: one in May 2011 and two in August 2011.

Hence, the applied polymerization condition was indeed strong enough to efficiently facilitate polycondensation via "direct" Friedel-Crafts reaction without gelation.
