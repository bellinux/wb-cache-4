25|$|Edward hires {{a private}} investigator, Frank Wilson (Dominic Chianese), to follow her. Frank returns with {{pictures}} of Connie and Paul together, which devastates Edward. Connie's visits with Paul become more frequent, {{to the point that}} she is late to pick up Charlie from school. Following this incident, she realizes she can no longer carry on the affair. Unsuccessfully trying to end the affair over the phone, Connie decides {{it would be best to}} do so in person. She spots Paul with another woman walking down the street as she approaches his neighborhood in her SUV. After following and then confronting Paul, their argument ends in a tryst in the stairwell of his apartment building. At the same time, Edward is standing outside Paul's apartment building, where Edward and Connie narrowly miss each other as she leaves out the backdoor. Edward goes to Paul's apartment and confronts him, revealing that he is Connie's husband. Edward asks to come into Paul's apartment, and after Paul lets him in, he gives Edward some vodka and they talk about Connie. Edward asks how Paul and Connie met, and while walking around the apartment, Edward is stunned to see a snow globe by the bed, which he recognizes as a gift he gave to Connie. Paul reveals that Connie gave it to him as a gift. Feeling sick and disoriented, Edward <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed and Paul asks if he would like some water. Edward suddenly has a mental breakdown and hits Paul with the snow globe, severely fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.|$|E

500|$|When {{he learns}} that Bob (Tuc Watkins) and Lee (Kevin Rahm) {{are seeing a}} counselor, Tom (Doug Savant) {{suggests}} going to one with Lynette (Felicity Huffman), but she insists therapy is for [...] "losers". Tom starts seeing a therapist {{on his own and}} keeping a [...] "feelings" [...] journal, which he will not let Lynette read. Angrily, she visits the therapist, Dr. Graham (Jane Leeves), to defend herself from what she's sure is Tom's badmouthing. She admits she gets mad when she is not in control.
