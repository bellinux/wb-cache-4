5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive <b>solar</b> <b>flare,</b> that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E

30|$|Similar {{correlation}} between the flare duration and energy was observed in <b>solar</b> <b>flares.</b> The power-law slope for the {{correlation between}} the duration of <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> and X-ray fluence observed with the GOES is about 1 / 3 (Veronig et al. 2002). The {{correlation between the}} duration and peak flux observed with RESSI also shows similar power-law slope of approximately 0.2 (Christe et al. 2008). These similarity between <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> and superflares on solar-type stars suggests that <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> and superflares are caused by the same physical process (i.e., reconnection).|$|R

5|$|It is safe {{to observe}} the total phase of a solar eclipse {{directly}} only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality. During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, and possibly even a <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and {{on the opposite side}} of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Space {{observations}} of <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> {{such as those}} from Yohkoh, SOHO, TRACE, and RHESSI have revealed a lot of observational evidence of magnetic reconnection in solar flares: cusp-shaped arcades, reconnection inflows, plasmoids, etc. Thus it has been established, at least phenomeno-logically, that magnetic reconnection does occur in <b>solar</b> <b>flares.</b> However, a number of fundamental questions and puzzles still remain in the physics of reconnection in <b>solar</b> <b>flares.</b> In this paper, we discuss the recent progresses and future prospects {{in the study of}} magnetic reconnection in <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> from both theoretical and observational points of view.

25|$|Suddenly, Desmond is {{approached}} by Jupiter, {{a member of}} the First Civilization. He explains that the First Civilization had built numerous vaults to study methods to save the planet from destruction. All of the data collected was transmitted to a central vault, where the data was tested. None of the methods were effective, however, and they failed to stop the <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> from destroying their civilization. Jupiter shows Desmond the location of the central vault, which from the map is located somewhere in New York, and tells him that he must save the planet from an impending second <b>solar</b> <b>flare.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ironically, in the Autumn of 2003 after {{a series}} of {{particularly}} strong <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> MARIE started malfunctioning, probably as a result of being exposed to the <b>solar</b> <b>flare's</b> intense blast of particle radiation.

40|$|One of {{the methods}} of {{detection}} and analysis of <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> is observing the time variations of certain solar spectral lines. During <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> a raise of electron concentration occurs in Earth's ionosphere which results in amplitude and phase variations of the recorded very low frequency (VLF) waves. We compared {{the data obtained by}} the analysis of recorded VLF signals and line spectra for different <b>solar</b> <b>flares.</b> In this paper we treated the DHO VLF signal transmitted from Germany at the frequency of 23. 4 kHz recorded by the AWESOME system in Belgrade (Serbia) during <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> in the period between 10 : 40 UT and 13 : 00 UT on 2011 April 22...|$|R
30|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>flares</b> produce great {{enhancements}} {{in extreme}} ultaviolet (EUV) and X-ray radiations, which cause sudden and intense disturbances in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. Ionospheric effects of <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> or sudden ionospheric disturbances (SID), {{have been studied}} since 1960 s owing to their effects on radio communications and navigation systems. Most previous studies related to <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> have so far focused on the ionospheric responses (e.g., Afraimovich 2000; Leonovich et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2004, 2006; Mahajan et al. 2010; Tsurutani 2005; Wan et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2002; Zhang and Xiao 2005; Le et al. 2007, 2011, 2013; Liu et al. 2011). Compared to the research on the ionospheric responses to <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> the study on the thermospheric responses to <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> is relatively scarce. It {{may be due to}} the much less observation of the thermosphere than that of the ionosphere. The observations of the terrestrial effects of <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> have recently been extended to the neutral atmosphere. The neutral density data near 400  km has been obtained from accelerometer measurements of nongravitational accelerations on the Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites.|$|R
25|$|NASA {{reports that}} a massive, {{potentially}} damaging, Solar Superstorm (<b>Solar</b> <b>flare,</b> Coronal mass ejection, Solar EMP) event occurred on 23 July 2012, and barely missed Earth. There is an estimated 12% chance of a similar event occurring between 2012 and 2022.|$|E
25|$|The X-ray {{signatures}} of aluminium, magnesium and silicon {{were picked up}} by the C1XS X-ray camera.

25|$|The {{first true}} astrophysical gamma-ray sources were solar flares, which {{revealed}} the strong 2.223 MeV line predicted by Morrison. This line {{results from the}} formation of deuterium via the union of a neutron and proton; in a <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> the neutrons appear as secondaries from interactions of high-energy ions accelerated in the flare process. These first gamma-ray line observations were from OSO-3, OSO-7, and the Solar Maximum Mission, the latter spacecraft launched in 1980. The solar observations inspired theoretical work by Reuven Ramaty and others.|$|E
40|$|We {{address in}} detail the {{cellular}} automaton approach, developed for the case of <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> and {{compare it to the}} magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory.

50|$|Unlike <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> Hyder flares take a {{much longer}} time to reach peak intensity, as much as 30 to 80 minutes and then can {{continue}} for several hours. They have not caused any interference with Earthly communications like <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> and are rather weak.|$|R
40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>flares</b> are {{the biggest}} explosions in the solar system. They are {{important}} both for understanding explosive events in the Universe and for their impact on human technology and communications. The satellite-based HESSI is designed to study the explosive release of energy and the acceleration of electrons, protons, and other charged particles to high energies in <b>solar</b> <b>flares.</b> HESSI produces "color" movies of the Sun in high-energy X rays and gamma rays radiated by these energetic particles. HESSI's X-ray and gamma-ray images of flares are obtained using techniques {{similar to those used}} in radio interferometry. Ground-based radio observations of the Sun provide an important complement to the HESSI observations of <b>solar</b> <b>flares.</b> I will describe the HESSI Project and the high-energy aspects of <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> and how these relate to radio astronomy techniques and observations...|$|R
25|$|The ISS is {{partially}} {{protected from the}} space environment by Earth's magnetic field. From an average distance of about , depending on Solar activity, the magnetosphere begins to deflect solar wind around Earth and ISS. Solar flares are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive {{only a few minutes}} warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class <b>solar</b> <b>flare,</b> the crew of Expedition 10 took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the ROS designed for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Associated with solar flares is {{a release}} of high-energy protons. These {{particles}} can hit the Earth within 15 minutes to 2 hours of the <b>solar</b> <b>flare.</b> The protons spiral around and down the magnetic field lines of the Earth and penetrate into the atmosphere near the magnetic poles increasing the ionization of the D and E layers. PCA's typically last anywhere from about an hour to several days, {{with an average of}} around 24 to 36 hours. Coronal mass ejections can also release energetic protons that enhance D-region absorption in the polar regions.|$|E
25|$|A <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> is a {{phenomenon}} where the sun suddenly releases {{a great amount of}} solar radiation, much more than normal. Solar flares are unlikely to cause any direct injury, but can destroy electrical equipment. The potential of solar storms to cause disaster was seen during the 1859 Carrington event, which disrupted the telegraph network, and the March 1989 geomagnetic storm which blacked out Quebec. Some major known solar flares include the X20 event on August 16, 1989, and a similar flare on April 2, 2001. The most powerful flare ever recorded occurred on November 4, 2003 (estimated at between X40 and X45).|$|E
40|$|A good {{observation}} of preflare activities {{is important for}} us to understand the origin and triggering mechanism of <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> and to predict the occurrence of <b>solar</b> <b>flares.</b> This work presents the characteristics of microwave spectral fine structures as preflare activities of four <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> observed by Ondřejov radio spectrograph in the frequency range of 0. 8 [...] 2. 0 GHz. We found that these microwave bursts which occurred 1 [...] 4 minutes before the onset of flares have spectral fine structures with relatively weak intensities and very short timescales. They include microwave quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) with very short period of 0. 1 - 0. 3 s and dot bursts with millisecond timescales and narrow frequency bandwidths. Accompanying these microwave bursts, there are filament motions, plasma ejection or loop brightening on the EUV imaging observations and non-thermal hard X-ray emission enhancements observed by RHESSI. These facts may reveal certain independent non-thermal energy releasing processes and particle acceleration before the onset of <b>solar</b> <b>flares.</b> They may be conducive {{to understand the nature of}} <b>solar</b> <b>flares</b> and predict their occurrence...|$|R

25|$|A <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> is an {{explosion}} in a solar atmosphere and was originally detected visually in our own sun. Solar flares create massive amounts of radiation across the full electromagnetic spectrum from the longest wavelength, radio waves, to high energy gamma rays. The correlations of the high energy electrons energized during the flare and the gamma rays are mostly caused by nuclear combinations of high energy protons and other heavier ions. These gamma rays can be observed and allow scientists to determine the major results of the energy released, which is not provided by the emissions from other wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|Crew {{living on}} the International Space Station (ISS) are {{partially}} protected from the space environment by Earth's magnetic field, as the magnetosphere deflects solar wind around {{the earth and the}} ISS. Nevertheless, solar flares are powerful enough to warp and penetrate the magnetic defences, and so are still a hazard to the crew. The crew of Expedition 10 took shelter as a precaution in 2005 in a more heavily shielded part of the station designed for this purpose. However, beyond the limited protection of Earth's magnetosphere, interplanetary manned missions are much more vulnerable. Lawrence Townsend of the University of Tennessee and others have studied the most powerful <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> ever recorded. Radiation doses astronauts would receive from a flare of this magnitude could cause acute radiation sickness and possibly even death.|$|E
25|$|Without the {{protection}} of Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere astronauts are exposed {{to high levels of}} radiation. A year in low Earth orbit results in a dose of radiation 10 times that of the annual dose on earth. High levels of radiation damage lymphocytes, cells heavily involved in maintaining the immune system; this damage contributes to the lowered immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also recently been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Outside {{the protection}} of low Earth orbit, galactic cosmic rays present further challenges to human spaceflight, as the health threat from cosmic rays significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade or more of exposure. A NASA-supported study reported that radiation may harm the brain of astronauts and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease. <b>Solar</b> <b>flare</b> events (though rare) can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes. It is thought that protective shielding and protective drugs may ultimately lower the risks to an acceptable level.|$|E
