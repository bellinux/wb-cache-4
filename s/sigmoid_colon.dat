25|$|Left-sided diverticular disease (involving the <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon)</b> is {{most common}} in the West, while right-sided diverticular disease (involving the {{ascending}} colon) {{is more common in}} Asia and Africa. Among patients with diverticulosis, 4 to 15% may go on to develop diverticulitis.|$|E
25|$|Intraperitoneal {{parts of}} the GI tract are covered with serosa. These include most of the stomach, {{first part of the}} duodenum, all of the small intestine, caecum and appendix, {{transverse}} colon, <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon</b> and rectum. In these sections of the gut there is clear boundary between the gut and the surrounding tissue. These {{parts of the}} tract have a mesentery.|$|E
25|$|The {{mesentery}} becomes {{attached to}} the colon at the gastrointestinal margin and continues as the several mesenteries of the mesocolon, sometimes collectively called the mesenteric organ. The parts of the mesocolon take their names from {{the part of the}} colon to which they attach. These are the transverse mesocolon attaching to the transverse colon, the sigmoid mesocolon attaching to the <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon,</b> the mesoappendix attaching to the appendix, and the mesorectum attaching to the upper third of the rectum.|$|E

25|$|The first {{surgical}} approach {{consists in}} the resection and primary anastomosis. This {{first stage of}} surgery is performed on patients with a well vascularized, nonedematous and tension-free bowel. The proximal margin should be an area of pliable colon without hypertrophy or inflammation. The distal margin should extend to the upper third of the rectum where the taenia coalesces. Not all of the diverticula-bearing colon must be removed, since diverticula proximal to the descending or <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon</b> are unlikely to result in further symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The {{parts of}} the colon are either {{intraperitoneal}} or behind it in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs in general {{do not have a}} complete covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. Intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. Of the colon, the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon</b> are intraperitoneal. This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.|$|E
25|$|Diverticulitis {{most often}} affects the elderly. In Western countries, diverticular disease most {{commonly}} involves the <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon</b> (95 percent of patients).

Less than 5 percent of those aged 40 years and younger may also be affected by diverticular disease.|$|E

40|$|Gastric {{carcinoma}} is {{a common}} malignancy worldwide. Advanced stages of the disease may result in metastases to many other organs of the body. However, colonic metastases are rare. We report a case of gastric carcinoma with symptoms of abdominal fullness and weight loss. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was elevated. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed giant folds occupying the whole gastric body and poor expansion of the stomach. Histologic examination of biopsy specimens from the giant fold demonstrated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring-cell differentiation. Total colonoscopy revealed five or six discrete flat elevated lesions in the distal transverse, descending, and <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colons.</b> These lesions were characterized by a clear margin of 3 - 5 mm in diameter and erosions on the tips. Polypectomy specimens demonstrated signet ring-cell carcinoma, which was histologically similar to the specimens taken from the gastric lesion. We conclude {{that this was a}} rare case in which gastric signet ring-cell carcinoma had metastasized to the colon in the form of flat elevated lesions, combined with rapid and wide lymphatic spread to the thorax and abdomen in a clinical course as short as 46 days...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} characterizing the distribution of colorectal morphometrics. It uses three-dimensional region growing and topological thinning algorithms to determine and visualize the luminal volume and centreline of the colon, respectively. Total and segmental lengths, diameters, volumes, and tortuosity angles were then quantified. The effects of body orientations on these parameters were also examined. Variations in total length were predominately {{due to differences in}} the transverse <b>colon</b> and <b>sigmoid</b> segments, and did not significantly differ between body orientations. The diameter of the proximal colon was significantly larger than the distal colon, with the largest value at the ascending and cecum segments. The volume of the transverse colon was significantly the largest, while those of the descending colon and rectum were the smallest. The prone position showed a higher frequency of high angles and consequently found to be more torturous than the supine position. This study yielded a method for complete segmental measurements of healthy colorectal anatomy and its tortuosity. The transverse and <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colons</b> were the major determinant in tortuosity and morphometrics between body orientations. Quantitative understanding of these parameters may potentially help to facilitate colonoscopy techniques, accuracy of polyp spatial distribution detection, and design of novel endoscopic devices...|$|R
25|$|The {{descending}} colon {{is the part}} of the colon from the splenic flexure {{to the beginning of the}} <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon.</b> One function of the {{descending colon}} in the digestive system is to store feces that will be emptied into the rectum. It is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. In the other third, it has a (usually short) mesentery. The arterial supply comes via the left colic artery. The descending colon is also called the distal gut, as it is further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut. Gut flora are very dense in this region.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{approaches}} in rectal prolapse {{can be either}} perineal or abdominal. A perineal approach (or trans-perineal) refers to surgical access to the rectum and <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon</b> via incision around the anus and perineum (the area between the genitals and the anus). Abdominal approach (trans-abdominal approach) involves the surgeon cutting into the abdomen and gaining surgical access to the pelvic cavity. Procedures for rectal prolapse may involve fixation of the bowel (rectopexy), or resection (a portion removed), or both. Trans-anal (endo-anal) procedures are also described where access to the internal rectum is gained through the anus itself.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} {{from the}} ascending colon and proximal {{two-thirds of the}} transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. The lymph from the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon,</b> and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph nodes. The lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain to the internal iliac nodes. The anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes. The pectinate line only roughly marks this transition.|$|E
40|$|The main {{limiting}} factor for sodium absorption in distal colon is the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). In this study mechanisms {{involved in the}} dysregulation of EnaC expression in ulcerative colitis were characterized (UC). Epithelial preparations from surgically removed inflamed and control <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colons</b> were used. Active electrogenic Na+ transport (JNa) was determined after 8 -hour aldosterone stimulation in Ussing-chambers and corrected for the altered epithelial/subepithelial resistance ratio. ENaC alpha-, beta- and gamma-subunits were analyzed immunohistochemically and in Western and Northern blots (corrected for the inflammatory increase in subepithelial protein content). Also, the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on sodium transport and ENaC transkription were analyzed. In controls, aldosterone stimulated JNa and induced ENaC beta- and gamma-subunit expression, whereas this response was virtually abolished in UC. Preservation of surface epithelium in UC was indicated by unchanged ENaC alpha-subunit expression, which points also against a mere immaturity or epithelial cell loss. Inhibition of electrogenic sodium transport as well as beta- and gamma-ENaC mRNA expression could be mimicked in control colon by in vitro preexposure for 8 hours to tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma. It can be concluded that, in ulcerative colitis, elevated proinflammatory cytokines selectively impair beta- and gamma-ENaC expression, which contributes to diarrhea by reducing colonic sodium absorption...|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} {{surgical}} approaches to treat megacolon, {{such as a}} colectomy (removal of the entire colon) with ileorectal anastomosis (ligation of the remaining ileum and rectum segments), or a total proctocolectomy (removal of <b>colon,</b> <b>sigmoid</b> and rectum) followed by ileostomy or followed by ileoanal anastomosis.|$|R

25|$|Anal sex can {{exacerbate}} hemorrhoids {{and therefore}} result in bleeding; in other cases, {{the formation of}} a hemorrhoid is attributed to anal sex. If bleeding occurs as a result of anal sex, it may also be because of a tear in the anal or rectal tissues (an anal fissure) or perforation (a hole) in the colon, the latter of which being a serious medical issue that should be remedied by immediate medical attention. Because of the rectum's lack of elasticity, the anal mucous membrane being thin, and small blood vessels being present directly beneath the mucous membrane, tiny tears and bleeding in the rectum usually result from penetrative anal sex, though the bleeding is usually minor and therefore usually not visible. By contrast to other anal sexual behaviors, anal fisting poses a more serious danger of damage due to the deliberate stretching of the anal and rectal tissues; anal fisting injuries include anal sphincter lacerations and rectal and <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon</b> (rectosigmoid) perforation, which might result in death.|$|E
25|$|Other {{anomalies}} of {{the classic}} Potter sequence infant include a parrot beak nose, redundant skin, and the most common characteristic of infants with BRA which is a skin fold of tissue extending from the medial canthus across the cheek. The ears are slightly low and pressed against the head making them appear large. The adrenal glands often appear as small oval discs pressed against the posterior abdomen due {{to the absence of}} upward renal pressure. The bladder is often small, nondistensible and may be filled with a minute amount of fluid. In males the vas deferens and seminal vesicles may be absent, while in females the uterus and upper vagina may be absent. Other abnormalities include anal atresia, absence of the rectum and <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon,</b> esophageal and duodenal atresia, and a single umbilical artery. Presence of a diaphragmatic hernia is also common in these fetuses/infants. Additionally, the alveolar sacs of the lungs fail to properly develop {{as a result of the}} reduced volume of amniotic fluid. Labor is often induced between 22 and 36 weeks of gestation (however, some of these pregnancies may go to term) and unaborted infants typically survive for only a few minutes to a few hours. These infants will eventually die as either a result of pulmonary hypoplasia or renal failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} and {{factors contributing to}} normal continence are multiple and inter-related. The puborectalis sling, forming the anorectal angle (see diagram), is responsible for gross continence of solid stool. The IAS is an involuntary muscle, contributing about 55% of the resting anal pressure. Together with the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions, the IAS maintains continence of flatus and liquid during rest. The EAS is a voluntary muscle, doubling the pressure in the anal canal during contraction, which is possible for a short time. The rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) is an involuntary IAS relaxation in response to rectal distension, allowing some rectal contents to descend into the anal canal where it is brought into contact with specialized sensory mucosa to detect consistency. The rectoanal excitatory reflex (RAER) is an initial, semi-voluntary contraction of the EAS and puborectalis which in turn prevents incontinence following the RAIR. Other factors include the specialized anti-peristaltic function of {{the last part of}} the <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon,</b> which keeps the rectum empty most of the time, sensation in the lining of the rectum and the anal canal to detect when there is stool present, its consistency and quantity, and the presence of normal rectoanal reflexes and defecation cycle which completely evacuates stool from the rectum and anal canal. Problems affecting any of these {{mechanisms and}} factors may be involved in the cause.|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute sigmoid volvulus {{is one of}} the commonest {{causes of}} benign large-bowel obstruction. Its {{incidence}} varies considerably from one geographic area to another. This study reviews its management in a relatively high-prevalence area. Materials and Methods: All adult patients with acute sigmoid volvulus seen at the Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital (RVTH), Banjul, between September 2000 and January 2005 were retrospectively studied. Demographic data, clinical features, resuscitative measures, results of investigations, findings at surgery and postoperative course, and complications were retrieved from the patients&#x 2032; clinical records and analyzed. Results: A total of 48 patients, 45 (93. 8 &#x 0025;) males and 3 (6. 3 &#x 0025;) females, with a male: female ratio of 14. 3 : 1, age range of 19 to 78 years and mean age of 45. 8 &# 177; 17. 6 years underwent treatment for acute sigmoid volvulus. Twenty-one (43. 8 &#x 0025;) of the patients were aged 40 to 49 years. Two (4. 2 &#x 0025;) had rectal tube detortion followed by elective sigmoidectomy and primary anastomosis on the same admission, while 24 (50 &#x 0025;) had emergency laparotomy, at which bowel decompression, one-stage resection and primary anastomosis without on-table lavage were done. The rest of the patients, 22 (45. 8 &#x 0025;), had gangrenous <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colons</b> at laparotomy and consequently underwent resection and Hartmann&#x 2032;s procedure. Fourteen (29. 1 &#x 0025;) patients developed wound infection; and 5 (10. 4 &#x 0025;) had prolonged ileus, which was managed conservatively. There was no anastomotic leak. The mean hospital stay was 11. 1 days. There were 5 deaths, giving a mortality rate of 10. 4 &#x 0025;. Conclusion: Acute sigmoid volvulus in The Gambia is almost exclusively a male disease. Sigmoid colectomy and primary anastomosis can be carried out safely in those with viable colon without on-table colonic lavage...|$|R

40|$|Demand for {{colonoscopy}} {{is increasing}} {{because it is}} an important tool not only for screening of colorectal neoplasm but also for resec-tion of such lesions in early stage. Cecal intubation requires expertise on shortening of the examination time and improvement of the cecal intubation rate without causing pain to the patients. About 5 % to 10 % of patients still experience difficulties or failure of the cecal intubation. There are number of factors that affect the difficulty of the colonoscopy such as technical skill of the endoscopist, angulated <b>sigmoid,</b> redundant <b>colon,</b> advanced age, female gender, diverticular disease, and inadequate bowel preparation.

25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colon.</b> The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent {{evidence}} {{challenges the}} 'low-fibre/high-colonic intraluminal pressure' hypothesis of diverticular disease (DD) and {{raises the possibility}} that other mechanisms are involved. Although bowel wall smooth muscle is known to be hypercontractile in DD, the nature of its relaxation is unknown. The present study investigated colonic smooth muscle responses to nitric oxide, as well as the smooth muscle contents of neural nitric oxide and elastin associated with the disease. METHOD: Immunohistochemical/image analysis of antibodies to nitric oxide synthase (NOS 1), co-localized with protein gene product (PGP) and to elastin, was performed on three histological sections of <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colons</b> from 20 patients (10 DD, 10 controls) following resections for rectal tumours. Organ bath experiments examined smooth muscle responsiveness to nitroprusside, a nitric oxide donor. RESULTS: Uncomplicated diverticular longitudinal muscle showed lower nitric oxide immunoreactivity compared with controls: median percentage surface area of NOS 1 over PGP was 26. 0 % (range 0. 5 - 58. 3), controls 45. 0 % (35. 0 - 70. 1; P = 0. 018). Median percentage surface area of elastin was elevated, 21. 3 % (10. 6 - 45. 6), controls 8. 2 % (1. 7 - 13. 5; P = 0. 0002), together with a low sensitivity to nitroprusside [mean - log EC(50) 5. 3 (SD 0. 5), controls 6. 6 (SD 0. 5), difference 1. 3, 95 % CI 0. 8 - 1. 7; P < 0. 0001] and there were lower maximum relaxation responses to nitroprusside compared with controls: median percentage (relaxation induced by nitroprussside/contraction induced by bethanecol) was 52. 0 %, range (20. 0 - 92. 0), controls 100. 0 % (71. 0 - 125. 0), P < 0. 0001. No statistically significant differences were found in circular muscle, at the sample size studied. CONCLUSION: This study established, for the first time, specific abnormalities in longitudinal muscle relaxation and contents of neural nitric oxide and elastin in uncomplicated DD. These findings may have important implications for both colon structure and function in the disease...|$|R
40|$|Growth hormone (GH) plays {{a crucial}} role in {{stimulating}} and controlling the growth, metabolism and differentiation of many mammalian cell types by modulating the synthesis of multiple mRNA species and a paracrine or autocrine mechanism of action has been proposed. These effects are mediated by the binding of GH to its membrane-bound receptor and involve a phosphorylation cascade that results in the modulation of numerous signaling pathways. To address the side/mode of action through which GH exerts its effects, a panel of well characterized monoclonal antibodies, directed against the hormone binding side of the receptor, was applied to immunohistochemically determine growth hormone receptor (GH-receptor) expression in poorly- moderate- to well differentiated colorectal adenocarcinomas (n= 40) from the rectum, transverse-, ascending-, descending and <b>sigmoid</b> <b>colons.</b> Of five anti-growth hormone receptor monoclonal antibodies used, human GH- receptor specific Mab 263 consistently resulted in strong receptor expression in colorectal carcinoma tumour cells. Heterogeneity of immunoreactivity was found in primary and secondary tumour lesions with a variable range of positive cells. Staining was mainly intracellular, showing either a monotonous or granular pattern, with some nuclei also reactive. The presence of intracellular GH-receptors has been previously documented and is a result of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi localization. Immunoreactivity in surface columnar cells, independent from pathological tissue, was weak to moderate. Epithelial cells from normal tissue, adjacent to tumour lesions, were of variable intensity. Goblet and mucous cells located at the crypt base immunostained faintly or were negative for the GH-receptors. Crypt base columnar cells strongly expressed the GH-receptor, but oligomucous cells were less reactive. In conclusion, this study indicates that receptor expression may be associated with malignancy of colorectal carcinoma and supports the hypothesis that GH may act locally in colorectal tissue. The demonstration of the presence of receptors for GH will be useful for site-specific studies of the evolution of gastrointestinal tract tumours, providing valuable information concerning cellular growth kinetics and tumour prognosis. It also raises questions regarding the administration of GH to cancer-induced cachexia patients and the possible oncogenic potential of the GH-receptor...|$|R
