40|$|For {{parallel}} {{and distributed}} systems to gain wider acceptance {{than they have}} to date, they must become significantly easier to program. Fundamentally, parallel programming is more difficult than sequential programming as long as data and computation must be distributed by the programmer. Cache Only Memory Architectures (COMAs) provide a Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) where data distribution is performed automatically and transparently. This paper generalizes this idea {{to achieve the same}} distribution for computation, thus arriving at an automatic and transparent form of scheduling. Once computation distribution (scheduling) is as automatic and transparent as data distribution, parallel computers become approximately as easy to program as sequential computers. Where COMA literature normally makes no assumptions concerning the parallel programs which use the DSM, we use special compiler techniques originally developed for multithreaded and dataflow architectures.

Secondly,editing the program. finally using the Guangzhou NC machining to complete the process of NC machining simulation. The results show the processing form model design to simulation can be completed, the final results is almost ideals. The emergence and development of The NC machining automatic programming technology and the NC machining simulation technology satisfy the requirements that the processing manufacturing tends to be complicated and highly precise.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{characteristics}} of well-being behavior of women living in Daegu and analyze their well-being levels according to their socio-demographic variables, thereby determining the effects of each variable on well-being behavior. A survey of 320 women was conducted and T-test, ANOVA was conducted for the well-being levels and well-being behavior based on socio-demographic variables. Multiple regression analysis was analyze the factors affecting well-being behavior. The major findings of this study were as follows. A higher level of education led to a higher level of well-being. Moreover, educational or counseling workers, those with higher monthly incomes, those with higher expenses spent on self-management, those who considered their physical condition good, and those who drank once or twice a week showed higher levels of well-being. According to the analysis of the variables influencing well-being behavior, those with an older age, a higher level of education, and higher expenses for self-management and non-smokers revealed higher degrees of involvement in well-being behavior. We need to maintain women's identity by establishing values of and beliefs in well-being and inspiring them with healthy consciousness of well-being <b>so</b> that <b>we</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{processing}} subgraph queries on a database that consists {{of a set of}} graphs. The answer to a subgraph query is the set of graphs in the database that are supergraphs of the query. In this article, we propose an efficient index, FG*-index, to solve this problem. The cost of processing a subgraph query using most existing indexes mainly consists of two parts, the index probing cost and the candidate verification cost. Index probing is to find the query in the index, or to find the graphs from which we can generate a candidate answer set for the query. Candidate verification is to test whether each graph in the candidate set is indeed a supergraph of the query. We design FG*-index to minimize these two costs as follows. FG*-index consists of three components: the FG-index, the feature-index, and the FAQ-index. First, the FG-index employs the concept of Frequent subGraph (FG) to allow the set of queries that are FGs to be answered without candidate verification. We call this set of queries FG-queries. We can enlarge the set of FG-queries so that more queries can be answered without candidate verification; however, a larger set of FG-queries implies a larger FG-index and hence the index probing cost also increases. We propose the feature-index to reduce the index probing cost. The feature-index uses features to filter false results that are matched in the FG-index, <b>so</b> that <b>we</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R
40|$|AdS/CFT duality is a conjectured dual {{correspondence}} between the large $N$ limit of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) in $d$-dimensions and the supergravity (SUGRA) in $d+ 1 $-dimensional Anti de Sitter (AdS) space. By using this conjecture, we can study various properties of large $N$ CFT by simple calculations in SUGRA. Recently much {{attention has been paid}} to the Renormalization Group (RG) flow viewed from the SUGRA side. Such RG flow in CFT is known to be characterized by the c-function which connects CFTs with different central charges. Therefore, we are interested in deriving this c-function from SUGRA with the help of AdS/CFT correspondence. To derive the c-function, we calculate the conformal anomaly (CA) in SUGRA, since it is closely related to the central charge. In this thesis, we discuss the various aspects of CA from AdS/CFT duality, especially for the cases of SUGRA in 3 and 5 -dimensions which correspond to 2 and 4 -dimensional CFTs, respectively. It is known that the bosonic part of SUGRA with scalar (dilaton) and arbitrary scalar potential describes the special RG flows in dual quantum field theory. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> calculate dilaton-dependent <b>CA</b> from dilatonic gravity with arbitrary potential. After that, we propose candidates of c-functions from such dilatonic gravity and investigate the properties of them. Comment: LaTeX file, 79 pages, typos corrected and references adde...|$|R
