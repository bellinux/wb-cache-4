500|$|After {{years of}} {{speculation}} from Babylon 5 fans, Straczynski finally offered an extensive {{explanation of the}} origins and nature of spoo. He said spoo are tiny, pasty, mealworm-like creatures that travel slowly in herds. Their main behavior is sighing, which [...] "can reportedly induce unparalleled bouts of depression" [...] in other creatures. They are raised on ranches and harvested through [...] "whacking". Spoo are regarded with contempt by most species in Babylon 5; they [...] "are the only creatures of which the Interstellar Animal Rights Protection League <b>says,</b> <b>simply,</b> 'Kill 'em.'" [...] Despite this, they are [...] "generally considered the most delicious food in all of known space".|$|E

Brennan, Arthur Joseph Goldberg, Thurgood Marshall, Potter Stewart, William O. Douglas, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Chief Justice William Howard Taft, Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chief Justice Warren Burger, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Justice Black is buried {{to the right of}} the main {{cemetery}} entrance, and up a hill, 200 yards behind the Taft monument. Black's headstone is [...] "identical in size and shape to the tens of thousands of military headstones in Arlington." [...] It <b>says</b> <b>simply,</b> [...] "Hugo Lafayette Black, Captain, U. S.

500|$|Later, while cooking meth {{at their}} lab, Walter waits for Gus to arrive {{so he can}} kill him. Instead, Victor's {{replacement}} Tyrus (Ray Campbell) arrives with Mike, who informs Walter he will never see Gus again. That night, Walter drives to Gus' house and approaches with the gun, but before he can cross the street, Walter receives a call from Tyrus, who <b>says</b> <b>simply,</b> [...] "Go home, Walter." [...] The next day, as Walter approaches Mike at the bar, Mike tells Walter that he observed Walter tailing him to the bar. Mike then reveals he could tell that Walter was carrying a weapon in the lab. Walter suggests he and Mike {{are in the same}} danger, and Gus could easily kill Mike the same way he killed Victor. This visibly unnerves Mike, who appears to be aware of this. Walter asks that Mike get him in a room with Gus so he can kill him. In response, Mike punches Walter, knocking him to the floor, kicks him in the torso a few times and then leaves the bar.|$|E

500|$|Chief Justice John Roberts, {{joined by}} Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented and harshly criticized the majority's holding. After {{providing}} historical {{context for the}} separation of powers between the legislature and judiciary found in Article III of the United States Constitution, the Chief Justice explained that §8772 is a type of unconstitutional breach of {{the separation of powers}} between Congress and the judiciary [...] "whereby Congress assumes the role of judge and decides a particular case in the first instance." [...] In his view, §8772 is no different than a hypothetical law applying to a case Smith v. Jones in which the legislature <b>says</b> <b>simply</b> [...] "Smith wins". In the Chief Justice's view, §8772 was not a valid exercise of Congress' foreign affairs authority; he contended that Congress and the Executive branch have sufficient authority that they do not need to [...] "seize" [...] the judiciary's power to [...] "make a political decision look like a judicial one." [...] Quoting James Madison in Federalist No. 48, the Chief Justice lamented that this case [...] "will indeed become a blueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power at the judiciary's expense, feeding Congress's tendency to 'extend the sphere of its activity and draw all power into its impetuous vortex.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Heimskringla relates that Gunnhild {{lived for}} a time in a hut with two Finnish wizards and learned magic from them. The two wizards demanded sexual favors from her, so she induced Erik, who was {{returning}} from an expedition to Bjarmaland, to kill them. Erik then took her to her father's house and announced his intent to marry Gunnhild. The older Fagrskinna, however, <b>says</b> <b>simply</b> that Erik met Gunnhild during an expedition to the Finnish north, where she was being [...] "fostered and educated ... with Mǫttull, king of the Finns". Gunnhild's Finnish sojourn is described by historian Marlene Ciklamini as a [...] "fable" [...] designed to set the stage for placing the blame for Erik's future misrule on his wife.|$|E

2500|$|By 2008, it {{had emerged}} in the media that Ichiro was known within {{baseball}} for his tradition of exhorting the American League team with a profanity-laced pregame speech in the clubhouse prior to the MLB All-Star Game.

In another 30-second extended clip, Bruce discusses the homosexual context within the songs of Dongalor's favorite singer, Yodeling Yourick, especially in the songs [...] "You Make My Glory Whole" [...] and [...] "Blowing Snowflakes". In a third 30-second, the peasant girl laughs at a joke from Lord Roderick and tells Dongalor it's the first time she's laughed since he killed her father; Dongalor replies, [...] "Oh, so you're going to bring that up every time we're together." [...] In a fourth 24-second clip, Dongalor orders Barnabus to conceal the Eye of Gulga Grymna and offers the peasant girl some turtle soup, then looks at her chest and <b>says</b> <b>simply,</b> [...] "Breasts".

2500|$|Similarly, reading [...] "My {{ordinances}} ( [...] , mishpatai) shall you do, and My statutes ( [...] , chukotai) shall you keep," [...] the Sifra distinguished [...] "ordinances" [...] ( [...] , mishpatim) from [...] "statutes" [...] ( [...] , chukim). The term [...] "ordinances" [...] ( [...] , mishpatim), {{taught the}} Sifra, refers to rules that even {{had they not}} been written in the Torah, {{it would have been}} entirely logical to write them, like laws pertaining to theft, sexual immorality, idolatry, blasphemy and murder. The term [...] "statutes" [...] ( [...] , chukim), taught the Sifra, refers to those rules that the impulse to do evil ( [...] , yetzer hara) and {{the nations of the world}} try to undermine, like eating pork (prohibited by [...] and [...] ), wearing wool-linen mixtures ( [...] , shatnez, prohibited by [...] and [...] ), release from levirate marriage ( [...] , chalitzah, mandated by [...] ), purification of a person affected by skin disease ( [...] , metzora, regulated in [...] ), and the goat sent off into the wilderness (the scapegoat, regulated in [...] ).

2500|$|The Zohar {{found in}} God's Attributes as {{expressed}} in [...] components of God's essential Name. In the Zohar, Rabbi Simeon taught from the Book of Mystery that the Divine Name has both a revealed and a concealed form. In its revealed form, it is written as the four-letter Name of God, the Tetragrammaton, but in its undisclosed form it is written in other letters, and this undisclosed form represents the most Recondite of all. In the Zohar, Rabbi Judah taught that even the revealed form of the Name is hidden under other letters (as the name ADoNaY, , is hidden within ADNY, [...] ) in order to screen the most Recondite of all. In the letters of God's Name are concealed 22 attributes of Mercy, namely, the 13 attributes of God in [...] and nine attributes of the Mikroprosopus, the lesser revealed aspect of God. They all combine in one composite Name. When people were more reverent, the priests openly enunciated the Name in the hearing of all, but after irreverence became widespread, the Name became concealed under other letters. At {{the time when the}} Name was disclosed, the priest would concentrate his mind on its deep and inner meaning, and he would utter the Name {{in such a way as}} to accord with that meaning. But when irreverence became common in the world, he would conceal all within the written letters. The Zohar taught that Moses uttered the 22 letters in two sections, first in [...] in the attributes of God, and second in [...] when he uttered nine attributes of Mercy that are inherent in the Mikroprosopus, and which are radiated from the light of God. All this the priest combined together when he spread forth his hands to bless the people pursuant to [...] so that all the worlds received God's blessings. It is for this reason that [...] <b>says</b> <b>simply</b> [...] "saying" [...] ( [...] , amor), instead of the imperative form [...] "say" [...] ( [...] , imri), in a reference to the hidden letters within the words of the Priestly Blessing. The word , amor has in its letters the numerical value of 248 minus one ( [...] equals 1; [...] equals 40; [...] equals 6; [...] equals 200; and 1 + 40 + 6 + 200 = 247), equal to the number of a man's bodily parts, excepting the one part on which all the rest depend.

6000|$|Now {{the notable}} {{things in this}} {{description}} are, first, the evident subservience of the whole landscape to human comfort, to the foot, the taste, or the smell; and, secondly, that throughout the passage {{there is not a}} single figurative word expressive of the things being in any wise other than plain grass, fruit, or flower. I have used the term [...] "spring" [...] of the fountains, because, without doubt, Homer means that they sprang forth brightly, having their source at the foot of the rocks (as copious fountains nearly always have); but Homer does not say [...] "spring," [...] he <b>says</b> <b>simply</b> flow, and uses only one word for [...] "growing softly," [...] or [...] "richly," [...] of the tall trees, the vine, and the violets.
