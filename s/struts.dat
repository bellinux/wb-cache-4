5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, {{and based on the}} features of the Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler referred to it as the Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to The Original Series into the ship. One of these was narrow <b>struts</b> leading from the body of the ship to the warp nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge {{at the front of the}} nacelles, and later described that the original <b>struts</b> would have been around a third more than those.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Tarbosaurus was {{completely}} described {{for the first}} time in 2003. Scientists noted key differences between Tarbosaurus and the North American tyrannosaurids. Many of these differences are related to the handling of stress by the skull bones during a bite. When the upper jaw bit down on an object, force was transmitted up through the maxilla, the primary tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw, into surrounding skull bones. In North American tyrannosaurids, this force went from the maxilla into the fused nasal bones on top of the snout, which were firmly connected in the rear to the lacrimal bones by bony <b>struts.</b> These <b>struts</b> locked the two bones together, suggesting that force was then transmitted from the nasals to the lacrimals.|$|E
5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} more {{flexible}} than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of <b>struts,</b> rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the articular bone.|$|E
50|$|A <b>strut</b> bar is {{designed}} to reduce this <b>strut</b> tower flex by tying the two <b>strut</b> towers together. This transmits the load off each <b>strut</b> tower during cornering which ties the two towers together and reduces chassis flex. To accomplish this effectively (especially on MacPherson <b>strut</b> suspensions), the bar must be rigid throughout its length.|$|R
50|$|The Chapman <b>strut</b> {{is often}} {{confused}} with the MacPherson <b>strut,</b> as both use a near-vertical upper <b>strut,</b> The distinction is that the MacPherson <b>strut</b> always requires a lower track control arm where the Chapman uses the drive shaft and a light radius rod.|$|R

5|$|MacPherson <b>struts</b> {{are used}} in the front suspension, and an unusual three-link De Dion tube/Watt's linkage is used in the rear. Front discs with {{anti-lock}} braking (ABS) and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) are standard across the range. In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen-inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on the fronts and wider 175/55 on the rears, in an effort to minimise the chances of oversteer caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|Pied currawongs are {{generally}} tree-dwelling, hunting and foraging some metres above the ground, and thus {{able to share}} territory with the ground-foraging Australian magpie. Birds roost in forested areas or large trees at night, disperse to forage {{in the early morning}} and return in the late afternoon. Although often solitary or encountered in small groups, the species may form larger flocks of fifty or more birds in autumn and winter. On the ground, a pied currawong hops or <b>struts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{engine was}} mounted on two main support frames that were {{supported}} by two tubular <b>struts.</b> The frame structure was triangulated and emanated from the fuselage. The main frames were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|Defects of {{the lateral}} crura can be {{corrected}} {{with a flat}} <b>strut</b> of formed cartilage, but, if {{the support of the}} medial crura is absent, then a columella <b>strut</b> must be inserted, and attached {{at the level of the}} anterior nasal spine. If a <b>strut</b> of nasal-septum cartilage proves too weak, then a rib cartilage <b>strut</b> can be applied to provide the adequate nasal support; afterwards, the <b>strut</b> is covered with onlay grafts.|$|R
40|$|A fin-stiffened <b>strut</b> concept which {{possesses}} high {{bending stiffness}} and low packaged volume {{has been identified}} for use on large space structures. The concept incorporates three curved fins which deploy from a core tube to increase the effective cross-sectional moment of inertia, the buckling load, and the vibration frequency of the <b>strut.</b> A <b>strut</b> design incorporating welded fin connections provides an upper bound of the <b>strut</b> buckling load. A <b>strut</b> design which allows the individual fins and core to move independently in the <b>strut</b> axial direction provides a lower bound of the <b>strut</b> buckling load which is approximately 20 to 25 percent of the upper bound. A practical <b>strut</b> design, incorporating hinge assemblies which constrain the fins to move together but independently of the core tube in the <b>strut</b> axial direction, provides a buckling load which is 75 to 80 percent of the upper bound. Euler's equation {{can be used to}} accurately predict buckling loads for the bounding designs. Flat plate finite element models of all designs give results that agree to within 10 percent of the experimental values. Equivalent beam models of the <b>strut</b> give results which are slightly less accurate...|$|R

5|$|A concave line of {{abrasion}} {{and polishing}} {{can be found}} on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument. These have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and <b>struts</b> which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E
5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D printing equipment. The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support <b>struts.</b> The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost savings of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus lacked these bony <b>struts,</b> and the {{connection}} between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards projection of the maxilla was massively developed in Tarbosaurus and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in Tarbosaurus. The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the frontal and prefrontal bones in Tarbosaurus. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{experimental study}} investigating the <b>strut</b> compression strength of deep beams without stirrups by array of varying <b>strut</b> angles and concrete strengths is presented. The specimens {{were designed to}} <b>strut</b> failure, eliminating unwarranted coupled failure modes. The discrepancies of dependent parameters in <b>strut</b> efficiency factors were reconciled with provisions in design standards, along with various researchers’ proposals. It was affirmed that a single constant value is best to represent the <b>strut</b> efficiency, echoing the design recommendation in ACI 318 - 11. Nonetheless, a less-conservative recommendation was put forward based on the experiment and a suite of supplementary filtered database results. A compatible lower-bound shear limit to prevent <b>strut</b> failure was set forth to unify the <b>strut</b> strength and sectional shear stress limit through a generic linear shear enhancement factor.

5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel <b>struts</b> without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical <b>struts</b> from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The {{unpressurized}} rotodome is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two <b>struts.</b> It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} great {{diversity}} in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or pedicel by which scales {{are attached to the}} substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior lamella. The upper surface, or superior lamella, has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held apart by <b>struts</b> called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} study of a piezoceramic active truss is presented. This active <b>strut</b> is unique in that the piezoceramic configurations allow the stroke length of the <b>strut</b> not {{to be dependent on}} the piezoceramic material's expansion range but on the deflection range of the piezoceramic bender segment. A finite element model of a piezoceramic <b>strut</b> segment was constructed. Piezoceramic actuation was simulated using thermally induced strains. This model yielded information on the stiffness and force range of a bender element. The static and dynamic properties of the <b>strut</b> were identified experimentally.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} different stent parameters {{on the development of}} restenosis, so as to provide references and basis for the design of stent forms. Methods: Stents were categorized into groups according to stent unite length, <b>strut</b> number, <b>strut</b> cross-section diameter, stent depth into fluid, <b>strut</b> cross-section shape. The influence of different parameter settings on wall shear stress distributions was investigated based on three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Results: The <b>strut</b> cross-section diameter had the most obvious impact on wall shear stress. It would lead to the increase of low wall shear stress area with shorter stent unite length, more <b>strut</b> number, larger <b>strut</b> cross-section diameter and deeper stent depth into the fluid. In comparison with triangular and square cross-section shape, the low shear stress area was much smaller by using stent with circular cross-section. Conclusions: It is suggested that the circular cross-section shape should be adopted in stent design, with preference to reducing <b>strut</b> cross-section diameter, <b>strut</b> number and stent depth into the fluid, while increasing stent unite length...|$|R
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type <b>struts</b> that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E

Breeding generally takes place from May to September except {{in the case of}} the South-eastern subspecies, which nests during summer (December to February). Pairs of the subspecies samueli in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia may produce two broods, while those of South-eastern subspecies only produce one. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. Hollows can be 1 to 2metres (3–7ft) deep and 0.25–0.5metres (10–20in) wide, with a base of woodchips. A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.|$|E
5|$|When the Phase II {{series was}} in development, {{original}} series designer Matt Jefferies updated the Enterprise design to feature a larger saucer with twin elevators (turbolifts) to the bridge, a wider secondary hull, docking ports, a dedicated photon torpedo weapon assembly {{at the base}} of the ship's neck, and angled <b>struts</b> supporting the nacelles. The nacelles themselves were completely changed to less cylindrical shapes and designed to feature glowing grilles on the sides. Likewise, an orbiting drydock, space office complex, and V'ger has been designed by artist Mike Minor. At the time Phase II was cancelled a roughly five foot long model of the Enterprise was under construction by Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures, and models of the drydock and V'ger were under construction as well. All of these models were abandoned, unfinished (although a Brick Price Enterprise was repurposed as the exploded Enterprise wreck in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock).|$|E

5|$|While the C9 {{project was}} well advanced, PSA {{already had a}} crowded lineup in the large vehicle segment, {{including}} the legendary Citroën CX, the slow-selling Peugeot 604 and the newly launched Peugeot 505. But with so much having already been invested in the project, PSA decided to press ahead and complete the development of C9, albeit with modifications to allow the use of shared parts with other PSA models. The Simca {{double wishbone front suspension}} gave way to MacPherson <b>struts</b> adopted from the Peugeot 505 and 604, and the rear axle was replaced with that of the 505, much narrower than the one originally planned, as it was designed with respect to the 505 body width. The C9 front end was extended to accommodate the optional PRV engine: now that the model belonged to PSA, using the PRV presented no problems.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting <b>struts</b> built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
5|$|During the Song dynasty, {{previous}} works on architecture {{were brought to}} more sophisticated levels of description, as in Yili Shigong, written by Li Ruogui in 1193 AD. One of the most definitive works, however, was the earlier Mu Jing ("Timberwork Manual"), ascribed to Yu Hao and written sometime between 965 and 995. Yu Hao {{was responsible for the}} construction of a wooden pagoda tower in Kaifeng, which was destroyed by lightning and replaced by the brick Iron Pagoda soon after. In his time, books on architecture were still considered a lowly scholarly achievement due to the craft's status, so Mu Jing was not even recorded in the official court bibliography. Although the book itself was lost to history, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo wrote of Yu's work extensively in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, praising it as a work of architectural genius, saying that no one in his own time could reproduce such a work. Shen Kuo singled out, among other passages, a scene in which Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan-architect about slanting <b>struts</b> in order to brace a pagoda against the wind, and a passage in which Yu Hao describes the three sections of a building, the area above the crossbeams, the area above ground, and the foundation, and then proceeds to provide proportional ratios and construction techniques for each section.|$|E
