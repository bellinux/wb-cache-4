At the end of the questionnaire, there have been identifying issues that divided the students into different segments. In my bachelor thesis I evaluated research on two identifiers; gender and vision for <b>their</b> <b>future</b> careers. Based on the data, I developed statistical tables, which I evaluated by using graphs. The results obtained show that, regardless of gender and ideas about future careers most of the students expressed their consent to the medical care throughout the EU which should be at a comparable level and equally available in all Member States. The greatest degree of disagreement was about the federative structure of the Union. However, students, who <b>see</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> as employees in the private sector in the foreign company, viewed the structure of the EU more positively than others.

30|$|A look at {{different}} career paths in Table  2, Panel C, reveals a few {{differences in the}} specific type of empirical research adopted by some doctoral students. Doctoral students {{who would like to}} stay in academia are more likely to use commercial databases for their empirical research, while doctoral students who <b>see</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> in practice more often use surveys. Moreover, the table shows that no significant differences between career paths in academia and practice exist with respect to verbal-analytical research. In fact, nearly 60 % of doctoral students aiming at a position in academia (also) employ verbal-analytical reasoning in their dissertation. Although this difference is not significant, it is also noteworthy that prospective academics tend to adopt multiple methods, while a larger proportion of doctoral students going into practice uses only a single method in their dissertations.|$|R

40|$|Future {{expectations}} of youth surviving {{on the streets}} of Porto Alegre, Brasil, were examined. The sample consisted of 35 boys and 34 girls aged 10 – 18 (M age 14. 4) who participated in a sentence completion task and semi-structured interviews. Responses to two incomplete sentences regarding the future revealed a mismatch between hoped-for and expected events. When completing the sentence, “In the future, I hope…” the majority of youth gave optimistic (but generally non-specific) responses. In contrast, the sentence “For me, the future…” elicited more pessimistic responses. Few gender or age-related differences emerged. Findings are discussed in light of prior research with general populations of adolescents as well as studies of street youth. Taken as a whole, results suggest that life on the street shapes and constrains how youth <b>see</b> <b>their</b> <b>futures.</b> Implications of the findings for policy makers and practitioners are addressed...|$|R

The results indicated that more than ten years after Hong Kong’s retrocession to China, some institutions were more strongly endorsed in 2009 than in 1999 but others registered a lower level of endorsement.
