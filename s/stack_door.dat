40|$|Crossdocking is a {{logistic}} technique {{which seeks}} to reduce costs related to inventory holding, order picking, transportation {{as well as the}} delivery time. Most of the existing studies in the area are interested in the dock assignment problem and the design of the crossdock transportation networks. Little attention has been given to the transshipment operations inside a crossdocking platform. In this article, we study the transshipment scheduling problem in a simple crossdock with a single strip door and single <b>stack</b> <b>door.</b> We propose a graph based model for the problem. The shortest path in the graph gives the schedule which minimizes the total cost of transshipment operations. Keywords: Crossdocking, Scheduling, Graphs, Shortest path...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a non-linear integer programming {{model for a}} cross-dock problem that considers the total transportation cost of inbound and outbound trucks from an origin to a destination and {{the total cost of}} assigning strip and <b>stack</b> <b>doors</b> to trucks based on their number of trips and the distance between doors in cross-dock. In previous studies these two cost-based problems are modeled separately however it is more realistic and practical to use both of them as an integrated cross-docking model. Additionally this model is solved for a randomly generated numerical example with three suppliers and two customers by the use of a genetic algorithm. By comparing two different parameter levels i. e. low and high numbers of populations the optimum solution is obtained considering a high level population size. A number of strip and <b>stack</b> <b>doors</b> are equal to a number of inbound and outbound trucks in the same sequence as 4 and 6 respectively. Finally the conclusion is presented...|$|R
40|$|Cross-docking is a {{logistics}} management concept {{that has been}} gaining global recognition in less-than-truckload logistics industries and retail firms. In cross-docking terminals, shipments are unloaded from inbound trucks at strip doors, consolidated insider cross-docks according to their destinations, and then, loaded into outbound tucks at <b>stack</b> <b>doors.</b> The goal of cross-docking is to reduce inventory and order picking which {{are the two most}} costly functions of traditional warehousing management. The sequence in which the inbound and outbound trucks have to be processed at the cross-dock is crucial for improving the efficiency of cross-docking systems. In this thesis we introduce an integer programming formulation and apply four heuristic algorithms: a local search, a simulated annealing, a large neighborhood search and a beam search, to schedule the trucks in a cross-docking terminal so as to minimize the total operational time...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a genetic algorithm for assigning doors in LTL (less-than-truckload) breakbulk terminals. Typically, strip (incoming freight) <b>doors</b> and <b>stack</b> (outgoing freight) <b>doors</b> {{are assigned to}} city areas. Incoming trailer loads are broken up and moved to appropriate outgoing trailers. The objective is to minimize the total weighted travel distance, a surrogate for labor cost and cycle time. The underlying problem is a Quadratic Assignment Problem. The experiments are based on real-world data...|$|R
5000|$|Yellow Fever - 500 produced, {{painted in}} Solar Yellow {{exterior}} paint and black [...] "fanged" [...] stripe {{on top of}} hood, came with two-tone interior which featured a yellow center <b>stack</b> bezel, yellow <b>door</b> spears, yellow stitching on steering wheel, seats and Regular Cab manual transmission shifter and yellow embroidering on the SRT-10 floor mats. Also came with special Yellow Fever Edition badges and a serialized Yellow Fever dash plaque. Available as a 2005 model.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first modern}} direct-pull {{electromagnetic}} lock {{was designed by}} Sumner [...] "Irving" [...] Saphirstein in 1969 for initial installation on doors at the Montreal Forum. Fire concerns by local authorities in locking the doors at the Forum prompted management to find a locking solution that would be safe during a fire incident. Saphirstein initially proposed to use a linear <b>stack</b> of <b>door</b> holders to work as an electromagnetic lock. These door holders were traditionally used to hold doors open, but in this application Saphirstein believed {{that they could be}} packaged and adapted to work as a fail-safe lock. After a successful prototype and installation at the Forum, Saphirstein continued evolving and improving the design and established the Locknetics company to develop accessories and control circuits for electromagnetic locks.|$|R
5000|$|This new car {{added to}} the extreme look of the Mystic Cobra by adding a unique feature beyond the paint itself, a color {{shifting}} leather interior. Satisfied with the exterior hue, Eggly and the Ford Special Vehicle Team {{turned their attention to}} the interior. [...] "The interior needed something special to complement the stunning exterior," [...] says Eggly. [...] "We considered spraying hard parts, like the center <b>stack</b> or <b>door</b> handles, with Mystichrome paint. Then I recalled a Ford supplier, Garden State Tanning (GST), had developed leather colored with ChromaFlair pigments." [...] According to Eggly [...] "The paint and interior trim perfectly complement the dramatic style and explosive performance of the SVT Mustang Cobra." [...] Only 1010 Mystchrome Cobras were produced for the 2004 production year with 515 in coupe form and 495 in convertible.|$|R
25|$|Inmates Robert Wright, Jimmy Loughnan, Arthur Gallagher, David McGauley and Ricky Morris {{from one}} side of the unit, and convicted Russell Street bomber Craig Minogue and three other inmates on the other side, sealed off their section doors with a tennis net. Mattresses and other bedding were then <b>stacked</b> against the <b>doors</b> and set on fire. Wright, Loughnan, Gallagher, McGauley and Morris died in the blaze, while Minogue and the three others were {{evacuated}} and survived.|$|R
50|$|On the 6 October 2006, the BF Mk II {{was officially}} {{launched}} by former Ford Australia President Tom Gorman. BF Falcon MkII {{went on sale}} 22 October 2006. The XT, Futura and Fairmont sport a facelift, with a new bonnet, headlights, grille and front and rear bumpers, while the XR range gets some minor interior updates. The {{top of the range}} Fairmont Ghia benefitted most from the BF Mark II upgrade compared to the other models in the range, including more chrome and diamond finished alloy wheels. The Fairmont Ghia also featured sportier body kit with side skirts designed to make the car more attractive to younger buyers. Inside, the Fairmont Ghia featured a piano black finish on the centre <b>stack,</b> chrome plated <b>door</b> handles and a brushed aluminium appearance on the instrument cluster.|$|R
60|$|In {{this way}} the months slipped by, and Christmas came round again. The evening before, the youth {{went down to the}} rocks and into the copse, {{collecting}} all the drift wood the sea had washed up or the gale had blown down, and he piled it up in a great <b>stack</b> outside the <b>door,</b> so that he might not have to fetch any all the next day. As soon as his task was done, he paused and looked out towards the mainland, thinking of Christmas Eve last year, and the merry dance they had had. The night was still and cold, and by the help of the Northern Lights he could almost sea across to the opposite coast, when, suddenly, he noticed a boat, which seemed steering straight for the island. At first he could hardly stand for joy, the chance of speaking to another man was so delightful; but as the boat drew near there was something, he could not tell what, that was different from the boats which he had been used to all his life, and when it touched the shore he saw that the people that filled it were beings of another world than ours. Then he hastily stepped behind the wood stack, and waited for what might happen next.|$|R
