25|$|When <b>solid</b> <b>biomass</b> {{is already}} in a {{suitable}} form (such as firewood), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When <b>solid</b> <b>biomass</b> is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from , which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce wood pellets, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with {{a broad range of}} input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} and properties of waste in a landfill, and its evolution over time, {{are difficult to}} estimate because of the heterogeneity of materials, biomass degradation, density, cover material, and infiltration of water. In this work, a lysimeter was used to simulate how refuse from mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) plants evolved in a landfill over a 45 -day period. Water was added {{as a way to}} imitate the effects produced during rainy seasons. Field capacity and changes in the physical and chemical properties (volatile <b>solids,</b> <b>biomass,</b> and heating value) were analyzed. The results of this research show that the percentage of biomass lowers, and the heating value increases, after bringing about infiltration and percolation of water in the waste mass. Therefore in order to stabilize waste in a landfill, employing irrigation or leachate recirculation could be advisable. As the heating value increases after percolation, it could also {{be a good idea to}} recover the fuel material after stabilization...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{electrochemical}} hydrogen removal (EHR) {{together with}} carbon dioxide removal (CDR) was demonstrated {{for the first}} time using a continuous hydrogen producing fermenter. CDR alone was found to increase hydrogen yields from 0. 07 mol H 2 molhexose to 0. 72 mol H 2 molhexose. When CDR was combined with EHR, hydrogen yields increased further to 1. 79 mol H 2 molhexose. The pattern of carbohydrate utilisation and volatile fatty acid (VFA) production are consistent with the hypothesis that increased yields are the result of relieving end product inhibition and inhibition of microbial hydrogen consumption. In situ removal of hydrogen and carbon dioxide as demonstrated here not only increase hydrogen yield but also produces a relatively pure product gas and unlike other approaches can be used to enhance conventional, mesophilic, CSTR type fermentation of low grade/high <b>solids</b> <b>biomass.</b> The authors would like to acknowledge the participation of Hydrogen Efficiency Technologies (HyET).

40|$|Optimal {{design and}} {{operation}} of a planned full-scale UASB reactor at a dairy farm are determined using optimization algorithms based on steady state simulations of a dynamic AD process model combined with models of the reactor temperature and heat exchanger temperatures based on energy balances. Available feedstock is 6 m 3 /d dairy manure produced by the herd. Three alternative optimization problems are solved: Maximization of produced methane gas flow, minimization of reactor volume, and maximization of power surplus. Constraints of the optimization problems are an upper limit of the VFA concentration, and an upper limit of the feed rate corresponding to a normal animal waste production at the farm. The most proper optimization problem appears to be minimization of the reactor volume, assuming that the feed rate is fixed at its upper limit and that the VFA concentration is at its upper limit. The optimal result is a power surplus of 49. 8 MWh/y, a hydraulic retention time of 6. 1 d, and a reactor temperature of 35. 9 °C, assuming heat recovery with an heat exchanger, and perfect reactor heat transfer insulation.
