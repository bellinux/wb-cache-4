40|$|Confinement of {{breeding}} {{sows and gilts}} {{is one of the}} most controversial issues in livestock production and there is worldwide interest in finding alternative housing systems for gestating sows and gilts. The present study was conducted to measure aspects of the. welfare of gestating <b>sows</b> housed <b>in</b> either large groups on deep litter (Hoops) or conventional stalls (Stalls). Six hundred and forty sows were studied, with 40 recently mated sows entering each treatment each week over an 8 -week period. Large groups were formed by 40 experimental and 45 non-experimental (n = 85) animals per group. <b>Sows</b> <b>in</b> Hoops had a higher (P < 0. 001) number of scratches, presumably due to fighting, particularly in the first week of gestation (25 vs. 3. 3 scratches/sow). In addition, there was a strong tendency (P = 0. 06) for higher salivary cortisol concentrations in week 1 of gestation <b>in</b> the <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> large group housing (6. 29 vs. 4. 03 nM), which may correspond to increased aggression as reflected by more scratches and a higher (P < 0. 01) return rate to oestrus between 19 and 43 days after mating (13. 2 % vs. 7. 4 %). <b>Sows</b> <b>in</b> Stalls had a higher (P < 0. 01) incidence of lameness at 9 weeks of gestation (7 % vs. 0 %), and this treatment difference became more pronounced (P < 0. 001) later in gestation (13. 8 % vs 0. 8 %. at week 15). There was evidence that the capability of the immune system of the <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the Stalls treatment, perhaps as a consequence of stress, was reduced late <b>in</b> gestation: <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the Stalls treatment had a higher (P < 0. 05) percentage of neutrophils (46 % vs. 41 %) and a lower (P < 0. 05) number and percentage of lymphocytes (4. 59 x 106 vs. 5. 16 x 106 c/mI and 41. 6 % vs. 46. 5 %) and consequently a higher neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (1. 22 vs. 0. 94, P < 0. 05) than <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the large groups on deep litter. There was a strong tendency (P =. 0. 06) for a higher reproductive failure in the Hoops treatment (27. 3 % vs. 14. 5 %). The Stalls treatment had a higher (P < 0. 001) farrowing rate (76. 8 % vs. 66 %) and while <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> Stalls weaned less piglets (P < 0. 01) per litter (8. 31 vs. 8. 97), the average weaning weight of these piglets was higher (P < 0. 005) than <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> Hoops (8. 69 kg vs. 8. 01 kg). The combination of these reproductive parameters shows that the <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the Stall treatment weaned the equivalent of 46 more piglets per hundred mated sows. The results of this experiment suggest that <b>sows</b> housed <b>in</b> large groups on deep litter may have faced greater welfare challenges in the early stages of gestation whereas <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> Stalls may have experienced greater welfare challenges later in gestation. However, further more detailed research on the welfare of gestating <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> these two housing systems is clearly required.

40|$|Currently, swine {{building}} ventilation {{design is}} based on heat and moisture rates measured in the 1950 s and 1970 s. Advancements in genetics, nutrition and management practices to increase productivity and pork quality during this period likely have led to considerable changes in heat and moisture production rates of the animals and their housing systems. This study quantifies total heat production rate (THP), house-level moisture production rate (MP) and house-level sensible heat production rate (SHP) of a 4300 -sow breeding, gestation, and farrowing facility in Iowa for 17 consecutive months. THP was determined using indirect animal calorimetry, MP was determined from mass balance, and SHP was calculated as the difference between THP and latent heat production (LHP). A Mobile Air Emission Monitoring Unit (MAEMU) was installed to monitor the deep-pit breeding-early gestation barn (1800 head), the deep-pit late gestation barn (1800 head), and two shallow-pit (pull-plug) farrowing rooms (40 head per room). This paper reports on data collected from February 2012 through {{the completion of the}} study in June 2013. Preliminary results from the study show that THP averages 373 W/sow for <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the breeding/early gestation stage, 376 W/sow for <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the late gestation stage, and 1191 W/sow+litter for <b>sows</b> and litters <b>in</b> the lactation stage. The house-level MP averages 198 g/hr-sow for <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the breeding/early gestation stage, 192 g/hr-sow for <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the late gestation stage, 818 g/hr-sow for <b>sows</b> and litters <b>in</b> the lactation stage.
