They drove her to a remote pine stand off of South Berkeley Lake Road in Gwinnett County near Duluth and buried Mackle in a <b>shallow</b> <b>trench</b> inside of a fiberglass-reinforced box. The box was outfitted with an air pump, a battery-powered lamp, water laced with sedatives, and food. Two plastic pipes provided Mackle with outside air.|$|E
25|$|Mine warfare began {{soon after}} a front line was {{established}} {{but the most}} extensive mining took place further north at La Boisselle and during 1915, the area around Mametz became a comparative backwater. The Germans began systematic fortification of the area, according to a directive from Erich von Falkenhayn the German army Chief of Staff, to fortify the Western Front so that {{a small number of}} infantry could defend the front indefinitely and later in the year began work on second and third defensive positions but in the Somme area, the defences north of the Bapaume–Albert were improved first and by July 1916 the first position defences around Mametz were extensive but the second position was a <b>shallow</b> <b>trench</b> and the third position had only been marked out.|$|E
25|$|The Duffel redoubt was {{evacuated}} on 3 October {{after the}} garrison {{ran out of}} ammunition and German artillery-fire was switched to fort Kessel on the flank of the break-in. Next day German super-heavy guns began to bombard the fort, which forced the garrison to abandon the fort and German preparations for {{an attack on the}} line of the Nete were made, opposite Lier at the junction of the Grote and Kleine Nete and Duffel. The Royal Marine Brigade arrived opposite Lier in requisitioned London buses on 4 October and occupied a position around the northern fringe of Lier, {{which turned out to be}} sections of a <b>shallow</b> <b>trench</b> between hedgerows, with one strand of wire in front. Some skirmishing took place in the town and the position was bombarded by German artillery, against which the British had no reply except from an armoured train. German attacks between the Grote and Kleine Nete, forced back the defenders and crossed the Dendre; attempts were made to cross the Scheldt at Schoonaarde and Dendermonde.|$|E

25|$|The third {{position}} was incomplete {{and the second}} {{position was}} not as elaborate as the defences to the north but all available labour was absorbed in keeping the first position in repair during the preparatory bombardment. In the 12th Division area, the second position was only a <b>shallow</b> <b>trench</b> and work had only begun on the third position. The front position had been made more formidable, with the strong points of The Castle, along with Glatz and Pommiers redoubts, made by blocking trenches and encircling them with barbed wire. Montauban had been fortified and a trench dug around the south side. Bavarian Infantry Regiment 6, of the 10th Bavarian Division held the German front line from the north bank of the Somme to the road between Montauban and Carnoy, {{with the rest of}} the division in reserve near Bapaume or in the line near Thiepval. The 12th Division was in support, Infantry Regiment 63 opposite the French XX Corps and Infantry Regiment 62 behind Montauban. Reserve Infantry Regiment 109 of the 28th Reserve Division held the line from the Carnoy road westwards to Mametz.|$|E
25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (<b>shallow</b> <b>trench</b> isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are very different from what we use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regiment}} was to {{have been}} relieved on the night of [...] but only [...] companies of Infantry Regiment 23 got through the British artillery-fire, the rest collecting at Montauban. Deep dugouts in the front line had not been damaged but there were few dugouts in the rearward lines, which led to most of the garrison being congregated in the front trench. A second position existed about [...] further back from Maurepas to Guillemont, Longueveal and the Bazentin villages but {{was little more than a}} <b>shallow</b> <b>trench.</b> The artillery of the 28th Reserve Division was accurately bombarded during the British artillery preparation and by 1 July many of the guns were out of action. Telephone communication was cut and machine guns in Danzig Alley (East) and the north end of Mametz were blown up by shells or made unserviceable.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] Transbay Tube {{has also}} {{required}} earthquake retrofitting. The immersed tube {{lies in a}} <b>shallow</b> <b>trench</b> dredged {{on the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay, and was anchored to the bottom by packing around the sides and top with mud and gravel. This fill may be prone to soil liquefaction during an earthquake, which could allow the buoyant hollow tube to break loose from its anchorages. Retrofitting outside the tube compacted the fill, to make it denser and less prone to liquefaction. Inside the tube, BART installed heavy steel plates, to reduce sideways movement in an earthquake. The work was performed between March and December 2013, and BART closed one of the two bores of the tube early on some weeknights. Trains shared a single tunnel between Embarcadero and West Oakland after 10 pm, with travel delays of 15–20 minutes. The work, estimated to take 14 months, was completed after 8 months.|$|E
2500|$|Caesium binds {{tightly to}} clay {{minerals}} such as illite and montmorillonite; hence it {{remains in the}} upper layers of soil {{where it can be}} accessed by plants with shallow roots (such as grass). [...] Hence grass and mushrooms can carry a considerable amount of 137Cs which can be transferred to humans through the food chain. [...] One of the best countermeasures in dairy farming against 137Cs is to mix up the soil by deeply ploughing the soil. [...] This has the effect of putting the 137Cs out of reach of the shallow roots of the grass, hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered. [...] Also, after a nuclear war or serious accident, the removal of top few cm of soil and its burial in a <b>shallow</b> <b>trench</b> will reduce the long term gamma dose to humans due to 137Cs as the gamma photons will be attenuated by their passage through the soil. [...] The more remote the trench is from humans and the deeper the trench is the better the degree of protection which will be afforded to the human population.|$|E

60|$|Then {{they went}} back to the shore. It was {{littered}} thickly with fragments of wreck, casks, boxes, and other articles. Here, too, were nearly a score of the corpses of their shipmates.

When Amadu cried again, the moving figures fell apart on either hand, and Dane was left with their leader and the bearers beside a <b>shallow</b> <b>trench,</b> on which one shaft of sunlight fell. He cast his ragged hat down on the sand, and in a voice which seemed to belong to some other person recited such fragmentary portions of the last office as he could remember.

50|$|Construction of {{the horse}} began in September 2002. The work to build the horse was {{completed}} entirely by hand.

These trenches were then filled with limestone slabs. The entire figure is approximately 90 metres long, measured from the front to the rear hoof.|$|R
60|$|Very little {{conference was}} needed, when all were bent upon one desperate purpose, infuriated with liquor, and flushed with {{successful}} riot. The word {{being given to}} surround the house, some climbed the gates, or dropped into the <b>shallow</b> <b>trench</b> and scaled the garden wall, while others pulled down the solid iron fence, and while they made a breach to enter by, made deadly weapons of the bars. The house being completely encircled, {{a small number of}} men were despatched to break open a tool-shed in the garden; and during their absence on this errand, the remainder contented themselves with knocking violently at the doors, and calling to those within, to come down and open them on peril of their lives.|$|E
60|$|Up {{out of the}} <b>shallow</b> <b>trench</b> sprang comrades on {{each side}} of Dorn. No rats to be cornered in a hole! Dorn seemed drawn by {{powerful}} hauling chains. He did not need to climb! Four big Germans appeared simultaneously upon the embankment of bags. They were shooting. One swung aloft an arm and closed fist. He yelled like a demon. He was a bomb-thrower. On the instant a bullet hit Dorn, tearing at the side of his head, stinging excruciatingly, knocking him down, flooding his face with blood. The shock, like a weight, held him down, but he was not dazed. A body, khaki-clad, rolled down beside him, convulsively flopped against him. He bounded erect, his ears filled with a hoarse and clicking din, his heart strangely lifting in his breast.|$|E
60|$|When {{the moon}} arose he again {{examined}} the body, and took from its clothing a few articles of identification and some papers of formality and precision, which he vaguely conjectured {{to be some}} law papers from their resemblance to the phrasing of sheriffs' and electors' notices which {{he had seen in}} the papers. He then buried the corpse in a <b>shallow</b> <b>trench,</b> which he dug {{by the light of the}} moon. He had no question of responsibility; his pioneer training had not included coroners' inquests in its experience; in giving the body a speedy and secure burial from predatory animals he did what one frontiersman would do for another--what he hoped might be done for him. If his previous unaccountable feelings returned occasionally, it was not from that; but rather from some uneasiness in regard to his late guest's possible feelings, and a regret that he had not been here at the finding of the body. That it would in some way have explained his own accident he did not doubt.|$|E
50|$|Chunuk Bair {{was hard}} to defend, it was only {{possible}} to scrape <b>shallow</b> <b>trenches</b> amongst the rocks and the peak was exposed to fire from the main Ottoman line on Battleship Hill {{to the south and}} from Hill Q to the north.

50|$|The 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment {{arrived in}} the Arawe area on the {{afternoon}} of 29 December, and conducted several small and unsuccessful attacks in early January 1944 before taking up positions about 400 - 500 yd north of the American MLR.

60|$|However, to propitiate the Hungry Folk, he {{made one}} of them leader of the ship expedition.

60|$|A little {{distance}} from Gubbins' house the procession joined a larger {{one with the}} day's victims from {{the other parts of}} the garrison--a total of twenty-four, young and old. At the head of the procession walked the Rev. Mr. Polehampton, one of the chaplains, who was distinguished for the bravery and self-devotion with which he labored among the sick and wounded. The service on which they were now engaged was in itself dangerous, for the churchyard was very exposed to the enemy's fire, and-- for they were throughout the siege remarkably well-informed of what was taking place within the Residency--every evening they opened a heavy fire {{in the direction of the}} spot where they knew a portion of the garrison would be engaged in this sad avocation. Quietly and steadily the little procession moved along, though bullets whistled and shells hissed around them. Each stretcher with an adult body was carried by four soldiers, while some of the little ones' bodies were carried by their mothers as if alive. Mrs. Hargreaves and her daughter carried between them the tray on which the body of little Rupert Righton lay. Arrived at the churchyard, a long <b>shallow</b> <b>trench,</b> six feet wide, had been prepared, and in this, side by side, the dead were tenderly placed. Then Mr. Polehampton spoke a few words of prayer and comfort, and the mourners turned away, happily without one of them having been struck by the bullets which sang around, while some of the soldiers speedily filled in the grave.|$|E
60|$|It was now {{past two}} o'clock, and the dawn had begun; so that I had no further trouble {{for want of}} light. I wheeled the coffin to a patch of loamy soil which I had noticed in the {{afternoon}} near the grave of the holy sisters. I had warmed to my work; my neck no longer pained me; and I began to dig vigorously, soon making a <b>shallow</b> <b>trench,</b> deep enough to hide the coffin {{with the addition of}} a mound. The chill pearl-coloured morning had by this time quite dissipated the darkness. I could see, and was myself visible, for miles around. This alarmed, and made me impatient to finish my task. Nevertheless, I was forced to rest for a moment before placing the coffin in the trench. I wiped my brow and wrists, and again looked about me. The tomb of the holy women, a massive slab supported on four stone spheres, was grey and wet with dew. Near it was the thornbush covered with rags, the newest of which were growing gaudy in the radiance which was stretching up from the coast on the east. It was time to finish my work. I seized the truck; laid it alongside the grave; and gradually pried the coffin off with the spade until it rolled over into the trench with a hollow sound like a drunken remonstrance from the sleeper within. I shovelled the earth round and over it, working as fast as possible. In less than a quarter of an hour it was buried. Ten minutes more sufficed to make the mound symmetrical, and to clear the adjacent ward. Then I flung down the spade; threw up my arms; and vented a sigh of relief and triumph. But I recoiled as I saw that I was standing on a barren common, covered with furze. No product of man's handiwork was near me except my truck and spade and the grave of Brimstone Billy, now as lonely as before. I turned towards the water. On the opposite bank was the cemetery, with the tomb of the holy women, the thornbush with its rags stirring in the morning breeze, and the broken mud wall. The ruined chapel was there, too, not a stone shaken from its crumbling walls, not a sign to shew that it and its precinct were less rooted in their place than the eternal hills around.|$|E
60|$|Half an {{hour before}} dawn on the 17th, the cavalry were mounted, {{and as soon as}} the light was strong enough to find a way through the broken ground, the {{squadron}} started in search of the missing troops. We had heard no more of their guns since about two o'clock. We therefore concluded they had beaten off the enemy. There might, of course, be another reason for their silence. As we drew near Bilot, it was possible to distinguish the figures of men moving about the walls and houses. The advanced files rode cautiously forward. Suddenly they cantered up to the wall and we knew some at least were alive. Captain Cole, turning to his squadron, lifted his hand. The sowars, actuated by a common impulse, rose in their stirrups and began to cheer. But there was no response. Nor was this strange. The village was a shambles. In an angle of the outside wall, protected on the third side by a <b>shallow</b> <b>trench,</b> were the survivors of the fight. All around lay the corpses of men and mules. The bodies of five or six native soldiers were being buried in a hurriedly dug grave. It was thought that, as they were Mahommedans, their resting-place would be respected by the tribesmen. [These bodies were afterwards dug up and mutilated by the natives: a foul act which excited the fury and indignation of soldiers of every creed in the force. I draw the reader's attention to this unpleasant subject, only to justify what I have said in an earlier chapter of the degradation of mind in which the savages of the mountains are sunk.] Eighteen wounded men lay side by side in a roofless hut. Their faces, drawn by pain and anxiety, looked ghastly in the pale light of the early morning. Two officers, one with his left hand smashed, the other shot through both legs, were patiently waiting for the moment when the improvised tourniquets could be removed and some relief afforded to their sufferings. The brigadier, his khaki coat stained with the blood from a wound on his head, was talking to his only staff-officer, whose helmet displayed a bullet-hole. The most ardent lover of realism would have been satisfied. Food, doolies, and doctors soon arrived. The wounded were brought to the field hospitals to be attended to. The unwounded hurried back to camp to get breakfast and a bath. In half an hour, the ill-omened spot was occupied only by the few sowars engaged in shooting the wounded mules, and by the vultures who watched the proceedings with an expectant interest.|$|E
5|$|On {{capturing}} the second-line, {{elements of the}} Liverpool Scottish decided to consolidate the <b>shallow</b> <b>trenches</b> that afforded little protection. The battle had quickly degenerated into a disorganised and chaotic affair, with British battalions losing cohesion and becoming mixed up with each other. An intensive German barrage decimated the occupants of the second-line trenches, while the 10th's temporary commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.G. Thin, was wounded by gunfire. The remainder of the Liverpool Scottish continued onto the third-line with portions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and 1st Northumberland Fusiliers.|$|R
