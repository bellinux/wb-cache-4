50|$|Unlike spirit duplicators (where {{the only}} ink {{available}} is depleted from the master image), mimeograph technology works by forcing a replenishable supply of ink through the <b>stencil</b> <b>master.</b> In theory, the mimeograph process could be continued indefinitely, especially if a durable <b>stencil</b> <b>master</b> were used (e.g. a thin metal foil). In practice, most low-cost mimeo stencils gradually wear {{out over the}} course of producing several hundred copies. Typically the stencil deteriorates gradually, producing a characteristic degraded image quality until the stencil tears, abruptly ending the print run. If further copies are desired at this point, another stencil must be made.|$|E

50|$|In 1986, the RISO Kagaku Corporation {{introduced}} the digital duplicator. It uses the basic mimeograph technology but improves on it, {{in that the}} operator {{does not have to}} create the stencil directly. The <b>stencil,</b> called a <b>master,</b> is made by use of a scanner and thermal print head. A used master is automatically removed and placed in a disposal box, as a new one is created. This way the operator should not have to touch the used master material that is coated in ink.|$|R
