The in strument produces a permanent quality-control record and eliminates time-consuming radio chromatographic segment counting. Many departments of nuclear medicine now pre pare sterile and pyrogren-free radiopharmaceuticals from commercial kits or from reagents prepared in their own laboratories. As part of the quality-control program, an accurate, rapid, and simple chroma tography system is required to assess the radiopurity of these products. We have developed a rapid, simple, chromato graphic method for measuring purity of radiophar maceuticals that uses instrumentation commonly available in most radioisotope laboratories and costs less than $ 1, 000 if purchased new. EQUIPMENT AND METHODS The distribution of radioactivity along the chroma tographic paper strip is determined {{by means of a}} Geiger-Muller (G-M) tube and a rate meter [Picker, Model No. 624081 (10 K range increased to lOOK) ] and the results are recorded on a strip chart recorder (Picker, Model No. PRR- 600 -O 90) (Fig. I). The G-M detector is shielded externally by a lead sleeve with a narrow slit opening (3 x I 1 mm) located over the front and center of the G-M detector (Fig. 2 A), which is mounted with lead shield on a ring stand 4 in. above the front of the strip chart recorder. A small stainless steel rod is connected to the ring stand 9 in. above the G-M tube to support the chro matography paper. In order to maintain the position of the chromatography strip as it passes over the slit window, a Lucite <b>strip</b> <b>guide</b> is placed {{on the front of the}} lead sleeve (Fig. 2 B). The lower end of the chromatographic strip is attached to the chart paper which pulls the strip across the front of the G-M tube at a constant speed. Output from the G-M tube is measured by the rate meter and its output recorded on the paper chart, proportional to the counting rate meter level...|$|E

Moreover, they increase the impedance bandwidth up to 40 % in Ka-band, and improve the realized gain by more than 2 dB. Indeed, a gain of 14. 9 dBi is achieved at the center frequency, with a front-to-back ratio of 33. 8 dB, and a side-lobe level of - 22. 9 dB in the H-plane.

One of the earliest and most loyal fan followings for a TV programme developed around the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows (1966 - 71), leading to conventions, novels, comic <b>strips,</b> episode <b>guides,</b> two feature films, {{and a series of}} audio dramas.

However, in many cases, because of their geometrical complexity and inaccessibility, it is difficult to inspect them by the conventional ultrasonic methods. The magnetostrictive transducer technique has several advantages for practical applications, such as a 100 percent volumetric coverage of a long segment of a structure, a reduced inspection time and its cost effectiveness, as well as relatively simple structure. Recently it has been found that the magnetostrictive properties of Fe-Co-V alloy showed superior to the conventional Ni <b>strip.</b> The <b>guided</b> wave signal amplitudes by the Fe-Co-V alloy strip are much higher than those of the Ni strip. However, the alternating excitation should be kept as low as possible to avoid unwanted vibration modes.

In order to apply a DC magnetization along the circumference of a small bore tube, an automotive battery is used to bring the Ni strip to a saturated magnetization. In addition, an in-bore torsional guided wave probe was applied to an inspection of a heat exchanger tube. The signal quality was not good enough to compare the case of DC magnetization along the circumference by using a high power DC supply.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The scattering of waves by a finite thin plate in a two-dimensional wave guide {{and an array of}} finite thin plates, in the presence of subsonic mean flow, are formulated using a mode matching technique. The influence of mean flow on trapped modes in the vicinity of a finite thin plate in a two-dimensional wave guide is then investigated by putting the amplitude of the forcing term to zero in the scattering problem. The conditions for complex resonances are found, and numerical results are computed. The influence of mean flow on Rayleigh-Bloch modes is investigated by using a similar methodology. The condition for embedded trapped modes to exist is introduced next, and then numerical results for embedded trapped modes without mean flow are presented. Complex resonances without mean flow are then found by fixing the geometry of the waveguide. The influence of mean flow on complex resonances and embedded trapped modes is investigated subsequently. In addition, the investigation of scattering coefficients is discussed when the frequency of an incident wave is near the real part of the frequency of complex resonances or embedded trapped modes. Embedded trapped modes near an indentation in a <b>strip</b> wave <b>guide,</b> which may correspond to a two-dimensional acoustic wave guide or a channel of uniform water depth in water waves, are also found. Modes are sought which are either symmetric or anti-symmetric about the centreline of the guide and the centre of the indentation. In each case, a simple approximate solution is found numerically. Full solutions are then found by using a Galerkin approach in which the singularity near the indentation edge is modelled by choosing proper special functions. The final part of the thesis is devoted to spinning modes (Rayleigh-Bloch modes) in a cylindrical waveguide in the presence of radial fins. A mode matching technique is used to obtain the potential, and the coefficients in the expansion are found numerically by using an efficient Galerkin procedure. In addition, an existence proof for modes symmetric about the centre of the guide and the centre of the section with radial fins is given by applying a variational approach. The connection between Rayleigh-Bloch modes and trapped modes is discussed thereafter, and numerical results for a number of geometric configurations are presented...|$|R
