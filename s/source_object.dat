The gravitational fields of these clusters deflect light-rays traveling near them. As seen from Earth, this effect can cause dramatic distortions of a background <b>source</b> <b>object</b> detectable by eye such as multiple images, arcs, and rings (cluster strong lensing). More generally, the effect causes small, but statistically coherent, distortions of background sources on the order of 10% (cluster weak lensing). Abell 1689, CL0024+17, and the Bullet Cluster {{are among the}} most prominent examples of lensing clusters.|$|E
40|$|Software {{rebuilding}} is {{the process}} of deriving a deployable software system from its primitive <b>source</b> <b>objects.</b> A build tool helps maintain consistency between the derived <b>objects</b> and <b>source</b> <b>objects</b> by ensuring that all necessary build steps are re-executed in the correct order after a set of changes is made to the <b>source</b> <b>objects.</b> It is imperative that derived objects accurately represent the <b>source</b> <b>objects</b> from which they were supposedly constructed; otherwise, subsequent testing and quality assurance is invalidated. This thesis aims to advance the state-of-the-art in tool support for automated software rebuilding. It surveys the body of background work, lays out a set of design considerations for build tools, and examines areas where current tools are limited. It examines the properties of a next-generation tool concept, redo, conceived by D. J. Bernstein; redo is novel because it employs a purely top-down approach to software rebuilding that promises to be simpler, more flexible, and more reliable than current approaches. The details of a redo prototype written by the author of this thesis are explained including the central algorithms and data structures. Lastly, the redo prototype is evaluated on some sample software systems with respect to migration effort between build tools as well as size, complexity, and performances aspects of the resulting build systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} on {{the update}} problem of multi-scale databases when the multi-scale databases, which is several spatial databases covering the same geographic area with different scales, {{are derived from}} an original one. Although the integrity between original and derived multi-scale databases should be maintained, most of update mechanisms do not respect it since the update mechanisms have assumed that the update of <b>source</b> <b>objects</b> propagates to objects directly derived from the source. In {{order to maintain the}} integrity of multi-scale databases during updates, we must propagate updates on a <b>source</b> database to <b>objects</b> derived from both the updated <b>source</b> <b>objects</b> and other related objects. This is an important functional requirement of multi-scale database systems, which has been not supported by existing spatial database systems or geographic information systems. In this paper, we propose a set of rules and algorithms for the update propagation and show a prototype developed on ArcGIS of ESRI. Our update mechanism provides with not only the consistency between multi-scale databases but also incremental updates. 1...|$|R
