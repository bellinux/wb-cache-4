On his march to Rome through Italy, Octavian's presence and newly acquired funds attracted many, winning over Caesar's former veterans stationed in Campania. By June, he had gathered an army of 3,000 loyal veterans, paying each a salary of 500 denarii.|$|E
25|$|In 1831, with George IV {{dead and}} the new king, William IV, over 60 and still without {{legitimate}} issue, the young princess's <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>heir</b> presumptive and the Duchess's prospective place as regent led to major increases in British state income for the Kents. A contributing factor was Leopold's designation as King of the Belgians, upon which he surrendered his British income. In any case, {{the idea of having}} the British heir presumptive supported by a foreign sovereign would clearly have been unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|These stories, {{written down}} some 40-odd years later, {{seem to be}} rooted in later smear campaigns which were meant to bring disrepute on Eadwig and his marital relations. Although both Lives focus on the {{personal}} dimension of the affairs {{from the perspective of}} their protagonists, the effects of factional rivalries loom in the background. It is known that in 958 Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, a supporter of Dunstan, annulled the marriage of Eadwig and Ælfgifu {{on the basis of their}} consanguinity. The underlying motive for this otherwise surprisingly belated decision may well have been political rather than religious or legal. It bolstered Edgar's <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>heir</b> to the throne. There is a good possibility that Oda’s act had been spurred on by Edgar’s sympathisers, the sons of Æthelstan Half-King, and in particular by their ally Dunstan, whose monastic reform they generously supported.|$|E

50|$|In some {{societies}} in Sub-Saharan Africa where male primogeniture was practiced, tensions {{between parents and}} their inheriting eldest son were resolved through rituals of avoidance. This was most extreme among the Tallensi. Among East Asian peoples, on the other hand, co-residence between parents and their eldest son was thought of as normal and desirable in systems of impartible inheritance, and in some countries such as Japan, Vietnam and South Korea it is widely practiced even nowadays. Historically in Japan, marriage and reproduction by the eldest son was facilitated by their <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>heirs.</b>|$|R
500|$|Berengaria's first {{engagement}} {{was agreed}} in 1187 when {{her hand was}} sought by Conrad, Duke of Rothenburg and fifth child of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. The next year, the marriage contract was signed in Seligenstadt, including a dowry of 42000 Maravedí. Conrad then marched to Castile, where in Carrión the engagement was celebrated and Conrad was knighted. [...] Berengaria's <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>heir</b> of Castile when she inherited the throne was {{based in part on}} documentation in the treaty and marriage contract, which specified that she would inherit the kingdom after her father or any childless brothers who may come along.

500|$|Efforts {{were also}} made towards a {{diplomatic}} annexation of Hungary. The Hungarian heir Béla, younger {{brother of the}} Hungarian king Stephen III, was sent to Constantinople to be educated in the emperor's court. Manuel intended the youth to marry his daughter, Maria, and to make him his heir, thus securing the union of Hungary with the Empire. At court Béla assumed the name Alexius and received the title of Despot, which had previously been applied only to the Emperor himself. However, two unforeseen dynastic events drastically altered the situation. In 1169, Manuel's young wife {{gave birth to a}} son, thus depriving Béla of his <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>heir</b> of the Byzantine throne (although Manuel would not renounce the Croatian lands he had taken from Hungary). Then, in 1172, Stephen died childless, and Béla went home to take his throne. Before leaving Constantinople, he swore a solemn oath to Manuel that he would always [...] "keep in mind the interests of the emperor and of the Romans". Béla III kept his word: as long as Manuel lived, he made no attempt to retrieve his Croatian inheritance, which he only afterwards reincorporated into Hungary.|$|E

50|$|Huntingtower {{was educated}} at Eton, which he {{left at the}} age of seventeen.

Unfortunately, his <b>status</b> <b>as</b> the <b>heir</b> of a large estate allowed him to borrow immense sums, and he led so dissipated a life as to accumulate, by 1841, £220,000 of debt. Among these debts was one of over £19,050 to a London diamond dealer, Dobson. Accordingly, he conveyed to Dobson, for a payment of just under £950, his interest in the family estates and eight life insurance policies, to be redeemable by paying his debt of £20,000.|$|R

5000|$|Don Henrique, angered over Jamie's <b>status</b> <b>as</b> his <b>heir,</b> makes {{a radical}} move {{to change the}} situation: he files a legal suit (Bartolus is his lawyer) to have the boy Ascanio {{declared}} his heir.

(Like other plays of the era, The Spanish Curate exploits the legal and ethical ambiguity of the precontract, which in some interpretations was like a demi-marriage...but not quite.) After the child's birth, Henrique had second thoughts about the social gap between himself and Jacinta, and got the precontract cancelled. Jacinta can only affirm the basic truth of Henrique's testimony; and on that basis, Henrique wins his suit. Ascanio is now his legal heir, and Jamie is out.|$|R

Two years later, a more self-sufficient Nagi reunites with Hayate in the place they met for the first time, where he tells her that despite not being her butler anymore he still wants to be with her, and that there is something he needs to tell her, before locking hands and walking down together under the starry night.|$|R
50|$|Until {{he became}} duke of Parma, Ferdinando {{was known as}} il Duchino, the little Duke, a {{reference}} to both his stature and his <b>status</b> <b>as</b> his father's <b>heir.</b> Although he was tall, he was slight built.

50|$|Myra Clark Gaines (c. June 30, 1804January 9, 1885) was an American socialite and {{plaintiff}} in the longest-running lawsuit {{in the history}} of the United States court system.

During its 57-year history in the courtroom, the Gaines cases appeared before the Supreme Court seventeen times and Louisiana state and federal court at least seventy times.

5000|$|Owing to Arbella's <b>status</b> <b>as</b> a {{possible}} <b>heir</b> to the throne, there were discussions of appropriate marriages for her throughout her childhood.

A marriage was also mooted with Ranuccio, eldest son of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma and Maria of Portugal. According to the Curiosities of Literature by Isaac D'Israeli, this scheme originated with the Pope, who eventually settled on his own brother, a cardinal, as a suitable husband for Arbella. The Pope defrocked his brother, freeing him to marry [...] "Arbelle" [...] (as the Italians spelled her name) and thus claim the English crown. Nothing came of this plan, and in fact the only direct evidence of Arbella's religion is her taking Protestant communions while at Shrewsbury House in Chelsea.|$|R

[...] After Zhang Chonghua died in 353, his son Zhang Yaoling carried the Jin Dynasty (265-420)-created title Duke of Xiping and was the titular ruler, but actual power was in Empress Dowager Ma's and Zhang Chonghua's older brother Zhang Zuo's hands. Most historians {{believed}} that she {{had an affair with}} Zhang Zuo, and later that year, she deposed Zhang Yaoling and replaced him with Zhang Zuo. In 355, however, the overly extravagant and cruel Zhang Zuo was deposed and killed by a coalition of officials, including Zhang Guan (張瓘) and Song Hun (宋混), and they pressured her into making Zhang Chonghua's younger son, Zhang Xuanjing, the new ruler. (Zhang Yaoling had been killed by Zhang Zuo earlier that year.) Zhang Guan initially served as regent, but was killed in 359 by Song Hun, who served as regent until his death in 361. He was replaced by his brother Song Cheng (宋澄), who was in turn killed by Zhang Yong (張邕) later that year.
