Uganda also dropped {{from being the}} second to being the fourth largest producer of sweetpotato in the world after China, Tanzania and Nigeria (FAO 2011). This reduction in sweetpotato production {{could be due to}} many biotic stresses including insect pests and diseases (viral and fungal) that have led to the decline in vine and root quality and root yields. Research conducted in most southern and eastern Africa has shown that insects are among the most economically important pests of sweetpotato (Smit 1997). The most serious and commonly reported insect pest species in Uganda (Smit 1997; Hakiza et al. 2000; Abidin 2004; Ebregt et al. 2005), Kenya (Smit 1997; Nderitu et al. 2009), Ethiopia (Azerefegne et al. 2001), Rwanda (Smit et al. 1997) and Nigeria (Girma 1994; Tewe et al. 2003) are caterpillars of the sweetpotato butterfly, Acraea acerata Hew.

40|$|Sweetpotato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lamarck, {{one of the}} top ten staple crops {{produced}} worldwide, {{has increased}} in production in Hawaii in recent years. The <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cylas formicarius (Summers) (Coleoptera: Brentidae), is a major economic and quarantine pest of sweetpotato in Hawaii as well as a pest of concern {{in all parts of the}} tropics where sweetpotatoes are grown. <b>Sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> infestation can reduce marketable root yield as well as reduce root quality by inducing production of bitter tasting sesquiterpines by the sweetpotato tissue. Traps baited with a male <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> lure, (Z) - 3 -dodecenyl (E) - 2 -butenoate, can be used for population monitoring, or even for population suppression if mass trapping is done using high doses of this lure. Weathering rates, though, have not been documented in Hawaii for the higher septa loadings (100 to 1000 μg [= 1. 0 mg]) that have been proposed for use in population suppression efforts through mass trapping. Here, we present comparative catch rates and weathering rates, along the Hamakua Coast of Hawaii island, of traps baited with septa loaded with 12 μg, 120 μg, or 1. 0 mg of male <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> lure. Traps baited with fresh 1. 0 mg male lure caught over 22 times as many weevils as traps baited with 12 μg lure over an initial one-week trapping period. Based on a fitted decay curve, decline in attractiveness of the 1. 0 mg treatment to 50 % of fresh attractiveness occurred at 19. 0 weeks, while the 120 μg treatment showed a 50 % decline after 16. 3 weeks, under climate conditions on the Hamakua Coast of Hawaii island.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} sweetpotato {{resistance to}} sweet potato weevils (Cylas spp.) and investigated the phytochemicals that mediated this defence. New Kawogo, LIR 302 and ARA 228 {{were shown to}} be the most resistant based on stem and root damage. Significant differences were observed on the number of faecal droppings, feeding holes and eggs laid on the root in a choice and no-choice bioassays confirming that New Kawogo, LIR 302 and ARA 228 affected development and emergence of adult weevils. Six hydroxycinnamic acid esters, including hexadecylcaffeic, hexadecylcoumaric, octadecylcaffeic, octadecylcoumaric, heptadecylcaffeic and 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid esters were identified on the root surface and amounts of these differed significantly between resistant and susceptible varieties. The mean number of C. puncticollis and C. brunneus feeding holes, faecal droppings and egg laid on the root core were significantly different among the root cores treated with synthetic hydroxycinnamic acid esters. The study also showed that there were significant differences in the root volatiles of resistant and susceptible variety both before and after infestation. The larval survival of <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> was significantly affected by hydroxycinnamic acid esters treatment and Bt-toxin applied on the diet. There was also significant differences in percentage <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> root infestation among genotypes of the segregating population. The genotype by environment (GxE) interaction effect was also significant on the <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> damage on the stem portion of the sweetpotato vine indicating that weevil stem damage is dependent on the season. The mean number of <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding holes differed significantly on the root of the genotypes of the segregating population in the feeding and oviposition bioassay. There was significant difference in total hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) esters among the genotypes of the segregating population. The distribution of genotype mean total HCA ester concentration was skewed to the left and only one progeny, NKB 257, had higher total HCA ester concentration than New Kawogo, the resistant mother used in the crossing. A weak but significant correlation between total HCA ester concentration and <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> root damage was observed signifying that resistance to sweetpotato weevils depended on other factors as well. The results are discussed in terms of how they might be incorporated into integrated pest management of sweetpotato weevils...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, sweetpotato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lamarck, {{production}} in Hawaii has been increasing, reaching 243 harvested ha, {{with a total}} production of 3. 76 million kg in 2009. Sweetpotato {{production in}} Hawaii is hindered by three major quarantine pests, for which only one, the <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cylas formicarius elegantulus (Summers) (Coleoptera: Brentidae), has an identified sex pheromone, (Z) - 3 -dodecen- 1 -ol (E) - 2 -butenoate, that has been deployed in traps for monitoring and suppression of field populations. The longevity of a commercial source of this sex attractant was tested under field conditions on the Hamakua Coast {{on the island of}} Hawaii. Based on a linear regression developed from weevil catch results versus weeks of aging, catch dropped to 50 % of the catch of unweathered lure at 13. 2 weeks, at a lower elevation site, and at 9. 0 weeks, at a higher elevation, windier site. Based on these results, lures in traps should be replaced every 9 weeks to maintain at least 50 % of maximum trap catch.

Attempts to breed for resistance to Cylas spp. have had limited success. However, {{there are reports}} of variation in the susceptibility to weevil attack in the field among cultivars in East Africa. Field trials were conducted at two sites (Ukiriguru and Kibaha) in Tanzania and at one site (Serere) in Uganda {{to determine the extent to}} which sweetpotato cultivars presently available in East Africa consistently differ in their susceptibility to field infestation by Cylas spp. and to identify the plant factors that determine the levels of susceptibility. Several methods to assess levels of field infestation were tested, and their relative merits are discussed. Significant cultivar differences in susceptibility to Cylas spp. infestation were observed for four out of six trials carried out over 2 years. The exceptions were cases where infestation levels were either very low or very high. Linear regression models of infestation suggest that the following plant characteristics are associated with low susceptibility to Cylas spp. infestation: increased distance of roots from the soil surface, fewer soil cracks, fewer exposed roots and a high foliage yield. Both the distance of the roots from the soil surface (shortest weevil distance) and foliage yield differ significantly between cultivars. The former cannot be approximated by measurement of root neck length, but must be measured in situ...|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} {{provided}} insight into sweetpotato {{production in the}} main production districts of Uganda. Insect pests are a major production constraint in all the districts surveyed. The majority of farmers perceive insect pests {{to be a very}} serious problem. With the exception of Masindi and Wakiso districts where A. acerata is the number one constraint, <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevils</b> (C. puncticollis and C. brunneus) are ranked as the most important insect pests. However, many sweetpotato farmers take no measures to control Cylas spp. but invest in the use of chemical insecticides to control A. acerata, which has a high priority in Masindi and Wakiso districts. Promoting the use of cultural control methods such as mulching, re-hilling to cover soil cracks, use of clean planting material, crop rotation, taking time period and crops planted before into account, have potential to reduce damage by Cylas spp. Further, it would be important to invest in research to develop additional control measures. Biological control using the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana has shown to reduce the Cylas formicarius Fabricius damage in Cuba alone or in combination with sexual pheromones (Lagnaoui et al. 2000) Farmers lack knowledge on Cylas spp. biology, damage and control. Hence, training about the biology and ecology of this important pest can help farmers to make informed crop management decisions. Baseline information gained from this study will assist the international agricultural research system (NARS), and non-governmental organizations (NGO’s) in designing IPM strategies that are based on the needs of smallholder farmers and their sweetpotato production systems. This information will also be useful in setting research priorities.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Assessment of {{the impact}} of {{transgenic}} crops on non-target organisms (NTO) is a prerequisite to their release into the target environment for commercial use. Transgenic sweetpotato varieties expressing Cry proteins (Bt sweetpotato) are under development to provide effective protection against <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevils</b> (Cole-optera) which cause severe economic losses in sub-Sah-aran Africa. Like any other pest control technologies, genetically engineered crops expressing insecticidal pro-teins need to be evaluated to assess potential negative effects on non-target organisms that provide important services to the ecosystem. Beneficial arthropods in sweetpotato production systems can include pollinators, decomposers, and predators and parasitoids of the target insect pest(s). Non-target arthropod species commonly found in sweetpotato fields that are related taxonomically to the target pests were identified through expert con-sultation and literature review in Uganda where Bt sweetpotato is expected to be initially evaluated. Results indicate the presence of few relevant non-target Cole-opterans that could be affected by Coleopteran Bt sweetpotato varieties: ground, rove and ladybird beetles. These insects are important predators in sweetpotato fields. Additionally, honeybee (hymenoptera) is the main pollinator of sweetpotato and used for honey production. Numerous studies have shown that honeybees are unaf-fected by the Cry proteins currently deployed which are homologous to those of the weevil-resistant Bt sweetpo-tato. However, because of their feeding behaviour, Bt sweetpotato represents an extremely low hazard due to negligible exposure. Hence, we conclude that there is good evidence from literature and expert opinion that relevant NTOs in sweetpotato fields are unlikely to be affected by the introduction of Bt sweetpotato in Uganda...|$|R

Until recently, growers have been exporting sweetpotatoes to the U. S. mainland using methyl bromide fumigation. Methyl bromide fumigation adversely affects root quality and has become costly. Irradiation treatment is an alternative to chemical fumigation for sweetpotato growers. The main advantage of irradiation as a phytosanitary treatment is that it is broadly effective against arthropod pests (insects and mites) at dose levels that do not cause injury to most types of fresh fruits and vegetables.

Cylns pinicticollis females lived longer than C. brunneus (141 ± 10 and 92 ± 12 days respectively), developed faster (egg to adult 20 - 28 days, and 32 - 41 days respectively) and had a lower oviposition rate (1. 10 ± 0. 04 and 1. 53 ± 0. 06 eggs per female per day respectively). The total egg production per female (average 101), sex ratio (1 : 1) and proportion of eggs surviving to adulthood (average 89 %) were similar for both species. The intrinsic rate of increase was higher for C. pnncticoUis (0. 553 per 10 -day period compared to 0. 521 for C. brunneus). Under field conditions C. bhmneiis will benefit from its higher oviposition rate during periods of favourable conditions for sweet potato weevils, like dry spells which expose tubers for egg laying.

30|$|Insect pests {{are among}} the most {{important}} constraints limiting sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) production in Africa. However, there is inadequate information about farmers’ knowledge, perceptions and practices in the management of key insect pests. This has hindered development of effective pest management approaches for smallholder farmers. A standard questionnaire was used to interview individual sweetpotato farmers (n[*]=[*] 192) about their perception and management practices regarding insect pests in six major sweetpotato producing districts of Uganda. The majority (93 %) of farmers perceived insect pests to be a very serious problem. With the exception of Masindi and Wakiso districts where the sweetpotato butterfly (Acraea acerata) was the number one constraint, <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevils</b> (Cylas puncticollis and C. brunneus) were ranked as the most important insect pests. Insecticide use in sweetpotato fields was very low being highest (28 – 38 % of households) in districts where A. acerata infestation is the biggest problem. On average, 65 % and 87 % of the farmers took no action to control A. acerata and Cylas spp., respectively. Farmers were more conversant with the presence of and damage by A. acerata than of Cylas spp. as they thought that Cylas spp. root damage was brought about by a prolonged dry season. Different levels of field resistance (ability of a variety to tolerate damage) of sweetpotato landraces to A. acerata (eight landraces) and Cylas spp. (six landraces) were reported by farmers in all the six districts. This perceived level of resistance to insect damage by landraces needs to be investigated.

Field surveys were conducted in 240 sweetpotato fields in eight subcounties in Masindi and Buliisa districts {{at the end of each}} of the two cropping seasons of 2012 (March to May and September to November). A. acerata and Cylas spp. occurred in 17 % and 90 % of the fields, respectively. A. acerata did not occur in two subcounties of Buliisa district. A. acerata infestation was low, with up to two and four larvae per plant in the first and second cropping season, respectively, causing minor defoliation of up to 4. 1 % of the sweetpotato plant. Larvae of Cylas spp. caused root yield losses of up to 56. 5 % and 47. 5 % in the first and second cropping seasons, respectively. Parasitism rates of A. acerata larvae ranged from 0. 0 % to 15. 1 % in season 1 and 0. 0 % to 6. 3 % in season 2. Out of a total of 1020 larvae collected, 8. 43 % were found to be parasitized.

For {{the first time in a}} segregating population, we quantified the plant chemicals that confer resistance and evaluated levels of insect colonization of the same progeny in field and laboratory studies. We used a bi-parental mapping population of 287 progenies from a cross between I. batatas ‘New Kawogo,’ a weevil resistant Ugandan landrace and I. batatas ‘Beauregard’ a North American orange-fleshed and weevil susceptible cultivar. The progenies were evaluated for resistance to <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cylas puncticollis at three field locations that varied climatically and across two seasons to determine how environment and location influenced resistance. To augment our field open-choice resistance screening, each clone was also evaluated in a no choice experiment with weevils reared in the laboratory. Chemical analysis was used to determine whether differences in resistance to weevils were associated with plant compounds previously identified as conferring resistance. We established linkage between field and laboratory resistance to Cylas spp. and sweetpotato root chemistry. The data also showed that resistance in sweetpotato was mediated by root chemicals in most but not all cases. Multi-location trials especially from Serere data provided evidence that the hydroxycinnamic acid esters are produced constitutively within the plants in different clonal genotypes and that the ecological interaction of these chemicals in sweetpotato with weevils confers resistance. Our data suggest that these chemical traits are controlled quantitatively and that ultimately a knowledge of the genetics of resistance will facilitate management of these traits, enhance our understanding of the mechanistic basis of resistance and speed the development of new sweetpotato varieties with resistance to <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil...</b>|$|E

This assembly was followed by a gene ontology annotation. Subsequently, a transcriptome search showed that the necessary RNAi components relevant to the three major RNAi pathways, were found to be expressed in SPW. To address the functionality of the RNAi mechanism in this species, dsRNA was injected into second instar larvae targeting laccase 2, a gene which encodes an enzyme involved in the sclerotization of insect exoskeleton. The body of treated insects showed inhibition of sclerotization, leading eventually to death. Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) confirmed this phenotype to be the result of gene silencing.

40|$|Sweetpotato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lamarck was {{introduced}} into Lesotho in 1992 {{in the hope}} that it would help alleviate poverty levels. Efforts are being made to learn the potential constraints to optimal production of this crop. Insect pests especially the <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevils,</b> Cylas species are a major production constraint worldwide. Hence the main objective {{of the study was to}} predict if these pests have potential to establish themselves in Lesotho. Two Cylas species, C. formicarius and C. puncticollis are present in South Africa and the latter is found in the northern Free State and the Eastern Cape both of which border the central and southern lowlands of Lesotho respectively. Cylas puncticollis was chosen as the subject of this study because of its potential spread into Lesotho. Thermal requirements (lower development threshold and degree-days) of this pest were calculated in the laboratory by studying the effects of temperature on its development and survival at six constant temperatures (16 °C, 19 °C, 24 °C, 26 °C, 31 °C and 36 °C). The photoperiod was maintained at 12 L: 12 D for all temperatures, but RH was not controlled. Thermal requirements (r and k) of this pest species were estimated for all the immature stages and for the total life-cycle using the linear regression method. The estimated lower temperature threshold (r) of the total development of the pest lies between 8 °C and 12 °C and the thermal constant (k) between 360 °D and 380 °D. The thermal needs of this pest obtained from the laboratory work were used to predict the potential for its establishment in Lesotho as well as determining the possible areas of distribution if it invades Lesotho. Actual soil temperatures to which the pest would be exposed to in Lesotho were recorded for a year. Both the calculated thermal needs of the pest and the field-recorded temperatures were used in the degree-day model to predict potential establishment of this pest. The second approach, climate matching in Geographical Information System (GIS) used the bio-climatic profile of C. puncticollis calculated from the known areas of its distribution in both South Africa and Swaziland. The bio-climatic profiles of the two countries were matched to the climatic conditions of Lesotho to predict the potential for its establishment. The two approaches, linear degree-day model and climate matching approach revealed that Cylas puncticollis is a potential pest in Lesotho. The former predicted the occurrence of this pest throughout the whole country with a maximum of eight generations per year being possible in the lowlands. Fewer generations (two to three) were predicted for the highlands and foothills agro-ecological zones, which are colder than the lowlands. The climate matching approach also confirmed the prediction although according to this method a patchy distribution of the pest was predicted. A survey was then carried out in Lesotho, first to determine if Cylas species were already present in Lesotho, secondly to identify any other pests of sweetpotato and lastly to determine other possible production constraints other than insect pests. The survey was conducted in the form of questionnaire and field sampling. Cylas species were neither documented by the farmers who were interviewed nor by the field sampling. Numerous common pests of sweetpotato were recorded during the sampling survey. These included the following leaf-feeding pests: Bedellia somnulentella Zeller, Acraea acerata Hewitson, Agrius convolvuli Linnaeus and locusts and grasshoppers. The root pests that were recorded were mole-rats, Blosyrus sp. and millipedes (Narceus sp.). According to the sampling carried out in Lesotho there were no insect pests that could be rated as major pests as yet. Sweetpotato farmers did not consider insect pests as an important production constraint for optimal yield of the crop. The major constraint was found to be lack of planting material, which contributed towards a slow adoption of the crop throughout the country.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was carried out}} to evaluate the potential sweetpotato clones from NTT for the following objectives: 1) to determine resistance level of the clones to <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> (SPW), 2) to investitage the effect of genotype by tuber production site interaction on SPW-resistance level, 3) to identify SPW-resistant clones. Sweetpotato roots employed in the experiment were obtained from two production sites in the fields.   The experiment was {{laid out in a}} Completely Randomized Design with a factorial treatment of two factors: sweetpotato genotype (10 clones) and root production sites (two sites). Experimental unit was replicated three times. Variables observed included percentage of SPW-injured root, severity of root injury, number of larva, pupae and imago, and root morphological characters.    Quantitative data were subjected to analysis of variance while qualititave data were descriptively analyzed. Results of the study revealed significant interaction effect of genotype by tuber production site on severity of root injury and number of larva+pupae+imago. NBN- 01 and NPL- 02 produced the lowest (4. 50 %) and the greatest (67. 03 %) severity of root injury. NBN- 01 was classified “resistant” and NPL- 02 was “susceptible” while the remaining eight clones/check varieties were “moderately resistant” to SPW...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the basis of resistance in a sub-Saharan sweetpotato variety, New Kawogo, to the African <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> Cylas puncticollis. This insect feeds on the roots, reducing quality and yield, and is the most important production constraint of sweetpotato in Africa. Laboratory bioassays were designed to determine how the performance of weevils differed on susceptible and resistant roots. Subsequently, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of the root surface and root latex identified quantitative and qualitative differences in the chemical profiles with higher levels of octadecyl and hexadecyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids reported in the resistant variety. The compounds were synthesized to confirm their identity and incorporated into artificial diets for bioassays on C. puncticollis. High levels of mortality and developmental inhibition were recorded for larvae feeding on treated diets, and the effect was dose-dependent. Thus, in contrast to previous work on resistant African sweetpotato cultivars, resistance in New Kawogo is not only active, but is quantifiable and manageable for breeding. Work is underway to determine what effect these compounds have on the weevils at a molecular level. The inheritance of the root latex esters will be studied in new crosses and mapped in new populations using quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that are currently being developed...|$|E
40|$|The African <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> Cylas brunneus {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating pests {{affecting}} the production of sweetpotatoes, an important staple food in Sub-Saharan Africa. Current available control methods against this coleopteran pest are limited. In this study, we analyzed the potential of RNA interference as a novel crop protection strategy against this insect pest. First, the C. brunneus transcriptome was sequenced and RNAi functionality was confirmed by successfully silencing the laccase 2 gene. Next, 24 potential target genes were chosen, based on their critical role in vital biological processes. A first screening via injection of gene-specific dsRNAs showed that the dsRNAs were highly toxic for C. brunneus. Injected doses of 200 ng/mg body weight led to mortality rates of 90 % or higher for 14 of the 24 tested genes after 14 days. The three best performing dsRNAs, targeting pros alpha 2, rps 13 and the homolog of Diabrotica virgifera snf 7, were then used in further feeding trials to investigate RNAi by oral delivery. Different concentrations of dsRNAs mixed with artificial diet were tested and concentrations as low as 1 mu g dsRNA/mL diet led to significant mortality rates higher than 50 %. These results proved that dsRNAs targeting essential genes show great potential to control C. brunneus...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cylas formicarius (F.) (Coleoptera: Brentidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of sweet potatoes in the world. With free trade between the United States and the U. S. -controlled Mariana Islands, C. formicarius has spread along with this commodity. Because of the cryptic nature of the larvae and nocturnal activity of the adults, and the cancellation of long-residual pesticides, this pest has become increasingly difficult to control. Therefore, the present study sought to explore and to compare the effectiveness of Metarhizium brunneum F 52 (90 ml a. i. /ha), Beauveria bassiana GHA (40 ml a. i. /ha), spinosad (90 g a. i. /ha), azadirachtin (1484 ml a. i. /ha), B. bassiana+M. brunneum (20 ml a. i. /ha+ 45 ml a. i. /ha), B. bassiana+azadirachtin (20 ml a. i. /ha+ 742 ml a. i. /ha), B. bassiana+spinosad (20 ml a. i. /ha+ 45 ml a. i. /ha), M. brunneum+azadirachtin (45 ml a. i. /ha+ 742 ml a. i. /ha) and M. brunneum+spinosad (45 ml a. i. /ha+ 45 grams a. i. /ha) in controlling this pest in both the laboratory and the field. The treatment with B. bassiana+M. brunneum was the most effective in reducing tuber damage by C. formicarius, producing the highest yields. The most adult cadavers were found in plots treated with the combination of two fungi. This combined fungal formulation appears to be appropriate for the practical control of C. formicarius on sweet potatoes...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam] germplasm with resistance to <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> (SPW) {{requires an understanding}} of the biochemical and genetic mechanisms of resistance to optimize crop resistance. The African sweetpotato landrace, ‘New Kawogo’, was reported to be moderately resistant to two species of SPW, Cylas puncticollis and Cylas brunneus. Resistance has been associated with the presence of hydroxycinnamic acids esters (HCAs), but the underlying genetic basis remains unknown. To determine the genetic basis of this resistance, a bi-parental sweetpotato population from a cross between the moderately resistant, white-fleshed ‘New Kawogo’ and the highly susceptible, orange-fleshed North American variety ‘Beauregard’ was evaluated for SPW resistance and genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to identify weevil resistance loci. SPW resistance was measured on the basis of field storage root SPW damage severity and total HCA ester concentrations. Moderate broad sense heritability (H 2 = 0. 49) was observed for weevil resistance in the population. Mean genotype SPW severity scores ranged from 1. 0 to 9. 0 and 25 progeny exhibited transgressive segregation for SPW resistance. Mean genotype total HCA ester concentrations were significantly different (P < 0. 0001). A weak but significant correlation (r = 0. 103, P = 0. 015) was observed between total HCA ester concentration and SPW severity. A total of five and seven SSR markers were associated with field SPW severity and total HCA ester concentration, respectively. Markers IBS 11, IbE 5 and IbJ 544 b showed significant association with both field and HCA-based resistance, representing potential markers for the {{development of}} SPW resistant sweetpotato cultivars...|$|E
40|$|The sweetpotato Ipomoea batatas L. (Convolvulaceae) {{has been}} one of the most {{important}} foods for Pacific islanders for centuries. However, the yield levels have been declining in the recent past due to the presence of sweetpotato weevils Cylas formicarius (Fabricius) (Coleoptera, Brentidae), Euscepes postfasciatus (Fairmaire) and Daealus tuberosus (Zimmer man) (Coleoptera, Curculionidae). Therefore, urgent management or eradication methods are sought in the Mariana Islands (Guam, Rota, Saipan, and Tinian). However, the management or eradication of these weevil pests requires accurate assessments of the target pest density. Currently, no advice is provided to growers on the best method for sampling sweetpotato for weevil pests, although pheromone-based traps or chemicals are being used. This study defines the results of field counts designed to adjust relative sampling techniques for three <b>sweetpotato</b> <b>weevil</b> pests by inspecting plants visually and at random in the field with an absolute measure of population density. Significant relationships were detected between the relative four sampling sites between the three weevil pests. In the dry and wet season, 90 % and 35. 5 %, respectively, of population density of C. formicarius was noticed in Rota. This density of the population levels of this species is significantly lower in Saipan, Guam and Tinian. No incidence of E. postfasciatus and D. tuberosus was observed on Guam. However, E. postfasciatus is identified as the second most destructive pest in Rota, Tinian and Saipan in both the dry and wet seasons. Likewise, D. tuberosus is the third major pest as the recorded population density ranged from 12. 5 % to 2. 5 %. Also, it is evident from the sampling study that the population densities of all three weevils are significantly higher in the dry season than the wet season...|$|E
