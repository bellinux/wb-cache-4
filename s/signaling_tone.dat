For touchtone service, the signal is a dual-tone multi-frequency <b>signaling</b> <b>tone</b> consisting of two simultaneous pure tone sinusoidal frequencies. The row in which the key appears determines the low-frequency component, and the column determines the high-frequency component. For example, pressing key 1 results in signal composed of tones with frequencies 697 hertz (Hz) and 1209 Hz.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—when {{the noise}} {{cancellation}} system (NC) {{is used in}} the down link of the power line carrier terminal, it can cancel the background noise and narrowband interference, but the downlink <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> distorts at the same time. This is because the VAD algorithm of the NC system is sensitive to dramatic changes in the power of <b>signal</b> <b>tone.</b> Through detailed researches on time frequency characteristics of <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> and error factors of network transmission, a new <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> detection algorithm that applicable to downlink NC system was put forward, The algorithm detects <b>signal</b> <b>tones</b> through changes of frequency-domain power and time-domain signal period of every frame.

40|$|Circulating {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH) shows a complex relationship with hard outcomes {{in subjects with}} chronic kidney disease (CKD). Moreover, intervention studies directly targeting PTH failed to yield unequivocal results. Disturbed PTH metabolism, posttranslational modifications of PTH, and end-organ hyporesponsiveness to PTH may explain the poor performance of PTH as an outcome biomarker and precise target of therapy {{in the setting of}} CKD, at least in the gray middle target zone. PTH fragments accumulate in CKD patients and may exert effects that are distinct from, if not opposite to biointact (1 - 84) PTH. Posttranslational modification of PTH and especially oxidation may alter the interaction of PTH with its receptor. Its clinical relevance, however, remains a matter of ongoing debate. Less controversial is the issue of end-organ hyporesponsiveness to PTH. This phenomenon, formally referred to as PTH resistance, has long been recognized in CKD, but factors and mechanisms contributing to it remain poorly defined. Subsequent evidence identified downregulation of the PTH receptor and competing downstream signals as underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. End-organ hyporesponsiveness to PTH in CKD, along with important analytical and biological variability, renders defining the PTH target range in CKD challenging. Although this may still be accomplished at the population level, it may prove to be very difficult at the individual level. This is a disillusioning thought in an era of personalized medicine. Parallel to the search of a functional and readily available assay quantifying PTH <b>signaling</b> <b>tone</b> or sensitivity, additional biomarkers (or a panel of biomarkers) should be formally evaluated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} {{and duration of}} mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling is regulated through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by dedicated dual-specificity kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Here we investigated the physiological role that extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) dephosphorylation plays in vivo through targeted disruption of the gene encoding dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp 6) in the mouse. Dusp 6 -/- mice, which were viable, fertile, and otherwise overtly normal, showed an increase in basal ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation in the heart, spleen, kidney, brain, and fibroblasts, but no change in ERK 5, p 38, or c-Jun N-terminal kinases activation. However, loss of Dusp 6 did not increase or prolong ERK 1 / 2 activation after stimulation, suggesting that its function is more dedicated to basal ERK 1 / 2 <b>signaling</b> <b>tone.</b> In-depth analysis of the physiological effect associated with increased baseline ERK 1 / 2 signaling was performed in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and the heart. Interestingly, mice lacking Dusp 6 had larger hearts at every age examined, which was associated with greater rates of myocyte proliferation during embryonic development {{and in the early}} postnatal period, resulting in cardiac hypercellularity. This increase in myocyte content in the heart was protective against decompensation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy following long term pressure overload and myocardial infarction injury in adult mice. Dusp 6 -/- MEFs also showed reduced apoptosis rates compared with wild-type MEFs. These results demonstrate that ERK 1 / 2 signaling is physiologically restrained by DUSP 6 in coordinating cellular development and survival characteristics, directly impacting disease-responsiveness in adulthood...|$|E

An antioxidant, recombinant human superoxide dismutase (rhSOD), significantly decreased stretch-induced cytosolic oxidative stress, but did not block stretch-induced sGC activity. Inhibition of iNOS with 1400 W or an iNOS-specific siRNA inhibited stretch-induced sGC activity by 30 % and 68 % respectively vs. static controls. In conclusion, cyclic stretch increases sGC expression and activity in an iNOS-dependent manner in PASMC from fetal lambs. The mechanism that produces iNOS and sGC upregulation is not yet known, but we speculate these effects represent an early compensatory mechanism to counteract the effects of stretch-induced oxidative stress.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis investigates the performance degradation resulting from multitone interference of orthogonal, noncoherent, frequency-hopped, M-ary frequency-shift keyed receivers (FH/MFSK) where {{the effect of}} thermal and other wideband noise is not neglected. The multiple, equal power jamming tones are assumed to correspond to {{some or all of}} the possible FH M-ary orthogonal <b>signaling</b> <b>tones.</b> Furthermore, the channel is modeled as a Ricean fading channel, a possibility precluded when thermal noise is neglected. Both the <b>signaling</b> <b>tones</b> and the multiple interference tones are assumed to be affected by channel fading. Both band and independent band multitone interference are considered. Performance is evaluated by obtaining a union bound on the probability of bit error, and receiver performance is compared with exact results for band multitone interference of a noncoherent FH/MFSK receiver under comparable circumstances. Except for the case of Rayleigh fading of the signal, the union bound is very tight for those cases that can be compared with exact results. The advantages of the union bound approach are twofold. First, the union bound approach yields a solution that is far less computationally intensive than that obtained with the exact approach. Second, the union bound approach allows numerical results to be obtained for interference conditions that are not amenable to exact analysis, such as independent multitone interference of FH/ MFSK[URL] JG, Hellenic Nav...|$|R
