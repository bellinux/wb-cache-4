40|$|Why {{preserve}} bamboos? Bamboos are {{a natural}} material and under natural conditions will gradually decay. If {{they are used}} as structural components {{they will need to}} be replaced after a period of time. The costs of this may prove prohibitive and the status of the bamboo will need constant monitoring to determine when it needs to be replaced. Preserving bamboos extends their life, reduces costs in the long run and improves safety of the structures they are used to form. What are <b>sap</b> <b>displacement</b> preservation <b>methods?</b> <b>Sap</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>methods</b> replace the <b>sap</b> in the vessels of a fresh bamboo culm with preservative. The culms are then left to stand for two weeks in order that the preservative can diffuse into the surrounding tissues and the preserving salts can be fixed in the cells. <b>Sap</b> <b>displacement</b> can be done by using natural capillary action or by one of a small range of simple pressurised techniques. What is the role of a <b>sap</b> <b>displacement</b> preservation unit in rural development? The unit itself offers employment opportunities to its employees and to many people in its forward and backward linkages. The unit can only treat freshly harvested bamboos and so a source of bamboos near to the unit is required. Local bamboo plantations can be established to supply the unit and create further income generating opportunities. Bamboos can be intercropped with food plants and the plantations can thereby increase the food security of the rural people that manage them. How do I establish a <b>sap</b> <b>displacement</b> unit? A <b>sap</b> <b>displacement</b> preservation unit can be established very cheaply. The only requirements are a supply of freshly harvested bamboos, labour and information from the secondary processors of their requirements. If a pressurised unit is to be established then a source of energy for the compressor will be needed. A pressurised unit capable of treating 50 bamboos per day can be established for USD $ 500, including a compressor, and non-pressurised units can be established for considerably less. Preserving bamboos extends their life, reduces costs in the long run and improves safety of the structures they are used to for...|$|R

The stems were sectioned in culms of 2. 0 m in length. One part of the culms had the diaphragm removed while in the other they were kept unbroken. The culms were treated in soutions of 1 % and 3 % of active ingredients (a. i.) of copper, chromated copper borate (CCB). The culms were kept in the solution for 5, 10 and 15 days. The preservative treatment quality was evaluated by means of penetration and retention of CCB in culms. There was greater penetration of copper and boron at the base of the culms, the removing of the diaphragm provided greater movement of the solution in the culms and the retention was, for most treatment conditions, below than the one recommended by Brazilian standards for wood preservative treatment...|$|E

Trees with DAP from 5. 0 to 10. 0 cm were employed. Disks of 2. 0 cm of thickness were retired {{on the top and}} on the base of pieces. The external disks were then discarded and the intern ones were employed to determine the wood characteristics, being the round pieces with 2. 0 m. A solution of 2 % of active ingredients of CCB was used to treated woods. A total of 10 pieces of each species were treated, and five of them remained in the solution for 8 days and the five ones had their tops inverted after the sixth day of treatment. The pieces were seasoned; disks of 2. 0 cm of thickness were taken in 5 positions along of pieces and the analyses for determination of copper and boron penetration took place. The values of wood characteristics indicated that the pieces were homogeneous. The absorption of the solution was of 19. 9 liters (Prosopis juliflora) and of 17. 0 liters (Leucaena leucocephala). The nominal retentions of CCB were 7. 72 and 5. 34 kg active ingredients (a. i.) /m 3, respectively.

40|$|As a {{tool for}} {{studying}} complex shapes and structures in nature, fractal theory plays {{a critical role in}} revealing the organizational structure of the complex phenomenon. Numerous fractal interpolation methods have been proposed over the past few decades, but they differ substantially in the form features and statistical properties. In this study, we simulated one- and two-dimensional fractal surfaces by using the midpoint <b>displacement</b> <b>method</b> and the Weierstrass–Mandelbrot fractal function method, and observed great differences between the two methods in the statistical characteristics and autocorrelation features. From the aspect of form features, the simulations of the midpoint <b>displacement</b> <b>method</b> showed a relatively flat surface which appears to have peaks with different height as the fractal dimension increases. While the simulations of the Weierstrass–Mandelbrot fractal function method showed a rough surface which appears to have dense and highly similar peaks as the fractal dimension increases. From the aspect of statistical properties, the peak heights from the Weierstrass–Mandelbrot simulations are greater than those of the middle point <b>displacement</b> <b>method</b> with the same fractal dimension, and the variances are approximately two times larger. When the fractal dimension equals to 1. 2, 1. 4, 1. 6, and 1. 8, the skewness is positive with the midpoint <b>displacement</b> <b>method</b> and the peaks are all convex, but for the Weierstrass–Mandelbrot fractal function method the skewness is both positive and negative with values fluctuating in the vicinity of zero. The kurtosis is less than one with the midpoint <b>displacement</b> <b>method,</b> and generally less than that of the Weierstrass–Mandelbrot fractal function method. The autocorrelation analysis indicated that the simulation of the midpoint <b>displacement</b> <b>method</b> is not periodic with prominent randomness, which is suitable for simulating aperiodic surface. While the simulation of the Weierstrass–Mandelbrot fractal function method has strong periodicity, which is suitable for simulating periodic surface...|$|R

Results: In all plaster casts, the discrepancies in volume measurements between 3 D imaging and water <b>displacement</b> <b>methods</b> did not exceed 40 cc. The overall mean relative difference was 5 %. The differences of the two methods were not significant at p = 0. 189, overall mean difference: 11. 1 cc and 95 % confidence interval (CI) was (- 6. 732, 28. 976). In the live models, the differences in breast volume measurements between the 3 D imaging and water <b>displacement</b> <b>methods</b> were significant at p ≤ 0. 017, overall mean difference: 207. 05 cc and 95 % CI (56. 12, 357. 98). Measurements by 3 D imaging were consistently smaller. In the live models, 3 D imaging overall was a more reproducible method for measuring breast volume than the water <b>displacement</b> <b>method</b> with a standard deviation of 36 units cc - 1 and 62. 6 units cc - 1, respectively. Conclusions: The 3 D breast imaging system using multiple stereo cameras was accurate for measuring the volumes of breast-shaped plaster models, and it was more reproducible than the water <b>displacement</b> <b>method</b> in live models. 3 D imaging is a reliable method for the comparative assessment of breast volume. © 2010 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

Design: Between-methods agreement and test-retest reliability study. Participants: 15 healthy volunteers (8 females and 7 males) with no drop-outs. Intervention: All participants had their dominant lower limb volumes measured using both the vertically-oriented perometer and volumeter. Allocation to either tests was random and in no specific order, but both tests had to be completed. Outcome measures: ICC(3, 1) model {{was used to determine}} the test-retest reliability for each method, while the measurement error was determined using within-subject standard deviation. A one sample t-test was used to determine the accuracy of the vertically-oriented perometer compared to the volumeter, while a Bland and Altman difference plot was constructed to determine the limits of agreement between both methods. Results: There was a lack of agreement between the perometer and water <b>displacement</b> <b>method.</b> The Bland-Altman difference plot showed that the perometer overestimated lower limb volume by 832 ml compared to the water <b>displacement</b> <b>method.</b> The respective upper and lower limits of agreement were 220 and 1444 ml. The test-retest reliability of the perometer method was ICC(3, 1) = 0. 994. The measurement error of the perometer method was clinically acceptable (149 ml).
