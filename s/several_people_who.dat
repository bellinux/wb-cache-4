5|$|A {{music video}} was filmed {{for the song}} and {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas. There are {{two versions of the}} video— one intercut with clips from the ABC series Dirty Sexy Money and created to promote the show, and another which is the official video. The video is set in a mansion, and starts with Gaga making her way down a hallway with <b>several</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are either walking behind her, holding an umbrella over her, dancing in front of her, or tossing dollar bills around her. Gaga and company are then featured in many repeatedly-changing shots at various locations in the mansion. She is seen lying seductively on a table covered with money, crawling along a black grand piano and striking the keys with her leg several times, dancing around and later making out with a statue, and dancing in an elevator solo. There are also several close-up shots of her burning money and later stuffing it into her mouth. Over the course of the video, she undergoes numerous costume changes. Singer-songwriter Space Cowboy is also shown, most notably in scenes where he climbs a wall.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Grant Webster, an 18-year-old {{who acted}} as a bouncer at the event, pleaded guilty to her murder {{and was sentenced to}} 20 years in prison with a 14-year non-parole period. He was {{released}} on parole in June 2004, after serving 14½ years. Guy Charles Wilson, the other bouncer and only other person aged over 18 at the party, pleaded guilty to assault; a third male (aged 15) pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor. The investigation of Leigh's murder proved controversial, however, as <b>several</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> admitted to various crimes, including assaulting Leigh, were never charged; nor was anyone ever charged with her sexual assault. Webster's confession did not match the forensic evidence. The murder investigation was reviewed by the New South Wales Crime Commission in 1996, and by the Police Integrity Commission in 1998, with the latter recommending the dismissal of the detective in charge of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Though Sanford {{enjoyed his}} time as Duke's president, he still harbored {{political}} ambitions. As the 1972 presidential primary season began, he was approached by <b>several</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> felt that the field of Democratic candidates was weak. He was particularly keen to challenge Alabama governor George Wallace {{in an effort to}} show that Wallace's segregationist views did not represent majority Southern opinion. Announcing his candidacy on March 8, he faced long odds in a crowded field. Knowing that he could not win a majority of delegates in the primary, he hoped to secure enough to emerge as a compromise candidate in a deadlocked convention. Even in the North Carolina primary, however, Wallace beat Sanford by 100,000 votes, and Sanford managed only a fifth-place finish at the 1972 Democratic National Convention with 77.5 votes, behind George McGovern (1,864.95), Henry M. Jackson (525), Wallace (381.7), and Shirley Chisholm (151.95).|$|E

5|$|The {{project began}} after it emerged {{that the three}} IRA members shot in Gibraltar {{were found to be}} unarmed and not in {{possession}} of a bomb. The series' editor, Roger Bolton, dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain, where they interviewed <b>several</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team. The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in Belfast. Satisfied by the journalists' findings, Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme; as the British government refused to comment, Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings. The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 (just under two months after the shootings), despite two attempts by Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority postpone the broadcast. Using the eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government's version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme's findings: none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire, but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back, with their hands up, or after falling to the ground. The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton, who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts.|$|E

50|$|Wanting to {{make the}} film {{historically}} accurate and unbiased, the producers invited a broadly based Advisory Board, and used scholars, Native Americans, and descendants of the colonists to help tell the story. They elicited personal and often passionate viewpoints from contemporary Americans.

It presents facts and seeks to help viewers better understand the <b>several</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>who</b> fought the War.|$|R
