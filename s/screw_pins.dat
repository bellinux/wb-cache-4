Despite this, they are {{categorized}} as woodwind instruments rather than brass, as the sound waves are produced by an oscillating wooden reed, not the lips against a mouthpiece as in a brass instrument, and because pitches are produced by breath wind passing opening and closing keys. The <b>screw</b> <b>pins</b> that connect the rods to the posts, {{as well as the}} needle and leaf springs that cause the keys to return to their rest position after being released, are generally made of blued or stainless steel. Since 1920, most saxophones have [...] "key touches" [...] (smooth replaceable pieces placed where the fingers touch the instrument) made from either plastic or mother of pearl. [...] Recently, some saxophones are offered with abalone or stone keytouches.|$|E
5000|$|Watchstraps or bracelets for diving watches are {{generally}} made of {{materials that are}} adequately water (pressure) resistant and able to endure the galvanic corrosiveness of seawater. In practical terms most diving watches feature a rubber, silicone rubber, polyurethane or fabric watchstrap or a stainless steel or titanium metal link or mesh bracelet of adequate length to facilitate wearing the watch over a diving suit sleeve.For a wrist with a 200 mm circumference wearing a 4 mm thick diving suit sleeve increases the strap or bracelet length required the fit the watch over the sleeved wrist to 225 mm. For this bracelets often have a (concealed) divers extension [...] clasp by which the bracelet can be appropriately extended by approximately 20 mm to 30 mm.Some watchstraps allow an increase in length by adding a diving suit extension strap piece to the standard watchstrap. If required more than one diving suit extension strap piece {{can be added to}} the standard watchstrap.With increasing depth and rising water pressure the (sleeved) wrist of a diver is exposed to compression effects that have a shrinking effect on the wrist circumference. Many watchstraps intended for diving watches have rippled or vented sections near the attachment points on the watch case to facilitate the required flexibility to strap the watch tightly for normal wear at the surface whilst keeping the watch sufficiently tightly in place on the divers wrist at depth.Metal link bracelets theoretically have more failure points compared to metal mesh bracelets and watchstraps due to the use of link connection parts like split pins or <b>screw</b> <b>pins.</b> One piece (NATO style) nylon fabric straps that slide under the watch case through both spring bars (or attaching points between the watch case and strap) are used to minimize the chance of losing the watch due to a spring bar or attachment point failure.|$|E

30|$|To Increase {{the speed}} of the MoMo, the second {{prototype}} (MoMo 2) was designed [18]. MoMo 2 and its experimental field are shown in Fig.  5. It comprises two legs and a translation component, upon which is mounted the DIND. The translation component is moved in a straight line between the two legs. This motion is used to reduce MoMo 2 ’s moment of inertia during a whole body rotating motion. Each leg has three <b>screw</b> <b>pins</b> that are rotated simultaneously by a pinning actuator. This mechanical structure reduces the number of steps in the gait sequence. The arrangement of nuts is adjusted according to changes in the mechanical structure. In the new field, three nuts compose one station and they are allocated {{in the form of an}} equilateral triangle. These stations are allocated at uniform distance and this is the same distance as between the two legs of MoMo 2. This indicates that the two legs are fixed at two adjacent stations. The gait sequence of MoMo 2, illustrated in Fig.  6, is simpler than that of MoMo 1. For MoMo 1, movement between two positions comprised 14 steps. However, for MoMo 2 only four steps are required: loosening of screws, rotation of the body, tightening of screws, and translating the DIND. The moving speed is increased in accordance with the reduction of steps in the process. As it is shown in Table  1, the no-load speed of MoMo 2 is more than six times faster than that of MoMo 1. However, MoMo 2 does not have an additional sensor for checking the status of the <b>screw</b> <b>pins.</b> Therefore, on occasion, a positioning error causes abrasion of the <b>screw</b> <b>pins</b> during their insertion into the nuts. This abrasion results in incomplete insertion into the nut and a gap between MoMo 2 and the field. This gap occasionally causes a critical positioning error between the other leg and its desired station. The latest prototype of MoMo is designed to solve the problems of the previous prototypes.|$|E
40|$|PosterMost of {{forestry}} or agroforestry artificial plantations either have an orthogonal design, or curvilinear under contour lines to prevent soil erosion. These designs {{are known to}} maximize machinery workflow or erosion control respectively. As in many occasions in land use management, what optimizes machinery operation is not what optimizes prevention of soil loss and vice versa. An alternative and intermediate design system such as an Archimedes spiral could offer in one hand, the ability to have equidistant lines to facilitate machinery operation and, in other hand reduce soil loss in comparison to orthogonal designs. Additionally can be an alternative design when aesthetics {{plays a role in}} the planting decision. Although the spiral land use design is present in permaculture related literature, scaling up the methodology to forestry is practically absent in literature. This work tries to contribute to the knowledge of planting trees in an Archimedes spiral design. Making a spiral is a trivial command in computer assisted design, but this work envisaged the creation of the spiral in the field without any high technology software (e. g. tractor with laser technology) to enlarge the scope of possible application. We used the spiral equation to explore and define in the spiral: 1) the number of turns, 2) the distance between the arms and 3) the tree density. The widest machinery of the farmer was five meters so, to allow the tractor to move inwards and outwards in the spiral, we opted to design twelve meters between rows to allow 1 meter safety distance to the tree line. The final spiral would have three arms with two meters between trees in the line (240 trees). Part of the challenge was to implement the spiral with the exact dimensions in order to respect the farmer needs. To implement the spiral in the field a “field spiralographer” was made with the following description: an axis with about 1 meter high, where on top was placed a base with six equidistant arms. Each arm was made telescopic to allow different lengths of the arms. At 2 meters from the center the arms were marked and a screw pin was placed on the mark. A rope was rolled up around the <b>screw</b> <b>pins.</b> The number of complete turns is equal to the number of lines existing in the field spiral. Because the union of the <b>screw</b> <b>pins</b> in the arms’ builds a hexagon with 6 x 2 meters perimeter, a full turn has 12 meters length. To mark the spiral in the field, start unrolling the rope and walk at the same time avoiding a loose rope, marking the place for planting the trees. By the end of a full turn around the “spiralographer” there should be 12 meters distance between the first and last tree mark. By keeping unrolling the rope until needed, the spiral keeps being designed in the field depending on the turns needed. In other words, the “spiralographer” could be an hexagon with R radius, being 6 xR, the distance between the lines in the spiral. Unrolling and keeping the rope unloose will provide a guide to mark the spiral in the field. Because the description might be unclear, a video was made showing the “making of” this spiral preparation: [URL] The experimental site is being used to survey operational costs to compare with conventional designs...|$|E
40|$|Current {{market trends}} are moving from large {{quantity}} production towards small batch production and mass customization. This {{has led to}} the high demand for the flexibility and adaptability of manufacturing technology and systems. Several reconfigurable pin type tooling systems have been proposed and developed to satisfy such demands. However, these reconfigurable tooling systems still suffer from several drawbacks, including difficulties associated with positioning and locking the pins and problems of uneven “staircase” surface effects from relying on discrete finite size pins. The main focus of this research is on building a hybrid vacuum-forming machine system (HAVES) based on reconfigurable screw-pin tooling (SPT) as a test bed for understanding the processes involved in developing this technology and to examine the feasibility of implementing such technology in an industrial system. The SPT used is composed of identical screw pins,which are engaged with each other in an array pattern. By adjusting vertical displacement of the <b>screw</b> <b>pins,</b> a wide variety of component geometry can be formed. The adjustment methodology of the SPT is formulated mathematically in order to help construction of the SPT be parametrical thus enabling automatic CNC G-code generation. The HAVES test bed development involves full machine design and hardware and software integration. The hardware integration task included a CNC controller, drive motors, encoders, milling and screw adjustment heads, SPT, vacuum forming system. The software integration task involved the processing of three-dimensional CAD geometry to automatically generate post processed G codes in order to adjust the screw-pin to the required component geometry and subsequent surface machining for driving the final die geometry and minimize operator intervention. The completed HAVES test bed has been tested for accuracy, repeatability and functionalities with quality good results. An economic analysis has been also conducted to verify the economic feasibility of the HAVES test bed by comparing the cost of making vacuum forming components using a dedicated mould versus using the HAVES test bed.

40|$|Background. Recent {{advances}} in biomaterial technology {{make it possible}} to produce easy-to-handle implants for osteosynthesis with ultra-high strenght and excellent biocompatibility. Biomechanical studies have shown that fixation rigidity achieved with self-reinforced (SR) <b>pins,</b> <b>screws</b> and miniplates is comparable with that of metallic fixation methods. Internal fixation by means of bioabsorbable plates, <b>screws,</b> and <b>pins</b> can be used to stabilize some fractures of small bones in the hand.

Conclusions. After bone healing is complete, metallic osteosynthesis devices become unnecessary or can even be harmful. Metallic implant-related long-term complications and secondary removal operation are avoided by using of bioabsorbable osteosynthesis devices for metacarpal bones osteosynthesis. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{clinical}} practice, bone {{healing is}} monitored with X-rays and manipulation. Its assessment is thus subjective, {{depending on the}} skills of the operator. Alternative and quantitative approaches have been proposed, generally based on the estimation of bone stiffness, which is known to increase with the healing process. The present study investigates the application of experimental modal analysis to fracture healing assessment focusing on fractures treated with an external fixator. The aim is to ascertain the capability of this approach to detect changes in the bone-callus stiffness as variations in the resonant frequencies despite the presence of the fixator, which might hide the bone response. In vitro tests were performed on a tibia phantom where the healing process was simulated creating three different types of callus surrogates, using glue and resin. The resonant frequencies of the phantom with <b>screwed</b> <b>pins</b> and of the phantom with the complete fixator were estimated.
