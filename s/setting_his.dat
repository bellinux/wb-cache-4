5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Alexandria heard of Caracalla's claims that he had killed his brother Geta in self-defence, they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to Alexandria and responded to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before <b>setting</b> <b>his</b> troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder. Following the massacre at Alexandria, Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E
5|$|In Gay's {{final year}} as an amateur athlete he started well, setting a {{personal}} best and school record of 6.55s in the 60m at the 2005 Championship Series. He helped the university team to another NCAA outdoor victory, setting a new personal best of 19.93s in the 200m qualifiers and placing third in the finals. Training partner and friend Wallace Spearmon took first place with 19.91s—his time and Gay's 19.93s were the second and third-fastest 200m times {{in the world that}} year. The pair teamed up for the 4 x 100m relay, along with Michael Grant and Omar Brown, and won with an Arkansas-record-breaking time of 38.49s. With the NCAA Championships behind him, in June 2005 Gay decided to become a professional athlete, <b>setting</b> <b>his</b> sights on a place in the US 200m team for the Helsinki World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Native-born long jumper Herbert McGregor {{represented}} Jamaica at the Beijing Olympics, and was {{the only}} male long jumper involved in his event. He was 26 {{years old at the}} time of his entrance into the Olympics, having not previously participated at any Olympic games. The qualification round for men's long jump took place on August 16, where McGregor competed in the second heat. The long jumper was given three attempts. During the first, McGregor jumped 7.64meters, <b>setting</b> <b>his</b> highest time of the three attempts; he ranked fifteenth in his heat with that score. His second attempt (7.46meters) and his third attempt (7.36meters) were discounted in favor of his best mark. Overall, McGregor ranked 30 out of the 38 athletes who received a score, falling behind Morocco's Tarik Bouguetaib (7.69meters) and placing ahead of Denmark's Morten Jensen (7.63meters). He did not participate in the final round, which was held on August 18.|$|E

5|$|Other {{than his}} stays in hospital, Hess {{spent the rest}} of his life in Spandau prison. His fellow inmates Konstantin von Neurath, Walther Funk and Erich Raeder were {{released}} because of poor health in the 1950s; Karl Dönitz, Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer served their time and were released; Dönitz in 1956, Schirach and Speer in 1966. The 600-cell prison continued to be maintained for its lone prisoner from Speer and Schirach's release until Hess's death in 1987, at an estimated cost of DM 800,000. Conditions were far more pleasant in the 1980s than in the early years; Hess was allowed to move more freely around the cell block, <b>setting</b> <b>his</b> own routine and choosing his own activities, which included television, films, reading and gardening. A lift was installed so he could more readily access the garden, and he was provided with a medical orderly from 1982 onward.|$|E
5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, <b>setting</b> <b>his</b> fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers slid off the track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain for half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E
5|$|The young Ueshiba {{was raised}} in a {{somewhat}} privileged <b>setting.</b> <b>His</b> father Yoroku was a wealthy gentleman farmer and minor politician, being an elected member of the Nishinotani village council for 22 consecutive years. His mother Yuki was from the Itokawa clan, a prominent local family who could trace their lineage back to the Heian period. Ueshiba was a rather weak, sickly child and bookish in his inclinations. At a young age his father encouraged him to take up sumo wrestling and swimming and entertained him with stories of his great-grandfather Kichiemon, who was considered a very strong samurai in his era. The need for such strength was further emphasized when the young Ueshiba witnessed his father being attacked by followers of a competing politician.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to competition, the 200 m {{remained}} Bolt's primary event, beating Justin Gatlin's meet record in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best but, {{despite the fact that}} bad weather had impaired his run, he was happy to end the meeting with just the victory. However, a sub-20-second finish was soon his, as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne, Switzerland, finishing behind Xavier Carter and Tyson Gay to earn a bronze medal. Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience. Also, he was more keen on competing over longer distances, <b>setting</b> <b>his</b> sights on running regularly in both 200 m and 400 m events within the next two years.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, all has transpired {{according}} to Shockwave's plans: the Ammonites, Lost Light and Necrotitan were pupeteered {{to ensure that}} Metroplex would return to Cybertron and bring {{the last of the}} ores with him, while Optimus Prime was deliberately lured into the Dead Universe so that he could destroy Nova Prime and remove his control over it. Using all of his combined ores, fueled by the energy of the Dead Universe — channeled through an unwitting Galvatron — Shockwave intends to bend space and time to his will, collapsing all of reality into a singularity that will be used to feed Cybertron for eternity. As the majority of the Autobots and Decepticons battle the colossal Ammonite army Shockwave summons to the planet, a small team ventures into Crystal City to confront him, where they are soon rejoined by Optimus Prime's team, who emerge through a portal within the unknowingly-undead Brainstorm. Metalhawk sacrifices himself to unbalance the ore equation, destroying the Ammonites, while Bumblebee is killed by Shockwave; inspired by the words and the sacrifice of his new friend, Megatron dons the Autobot symbol, an action that throws Shockwave into confusion. The scientist's loss of focus causes him to lose control of his chronal drive, <b>setting</b> <b>his</b> mind adrift in time and resulting in the re-emergence of his pre-Shadowplay self. Horrified at what he has become, Shockwave allows Optimus and Megatron to kill him, destroying the drive and bringing an end to his plan.|$|E
5|$|Since Marvin {{was well}} versed in Lucha libre, he often teamed with or faced luchadors from Mexico who toured with Noah. In August 2008, Marvin often teamed with Laredo Kid and El Oriental as they {{wrestled}} against Histeria, Antifaz, and Rocky Romero, all representing the Mexican Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) promotion.

In 2009, Marvin began teaming regularly with Taiji Ishimori, <b>setting</b> <b>his</b> sights on the junior tag team title for a second time. In early 2010, the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship was vacated when Kotaro Suzuki suffered a knee injury. Ishimori and Marvin teamed up for a tournament to determine the next champions. They defeated Bobby Fish and Eddie Edwards in the first round and Genba Hirayanagi and Yoshinbou Kanemaru in the finals to win the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship.

After one victory and three losses, the team finished last in their block of the tournament. On October 16, 2011, Marvin defeated Satoshi Kajiwara to win the vacant GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship for the first time. Immediately after the match, Marvin vacated the title, declaring that he wanted to earn it by defeating Katsuhiko Nakajima, who had been forced to vacate the title due to injury and whom Marvin considered the real champion. Nakajima returned on November 27 and defeated Marvin for the vacant GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship. On July 22, 2012, Marvin and Super Crazy, known as Los Mexitosos, defeated Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki to win the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship.
