There are two types of couplings: [...] "regular" [...] and [...] "slip". A regular coupling has a small ridge or stop internally, to prevent over-insertion of a pipe, and thus under-insertion of the other pipe segment (which would result in an unreliable connection). A <b>slip</b> <b>coupling</b> (sometimes also called a repair coupling) is deliberately made without this internal stop, to allow it to be slipped into place in tight locations, such as the repair of a pipe that has a small leak due to corrosion or freeze bursting, or which had to be cut temporarily for some reason..

(Hårdvaruberoende reglering av fyrhjulsdrift) Haldex Traction AB {{designs and}} manufactures an {{all wheel drive}} system called Haldex Limited <b>Slip</b> <b>Coupling.</b> A slip controller controls the speed differences between {{the front and rear}} shafts in the all wheel drive vehicle. The product exists in three generations and a fourth, with some major hardware differences, is under development. The variations in hardware lead to widely different demands on the control software of the slip controller. This master thesis presents a well-founded comparison between Generation I and IV from a control design perspective. Two models were made of the coupling, one for the two generations respectively, and simulated together with a simple vehicle model and a PID controller. The control parameters were tuned for a normal driving condition and then tested for different disturbances. The simulations show that the slip controller in Generation IV can be made faster due to less embedded delay in the coupling. Generation I on the other side is more robust to changes in friction between the tyres and the surface and is more stable for time delays from the CANbus...|$|E
40|$|<b>Slip</b> <b>Coupling</b> {{came in a}} VW Golf 4 MOTION {{that same}} year {{and a year later}} it was {{presented}} in a Volvo S 60 AWD. The first generation Haldex LSC was based upon a unique patented differential pump that created a hydraulic flow proportional to the difference velocity over the coupling. With help of a linear throttle valve, activated with help of a stepper motor, the ‘stiffness ’ could be varied and the torque transfer controlled. One can see the Haldex system as a rotational damper with variable characteristics. Later, in the year 2002 Haldex Generation II was introduced. This second generation of Haldex LSC is still using the unique differential hydraulic pump, but the linear throttle valve has been exchanged for a solenoid controlled proportional throttle valve. On top of that a pressure sensor is introduced and used actively for closed loop pressure (torque) control, which created performance improvements especially within the limits of tyre-road adhesion. However, the mechanical-intelligence 1 is still there for disturbances beyond the bandwidth largely determined by the CAN communication, e. g. slip control and µ-jump. Also it offers great robustness to poor signal quality and CAN signal loss. In case of a broken CAN bus the fall back is a certain predefined stiffness value, which is a compromise between traction and manoeuvrability. LSC’s without this differential pump have to shut off and leave you in the bush, because there is not such compromising pre-emptive torque.

40|$|Somewhere in the {{transmission}} of vehicles today, a wet clutch can often be found. Characteristic {{of this type of}} clutch is that they operate under lubricated working conditions. In earlier research, friction characteristics and performance of wet clutches have been well investigated by several authors. Studies have also been made {{in order to understand the}} ageing of wet clutches. However, most lifetime studies have been made for systems with paperbased friction discs and systems involving sintered bronze friction discs remain unexplored. Friction discs of sintered bronze is used in the Haldex limited <b>slip</b> <b>coupling</b> (LSC), an all-wheel drive system used in cars from many different manufacturers. In order to get a better understanding of how this system can change over time, the study in this master thesis is focused on how frictional performance is affected by oxidation of lubricant, testrig ageing and additive content. This work has been conducted in cooperation with Haldex Traction in Landskrona and Statoil Lubricants in Nynäshamn. The oxidation effects on friction performance was examined using a modified dry-TOST (Waterless Turbine Oil Oxidation Stability Test) on a fully formulated lubricant. The oxidation time period was divided into five steps from 48 hours to 408 h and for each level of oxidation, a friction performance test was run using a pin on disc machine. Also an oil aged in a clutch disc testrig was tested for friction performance. The test is constructed in order to verify that an oil- friction disc combination will last the lifetime of the specific application. Since lubricant additives are vital to the performance of wet clutches the effect of reducing the additive concentration in the oil was also studied, in the range 10 to 100 % of the standard additive formulation. Results showed that a general friction increase can be seen for oxidation, additive reduction and testrig ageing. Lubricant aged in testrig shows significantly different friction characteristics with temperature than lubricants aged by dry-TOST implying that dry-TOST alone is not a sufficient method to evaluate lubricant ageing. Further research has to be made in order to understand the ageing of wet clutches. A better understanding of which mechanisms that are responsible for the decomposition of a lubricant in a wet clutch system such as the Haldex LSC is needed. This thesis has focused on lubricant ageing but no attention has been paid to wear and ageing of friction discs. To investigate and relate ageing of lubricant and friction discs is another important task for future research. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|The {{operating}} performance {{and reliability of}} tribological systems at present are main- tained by employing periodic or online diagnostic techniques. These techniques have of course been effective in enhancing the performance, reliability and durability of various systems. However, these systems invariably have to be shutdown for tak- ing the necessary corrective action based on a system’s condition. This approach is usually considered passive and presently {{there are not many}} active methods which enable corrective action in situ to maintain the desired performance, reliability and durability of complex technological systems. The Division of Machine Elements at Luleå University of Technology has recently coined a new term Tribotronics. It is essentially based on combining the knowledge of tribology and electronics for actively controlling and optimising the performance, reliability and durability of modern tech- nological systems. Tribotronics at present is just an idea and a lot of Research and Development work will have to be carried out for developing viable and reliable Tribotronic systems. This thesis is thus a first step towards developing a Tribotronic system in the long run. As is well known, a lubricant plays a very crucial role in controlling (minimising) friction and wear in machines. The deterioration of its prop- erties during ageing can therefore significantly influence the performance, reliability and durability of technological systems. There are of course several laboratory tests to analyse and measure the changes in properties of used lubricants but the under- standing of their the ageing during service is far from satisfactory. There is thus a clear need to developed some techniques or systems to monitor, and analyse in situ the ageing behaviour of a lubricant during use. This work has focused on {{the development and implementation of}} a Tribotronic Diagnostic System (TDS) to monitor the ageing of lubricant in the Haldex Limited <b>Slip</b> <b>Coupling</b> (HLSC) test rig available at Tribolab, at Luleå University of Technology. A fluid property analyzer has been used in developing the prototype of the TDS. A LabVIEW measurement interface has also been developed to measure and analyse various lubricant parameters. For understanding the ageing behaviour of the lubricant, the changes in the lubricant viscosity and dielectric properties during its use in the HLSC test rig incorporating the TDS have been monitored. The viscosity of the aged lubricant samples were also measured by using Bohlins rheometer in order to compare and check the reliability of results obtained by using the TDS system. In addition, corelation of ageing of the lubricant to friction between the clutch plates in the HLSC has also been discussed in this report. The results of this study have shown that it is possible to actively measure the ageing behaviour of a lubricant by using the TDS. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

The global system of equations was obtained for the bearing and solved using Gauss Seidel iterative scheme. The converged pressure solution was used to obtain the load capacity of the bearing. Numerical experiments reveal the existence of an optimum velocity slip for which maximum benefit is obtained for the slider bearing in terms of bearing load. Increase in the slip parameter beyond this optimum value was shown not to augment the bearing load. Computations put forth also affirm that the bearing load is augmented with increase in couple stress parameter.

40|$|Interactions between dislocations {{and grain}} {{boundaries}} {{play an important}} role in the plastic deformation of polycrystalline metals. Capturing accurately the behaviour of these internal interfaces is particularly important for applications where the relative grain boundary fraction is significant, such as ultra fine-grained metals, thin films and micro-devices. Incorporating these micro-scale interactions (which are sensitive to a number of dislocation, interface and crystallographic parameters) within a macro-scale crystal plasticity model poses a challenge. The innovative features in the present paper include (i) the formulation of a thermodynamically consistent grain boundary interface model within a microstructurally motivated strain gradient crystal plasticity framework, (ii) the presence of intra-grain <b>slip</b> system <b>coupling</b> through a microstructurally derived internal stress, (iii) the incorporation of inter-grain <b>slip</b> system <b>coupling</b> via an interface energy accounting for both the magnitude and direction of contributions to the residual defect from all slip systems in the two neighbouring grains, and (iv) the numerical implementation of the grain boundary model to directly investigate the influence of the interface constitutive parameters on plastic deformation.

The influence of dissipative and energetic interface hardening, grain misorientation, asymmetry in the grain orientations and the grain size are systematically investigated.

40|$|Physics-based {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} earthquakes and slow <b>slip,</b> <b>coupled</b> with field observations and laboratory experiments, can, in principle, {{be used to}} determine fault properties and potential fault behaviors. Because of the computational cost of simulating inertial wave-mediated effects, their representation is often simplified. The quasi-dynamic (QD) approach approximately accounts for inertial effects through a radiation damping term. We compare QD and fully dynamic (FD) simulations by exploring the long-term behavior of rate-and-state fault models with and without additional weakening during seismic slip. The models incorporate a velocity-strengthening (VS) patch in a velocity-weakening (VW) zone, to consider rupture interaction with a slip-inhibiting heterogeneity. Without additional weakening, the QD and FD approaches generate qualitatively similar slip patterns with quantitative differences, such as slower slip velocities and rupture speeds during earthquakes and more propensity for rupture arrest at the VS patch in the QD cases. Simulations with additional coseismic weakening produce qualitatively different patterns of earthquakes, with near-periodic pulse-like events in the FD simulations and much larger crack-like events accompanied by smaller events in the QD simulations. This is because the FD simulations with additional weakening allow earthquake rupture to propagate at a much lower level of prestress than the QD simulations. The resulting much larger ruptures in the QD simulations are more likely to propagate through the VS patch, unlike for the cases with no additional weakening. Overall, the QD approach should be used with caution, as the QD simulation results could drastically differ from the true response of the physical model considered...|$|R
