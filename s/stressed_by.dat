5|$|With a good {{level of}} {{socialisation}} {{at an early}} age, an American Cocker can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed {{seems to have a}} perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.|$|E
5|$|To {{take another}} example, in his {{screenplay}} for The Signalman Andrew Davies adds {{scenes of the}} traveller's nightmare-plagued nights at an inn, and reinforces the ambiguity of the traveller-narrator by restructuring the ending and matching his facial features {{with those of the}} spectre. The film also makes use of visual and aural devices. For example, the appearance of the spectre is <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> the vibrations of a bell in the signalbox and a recurring red motif connects the signalman's memories of a train crash with the danger light attended by a ghostly figure.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky {{discussed}} a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, marine regression, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, {{as the largest}} vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains. The major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as, either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or, not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction. Recent work at Seymour Island, Antarctica showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact.|$|E
30|$|Original item 46 “I {{respond to}} <b>stress</b> <b>by</b> using over-the counter drugs” was merged with {{original}} item 47 “I respond to <b>stress</b> <b>by</b> using prescription drugs.” New item 46 becomes “I respond to <b>stress</b> <b>by</b> using over-the counter drugs or prescription medication.” This is because several over-the-counter drugs are prescription medication within this study population area.|$|R
30|$|In {{original}} item 47, “I {{respond to}} <b>stress</b> <b>by</b> using prescription drugs” was modified to “I respond to <b>stress</b> <b>by</b> taking alcohol or illegal drug.” This {{is because of}} the use of illegal drugs such as cannabis or alcohol in time of stress.|$|R

25|$|Parents {{and family}} members are {{frequently}} <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> a child's bedwetting. Soiled linens and clothing cause additional laundry. Wetting episodes can cause lost sleep if the child wakes and/or cries, waking the parents. A European study estimated that a family with a child who wets nightly will pay about $1,000 a year for additional laundry, extra sheets, disposable absorbent garments such as diapers, and mattress replacement.|$|E
25|$|Februlis {{oversees the}} secundament of the {{placenta}} and is strictly associated to Fluvonia, Fluonia, goddess who retains the blood {{inside the body}} during pregnancy. While the protection of pregnancy is <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> Duval, Palmer sees in Fluonia only the Juno of lustration in river water. Ovid devotes an excursus to the lustrative function of river water {{in the same place}} in which he explains the etymology of February.|$|E
25|$|The industry's {{decision}} to embrace VHS {{in the early}} 1980s, for example, helped {{to do away with}} Sony Betamax, despite the latter format's superior quality.

25|$|Acceptability {{is about}} the {{performance}} of speakers, that is, the actual use of their language in concrete situations. As <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> Chomsky, acceptability does not mean grammaticality: while an acceptable sentence must be grammatical, a grammatical sentence {{does not need to}} be acceptable. For a sentence to be judged acceptable, it must also appear natural and appropriate in a given context, be easily understood and, possibly, be to a certain extent conventionalised.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the refugee crisis could not {{continue}} indefinitely was emphasized in January 1996 when Burundi closed the two camps within its borders and told the refugees that they should return to Rwanda. The refugees instead began to trickle across into Tanzania until Tanzania closed its Burundian border in April after its refugee burden reached 550,000. Burundi, then {{in the midst of}} a civil war, had been <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> the demands of the refugees but was also influenced by a desire not to antagonize the new government of its neighbor to the north.|$|E
25|$|The Tropical waltz was {{performed}} {{in a slower tempo}} and frequently included a sung melody with a text. Those texts usually referred to the beauties of the Cuban countryside, the longing of the Siboneyes (Cuban aboriginee) and other creole themes. With accents on its three beats, its melody was fluid and composed of equal value notes. It was similar to many other songs in which the melody was treated in a syllabic way, where the first beat was not <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> a brief anacrusis but had a tendency to move toward the second beat like in the peasant (guajiro) song.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the antioxidant response to water <b>stress</b> <b>by</b> drought in seven improved varieties, we assessed the enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (ASPX) and guayacol peroxidase (POX). The {{results showed that the}} Aurora, Victoria and Jaspe varieties were resistance to water <b>stress</b> <b>by</b> drought and showed higher values in the enzymatic activity of CAT, ASPX and POX, that their own controls. This confirmed that these varieties were more resistant to water <b>stress</b> <b>by</b> drought. In contrast, clones 00 - 216 - 3, 00 - 207 - 6 and Desirée and Salome varieties, showed resistance and lower values than their controls. However, the Salome variety with 20 days of drought water stress contrary to what was expected showed high levels of enzyme activity compared to controls. This suggested that this variety probably had other mechanisms of resistance to water <b>stress</b> <b>by</b> drought that allowed more dramatic reaction to drought stress. Finally, cuticular permeability showed that Aurora and Victoria varieties had low chlorophyll content in reference to its controls that showed high chlorophyll content...|$|R
25|$|Climate {{change in}} the Arctic region is leading to {{widespread}} ecosystem restructuring. The distribution of species is changing along with the structure of food webs. Changes in ocean circulation appear responsible for the first exchanges of zooplankton between the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions in perhaps 800,000 years. These changes can allow the transmission of diseases from subarctic animals to Arctic ones, and vice versa, posing an additional threat to species already <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss and other impacts. Where these changes lead is not yet clear, but {{are likely to have}} far-reaching impacts on Arctic marine ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Hinduism, in its scriptures such as chapter 7 of the Bhagavad Gita, recognizes four {{kinds of}} devotees who {{practice}} Bhakti yoga. Some practice {{it because they}} are hard pressed or <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> anxiety or their life's circumstances and see Bhakti yoga {{as a form of}} relief. The second type practice Bhakti yoga to learn about god out of curiosity and intellectual intrigue. The third type seek rewards in this or in afterlife through their Bhakti yoga. The fourth are those who love god driven by pure love, knowing and seeking nothing beyond that experience of love union.|$|E
25|$|The heavy cost {{of these}} battles slowly {{exhausted}} Egypt's treasury {{and contributed to}} the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. The severity of these difficulties is <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> the fact that the first known strike action in recorded history occurred during Year 29 of Ramesses III's reign, when the food rations for the Egypt's favoured and elite royal tomb-builders and artisans in the village of Deir el-Medina could not be provisioned. Something in the air prevented much sunlight from reaching the ground and also arrested global tree growth for almost two full decades until 1140 BC. One proposed cause is the Hekla 3 eruption in Iceland, but the dating of that event remains in dispute.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the support}} of the royal family, the reign of Alexander II did not {{produced}} many examples of the style: the economy, crippled by the Crimean War and further <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> Alexander's reforms, was too weak to support mass construction. Once started, projects were delayed for decades. For example, Aleksei Avdeyev's draft of the Sevastopol Cathedral was approved in 1862, but actual work started only in 1873. The foundations, built before the war, were already in place yet construction dragged on slowly until 1888, literally consuming the architect's life. David Grimm's Tbilisi cathedral, designed in 1865, was started in 1871 and soon abandoned; construction resumed in 1889 and was completed in 1897. Grimm died one year later.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem that}} became evident in service was the snap-off wingtips not working as expected. While they worked well under {{carefully}} controlled conditions in flight {{and on the}} ground, in the field, where aircraft were repetitively <b>stressed</b> <b>by</b> landing on carriers and since the wings were slightly less carefully made in the factories, {{there was a possibility}} that only one wingtip would break away with the possibility of the aircraft crashing. This was replaced with an explosives system to blow the wingtips off together, which also worked well, but this ended when a ground technician died due to an accidental triggering. In the end, the wings were reinforced and the aircraft limited to 7.5 g.|$|E
25|$|Mass wasting {{events such}} as the 1925 Gros Ventre {{landslide}} continue to change the area. On June 22, 1925 an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 4 weakened {{the side of a mountain}} located three miles (4.8km) outside of the current park's southeastern border. The next day, 50 million cubic yards (38 million cubic meters) of water-saturated Pennsylvanian-aged Tensleep Sandstone slid 1.5 miles (2.4km) from its source on Sheep Mountain and into the Gros Ventre River valley 2,100 feet (640 m) below, damming the river. <b>Stressed</b> <b>by</b> snow melt, the resulting 5 mile (8km) long and 200 feet (60 m) deep lake breached the debris dam on May 18, 1927 and flooded the town of Kelly, Wyoming, killing six.|$|E
