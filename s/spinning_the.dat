5|$|Destruction Derby 2 is {{the sequel}} to Destruction Derby. Like the original, players race on one of seven {{circuits}} {{in a range of}} modes. The modes are: Wrecking Racing, in which, the goal is to earn points by destroying or <b>spinning</b> <b>the</b> other competitors during the race; Stock Car, a typical race during which cars can still be damaged or destroyed, and Destruction Derby, based around the crash arenas instead of race tracks, in which the goal is to inflict as much damage as possible. A new feature called the pit stop was added to the race tracks, where cars can be repaired. Another major difference from the original game is track obstacles such as jumps and crossovers.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} And Yet It Moves are {{designed}} such that <b>spinning</b> <b>the</b> world at certain moments {{is required to}} progress. Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance, the player must often spin the world such that the character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles. Other hazards such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, or falling into the black void that borders the playing field will tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. <b>Spinning</b> <b>the</b> cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E
5000|$|A {{deterministic}} {{version of}} Toom's rule can be stated simply as:At each {{site in the}} lattice if <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> of <b>the</b> current (center) site plus <b>the</b> neighboring <b>spin</b> to <b>the</b> North plus <b>the</b> neighboring <b>spin</b> to <b>the</b> East is greater than 0, then <b>the</b> current <b>spin</b> has <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> +1 in <b>the</b> next time step. Toom's rule is sometimes called the NEC rule since it involves the North, East, and Center sites. If this sum is less than 0, then <b>the</b> current <b>spin</b> has <b>spin</b> -1 in <b>the</b> next time step. As there are 3 <b>spins</b> <b>the</b> sum can never equal 0.|$|R
50|$|The energy {{required}} to <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> CaH molecule from {{its lowest level}} to the first quantum level corresponds to a microwave frequency, so there is an absorption around 253 GHz. However, <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> of <b>the</b> molecule is also affected by <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> of an unpaired electron on the calcium, and <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> of <b>the</b> proton in the hydrogen. <b>The</b> electron <b>spin</b> leads to splitting of the line by about 1911.7 MHz, and <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> relative to <b>the</b> proton <b>spin</b> results in hyperfine splitting of the line by about 157.3 MHz.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{graveyard}} <b>spin</b> is {{an illusion}} that can occur to a pilot who enters a spin. For example, a pilot who enters a <b>spin</b> to <b>the</b> left will initially have a sensation of <b>spinning</b> in <b>the</b> same direction. However, if <b>the</b> left <b>spin</b> continues <b>the</b> pilot will have the sensation that <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> is progressively decreasing. At this point, if the pilot applies right rudder to stop <b>the</b> left <b>spin,</b> <b>the</b> pilot will suddenly sense a <b>spin</b> in <b>the</b> opposite direction (to the right).|$|R
5|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{technology of}} the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the day could accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred on the dirt tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction and <b>spinning.</b> <b>The</b> resulting tire spin caused the motorcycle to buck and shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer the motorcycle around a corner. Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors.|$|E

50|$|The rollers {{act as the}} “threads” of the nut assembly, causing axial {{movement}} of the rotating screw due to their orbital restraint. Screw rotation <b>spins</b> <b>the</b> rollers, which <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> bearing ring, dissipating the load-induced friction along the way.|$|R
50|$|Some seeders/spreaders have {{directional}} fins {{to control}} {{the direction of the}} material that is thrown from the spreader. All broadcast spreaders require some form of power to <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> disk. On hand carried units, a hand crank spins gears to turn the disk. On tow behind units, <b>the</b> wheels <b>spin</b> a shaft that turns gears which, in turn, <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> disk. As is partially visible in one of the photos, with tractor mounted units, a mechanical P.T.O. shaft connected to the tractor and controlled by <b>the</b> tractor operator, <b>spins</b> <b>the</b> disk. There are some seeder/spreaders made for garden size tractors that use a 12 volt motor to <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> dispersing disk and yaw.|$|R

25|$|Lancashire {{became a}} centre for the nascent cotton {{industry}} because the damp climate was better for <b>spinning</b> <b>the</b> yarn. As the cotton thread was {{not strong enough}} to use as warp, wool or linen or fustian had to be used. Lancashire was an existing wool centre. Likewise, Glasgow benefited from the same damp climate.|$|E
25|$|When the {{pressure}} of the engine's intake air is increased, its temperature also increases. In addition, heat soak from the hot exhaust gases <b>spinning</b> <b>the</b> turbine will also heat the intake air. The warmer the intake air, the less dense, and the less oxygen available for the combustion event, which reduces volumetric efficiency. Not only does excessive intake-air temperature reduce efficiency, it also leads to engine knock, or detonation, which is destructive to engines.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Big <b>Spin,</b> <b>the</b> California Lottery's {{first game}} show, {{broadcast}} its final episode on January 10, 2009, ending its run as the longest-running lottery game {{show in the}} US. The Lottery had several methods for choosing contestants, including prizes in Scratchers games and [...] "second-chance" [...] drawings from other games. The top prize was fixed at $3 million; the minimum guaranteed prize was $1,750. While Big Spin Scratchers remained in circulation in 2009, winners who would previously have <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> wheel on <b>The</b> Big <b>Spin</b> had <b>the</b> option to <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> wheel—untelevised—as an alternative to going to the Make Me a Millionaire show, which succeeded <b>The</b> Big <b>Spin.</b> Following <b>the</b> show's ending in 2009, the California Lottery commission deemed the wheel to be too historic to salvage, and decided to preserve <b>The</b> Big <b>Spin</b> wheel {{as part of a}} permanent exhibit at their headquarters in Sacramento.

25|$|Diane Holloway, Cox News Service (April 20, 2001) — The {{music is}} big-band smooth, {{the cars are}} shiny with tail fins and the {{dialogue}} is snappy, almost musical.

25|$|The vibraphone {{resembles the}} xylophone, marimba, and glockenspiel. Each bar is {{paired with a}} {{resonator}} tube that has a motor-driven butterfly valve at its upper end. The valves are mounted on a common shaft, which produces a tremolo or vibrato effect while <b>spinning.</b> <b>The</b> vibraphone also has a sustain pedal similar to that on a piano. With the pedal up, the bars are all damped and produce a shortened sound. With the pedal down, they sound for several seconds.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{it is an}} {{efficient}} method of gathering food. However, constructing the web is in itself an energetically costly process {{because of the large}} amount of protein required, in the form of silk. In addition, after a time the silk will lose its stickiness and thus become inefficient at capturing prey. It is common for spiders to eat their own web daily to recoup some of the energy used in <b>spinning.</b> <b>The</b> silk proteins are thus recycled.|$|E

As described in the section above, measuring <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> about <b>the</b> horizontal axis can allow an atom which was spin up to become spin down: measuring its <b>spin</b> about <b>the</b> horizontal axis collapses its wave function {{into one of the}} eigenstates of this measurement, which means it is no longer in an eigenstate of <b>spin</b> about <b>the</b> {{vertical axis}}, so can take either value.|$|R
25|$|Engineering {{achievements}} of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science. The advancements made a great contribution {{to the quality of}} life. In the first revolution, Lewis Paul was the original inventor of roller <b>spinning,</b> <b>the</b> basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill. Matthew Boulton and James Watt's improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both the Kingdom of Great Britain and the world.|$|E
25|$|An NMR {{spectrometer}} typically {{consists of}} a spinning sample-holder inside a very strong magnet, a radio-frequency emitter and a receiver with a probe (an antenna assembly) that goes inside the magnet to surround the sample, optionally gradient coils for diffusion measurements and electronics to control the system. <b>Spinning</b> <b>the</b> sample is necessary to average out diffusional motion. Whereas, measurements of diffusion constants (diffusion ordered spectroscopy or DOSY) are done the sample stationary and spinning off, and flow cells {{can be used for}} online analysis of process flows.|$|E

On the return trip, known as putting up, as the carriage moves back to its original position, the newly spun yarn is wound onto the spindle {{in the form of}} a cone-shaped cop. As the mule spindle travels on its carriage, the roving which it spins is fed to it through rollers geared to revolve at different speeds to draw out the yarn.|$|E

There, Sergeant Iverson developed an unorthodox method of <b>spinning</b> <b>the</b> ball, which he gripped between his thumb and middle finger. This enabled him to bowl a wide variety of deliveries, including off breaks, leg breaks and googlies, without any change of action. At this stage he was only playing socially in spontaneous recreation with other army colleagues.|$|E
25|$|Large {{quantities}} of pure CNTs {{can be made}} into a fiber (a.k.a. filament) by wet <b>spinning.</b> <b>The</b> fiber is either directly spun from the synthesis pot or spun from pre-made dissolved CNTs. Individual fibers can be turned into a yarn. Apart from its strength and flexibility, the main advantage is making an electrically conducting yarn. The electronic properties of individual CNT fibers (i.e. bundle of individual CNT) is governed by the two-dimensional structure of CNTs.. At 300 K, CNT fibers have a conductivity one order of magnitude higher than the best electrical conductors.|$|E
25|$|A {{bolas spider}} is any of {{several species of}} orb-weaver spider that, instead of <b>spinning</b> <b>the</b> typical web, hunt by using a sticky 'capture blob' of silk {{on the end of}} a line, known as a 'bolas'. By {{swinging}} the bolas at flying male moths or moth flies nearby, the spider may snag its prey rather like a fisherman snagging a fish on a hook. Because of this, they are also called angling or fishing spiders (although the remotely related genus Dolomedes is also called a fishing spider). The prey is lured to the spider by the production of up to three pheromone-analogues.|$|E
