40|$|The {{ability of}} certain spore-forming {{bacteria}} in the order Bacillales (e. g., Bacillus spp., Paenibacillus spp.) to survive pasteurization in spore form and grow at refrigeration temperatures results in product spoilage and limits the shelf life of high temperature, short time (HTST) -pasteurized fluid milk. To facilitate development of strategies to minimize contamination of raw milk with psychrotolerant Bacillales spores, we conducted a longitudinal study of 10 New York State dairy farms, which included yearlong monthly assessments of the frequency and levels of bulk tank raw milk psychrotolerant spore contamination, along with administration of questionnaires to identify farm management practices associated with psychrotolerant spore presence over time. Milk samples were first spore pasteurized (80 °C for 12 min) and then analyzed for <b>sporeformer</b> counts on the initial day of spore pasteurization (SP), and after refrigerated storage (6 °C) for 7, 14, and 21 d after SP. Overall, 41 % of samples showed <b>sporeformer</b> counts of > 20, 000 cfu/mL at d 21, with Bacillus and Paenibacillus spp. being predominant causes of high <b>sporeformer</b> counts. Statistical analyses identified 3 management factors (more frequent cleaning of the bulk tank area, {{the use of a}} skid steer to scrape the housing area, and segregating problem cows during milking) that were all associated with lower probabilities of d- 21 Bacillales spore detection in SP-treated bulk tank raw milk. Our data emphasize that appropriate on-farm measures to improve overall cleanliness and cow hygiene will reduce the probability of psychrotolerant Bacillales spore contamination of bulk tank raw milk, allowing for consistent production of raw milk with reduced psychrotolerant spore counts, which will facilitate production of HTST-pasteurized milk with extended refrigerated shelf life...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of psychrotrophic or highly thermoresistant spore-forming bacteria {{in food and}} feedstuff responsible for food poisoning and spoilage raises major safety and economical issues. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the performances of a ready-to-use PCR assay (alternative method) in comparison with the standard microbiological plating method regarding spore-forming bacteria detection in food samples. An overnight sample enrichment was selected to increase <b>sporeformer</b> diversity recovery, spore germination, bacterial growth and favour DNA extraction. A total of 180 <b>sporeformer</b> isolates representing 38 different species and 8 genera were tested in the PCR assays. Inclusivity and exclusivity results ensured specific detection and identification of the majority of targeted genera and species. Validation studies carried on artificially contaminated food samples showed detection of the inoculated contaminants in most cases, with increased detection limit for the alternative method which enabled detection with up 1 spore of B. cereus in 25 g food sample. Using naturally contaminated food samples, standard method comforted the alternative method. In a number of cases, the alternative method was able to identify species not detected with the standard method. In addition, identification and discrimination between the B. cereus group members was possible. Thus, associated to a key element, i. e., the enrichment step, the developed multiparametric PCR-based assays reported in this study provide a fast, sensitive and reliable detection and identification tool for mostly encountered spore-forming food contaminants.

40|$|Dairy powder {{products}} (e. g., sweet whey, nonfat dry milk, acid whey, and whey protein concentrate- 80) are of important economic {{interest to the}} dairy industry. According to the U. S. Dairy Export Council, customers have set strict tolerances (< 500 to < 1, 000 /g) for thermophilic and mesophilic spores in dairy powders; therefore, understanding proliferation and survival of sporeforming organisms within dairy powder processing plants is necessary to control and reduce <b>sporeformer</b> counts. Raw, work-in process, and finished product samples were collected from four dairy powder processing facilities in the northeast United States over a 1 -year period. Two spore treatments were applied: i) 80 °C/ 12 min for sporeformers and ii) 100 °C/ 30 min for highly heat resistant sporeformers. Raw material, work-in-process and finished product samples were analyzed for thermophilic, mesophilic and psychrotolerant sporeformers resulting in 77. 5 %, 71. 0 % and 4. 6 % of samples positive for those organisms, respectively. Work-in-process and finished product samples were analyzed for highly heat resistant thermophilic and mesophilic sporeformers resulting in 63. 7 % and 42. 6 % of samples positive, respectively. Results varied considerably by product and plant; sweet whey and non-fat dry milk had the highest overall prevalence of thermophilic and mesophilic sporeformers, whereas acid whey and whey protein concentrate- 80 had much lower levels. The results provide a preliminary evaluation of mesophilic and thermophilic sporeformers in various dairy powders. This study also revealed that thermophilic sporeformers are the primary organism of concern in dairy powders and {{that there must be}} further study of sporeformers, specifically, thermophilic Sporeformers, within the dairy powder processing continuum, to reduce overall spore counts in finished products.

40|$|The dairy {{industry}} is recently facing a quality problem {{due to the}} presence of <b>sporeformer</b> bacteria in different products. These bacteria are members mainly of the Bacillus taxonomic group and due to their abilities to survive pasteurization, can not be controlled by this process technology. Consequently, this bacteria population affects the quality of some products during storage (e. g. fluid milk) and limit their potential markets (e. g. milk powder). Since no technology/interventions are currently available to eliminate this bacteria type once they enter the milk chain, the identification of their entry points and sources is essential information to design potential interventions to control them at early stages. In order to address this issue, this research focused on identifying those “problematic” sporeforming bacteria across the milk chain (from sources at farm level, raw milk, fluid milk and condensed milk) using DNA-based methods (rpoB or 16 S). Moreover, associations affecting their entrance into the milk chain were also studied, including weather and potential farm practices. The identification of problematic sporeformers suggests that Paenibacillus spp. are responsible for spoilage of fluid milk due to their ability to grow and survive the processing conditions encountered during pasteurization and condensation. Other Bacillus species found in condensed milk include: B. claussi, B. subtilis, Lysinibacillus sp., B. safensis, B. licheniformis, B. sonorensis and Brevibacillus spp. These last three species are capable of growing at thermophilic temperatures (55 °C) being potential problematic for the milk powder industry. Therefore, contamination of other dairy products could occur when condensed milk is used as ingredient. When evaluating the raw milk at the farm level, no seasonal effect was associated with the prevalence of sporeformers bacteria; however, farms seems to have an effect. Among the sources of problematic strains at the farm, it was found that milking equipment and cow teats are associated {{with a wide variety of}} psychrotrophic and thermophilic problematic strains, suggesting that any interventions at farm level should be targeting these areas. By better understanding the potential sources, scientists and farmers could design and implement suitable interventions to decrease <b>sporeformer</b> counts in raw milk improving the quality of dairy products. ...|$|E

Materials and Methods: After preparing the final suspensions of B. coagulans and Bacillus subtilis subsp. Natto spores, they were spread-plated before and after fast freezing treatment (- 70 °C for about 1 min). Heat shock treatments of the spores were carried out at 68 oC for 15, 20, and 30 min as well as at 80 oC for 10 and 15 min. Concentrations of the examined probiotic <b>sporeformers</b> were determined simultaneously by plate enumerations and microscopically determined counts. Student’s t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of SPSS were used for statistical analysis of the data. Analysis of DoE results was carried out using Minitab. Results: The results presented here show that the highest recovery rates for B. coagulans (14. 75 log CFU/mL) and B. subtilis spores (14. 80 log CFU/mL) were under a heat shock condition of 68 °C for 20 min in nutrient agar (p< 0. 05). In addition, the survival rates of B. coagulans and B. subtilis spores under the fast freezing and subsequent thawing condition were about 90 % and 88 %, respectively. Plate counts differed significantly from counts determined microscopically, with differences of almost 0. 5 and 0. 8 log for B. coagulans and B. subtilis spores, respectively (p< 0. 05). In addition, DoE results of the study revealed that both factors of spore count method and only freezing factor in fast freezing treatment have a significant effect on concentrations of the spores examined (p< 0. 05).

40|$|In dairy foods, the <b>sporeformer</b> Bacillus licheniformis can be {{the cause}} of {{spoilage}} or specification compliance issues. Currently used methods for genotyping B. lichemformis have limited discrimination with only 2 or 3 different subgroups being identified. Here, we have developed a multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) method and combined it with high resolution melt analysis (MLV-HRMA) for genotyping B. licheniformis. Five repetitive loci were identified and used as markers for genotyping 52 isolates from two milk powder processing plants and retail samples. Nineteen genotypes could be identified using both MLVA and MLV-HRMA leading to Hunter-Gaston discrimination indices (D-value) of 0. 93 each. It was found that all 5 MLVA loci were stable following 10 days of sub-culturing of 8 representative isolates. All isolates were also genotyped using previously used methods including randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD) and partial rpoB sequencing. Five different RAPD profiles and 5 different partial rpoB sequence types were identified resulting in corresponding D-values of 0. 6 and 0. 46, respectively. Analysis of the genotypes from dairy samples revealed that dairy B. lichenzformis isolates are more heterogeneous than previously thought and that this new method can potentially allow for more discriminatory tracking and monitoring of specific genotypes.

40|$|Interest in {{the role}} of the {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) microbiota on host health has exponentially increased in recent years, with the microbiome now considered a major organ that can have systematic effects. This has included hypotheses and subsequent studies of possible roles of the GI micro biota in autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). Previous data demonstrated differences in the faecal microbiota of ASD and non-ASD children, particularly within the Clostridium populations (most notably Clostridium clusters I and II). The primary objective of this work was to investigate the diversity and dynamics of the anaerobic faecal spore-forming bacteria (including Clostridium) associated with ASD using a range of enrichment methods. Twenty-two faecal samples were collected from 11 subjects (5 ASD, 3 non-ASD siblings and 3 unrelated non-ASD children), yielding 2340 isolates - 1286 'biotypes' comprising 109 species (60 of which were non spore-formers) from anaerobic cultivation across 8 enrichment methods (aerobic dessication, anaerobic dessication, heat and ethanol treatments of faecal samples, each cultured on Fastidious anaerobe agar and Reinforced clostridial agar). All enrichment methods contributed to the anerobic <b>sporeformer</b> diversity, with temporal stability for some biotypes demonstrated whilst others fluctuated from sample to sample. Biotype specificity was also found among commonly isolated anaerobic spore-formers for the ability to utilize tryptophan and/or phenylalanine. Multiple antibiotic resistance was also common, with more than 50 % of common Clostridium biotypes showing resistance to vancomycin (both ASD and non-ASD isolates). Aerobic cultivation of 7 of the faecal samples (4 ASD and 1 non-ASD subjects; all four treatments) on Tryptone soya agar isolated 180 'biotypes' (446 isolates) including 62 spore-former species (46 Bocillioceoce species, 12 Paenibacillaceae species, 3 Clostridium species and Rummeliibacillus pycnus). Whilst heat treatment gave the greatest diversity of Bacillus, all treatments again contributed to the overall diversity recovered. This is the first study of aerobic spore-formers harboured by ASD children. The diversity of anaerobic and aerobic spore-formers described herein extends our knowledge of these populations within the GI microbiota of ASD and non-ASD children, and demonstrated that employment of multiple enrichment methods is required to maximise the recovery of <b>sporeformer</b> diversity within such complex microbial ecosystems. The Clostridium data corroborates previously published findings regarding distinctions in the Clostridium populations of ASD and non-ASD cohorts (particularly Clostridium clusters I and II). The extensive collection of Clostridium biotypes obtained from the anaerobic spore-former work is an invaluable resource that could be applied to develop and/or validate molecular-based techniques for future studies examining the diversity, dynamics and relative abundance of Clostridium populations at subspecies levels.

Samples were also inoculated with Clostridium sporogenes and were dried and rehydrated at 100 C and stored at 37 C. Approximately 21 % of the aerobes and 37 % of the anaerobes survived drying and rehydration at room temperature. Many genera of aerobes, anaerobes, and facultative anaerobes survived drying and rehydration at 50 C; only <b>sporeformers</b> survived rehydration at 85 or 100 C.

40|$|This paper, {{although}} {{limited to}} the effects of homologous antibodies acting as inhibitors of the sporulation process of bacterial cells, is {{one of a series of}} current investigations of various physio-logical factors concerned in sporogenesis. The essentials for sporogenesis recently have been hypothesized and experimentally supported by Hardwick and Foster (1952). They point out, with good evidence, that spore formation appears to involve an endogenous mechanism and con-sequently is not dependent primarily upon an exogenous energy supply. It is demonstrated further by them that there are two factors es-sential for sporulation: (1) energy from an intracellular source; (2) nitrogenous precursors which furnish the material for the svnthesis of the spore. The main objective of the present paper is concerned with this pool of nitrogenous materials and its relationship to sporogenesis. The author is interested in the supposition that perhaps some of the external (peripheral) protein material of the cell, as well as some of the internal protein components, namely, enzymes (Hardwick and Foster, 1953), may be supplying necessary con-stituents to this nitrogenous pool. This con-jecture was tested by reacting antibodies homol-ogous for resting vegetative cells with external antigenic proteins, which procedui'e rendered the protein units inert. Through this technique some information was found about an inhibitor to the sporulation process, as well as a solution to the necessary nitrogenous precursors of the spore.

The formation of butyrate was shown {{to be dependent on}} the presence of saccharolytic anaerobic <b>sporeformers</b> in the acid-forming population. By the use of pasteurized activated sludge as an inoculum a culture was obtained consisting solely of anaerobic <b>sporeformers</b> that gave rise to the formation of butyrate, acetate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide as the main fermentation products. No formation of propionate could be detected. In this culture, the role of sporulation was investigated by applying periods of starvation and a single-step lowering of dilution rate (shift-down). In an experiment using a mineral salts medium supplemented with 1 % (w/v) glucose and 0. 5 % (w/v) casein hydrolysate formation of refractile forespores as well as cell lysis could be demonstrated after 6 h starvation. In mixed cultures, initially inoculated with non-pasteurized activated sludge, a regular interruption of feed supply for 1 h per day resulted in selection of non-sporulating anaerobes. The fermentation pattern changed to a production of propionate and acetate, with a concomitant reduction of gas production. Similar results were obtained with shift-down in dilution rate. A relative increase of propionate-forming bacteria was accomplished in a continuous culture experiment with regular two times 2 -h periods of starvation per day. The propionate-forming microbial population consisted predominantly of curved rods, tentatively identified as Selenomonas s...|$|R
40|$|The pathway whereby certain {{bacterial}} {{strains of}} the genus Bacillus degrade m-hydroxybenzoate is delineated. Of 12 strains examined, nine were tentatively classified as representatives of the species Bacillus brevis, two of Bacillus sphaericus and one of Bacillus megaterium. All strains degraded m-hydroxybenzoate via the same pathway. m-Hydroxybenzoate was hydroxylated to 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoate (gentisate), which was oxidized by a gentisate 1, 2 -dioxygenase yielding maleylpyruvate. Maleylpyruvate was hydrolyzed without prior cis, cis to cis, trans isomerization yielding pyruvate and maleic acid. Numerous soils were examined by plate-count procedures and found to contain 104 to 106 aerobic <b>sporeformers</b> able to grow on m-hydroxybenzoate per g of dry soil...|$|R
40|$|The ‘rag-bag {{character}} of ‘coli-aerogenes’ bacteria used originally as markers for process failure has prompted their substitution by the taxonomically accurately delineated group of Enterobacteriaceae. Media previously {{used for the}} detection or enumeration of the coli-aerogenes group {{can be adapted to}} monitoring Enterobacteriaceae simply by replacing lactose by glucose. Test strains including fastidious as well as more robust Enterobacteriaceae are used for the evaluation of media considered appropriate. They should be recovered within 0. 5 log 10 of cfu-numbers obtained on non-selective media whereas <b>sporeformers</b> and cocci should lead to less than 5 log 10 cycles of the recovery on or in control media...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnited States dairy {{industry}} exports have steadily risen in importance {{over the last}} 10 yr, with dairy powders playing a particularly critical role. Currently, approximately half of US-produced nonfat dry milk and skim milk powder is exported. Reaching new and expanding existing export markets relies {{in part on the}} control of endospore-forming bacteria in dairy powders. This study reports baseline mesophilic and thermophilic spore counts and spore populations from 55 raw material samples (primarily raw milk) and 33 dairy powder samples from dairy powder processors across the United States. Samples were evaluated using various spore testing methodologies and included initial heat treatments of (1) 80 °C for 12 min; (2) 100 °C for 30 min; and (3) 106 °C for 30 min. Results indicate that significant differences in both the level and population of spores were found for both raw milk and dairy powders with the various testing methods. Additionally, on average, spore counts were not found to increase significantly from the beginning to the end of dairy powder processing, most likely related to the absence of biofilm formation by processing plant-associated sporeformers (e. g., Anoxybacillus sp.) in the facilities sampled. Finally, in agreement with other studies, Bacillus licheniformis was found to be the most prevalent <b>sporeformer</b> in both raw materials and dairy powders, highlighting the importance of this organism in developing strategies for control and reduction of spore counts in dairy powders. Overall, this study emphasizes the need for standardization of spore enumeration methodologies in the dairy powder industry...|$|E
40|$|In the {{presented}} {{review the}} general data concerning probiotics is considered, i. e. {{definitions of the}} term, classification principles, and the core benefits of usage if compared to antibiotics. Are noted The criteria of choice and {{the characteristics of the}} main sorts of bacteria used as basic probiotics. Special attention in terms of usage for producing bacteriemic medicines is paid to Bacillus spore-former bacteria, as normal micro-flora exogenous components that do not produce biofilms. Bacillus <b>sporeformer</b> bacteria are also able to produce a wide spectrum of biologically active substances, including antibiotics, lysozyme, proteolytic enzymes, and able to influence the immunological reactivity of macro-organism, therefore stimulating the growth of secretory immunoglobulins`, macrophages`, natural killers` activity. The Subalinum biological features are considered. The basic for Subalinum is genetically modified strain of Bacillus subtillis 2335 / 105 with a plasmid, containing the gene for alpha- 2 human interferon. The characteristics for genetically modified strains of E. coli is given, as being perspective for creating probiotics for effective treatment of diarrhea, caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli and Vibrio cholera. They are proposed for creating recombinant strains of bifidobacteria for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases` treatment and prevention. They are also prospective for making Lactococcus lactis recombinative strain for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's diseases` treatment. The potential dangers of drugs based on living organisms are being discussed. Some of the mechanisms of probiotics influence on the immune system and aspects of clinical application of probiotics for preventing and treating dysbiosis, atopy, intestinal infections of bacterial and viral, cardiovascular, cancer and secondary immunodeficiencies, are highlighted. The research paper contains the possibility of co-using probiotics as vaccination adjuvant...|$|E
40|$|Social {{concern about}} misuse of {{antibiotics}} as growth promoters (AGP) and generation of multidrug-resistant bacteria have restricted the dietary inclusion of antibiotics in livestock feed in several countries. Direct-fed microbials (DFM) {{are one of}} the multiple alternatives commonly evaluated as substitutes of AGP. <b>Sporeformer</b> bacteria from the genus Bacillus have been extensively investigated because of their extraordinary properties to form highly-resistant endospores, production of antimicrobial compounds and synthesize different exogenous enzymes. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate and select Bacillus spp. from environmental and poultry sources as DFM candidates, considering their enzyme production profile, biofilm synthesis capacity and pathogen-inhibition activity. Thirty one Bacillus isolates were screened for in vitro relative enzyme activity of amylase, protease, lipase and phytase using a selective media for each enzyme, with 3 / 31 strains selected as superior enzyme producers. These three isolates were identified as B. subtilis (1 / 3), and B. amyloliquefaciens (2 / 3) based on biochemical tests and 16 S rRNA sequence analysis. For evaluation of biofilm synthesis, the generation of an adherent crystal violet-stained ring was determined in polypropylene tubes, resulting in 11 / 31 strains showing a strong biofilm formation. Moreover, all Bacillus strains were evaluated for growth inhibition activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (26 / 31), Escherichia coli (28 / 31) and Clostridioides difficile (29 / 31). Additionally, in previous in vitro and in vivo studies, these selected Bacillus strains have shown to be resistant to different biochemical conditions of the gastrointestinal tract of poultry. Results of the present study suggest that the selection and consumption of Bacillus-DFM, producing a variable set of enzymes and antimicrobial compounds may contribute to enhanced performance through improving nutrient digestibility, reducing intestinal viscosity, maintaining a beneficial gut microbiota and promoting healthy intestinal integrity in poultry...|$|E

40|$|We {{were able}} to isolate Bacillus thuringiensis from {{environmental}} samples with a background of 109 bacteria per g of soil. Our selection process differed significantly from classical selection methods which permit only the desired organism to grow. In our process, germination of B. thuringiensis spores was selectively inhibited by sodium acetate, {{while most of the}} undesired <b>sporeformers</b> germinated. Next, all of the nonsporulated microbes were eliminated by heat treatment at 80 °C for 3 min. The surviving spores were then plated on a rich agar medium and allowed to grow until they sporulated. Of random colonies picked from agar, 20 to 96 % were crystal-forming Bacillus species. B. thuringiensis and B. sphaericus were routinely selected by this method...|$|R
