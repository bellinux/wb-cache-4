5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, <b>side</b> <b>mirror,</b> steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|Kristina (Monica Potter) is {{teaching}} Haddie (Sarah Ramos) how to drive, but is so over-worried she stresses her daughter out. Haddies tries to convince Adam {{to teach her}} instead, but he refuses. Later, during another lesson, Kristina distresses Haddie so much she crashes into a garbage can, damaging a <b>side</b> <b>mirror.</b> The two later argue, but they eventually reconcile, and Kristina explains she dreads the idea of her daughter dying in an accident. Meanwhile, Crosby (Dax Shepard) meets and seems attracted to Gaby (Minka Kelly), the therapist helping Max (Max Burkholder). Crosby is {{trying to cope with}} missing his son Jabbar (Tyree Brown) and girlfriend Jasmine (Joy Bryant), who is in New York City pursuing her dancing career. Jabbar plans to visit Crosby, who promises Max the two boys can have a sleepover, much to Max's excitement. However, Jasmine later tells Crosby she cannot visit after all due to an audition. When Crosby tells Max, he grows hysterical due to his Asperger syndrome. He is calmed by Gaby while Crosby watches, realizing the extent of Max's problems. Haddie later has a sleepover with a now-happy Max.|$|E

Factory options included power drum brakes with manual transmission, power steering, heater, passenger's side remote mirror, remote controlled driver's <b>side</b> <b>mirror,</b> custom sport wheels and rear bumper guards. Dealer installed options included side decals, light group, map pouches, vinyl roof, locking gas cap, license plate frames, mud flaps, AM/FM radio, front disk brakes, heavy duty adjustable shocks, and many others.|$|E

In order to decrease the impact that <b>side</b> <b>mirrors</b> have on the drag of the vehicle the <b>side</b> <b>mirrors</b> can be replaced with smaller mirrors or mirrors with a different shape. Several concept cars of the 2010s are replacing mirrors with tiny cameras but this option is not common for production cars because most countries require <b>side</b> <b>mirrors.</b>|$|R

500|$|Debuting in late 2009 for the 2010 model year, {{the revised}} LS 460 and LS 460 L {{included}} restyled {{front and rear}} fascias, <b>side</b> <b>mirror</b> turn signals, and new wheel designs. New technology included automatic high beam lights and a self-repairing clear coat for the exterior paint. The standard cabin received additional chrome trim, an optional DVD entertainment system behind the center armrest, and in certain markets, an all-digital instrument panel with night vision capability. The LS 460 Sport—a performance variant equipped with a sport-tuned air suspension, Brembo brakes, forged wheels, paddle shifters, body kit, and a unique interior—was added. The Sport model received the Sport Direct Shift transmission, {{also found in the}} Lexus IS F, with downshift rev-matching capability and manual mode. A new interior customization program, [...] "L-Select", also became available for LS customers in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 American ECD came {{standard}} with a 170 gross hp [...] inline six engine with a single-barrel Carter carburetor, electronic ignition, 266 degree camshaft, and 7.6:1 {{compression ratio}} with regular cooling system. Included were manual front disk brakes with rear drums, power steering, {{heavy duty suspension}} with front sway bar, Chrysler TorqueFlite A904 three-speed automatic transmission, and 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The exterior of the model incorporated a full vinyl roof with bright moldings, regular bright molding package (wheel lip, rocker panels, drip rails, and between taillights molding), luxury wheel covers, [...] "American" [...] and [...] "Automático" [...] emblems on the rear panel, [...] "258" [...] emblems on rear quarter panels, and golden [...] "ECD" [...] emblems over {{the base of the}} C-pillars. Standard equipment also consisted of front and rear bench seats, front two-point seatbelts, front and rear armrests, luxury upholstery, custom steering wheel, column-mounted shifter, color-keyed padded dashboard, gasoline and water temperature gauges, warning lights (brakes, oil and electrical system), 200km/h speedometer, vacuum gauge, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, heater with front defroster, AM monoaural radio with a single speaker and antenna, locking glove box, parcel sheft, courtesy lights, padded sun visors, day/night rearview mirror, heat and sound insulating cardboard-type headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, rear ashtray mounted on the front seat back and driver's side remote mirror.

2500|$|... 1971 Novas {{were similar}} to the {{previous}} year. [...] The [...] engine was replaced with the [...] in the SS model. 1971 also saw {{the introduction of the}} Rally Nova, a trim level that only lasted two years (until it resurfaced in 1977). The Rally kit included black or white stripes that ran the length of the car and around the back, a Rally Nova sticker on the driver's side of the hood, Rally wheels, multi-leaf rear springs, and a [...] "sport" [...] body colored driver's <b>side</b> <b>mirror</b> that was adjustable from the interior. The well-hyped Vega stole sales from the Nova this year, but the compact soon would enjoy a resurgence of popularity that would last deep into the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Designed by Pininfarina, {{under the}} {{guidance}} of Frank Stephenson, the body styling of the F430 was revised from its predecessor, the Ferrari 360, to improve its aerodynamic efficiency. Although the drag coefficient remained the same, downforce was greatly enhanced. Despite sharing the same basic Alcoa Aluminium chassis, roof line, doors and glass, the car looked significantly different from the 360. A great deal of Ferrari heritage was included in the exterior design. [...] At the rear, the Enzo's tail lights and interior vents were added. The car's name was etched into the Testarossa-styled driver's <b>side</b> <b>mirror.</b> The large oval openings in the front bumper are reminiscent of Ferrari racing models from the 60s, specifically the 156 [...] "sharknose" [...] Formula One car and 250 TR61 Le Mans cars of Phil Hill.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing {{the concept}} of VAM's version of the AMC Rebel, the Mexican Matadors were only {{available}} as a single trim level and in four-door sedan and two-door hardtop forms in their initial year. The hardtop retained the Rambler Classic SST name while the four-door sedan changed from Rambler Classic 770 to Rambler Classic DPL. Both body styles saw the same features as the 1971 AMC Matadors and were almost equal with only few exclusive characteristics for each. Standard equipment consisted of four-wheel manual drum bakes, manual steering, [...] gross at 4600 RPM [...] I6 engine with Carter WCD two-barrel carburetor and 9.5:1 compression ratio, fully synchronized three-speed manual transmission with column shift, 10-inch heavy duty clutch, 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio with manual transmission, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio with automatic transmission, electric two-speed wipers, electric washers, rectangular full-length 200km/h speedometer, electric analog clock, collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch, luxury custom steering wheel, courtesy lights, cigarette lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, wide individual front seats (hardtop), front bench seat (sedan), two-point front seatbelts, front and rear side armrests, dual rear ashtrays, single round dome light (sedan), dual C-pillar dome lights (hardtop), dual coat hooks, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, heavy-duty suspension, automatic transmission, heater with front defroster, vinyl roof, remote-controlled driver's <b>side</b> <b>mirror,</b> passenger's side remote mirror, bumper guards, bumper tubes, and locking gas cap.|$|E

2500|$|The top of {{the line}} models were named American GFS (Concord DL two-door), American ECD (Concord DL four-door), and Camioneta American Automática (Concord DL wagon). All three {{featured}} automatic transmissions, power brakes, power steering, [...] six-cylinder (258 on ECD) with new-for-the-year Motorcraft two-barrel carburetor and 8.0:1 compression ratio, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio, light group (courtesy, ashtray, glovebox, hood and trunk; the last one unavailable on the wagon), custom steering wheel, woodgrain panels on dashboard, parcel shelf, clock, retractable seat belts, luxury upholstery, tinted windshield, bright molding package (wheel arches, drip rails, rocker panels, front hood edge, hood ornament), engine displacement [...] "4.6" [...] emblems ("4.2" [...] on ECD), wheel covers, and bumper guards. The GFS model included a floor-shift transmission and reclining individual high-back seats, while the ECD and automatic wagon had column-shift coupled with a bench front seat. Both sedan models incorporated vinyl roof either in full form (ECD) or Landau type (GFS). The most unusual looking of these models in contrast with AMC's versions was the GFS model as it incorporated the flip-open rear side opera windows and the targa band used in the 1977 AMC Hornet AMX models (the same treatment used in the Hornet-based 1977 VAM American GFS). The optional equipment list on these models included air conditioning system with heavy duty cooling (seven-blade flexible fan, three-line radiator, fan shroud, coolant recovery tank and 55 amp alternator), reading dome light, remote-controlled driver's <b>side</b> <b>mirror,</b> passenger's side remote mirror, and rear defroster.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the VAM Pacer was entirely {{different}} compared to the AMC Pacer. The car was focused to be a high-end luxury car from its introduction to its end, while American Motors counterpart started as an economy car and import fighter. This was reinforced after the first 200 units produced when the three-speed automatic transmission joined the standard equipment list, which by default created the addition of an [...] "Automático" [...] emblem on the bright rear panel. The VAM Pacer became the most costly and luxurious VAM car at the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic line. The uniqueness of the model coupled to its level of luxury and price range practically made the car a flagship for the company, {{even though it was}} never officially considered as such. Probably the most unusual aspect of the 1976 VAM Pacer lies in its seat designs. VAM created a design based on AMC's Oleg Cassini interior for the 1974–1975 Matador coupe that used not just in the Pacer but in all three VAM Classic models for the year. The Pacer's seats incorporated a golden Cassini crest on the adjustable headrests and a pattern with copper buttons forming squares. Unlike the AMC Pacer, the VAM Pacer had a very short list of factory optional equipment. These included rear wiper and washer, rear defroster, reading dome light, trunk cover, remote-controlled driver's <b>side</b> <b>mirror,</b> luxury wheel covers and heavy duty cooling system (seven-bladed flexible fan and fan shroud). An universal air conditioning system was available only as a dealership option among a few others not present in the factory list.|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 {{model year}} Mustang was {{unveiled}} on November 18, 2008, {{prior to the}} Los Angeles International Auto Show. Production began on January 12, 2009 and it went on sale in March 2009. The 2010 Mustang was a revision of the 2005–2009 models, retaining the D2C platform. Design and development work began in 2005, with 2006 being the year when designer George Saridikas' exterior proposal was chosen, as well as Robert Gelardi's interior proposal under chief S-197 designer Doug Gaffka. Doug Gaffka afterward, became immediately responsible {{for the design of}} the 2008–2009 Bullitt and the GT500KR, upon MY2010 design selection in 2006. [...] The resulting production exterior design of late 2006 was substantially revised, resulting in better aerodynamic performance (Ford claimed the coefficient of drag was reduced by 4% on V6 models and 7% on GT models, and that the front aerodynamic lift was reduced by 37% for V6 models and 23% for GT models.). [...] Specific changes to the exterior include a restyled Mustang emblem, a new headlight design with integrated turn signals, new slimmer <b>side</b> <b>mirror</b> design, a prominent [...] "powerdome" [...] hood, and revised three-lens taillights with LEDs that blink in sequence for turn indication. Additionally, the 2010 Mustang GT used smaller fog lights than the 2005–2009 models though they were still mounted in the car's grille. Fog lights on V6 models (a part of a revised Pony Package first introduced for 2006) are now mounted in the lower fascia below the grille. The radio antenna had been moved {{to the rear of the}} car and the lock for the trunk no longer featured a keyhole on the trunk lid, substituting with a remote trunk release only. In spite of its changes, the 2010 Mustang's overall exterior dimensions were nearly identical to the 2005–2009 models.|$|E
