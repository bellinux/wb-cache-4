5000|$|... 1910 Manufacturer of <b>single-sided</b> <b>disc</b> {{records and}} gramophones.|$|E
5000|$|The first [...] "Sun Records" [...] in Europe were <b>single-sided</b> <b>disc</b> records {{put out by}} The Crystalate Gramophone Record Manufacturing Company Ltd. of Tonbridge, Kent, England, {{from about}} 1905 to 1910. (The same company would later produce records under the name Imperial Records).|$|E
50|$|Physically smaller, 80 mm in diameter, DVD-RAM discs {{also exist}} with a {{capacity}} of 1.46 GB for a <b>single-sided</b> <b>disc</b> and 2.8 GB for a double-sided disk, but they are uncommon.DVD-RAMs were originally solely sold in cartridges; recent DVD recorders can work with discs either {{with or without a}} cartridge, and many devices do not work with cartridges. Discs can be removed from cartridges for use with these drives (except with type 1 media, see table above).|$|E
2500|$|The first {{complete}} {{recording of}} an opera was the 1904 recording of Ernani, on 40 <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs,</b> by the Gramophone Company in England. [...] Later recordings include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{installed}} base of single-sided drives, commercial software was normally provided on <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs,</b> or as [...] "flippy discs" [...] that were manually reversed {{to access the}} other side.|$|R
50|$|The {{recording}} of Verdi's Ernani in 1903 by the Italian Gramophone Company, {{a part of}} HMV was the first complete opera recording. It was issued on 40 <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs.</b> The first complete orchestral recording, Arthur Nikisch's {{recording of}} Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, was made in 1913.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} established in 1910 {{as part of}} Nippon Chikuonki Shokai (Japan Recorders Corporation), a manufacturer of <b>single-sided</b> <b>disc</b> records and gramophones. The company was originally called [...] - Nippon DENki ONkyo Kabushikigaisha which was shortened to the name of DEN-ON in Japanese. The company is actively involved with sound systems electric appliance production and later {{the company has been}} merged with other related companies {{as a result of this}} the company name became Denon.|$|E
50|$|On August 14, 1995, {{an ad hoc}} group {{formed from}} five {{computer}} companies (IBM, Apple, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft) issued a press release stating that they would only accept a single format. The TWG voted to boycott both formats unless the two camps agreed on a single, converged standard. They recruited Lou Gerstner, president of IBM, to pressure the executives of the warring factions. In one significant compromise, the MMCD and SD groups agreed to adopt proposal SD 9, which specified that both layers of the dual-layered disc be read from the same side—instead of proposal SD 10, which would have created a two-sided disc that users would have to turn over. As a result, the DVD specification provided a storage capacity of 4.7 GB for a single-layered, <b>single-sided</b> <b>disc</b> and 8.5 GB for a dual-layered, <b>single-sided</b> <b>disc.</b> The DVD specification ended up similar to Toshiba and Matsushita's Super Density Disc, except for the dual-layer option (MMCD was single-sided and optionally dual-layer, whereas SD was two half-thickness, single-layer discs which were pressed separately and then glued {{together to form a}} double-sided disc) and EFMPlus modulation designed by Kees Schouhamer Immink.|$|E
50|$|Blue State was {{released}} on DVD on February 12, 2008 in Region 1 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in a dual sided format with side A being a 1.33:1 pan and scan version and side B having the film in 1.78:1 widescreen. The DVD includes subtitles and an audio commentary by writer/director Marshall Lewy. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released Blue State in Canada on February 28, 2008 on a <b>single-sided</b> <b>disc</b> containing the film in 1.78:1 widescreen. It has the audio commentary but does not have subtitles.|$|E
50|$|The Region 1 DVD set of Season 1 {{was issued}} in non-anamorphic {{widescreen}} (meaning those with widescreen TVs {{would have to}} use the Zoom button for the show to fit their screen properly, causing the picture to be blurry) on 3 double-sided discs. However, Universal reissued the Season 1 set on February 10, 2009 in the correct anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio, which is now on 6 <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs</b> instead of the 3 double-sided ones.|$|R
5000|$|On January 24, 2012, Universal Studios re-released Season One {{by itself}} in North America, as a six disc set. The <b>discs</b> were <b>single-sided</b> for this release, in {{contrast}} to the double-sided discs released in 2004. Season Two was re-released with <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs</b> on January 8, 2013. As a bonus feature, the second season set includes the television version of the original pilot film, [...] "Awakening", the first time this version has been released on DVD.|$|R
5000|$|In Montreal in 1900, Emile Berliner, {{inventor}} of the gramophone sound recording technique, established the Berliner Gramophone Company and began to manufacture the first phonograph records in Canada, first produced as seven-inch <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs.</b> These records were played on a gramophone, also manufactured by Berliner. They produced sound through purely mechanical means, by rotating the discs on a platter turning at 78 r.p.m. and [...] "reading" [...] the grooves with a metal needle, which caused substantial wear and tear.|$|R
50|$|The movie {{released}} in late 1997 on VHS. The movie (as well as 1995's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie) was then released on a two-sided DVD disc in March 13, 2001, and then re-released (just this movie) on a <b>single-sided</b> <b>disc</b> in 2003. This movie was re-released with different packaging in 2011. The movie then re-{{released in}} 2017 in a bundled set with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (this time as two single-sided DVD discs) {{to coincide with}} the movie Power Rangers.|$|E
50|$|The first regular {{issue was}} {{released}} in February 1930. By the summer of 1930, up to half a million copies of each week's issue were produced. But as the Depression worsened, sales slumped. In March 1931 the company went into receivership and in May it was purchased by the Erwin, Wasey & Company advertising agency. A new format debuted in August, featuring two songs or dance tunes on each <b>single-sided</b> <b>disc</b> and a total playing time of about five minutes, but the label remained unprofitable. The final Hit of the Week issue {{was released in}} June 1932.|$|E
5000|$|NOTE: A {{limited edition}} double pack was {{available}} in both 7" [...] and 12" [...] format, which included a <b>single-sided</b> bonus <b>disc</b> featuring the song ...|$|R
5000|$|Leeds Talk-O-Phone was {{a record}} label, {{producing}} cylinders from 1894 to 1903 and <b>single-sided</b> lateral-cut <b>disc</b> gramophone records in the United States of America from about 1902 to 1909.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Universal {{announced}} that the first season of seaQuest DSV would be released on Region 1 DVD along with a week-long marathon of the show on the Sci Fi Channel. The DVD release included never before seen deleted scenes on selected episodes. The second season was released in 2008 in region 1. As opposed to the first season, the second season was released on eight <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs</b> and does not contain any extra features such as deleted scenes. The third season was not released on DVD in region 1 but was released in Region 4 in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Track 15 was {{distributed}} as a free, <b>single-sided</b> flexi <b>disc</b> at House of Love concerts, and later made {{available on the}} Creation Records compilation Pensioners on Ecstasy (1990). It is a solo acoustic performance by Guy Chadwick.|$|R
50|$|The first Lakeside Records was a United States based {{record label}} {{in the years}} before World War I. Lakeside was {{manufactured}} by Columbia Records, who made <b>single-sided</b> lateral-cut <b>disc</b> records to be sold via mail order by Montgomery Ward.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} re-released with {{different}} packaging on DVD in 2011. The film then re-released in 2017 in a bundled set with Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie (this time as two <b>single-sided</b> DVD <b>discs)</b> {{to coincide with}} the movie Power Rangers.|$|R
2500|$|Early disc {{recordings}} {{were produced}} {{in a variety}} of speeds ranging from 60 to 130rpm, and a variety of sizes. As early as 1894, Emile Berliner's United States Gramophone Company was selling <b>single-sided</b> 7-inch <b>discs</b> with an advertised standard speed of [...] "about 70rpm".|$|R
50|$|In 1986, {{the first}} vector-based clip art disc was {{released}} by Compuset, a small desktop publishing company based in Eureka, California. The black-and-white art was painstakingly created by Rick Siegfried with MacDraw, sometimes using hundreds of simple objects combined to create complex images. It was released on a <b>single-sided</b> floppy <b>disc.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vim Records were <b>single-sided</b> lateral cut <b>disc</b> records. Vim was {{recorded}} and manufactured by the International Talking Machine Company and Leeds & Catlin.|$|R
5000|$|DVD-R discs are {{composed}} of two 0.6 mm acrylic discs, bonded with an adhesive to each other. One contains the laser guiding groove and is coated with the recording dye and a silver alloy or gold reflector. The other one (for <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs)</b> is an ungrooved 'dummy' disc to assure mechanical stability of the sandwich structure, and compatibility with the compact disc standard geometry which requires a total disc thickness of about 1.2 mm. The sandwich structure also helps protect the layer containing data from scratches with a thick [...] "dummy" [...] disc, a problem with CDs, which lack that structure. Double-sided discs have two grooved, recordable disc sides, and require the user to flip the disc to access the other side. Compared to a CD's 1.2 mm thickness, a DVD's laser beam only has to penetrate 0.6 mm of plastic {{in order to reach}} the dye recording layer, which allows the lens to focus the beam to a smaller spot size to write smaller pits.|$|R
5000|$|Vocalion (pronounced [...] "vo-CAL-yun") {{was founded}} in 1916 by the Aeolian Piano Company of New York City, which {{introduced}} a retail line of phonographs at the same time. The name was derived from one of their corporate divisions, the Vocalion Organ Co. The fledgling label first issued <b>single-sided,</b> vertical-cut <b>disc</b> records but soon switched to double-sided and then, in 1920, switched to the more common lateral-cut system.|$|R
50|$|Humperdinck {{also made}} {{arrangements}} of various numbers for military band. These were {{recorded by the}} band of the Coldstream Guards conducted by Major Mackenzie Rogan and released on <b>single-sided</b> HMV 78rpm <b>discs</b> in March 1913.|$|R
5000|$|Laser rot is the {{appearance}} of video and audio artifacts during the playback of LaserDiscs, and their progressive worsening over time. It is most commonly attributed to oxidation in the aluminum layers by poor quality adhesives used to bond the <b>disc</b> halves together. <b>Single-sided</b> video <b>discs</b> {{did not appear to}} suffer from laser rot while double-sided discs did. The name [...] "laser rot" [...] is a misnomer; the disc degradation does not involve the player's laser.|$|R
25|$|Universal Studios Home Entertainment has {{released}} all Miami Vice seasons on DVD for regions 1, 2, and 4. Seasons 1 & 2 were released in 2005, and seasons 3 through 5 were released in 2007. The DVD {{release of the}} series had been significantly slow due {{to one of the}} signature features of the show: the heavy integration of 1980s pop and rock music. The music was difficult to source the rights to and acquire permission to use. In the November 2004 announcement for the DVD release of the series, Universal promised that all original music in the series would be intact. On August 21, 2007 Universal announced the November 13, 2007 release of the complete series, with all five seasons on 27 single-sided DVDs. The seasons are in their own Digipak-style cases, and the set is housed in a faux alligator-skin package. Seasons 1 & 2 contained six <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs,</b> rather than the three double-sided discs in the initial release. The Region 2 version has different packaging, does not use double-sided discs, and although there are no special features stated on the packaging they are contained within the season 1 discs.|$|R
50|$|When the AVCHD {{standard}} was first announced, recordable DVD {{was the only}} recording medium. To reduce camcorder size, manufacturers opted for an 8 cm disc, sometimes called miniDVD. Recording capacity of an 8 cm disc ranges from 1.4 GB for a <b>single-sided</b> single layer <b>disc</b> to 5.2 GB for a double-sided double layer disc.|$|R
5000|$|In 1905 the Pathé {{brothers}} {{entered the}} growing field of disc records. They needed to employ several unusual technologies as preventive measures against patent infringement. At first they sold <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs</b> with a recording in wax {{on top of}} a cement base. In October 1906 they started producing discs in the more usual manner with shellac. Even with this less eccentric material, the early Pathé discs were unlike any others. The sound was recorded vertically in the groove, rather than side-to-side, and the groove was wider than in other companies' records, requiring a special ball-shaped [...]005 in stylus for playing. The discs rotated at 90 rpm, rather than the usual 75 to 80 rpm. Originally, the groove started on the inside, {{near the center of the}} disc, and spiraled out to the edge. In 1916, Pathé changed over to the customary rim-start format, a more nearly normal 80 rpm speed, and paper labels instead of the stamped-in, paint-filled text previously used. Pathé discs were commonly produced in 10 inch (25 cm), 10 [...] inch (27 cm), and 11 [...] inch (29 cm) sizes. 6 [...] (17 cm), 8 inch (21 cm), and 14 inch (35 cm) discs were also made, as were very large 20 inch (50 cm) discs that played at 120 rpm. Due to their fragility, unwieldiness, and much higher price, the largest sizes were a commercial failure and were not produced for long.|$|R
5000|$|DVDs {{also are}} {{available}} in single-sided and double-sided formats. When used for movie releases, double-sided DVDs typically have the widescreen (or letterbox) version of the movie on one side, and the pan and scan (sometimes called [...] "fullscreen") version on the opposite side. Some releases place the feature on one side, and the [...] "extras" [...] on the opposite. It is more common, however, for movies to be released on <b>single-sided,</b> dual-layer <b>discs,</b> with the film and extras on the same side, and widescreen and letterbox versions packaged separately. Some particularly lengthy films like Schindler's List and Oliver! are divided between the two sides, starting on Side A and continuing on Side B, and include a prompt for when to flip the disc (identically to a LaserDisc).|$|R
2500|$|In January 1938, Milt Gabler started {{recording}} {{for his new}} label, Commodore Records, and {{to allow}} for longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12-inch records. Eddie Condon explained: [...] "Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development." [...] The first two 12-inch recordings did {{not take advantage of}} the extra length: [...] "Carnegie Drag" [...] was 3m15s; [...] "Carnegie Jump", 2m41s. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: [...] "Embraceable You" [...] was 4m05s; [...] "Serenade to a Shylock", 4m32s. Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record. Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded [...] "Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean", written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo. An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records. An early multi-record release was in 1903, when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi's Ernani, on 40 <b>single-sided</b> <b>discs.</b> In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band's recording of [...] "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" [...] in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record, in 1948. In popular music, this time limitation of about [...] minutes on a 10-inch 78rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record. One exception is Frank Sinatra's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's [...] "Soliloquy", from Carousel, made on May 28, 1946. Because it ran 7m57s, longer than both sides of a standard 78rpm 10-inch record, it was released on Columbia's Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12-inch record. The same was true of John Raitt's performance of the song on the original cast album of Carousel, which had been issued on a 78-rpm album set by American Decca in 1945.|$|R
5000|$|The Standard Talking Machine Company was an American {{record label}} {{that was created}} in October 1901 and {{operated}} until March 1918. The Chicago, Illinois based company produced several models of phonographs from Columbia Records parts and issued <b>single-sided</b> and double-sided <b>disc</b> records from Columbia Records masters. Despite the label name, the discs were not quite [...] "Standard"; the spindle hole {{at the center of}} the discs was 9/16 inch, larger than the industry standard. This made the discs difficult to play on phonographs other than those marketed by the company.|$|R
5000|$|The American Record Company (commonly {{abbreviated}} as [...] "ARCo") {{was founded}} by Ellsworth A. Hawthorne and Horace Sheble, formerly designers of accessories for Edison Records machines at their Philadelphia-based bicycle shop; in a previous venture, they had issued a small run of brown-wax cylinders in the mid-1890s. Hawthorne and Sheble partnered with John O. Prescott, whose brother Frederick worked with International Talking Machine in Berlin, which marketed Odeon Records. The new company was based in Springfield, Massachusetts, though they maintained factories in Bridgeport, CT and Philadelphia; recordings were made in a studio in New York City. American principally produced <b>single-sided,</b> lateral-cut <b>disc</b> records on blue wax, although two-sided issues and standard, black shellac appeared {{towards the end of}} the company's run. In 1906, John O. Prescott left, and Hawthorne and Sheble yielded to pressure from patent holders and retired American, retooling as Star Records; they also abandoned making their own recordings as with American, preferring to re-release [...] "legitimate" [...] discs already marketed by Columbia Records. Hawthorne & Sheble and Star Records was finally closed after unfavorable judgments in 1909 on patents held by the Victor Talking Machine Company.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{home video}} LaserDisc was 30 cm {{in diameter and}} made up of two <b>single-sided</b> aluminum <b>discs</b> layered in plastic. Although appearing similar to compact discs or DVDs, LaserDiscs used analog video stored in the composite domain (having a video bandwidth approximately equivalent to the 1 in C-Type VTR format) with analog FM stereo sound and PCM digital audio. The LaserDisc at its most fundamental level was still recorded {{as a series of}} pits and lands much like CDs, DVDs, and even Blu-ray Discs are today. However, while the encoding is of a binary nature, the information is encoded as analog pulse-width modulation with a 50% duty cycle, where the information is contained in the lengths and spacing of the pits. In true digital media the pits, or their edges, directly represent 1s and 0s of a binary digital information stream. [...] Early LaserDiscs featured in 1978 were entirely analog but the format evolved to incorporate digital stereo sound in CD format (sometimes with a TOSlink or coax output to feed an external DAC), and later multi-channel formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS.|$|R
5000|$|Master {{recordings}} {{were made}} onto zinc plates, {{which were then}} electroplated and a negative-image [...] "mother" [...] made from them to stamp discs. A major reversal of Berliner's fortunes occurred when the mastering plant in Washington D.C. burned down on September 29, 1897, destroying a hundred unissued masters {{and all of his}} record manufacturing equipment. Within a few months, however, Berliner was up and rolling again, with some record production aspects moved to Philadelphia. [...] Berliner records were short-playing. Only about two minutes could comfortably fit on each <b>single-sided</b> 7-inch <b>disc.</b> The absolute maximum depended on the speed, which was not standardized and ranged from about 75 rpm to a more typical 70 rpm down to as slow as 60 rpm. During most of the 1890s, the competing small-diameter brown wax cylinder records were recorded at about 120 rpm and could play for as long as three minutes, although recordings fully that long were uncommon. At the end of the decade, cylinder record makers began a transition to higher speeds, mainly to produce louder-playing cylinders that could better compete with the considerably louder gramophone - cylinders had usually been heard through individual stethoscope-like listening tubes rather than through a horn that yielded relatively feeble sound. A new standard cylinder speed of 160 rpm was soon established, reducing the maximum playing time to a little over two minutes and losing an advantage over Berliner's discs.|$|R
