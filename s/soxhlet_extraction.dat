2500|$|Since {{mannitol}} {{is found}} {{in a wide variety}} of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (Serenoa). Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the <b>Soxhlet</b> <b>extraction,</b> using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another method of extraction is using supercritical and subcritical fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, so are more diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or subcritical fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction â€” [...] CO2 versus [...] ethanol per [...] olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, subcritical water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only [...] water per [...] of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and subcritical extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction. However, the required high operating temperatures and pressures are causes for hesitancy in the industrial use of this technique.|$|E

Two organic layers (moss and F 1) {{as well as two}} mineral soil horizons (EA and Cl) were sampled and extracted with DCM/MeOH (93 : 7 v/v) by ASE at 75 degrees C and a pressure of 6. 9 x 10 (6) Pa or 17 x 10 (6) Pa. <b>Soxhlet</b> <b>extractions</b> were used as the established reference method. After clean-up and derivatization with BSTFA, the extracts were analyzed on GC/MS. Using Soxhlet as a reference, we found ASE to extract all compounds adequately. The n-alkanes, especially, were found to be extracted very efficiently from all horizons studied. Only the n-fatty acids and P-sitosterol from the organic layers seemed to be extracted at a slightly lower efficiency by ASE. In all but two instances the relative abundance of extracted lipids within a component class was the same regardless of the extraction method used. Using a higher pressure in the ASE extractions significantly increased the extraction efficiency for all component classes in the moss layer, except P-sitosterol. The effect was most pronounced for the n-alkanes. In the EA horizon, a higher pressure slightly reduced the extraction efficiency for dehydroabietic acid. The observed differences between ASE and <b>Soxhlet</b> <b>extractions</b> as well as the pressure effect can be explained by a decrease in polarity of the extractant due to the elevated pressure and temperature applied during ASE extractions as compared to <b>Soxhlet</b> <b>extractions.</b> This would mainly increase the extraction efficiency of the least polar biomarkers: the n-alkanes as was observed. In addition, a better penetration of still partially water-filled micro pores under elevated pressure and temperature may have played a role...|$|R

5000|$|A Soxhlet {{extractor}} is a {{piece of}} laboratory apparatusinvented in 1879 by Franz von Soxhlet. [...] It was originally designed for the extraction of a lipid from a solid material. Typically, a <b>Soxhlet</b> <b>extraction</b> is used when the desired compound has a limited solubility in a solvent, and the impurity is insoluble in that solvent.

The main advantages to this technique are the repeated washing of MIP particles with fresh extracting solvent, favors solubilization because it uses hot solvent, no filtration is required upon completion to collect the MIP particles, the equipment is affordable, {{and it is very}} versatile and can be applied to nearly any polymer matrix.

In addition to ferric chloride, other oxidizing agents, including ferric chloride hydrate, copper perchlorate, and iron perchlorate have also been used successfully to polymerize 2,2'-bithiophene. Slow addition of ferric chloride to the monomer solution produced poly(3-(4-octylphenyl)thiophene)s with approximately 94% H-T content. Precipitation of ferric chloride in situ (in order to maximize the surface area of the catalyst) produced significantly higher yields and monomer conversions than adding monomer directly to crystalline catalyst. Higher molecular weights were reported when dry air was bubbled through the reaction mixture during polymerization. Exhaustive <b>Soxhlet</b> <b>extraction</b> after polymerization with polar solvents was found to effectively fractionate the polymer and remove residual catalyst before NMR spectroscopy. Using a lower ratio of catalyst to monomer (2:1, rather than 4:1) may increase the regioregularity of poly(3-dodecylthiophene)s.

Higher-quality catalyst, added at a slower rate and at reduced temperature, was shown to produce high molecular weight PATs with no insoluble polymer residue.

40|$|This paper focusses {{mainly on}} {{improving}} superheated water extraction conditions using the simulation optimization approach known as "steepest ascent". The study examines {{the effect of}} operating conditions {{on the amount of}} five isoflavones extracted from defatted soybean flakes (DSF) using superheated water extraction (SWE), stirred solvent <b>extraction,</b> <b>Soxhlet</b> methanol <b>extraction,</b> and pressurized water extraction (PWE). Amberlite XAD 16 -HP adsorbent was used to purify five isoflavones obtained by reverse phase solid extraction. HPLC analysis was conducted to quantify these five isoflavones as proportions of the amount of total isoflavones (TIF). The steepest ascent design for SWE revealed that the optimum condition was 110 degreesC and 641 psig (4520 kPa) over 2. 3 h of extraction. Under these condition, 3937 TIF mug/g (DSF) was produced. Solid phase purification, by Amberlite XAD 16 -HP absorption, yielded a solid with 37. 0 purity and 49. 0 de-sorption recovery of total isoflavones. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|The {{successive}} extractions {{were made}} with hexane, methylene chloride and ethanol in a <b>Soxhlet</b> apparatus. The <b>extractions</b> were made in triplicate with samples of 20 Â g of leaves or flowers each. The solutions were cooled and then concentrated at room temperature under vacuum.|$|R
30|$|Lipid content (%) of {{the oyster}} tissue was {{determined}} using the <b>Soxhlet</b> method (Buchi <b>Extraction</b> System B- 811) using chloroform/methanol (2 : 1) as extract solvents. In addition, the moisture content was calculated as the weight {{loss of the}} heated sample at 110 Â°C.|$|R
