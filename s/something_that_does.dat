25|$|In 1996, McDonald's forced Scottish {{sandwich}} {{shop owner}} Mary Blair of Fenny Stratford, Buckinghamshire to drop McMunchies as her trading name. Mrs. Blair did not sell burgers or chips. She said she chose the name because {{she liked the}} word munchies and wanted the cafe to have a Scottish feel. The cafe's sign reflected this, featuring a Scottish thistle and a St Andrew's flag. But {{in a statement to}} Mrs. Blair's solicitors, McDonald's said if someone used the Mc prefix, even unintentionally, they were using <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not belong to them.|$|E
25|$|The Asia Minor Expedition and Catastrophe, {{as well as}} the {{uprooting}} of {{the ethnic}} Greek population from Anatolia after three thousand years of presence, had an enormous impact on the Greek psyche. The Smyrna Catastrophe has been considered as the worst incident of modern Greek history, and as an incident of the same magnitude as the Fall of Constantinople for the Greeks. The matters related to the refugees halted the Greco-Turkish relations for many decades. The issues concerning the missing Greeks were soon raised in the International Red Cross, without any success and cooperation from the Turkish side. To this day, the Greek citizens who were born in Asia Minor have to apply for a visa in order to enter Turkey (<b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not apply to Greek citizens born in Greece).|$|E
25|$|That Start transit {{requires}} {{the attainment of}} a threshold cell size directly implies that yeast cells measure their own size, {{so that they can}} use that information to regulate Start. A favored model for how yeast cells, as well as cells of other species, measure their size relies on the detection of overall translation rate. Essentially, since cell growth consists, to a great extent, of the synthesis of ribosomes to produce more proteins, the overall rate of protein production should reflect cell size. Thus, a single protein that is produced at a constant rate relative to total protein production capacity will be produced in higher quantities as the cell grows. If this protein promotes cell cycle progression (Start in the case of yeast), then it will link cell cycle progression to translation rate and, therefore, cell size. Importantly, this protein must be unstable, so that its levels depend on its current translation rate, rather than the rate of translation over time. Furthermore, since the cell grows in volume as well as mass, the concentration of this size sensor will remain constant with growth, so its activity must be compared against <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not change with cell growth. Genomic DNA was suggested as such a standard early on, because it is (by definition) present in a constant quantity until the start of DNA replication. How this occurs remains a major question in current studies of size control (see below).|$|E

The Evil Queen tells the Dragon that he was right about one thing: there was a battle raging within Regina. She then laughs that Regina should have never let her out to play.

2500|$|Austrian philosopher Alexius Meinong (1853–1920) {{advanced}} nonexistent {{objects in}} the 19th and 20th century within a “theory of objects”. He was interested in intentional states which are directed at nonexistent objects. [...] Starting with the “principle of intentionality”, [...] mental phenomena are intentionally directed towards an object. [...] People may imagine, desire or fear <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not exist. [...] Other philosophers concluded that intentionality is not a real relation and therefore {{does not require the}} existence of an object, while Meinong concluded there is an object for every mental state whatsoever—if not an existent then at least a nonexistent one.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia, {{joined by}} Chief Justice William Rehnquist, dissented, {{accepting}} the Act's stated purpose of [...] "protecting academic freedom" [...] as a sincere and legitimate secular purpose. They construed the term [...] "academic freedom" [...] {{to refer to}} [...] "students' freedom from indoctrination", in this case their freedom [...] "to decide for themselves how life began, based upon a fair and balanced presentation of the scientific evidence". However, they also criticized the first prong of the Lemon test, noting that [...] "to look {{for the sole purpose}} of even a single legislator is probably to look for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not exist".|$|E

50|$|The {{foundation}} of Kemal Tahir's ideology can be broadly described as Marxist. As {{a writer and}} a political activist, he saw a contradiction between the socio-cultural and political structure of Turkey and solutions that Marxism offers. Due to his belief <b>that</b> Westernization was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not quite fit Turkish society, he found Marxism somewhat lacking. Marxist historical theory {{is based on the}} existence of a bourgeois class, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not develop in the Ottoman Empire (as in many other 'peripheral countries'). Perhaps the greatest intellectual struggle of Tahir's was in reshaping Marxist historical theory to the reality of Turkish history.|$|R

2500|$|The rabbi's wife {{plays an}} {{important}} community role, especially in small communities. In many ways, she is called on to be as knowledgeable as the rabbi {{in the realm of}} woman's observances: in this manner, for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not require a psak (ruling), she can be approached when a woman does not feel comfortable approaching the rabbi, or where the rabbi maybe should not be approached. [...] For instance, the rebbetzin may often be the [...] "mikvah lady" [...] and help with more mundane questions regarding the laws of niddah. [...] Part of it, certainly, is that she always has the rabbi's ear, and that she would know if the question needs to be asked, {{in order to get a}} psak.|$|E
2500|$|In Plato one {{experienced}} unit is a state, or object existing, {{which can}} be observed. The time parameter is set at [...] "ever"; that is, the state is to be presumed present between observations. Change is to be deduced by comparing observations and is thus presumed a function that happens to objects already in being, rather than something ontologically essential to them (such that <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not change cannot exist) as in Heraclitus. In Plato, {{no matter how many}} of those experienced units you are able to tally, you cannot get through the mysterious gap between them to account for the change that must be occurring there. This limitation is considered a fundamental limitation of reality by Plato and in part underpins his differentiation between imperfect experience from more perfect Forms. The fact that this is no limitation for Heraclitus motivates Plato's condemnation.|$|E
2500|$|Thich Nhat Hanh states, [...] "Pratitya samutpada is {{sometimes}} called the teaching {{of cause and effect}}, but that can be misleading, because we usually think of cause and effect as separate entities, with cause always preceding effect, and one cause leading to one effect. According to the teaching of Interdependent Co-Arising, cause and effect co-arise (samutpada) and everything is a result of multiple causes and conditions... In the sutras, this image is given: [...] "Three cut reeds can stand only by leaning on one another. If you take one away, the other two will fall." [...] In Buddhist texts, one cause is never enough to bring about an effect. A cause must, at the same time, be an effect, and every effect must also be the cause of something else. This is the basis, states Hanh, for {{the idea that there is}} no first and only cause, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not itself need a cause.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} spirit, {{opposing}} New Social Democratic Party party leader Tito Petkovski (which by now {{participates in the}} governmental coalition until NATO's summit), announced: [...] "I do not hide that we must proceed on an international usage name's change, with some type of addition, which in no way must put our values under question. I {{do not want to}} proceed in an auction with the name, because that will be very damaging also for the interests of the neighboring country that disputes it." [...] He added that [...] "the overwhelming majority {{of the state and the}} scholars, ask for a solution and for a way out, using <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not put our identity and our cultural distinction under questioning. I think that such a solution can be found, especially if the greatest lobbyists and supporters of ours, the United States, declare that Macedonia will be safe, with a safe territorial integrity, with financial support and dynamic development.

2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E
