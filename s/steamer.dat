A beach {{at the mouth of the}} Catlins River is named Surat Bay in commemoration of this wreck. The schooner Wallace and <b>steamer</b> Otago were also both wrecked at or near Chasland's Mistake, in 1866 and 1876 respectively, and a 4534-ton <b>steamer,</b> the Manuka, ran aground at Long Point north of Tautuku in 1929. In all there were eight shipwrecks of note between 1839 and 1892.|$|E

5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The <b>steamer</b> Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the <b>steamer</b> Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, {{wear and tear on}} the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw <b>steamer</b> Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E

5|$|News reached Dinapore on 27 July that mutinying sepoys had {{attacked}} Arrah. General Lloyd was still unwilling {{to send troops}} to pursue the mutineers until he was persuaded {{to do so by}} pressure from magistrates, who were personal friends of the besieged party, and Tayler in his role as the Commissioner of Patna. A party of 200 from the 37th Regiment of Foot, 50 from the Bengal Military Police Battalion and 15 loyal Sikhs from regiments that had mutinied, were sent, aboard the river <b>steamer</b> Horungotta, to rescue the town's civil servants. News arrived in Dinapore the following day that the <b>steamer</b> was aground on a sandbank, and Lloyd ordered the party recalled. Under pressure from local government officials, he changed his mind and agreed to send, using the river <b>steamer</b> Bombay, a large force of the 10th Regiment of Foot under Lieutenant Colonel William Fenwick to join up with the party on the first <b>steamer</b> and head to Arrah. Bombay already had a large complement of civilian passengers and attempts to have the passengers removed met with confusion and arguments with the captain of the <b>steamer,</b> causing a delay of around four hours. As a result, only a reduced force of about 150 (including seven civilian volunteers) was able to embark. Fenwick, unwilling to carry out the mission with only 150 men, delegated its command to Captain Charles Dunbar (who worked in the paymaster's bureau) and Bombay departed on 29 July at around 9:30am. The two steamers met up, and the combined force of about 415 then headed towards Arrah.|$|E

These are now at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum. Whilst in Tromsø harbour on 18 July 1955 Tiptoe was damaged when a coastal <b>steamer</b> collided with her. The <b>steamer,</b> a 2,162 tonne vessel called Nordlys, was entering the harbour when she collided with the British destroyer HMS Chevron.

5|$|To get to Ottawa, several {{thousand}} miles away, the club {{had to get}} to Whitehorse by overland sleigh, catch a train from there to Skagway, Alaska, then catch a <b>steamer</b> to Vancouver, B.C. and a train from there to Ottawa. On December 18, 1904, several players set out by dog sled and the rest left the next day by bicycle for a 330-mile trek to Whitehorse. At first the team made good progress, but the weather turned warm enough to thaw the roads, forcing the players to walk several hundred miles. The team spent the nights in police sheds along the road. At Whitehorse, the weather turned bad, causing the trains not to run for three days and the Nuggets to miss their <b>steamer</b> in Skagway. The next one could not dock for three days due to the ice buildup. The club found the sea journey treacherous, and it caused seasickness amongst the team. When the <b>steamer</b> reached Vancouver, the area was too fogged in to dock, and the <b>steamer</b> docked in Seattle. The team from there caught a train to Vancouver, from which it left on January 6, 1905, arriving in Ottawa on January 11.|$|E
