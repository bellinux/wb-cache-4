50|$|The {{new design}} improved, among other things, the {{discharge}} {{area of the}} stripper. This had been a problem area for the carousel <b>stripping</b> <b>machines,</b> in which copper released from the cathode plate fell into an envelope and was then transferred to a material handling device. Copper that misbehaved and failed to transfer often required manual intervention. The new robot discharge system eliminated the free falling of the copper and physically transferred the released copper to the discharge location.|$|R

50|$|Falconbridge began {{marketing}} {{the technology in}} 1992, after many requests from other refinery operators. Thus, the Kidd Process created competition between two suppliers of permanent cathode technology. The main differences between them were the cathode header bar, edge stripping and the <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> technology.|$|E

50|$|Cotton can be {{recycled}} from pre-consumer (post-industrial) and post-consumer cotton waste. Pre-consumer waste comes from any excess material produced during {{the production of}} yarn, fabrics and textile products, e.g. selvage from weaving and fabric from factory cutting rooms. Post-consumer waste comes from discarded textile products, e.g. used apparel and home textiles. During the recycling process, the cotton waste is first sorted by type and color and then processed through <b>stripping</b> <b>machines</b> that first breaks the yarns and fabric into smaller pieces before pulling them apart into fiber. The mix is carded several times in order to clean and mix the fibers before they are spun into new yarns.|$|R
50|$|The {{stripping}} machines included receiving and discharge conveyors, washing, separation, cathode stacking and discharging, {{cathode plate}} separation for refurbishing, and the wax {{applications for the}} sides and bottoms of the cathode plates. The original CRL <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> had the capability of stripping 250 cathode plates per hour.|$|E
50|$|The Kidd Process {{initially}} used a “carousel” <b>stripping</b> <b>machine,</b> but {{a linear}} installation was subsequently developed to provide machines with lower to medium stripping capacities for electrowinning plants and smaller refineries. The linear stripping machines, first installed in 1996, were more compact, less complex and had lower installation costs than the carousel machines.|$|E
50|$|A laser wire {{stripper}} is a computer-controlled machine, {{much like a}} CNC router, which uses a laser to burn off the insulation of the wire. Laser wire stripping machines are used mostly for very fine gauge wires since they do not damage the conductor. A typical CO2 laser wire <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> should be capable of stripping the insulation from any size wire.|$|E
50|$|The 557 was {{prone to}} jamming of the lifter bars and {{resulted}} in what the CEs called a “Rack & Wheel” job. This meant <b>stripping</b> the <b>machine</b> down to its base and rebuilding it, an 8-hour job.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{automatic}} <b>stripping</b> <b>machines</b> requires a uniform and low adherence of electrowon zinc to aluminium starting sheets. Some impurities in the electrolyte severely affect this adherence. The strong effect of F− ions is first reported. Two pretreatments aimed at lowering the adherence are then compared. Brushing the aluminium blanks gives excellent results whereas anodization, even {{for long periods}} of time, is less effective. Influence of these pretreatments on the electrical parameters of zinc deposition has also been examined and economical conclusions are drawn. Differences in the electrocrystallization of zinc on low and high adherence areas are indicated by scanning electron microscopy examination. Mechanisms are proposed to explain the experimental observations. © 1980, All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|Aluminum or {{copper strip}} casting: Commercial twin-belt {{continuous}} <b>strip</b> casting <b>machines</b> {{are capable of}} producing as-cast dimensions from 10-35 mm thick, and up to 2035 mm wide. After being directly fed into a hot rolling mill, the as-cast strip is typically rolled down to 1-3 mm thickness strip.|$|R
50|$|The focus then {{shifted to}} {{developing}} a <b>stripping</b> <b>machine,</b> to develop stainless steel cathodes incorporating the existing header bars and evaluating edge-strip technology. The company’s board of directors gave approval for {{the conversion of the}} refinery to the Kidd technology in April 1985. The conversion was completed in 1986 and the Kidd refinery became the third to install permanent cathode and automated stripping technology.|$|E
50|$|Bull {{was known}} for his {{creation}} of an agricultural <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> which he developed but was controversially beaten to the title of inventor by John Ridley. The controversy was again revived in 1875, when the University of Adelaide proposed to establish a 'Ridley' chair of agriculture. Bull successful petitioned parliament in 1880 for a grant of recognition of his invention and after a long inquiry, was given £250 in 1882 'for services in improving agricultural machinery'. Later research has supported Ridley's claim.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} cathode <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> {{was based}} on that used at the Hikoshima plant of the Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company of Japan. However, considerable development work was necessary to modify the design to handle the copper cathodes, which were heavier than those at Hikoshima, and to process the cathode plates without damaging them. The machines also had to be redesigned to allow for waxing the sides and bottoms of the cathode plates to allow the next copper cathode sheets to be removed easily.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the Batch Processing Machine (BPMs) and its {{scheduling}} {{problem in a}} semiconductor wafer fabrication facility (fab) has been focused,where in there are many BPMs, such as diffusion machines, oxidation <b>machines</b> and dry <b>strip</b> <b>machines.</b> The jobs processed on those machines cannot be batched together unless they use {{they have the same}} recipe of those BPMs. As a result, the {{scheduling problem}} of those BPMs is abstracted as identical PBPM with incompatible job families. In a fab, because most of upstream and downstream machines of the BPMs are non-BPMs, jobs must be batched or split regularly during their fabrication processes. Therefore, a good scheduling solution of those BPMs is important to efficiently utilize their capacity and satisfy the requirements of their downstream machines to balance the fab-wide workload and achieve better fab-wide operational performance...|$|R

50|$|The {{variation}} in copper deposits on the cathode plates {{was one of}} the difficulties encountered with the earlier stripping machines. Areas of thin copper on the cathode plates, which are caused by short circuits, are difficult to separate from the stainless steel plate due to their lack of rigidity. Plates bearing such areas generally had to be rejected from the <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> and stripped manually. Similarly, sticky copper deposits (generally related to poor surface condition on the cathode plate, such as corroded surfaces or improper mechanical treatment), heavily nodulated cathode and laminated copper caused problems for stripping.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the economic benefits to the entrepreneur, {{we also found that}} there was a positive social impact on the lives of the rural user entrepreneurs. The rural user entrepreneurs enjoyed social recognition, experienced greater self-esteem, social respect, and acceptability. Further, rural user innovation and entrepreneurship is likely to make an impact at the community/society level also. The increased efficiency and productivity {{with the use of the}} product is likely to lead to the economic prosperity for its user community. The users of such products are likely to experience improved quality of life by gaining access to affordable low-cost products meeting their local needs. Further, some of these products can also offer health benefits in the form of reduced harmful impacts of existing products/methods as seen in the case of Patel's cotton <b>stripping</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
