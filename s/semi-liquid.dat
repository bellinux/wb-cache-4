5|$|Davies's Merthyr {{constituency}} {{included the}} mining village of Aberfan, situated {{a few miles}} south of Merthyr Tydfil. On the mountainsides above the village, colliery waste had been dumped {{over the years to}} form large spoil tips. Shortly after 9:00 am on Friday 21 October 1966 one of these tips collapsed, sending thousands of tons of <b>semi-liquid</b> waste hurtling towards Aberfan. The point of impact was Pantglas Junior School, where morning lessons were beginning. The school was half buried; inside, 109 children and 5 teachers were killed. A further 7 children and 23 adults lost their lives outside the school, in the streets or adjoining houses. In the immediate aftermath, Davies visited and consoled the bereaved families in Aberfan, and the following day he led a party which included the Duke of Edinburgh {{on a tour of the}} disaster site.|$|E

The hydraulic fluid properties of these viscous hybrid materials were evaluated and {{compared with those of}} some commercially available hydraulic fluids: Mobil EAL 224 H, Super-V (AP) and Puroil SHO.

Brief mention will be made of the possible advantages of systems that are glassy solids but more conductive than most liquids, and <b>semi-liquids,</b> that are crystals with respect to their centers of mass, but have their rotational degrees of freedom, highly excited. Some applications in battery technology will be discussed, and some limitations will be noted...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to oceanic tides, large lakes can experience small tides and even planets can experience atmospheric tides and Earth tides. These are continuum mechanical phenomena. The first two {{take place in}} fluids. The third affects the Earth's thin solid crust surrounding its <b>semi-liquid</b> interior (with various modifications).|$|E
25|$|The four inner or {{terrestrial}} planets have dense, rocky compositions, {{few or no}} moons, and no ring systems. They {{are composed}} largely of minerals with high melting points, such as the silicates which form their solid crusts and <b>semi-liquid</b> mantles, and metals such as iron and nickel, which form their cores.|$|E
25|$|To produce {{concrete}} {{from most}} cements (excluding asphalt), water {{is mixed with}} the dry powder and aggregate, which produces a <b>semi-liquid</b> slurry that can be shaped, typically by pouring it into a form. The concrete solidifies and hardens through a chemical process called hydration. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together, creating a robust stone-like material.|$|E
40|$|Volatile {{substances}} are {{chemical compounds}} that give off fumes at room temperature. They are also called ‘inhalants’ {{in recognition of}} their route of administration [1]. They are central nervous system depressants, and their use involves deliberate inhalation to produce a state of altered consciousness or intoxication. Onset of effect occurs rapidly because the extensive capillary surface of the lungs readily absorbs the vapour, causing blood levels to peak within minutes of use [2]. There are approximately 250 household, medical and industrial products that contain potentially intoxicating volatile substances [1]. Many of these are readily available. Volatile substances are usually classified into four groups [3]: •	 solvents-liquids or <b>semi-liquids</b> that vaporise at room temperature, such as glues and petrol •	 gases-medical anaesthetics and fuel gases, such as lighter fuels •	 aerosols-sprays containing propellants and solvents •	 nitrites-amyl nitrite or cyclohexyl nitrite found in room deodorisers Nitrates, however, do not directly affect {{the central nervous system}} and their use occurs primarily for enhancement of sexual pleasure, rather than intoxication. The volatile substances most commonly used for intoxication are aliphatic, aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons. These include toluen...|$|R
40|$|Acid tars are waste {{residues}} of obsolete benzole refining, oil re-refining {{and white}} oil production processes. They are black, acidic, viscous <b>semi-liquids</b> comprising an extremely complex mixture of water, sulfuric acid {{and a large}} range of organic compounds. Acid tars were often dumped into excavations and existing holes in the ground together with various co-disposed materials without any treatment or engineered lining system leaving a legacy of acid tar lagoons. Acid tars may pose potential risks to {{human health and the}} environment because of their acidity, volatiles and other hazardous components. The major contamination pathways of acid tar lagoons are considered to be direct contact, gas emission, bulk tar migration offsite, and surface and ground water contamination. The leaching, weathering and migration behaviours of acid tars were investigated by carrying out a series of batch, cascade and flow cell tests. The results demonstrated that acid tars are capable of leaching Significant levels of contaminants if disturbed, while the leaching level is Significantly lower under simulated groundwater flow in a model soil. The time scale to leaching stabilization was of the order of months in the model soil and is expected to significantly exceed that in the natural environment. To support this work a nubmber of analytical methods for determining physical and chemical properties of acid tars had to be adapted from standard techniques. These modified techniques are described in detail together with recommendations for data integration and correlation of all analyses to form a better understanding of acid tars and their potential environmental impact. The overall findings of the research were integrated to generate a conceptual model of acid tar lagoon processes to assist in assessment. Monitored Natural Attenuation was evaluated and is considered to be a potentially viable approach to the environmental management of some acid tar lagoons...|$|R
25|$|The coordinated contractions {{of these}} layers is called {{peristalsis}} and propels the food through the tract. Food in the GI tract {{is called a}} bolus (ball of food) from the mouth down to the stomach. After the stomach, the food is partially digested and <b>semi-liquid,</b> and {{is referred to as}} chyme. In the large intestine the remaining semi-solid substance is referred to as faeces.|$|E
25|$|Valhalla {{consists}} of a bright central region 360km across, an inner ridge and trough zone and striking concentric rings extending up to about 1,900km from the center. Several large impact craters and catenae are superimposed on Valhalla. Valhalla multi-ring system is of impact origin and may have formed as <b>semi-liquid</b> or liquid material underlying the brittle lithosphere punctured by the impactor slumped towards {{the center of the}} crater following the impact.|$|E
25|$|F. scalaris {{is usually}} found on cadavers in exposed gut content or excrement. They are often found on urine-soaked babies’ napkins and wet blankets. This species {{is also found}} on highly {{decomposed}} bodies that are in containers that do not allow drainage, which can form <b>semi-liquid</b> media. They usually arrive at bodies after the blow flies and flesh flies, when the body is at a greater state of decomposition.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of F. scalaris, when full grown, are 6 to 8mm in length, {{white or}} cream colored, and {{slightly}} flattened dorsally. They have long tubercles on every segment with the {{projections of the}} eighth segment longer than both the seventh and eighth segments put together. The protuberances are feathered due to their preferences for <b>semi-liquid</b> organic matter. They {{are similar to the}} hairy maggot blowfly in appearance but smaller in size. During the pupal stage, the puparium is brown in color and the same shape as the larvae.|$|E

500|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74 {{consisted}} of a glass sphere in which was contained approximately [...] of <b>semi-liquid</b> nitroglycerin devised by ICI. The sphere was covered in stockinette which was coated with a liberal amount of birdlime, an extremely adhesive substance from which the nickname 'sticky bomb' was derived. A casing made out of thin sheet-metal, and formed of two halves, was then placed around the sphere and {{held in place by}} a wooden handle, inside which was a five-second fuse. The handle also contained two pins and a lever; the first pin was pulled out to make the casing fall away, and the second to activate the firing mechanism in the grenade. This primed the grenade, with the lever being held down to ensure the fuse was not triggered; then the user would run up to the tank and stick the grenade to its hull, using as much force as possible to break the sphere and spread the nitroglycerin onto the hull in a thick paste. Another alternative was for the user to throw it at the tank from a distance. Either way, the lever would be released and the fuse activated, and the grenade would then detonate.|$|E

2500|$|Bone marrow samples can be {{obtained}} by aspiration and trephine biopsy. [...] Sometimes, a bone marrow examination will include both an aspirate and a biopsy. [...] The aspirate yields <b>semi-liquid</b> bone marrow, which can be examined by a pathologist under a light microscope and analyzed by flow cytometry, chromosome analysis, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequently, a trephine biopsy is also obtained, which yields a narrow, cylindrically shaped solid piece of bone marrow, 2mm wide and 2cm long (80 μL), which is examined microscopically (sometimes with the aid of immunohistochemistry) for cellularity and infiltrative processes. An aspiration, using a 20 mL syringe, yields approximately 300 μL of bone marrow. A volume greater than 300 μL is not recommended, since it may dilute the sample with peripheral blood.|$|E

2500|$|The {{endothermic}} {{property of}} this reaction {{is relevant to}} the performance of drywall, conferring fire resistance to residential and other structures. In a fire, the structure behind a sheet of drywall will remain relatively cool as water is lost from the gypsum, thus preventing (or substantially retarding) damage to the framing (through combustion of wood members or loss of strength of steel at high temperatures) and consequent structural collapse. But at higher temperatures, calcium sulfate will release oxygen and act as an oxidizing agent. This property is used in aluminothermy. In contrast to most minerals, which when rehydrated simply form liquid or <b>semi-liquid</b> pastes, or remain powdery, calcined gypsum has an unusual property: when mixed with water at normal (ambient) temperatures, it quickly reverts chemically to the preferred dihydrate form, while physically [...] "setting" [...] to form a rigid and relatively strong gypsum crystal lattice: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{children}} {{over the age}} of four who have been toilet trained, a similar condition is generally termed encopresis (or soiling), which refers to the voluntary or involuntary loss of (usually soft or <b>semi-liquid)</b> stool. The term pseudoincontinence is used when there is FI in children who have anatomical defects (e.g. enlarged sigmoid colon or anal stenosis). Encopresis is a term that is usually applied when there are no such anatomical defects present. The ICD-10 classifies nonorganic encopresis under [...] "behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence" [...] and organic causes of encopresis along with FI. [...] FI can also be classified according to gender, since the cause in females may be different from males, for example it may develop following radical prostatectomy in males, whereas females may develop FI as an immediate or delayed consequence of damage whilst giving birth. Pelvic anatomy is also different according to gender, with a wider pelvic outlet in females.|$|E
2500|$|Digestion {{begins in}} the mouth with the {{secretion}} of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage {{the walls of the}} stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick <b>semi-liquid</b> chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. [...] The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine.|$|E
2500|$|Counter-mining {{activity}} by the Tunnelling Companies RE began at St Eloi {{in the spring}} of 1915. Much of the mining in this sector was done by the 177th Tunnelling Company and the 172nd Tunnelling Company. The Ypres area has a shallow soil layer of loam or sand above waterlogged <b>semi-liquid</b> sand and patches of sand and clay called slurry. Beneath the second layer is a thick seam of blue clay. The early mining took place above the blue clay which put very heavy pressures of water and wet sand on the underground works. In August the digging of galleries had begun to be ready by the end of June 1916. Both sides spent 1915 mining and counter-mining, the British springing [...] and [...] against [...] mines and [...] In September, Brigadier-General George Fowke the Engineer in Chief, proposed a mining offensive in the blue clay [...] underground. Since the Germans were on the higher ground, galleries could be driven horizontally into the blue clay from shafts about [...] back from the front line. By January 1916, the 172nd Tunnelling Company had sunk shafts into the blue clay and began to dig galleries [...] under the German front position. After the Second Army offensive in the summer of 1916 was postponed the mining offensive was made even more ambitious, with a plan to mine Messines Ridge.|$|E

[...] "And Soup Face," [...] continued The Sky Pilot. A battered wreck half rose and extended a pudgy hand.

Placing the component parts in a tin pan, I kneaded them together for an hour, entirely reckless as to pulmonary considerations, touching the ruinous expenditure of breath; and having decanted the <b>semi-liquid</b> dough into a canvas-bag, secured the muzzle, tied on the tally, and delivered it to Rose-water, who dropped the precious bag into the coppers, along with a score or two of others.|$|E
60|$|Again he paused, {{as though}} he had done for good. He passed his tongue over his lips, gave a {{backward}} glance at the Serang conning the ship with quiet whispers and slight signs of the hand. The wash of the propeller sent a swift ripple, crested with dark froth, upon a long flat spit of black slime. The Sofala had entered the river; the trail she had stirred up over the bar was a mile astern of her now, out of sight, had disappeared utterly; and the smooth, empty sea along the coast was left behind in the glittering desolation of sunshine. On each side of her, low down, the growth of somber twisted mangroves covered the <b>semi-liquid</b> banks; and Massy continued in his old tone, with an abrupt start, as if his speech had been ground out of him, like the tune of a music-box, by turning a handle.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the process}} of construction, the central wire of the copper core was first covered with a <b>semi-liquid</b> coating of gutta-percha, mixed with tar--known as [...] "Chatterton's Compound." [...] This was laid on so thick that when the other wires were wound round it all air was excluded. Then a coating of the same {{compound}} was laid over the finished conductor, and thus the core was solidified. Next, the core was surrounded with a coating of the purest gutta-percha--a splendid non-conductor, impervious to water--which, when pressed to it, while in a plastic state, formed the first insulator or tube to the core. Over this tube was laid a thin coat of Chatterton's Compound {{for the purpose of}} closing up any small flaws or minute holes that might have escaped detection. Then came a second coating of gutta-percha, followed by another coating of compound, and so on alternately until four coats of compound and four of gutta-percha had been laid on.|$|E
60|$|Almost involuntarily he {{cast his}} eyes behind him, and saw neither sheego nor serpent. He breathed more freely, and essayed to extricate {{himself from his}} {{unpleasant}} position.

The sudden fear that this produced caused him to make a violent struggle, and in his next effort he succeeded in catching a twig; it supported him, for a moment, then broke, and he fell back again into the mud. Each successive struggle only sank him deeper. As the thick adhesive <b>semi-liquid</b> clung to his lower limbs and rose slowly on his chest, the wretched man uttered a loud cry of despair. He felt that he was brought suddenly face to face with death in its most awful form. The mud was soon up to his arm-pits. As the hopelessness of his condition forced itself upon him, he began to shout for help until the dark woods resounded with his cries; but no help came, and the cold drops of sweat stood upon his brow as he shrieked aloud in agony, and prayed for mercy.|$|E
60|$|Tara of Helium {{removed the}} scarf from {{about her and}} handed it to the slave. Slowly she descended the steps to the water, the {{temperature}} of which she tested with a symmetrical foot, undeformed by tight shoes and high heels--a lovely foot, as God intended that feet should be and seldom are. Finding the water to her liking, the girl swam leisurely to and fro about the pool. With the silken ease of the seal she swam, now at the surface, now below, her smooth muscles rolling softly beneath her clear skin--a wordless song of health and happiness and grace. Presently she emerged and gave herself {{into the hands of the}} slave girl, who rubbed the body of her mistress with a sweet smelling <b>semi-liquid</b> substance contained in a golden urn, until the glowing skin was covered with a foamy lather, then a quick plunge into the pool, a drying with soft towels, and the bath was over. Typical of the life of the princess was the simple elegance of her bath--no retinue of useless slaves, no pomp, no idle waste of precious moments. In another half hour her hair was dried and built into the strange, but becoming, coiffure of her station; her leathern trappings, encrusted with gold and jewels, had been adjusted to her figure and she was ready to mingle with the guests that had been bidden to the midday function at the palace of The Warlord.|$|E
60|$|In {{building}} their webs, {{as in many}} other small points, Lucy and Eliza showed from the first no inconsiderable personal differences. Lucy began hers by spinning a long line from her spinnerets, and letting the wind carry it wherever it would; while Eliza, more architectural in character, preferred to take her lines personally from point to point, and see herself to their proper fastening. In either case, however, the first thing done was to stretch some eight or ten stout threads from place to place {{on the outside of the}} future web, to act as points d'appuy for the remainder of the structure. To these outer threads, which the spiders strengthened so as to bear a considerable strain by doubling and trebling them, other thinner single threads were then carried radially at irregular distances, like the spokes of a wheel, from a point in the centre, where they were all made fast and connected together. As soon as this radiating framework or scaffolding was finished, like the woof on a loom, the industrious craftswoman started at the middle, and began the task of putting in the cross-pieces or weft which were to complete and bind together the circular pattern. These she wove round and round in a continuous spiral, setting out at the centre, and keeping on in ever-widening circlets, till she arrived at last at the exterior or foundation threads. How she fastened these cross-pieces to the ray-lines I could never quite make out, though I often followed the work closely from inside through the pane of glass with a platyscopic lens; for, strange to say, the spiders were not in the least disturbed by being watched at their work, and never took the slightest notice of anything that went on at the other side of the window. My impression is, however, that she gummed them together, letting them harden into one as they dried; for the thread itself is always <b>semi-liquid</b> when first exuded.|$|E
60|$|It {{was while}} {{the people of}} the town were {{pursuing}} their enemies that another shock of the earthquake occurred, and it was so violent that many of the pursuers paused, while others turned at once and ran back to the town. Here they found the women and children in a state of consternation, for they had more thoroughly realised the force of the shock; and the dreadful scenes that had taken place in Caraccas, when upwards of ten thousand of the inhabitants perished, were still fresh in their memory. Another shock occurred just as Don Pedro, Will Osten, and his friends galloped into the principal square of the town. Here there were hundreds of cattle which had been driven there for safety, and crowds of people hurrying to and fro. The horsemen rode towards the principal church of the town, which had been made a place of temporary retreat for the women and children. They had got within a few hundred yards of it when there came a shock so terrible that {{it seemed as if the}} binding forces of nature were being dissolved. Hollow thunderings were heard deep in the bowels of the earth, which heaved and undulated almost as if it had been in a <b>semi-liquid</b> state, while great rents and fissures occurred here and there. Will Osten's horse stumbled into one of these and threw him, but he leaped up unhurt. Don Pedro and the others pulled up and dismounted hastily. Before they could make up their minds which way to turn or what to do, another shock occurred; the houses on either side of them began to sway to and fro, and one not far distant fell. Just then a terrible crash was heard, and Will Osten turned round in time to see the large church in the act of falling. Women and children were rushing out of it frantically, but those within were doomed. One wild and awful shriek mingled with the roar of the tumbling edifice, and five hundred souls were instantaneously buried in a common grave.|$|E
