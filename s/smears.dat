The <b>smear</b> is prepared on separate areas of a single slide with three distinct samples, each from ectocervix, vagina and endocervix. Each sample occupies one-third of the glass slide.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study examined, {{with the}} use of {{transmission}} electron microscopy (TEM), the aggressiveness of three self-etching adhesive systems in penetrating dentin <b>smear</b> layers of different thickness. METHODS: Dentin disks were produced from extracted human third molars. For the control group, the middle dentin surface was cryofractured to create a bonding surface that was devoid of a <b>smear</b> layer. The experimental teeth were polished with wet 600 or 60 -grit SiC paper to produce bonding surfaces with thin and thick <b>smear</b> layers. They were bonded using one of the three self-etching systems: Clearfil Mega Bond (Kuraray), Non-Rinse Conditioner and Prime&Bond NT (Dentsply DeTrey) and Prompt L-Pop (ESPE). Bonded specimens were then demineralized and embedded in epoxy resin for TEM examination. RESULTS: For Mega Bond, thin authentic hybrid layers between 0. 4 - 0. 5 microm were found. <b>Smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs were retained as part of the hybridized complex. For Non-Rinse Conditioner/Prime&Bond NT, the authentic hybrid layers were between 1. 2 - 2. 2 microm thick. <b>Smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs were completely dissolved in dentin with thin <b>smear</b> layers, but were partially retained as part of the hybridized complex in those with thick <b>smear</b> layers. For Prompt L-Pop, authentic hybrid layers were 2. 5 - 5 microm thick and <b>smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs were completely dissolved even in dentin with thick <b>smear</b> layers. SIGNIFICANCE: Contemporary self-etching systems may be classified as mild, moderate and aggressive based on their ability to penetrate dentin <b>smear</b> layers and their depth of demineralization into the subsurface dentin. The more aggressive system completely solubilized the <b>smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs and formed hybrid layers with a thickness approaching those of phosphoric acid conditioned dentin...|$|R

40|$|Background: Abnormal Pap <b>smear</b> {{consists}} of premalignant or malignant cervical lesions. Many of premalignant cervical lesions will never progress to invasive malignancy, or even may regress over the time. Thus, {{there is always}} a risk of overtreatment of patients with an abnormal Pap <b>smear.</b> A long-term follow-up of these patients can reveal final events associated with each subtype of abnormal Pap <b>smear,</b> and, therefore, help us to prevent unnecessary interventions. The aim of our study was to present 2 years follow-up of referral patients with abnormal Pap <b>smear.</b> Materials and Methods: A total of 334 consecutive women aged more than 16 who were referred with an abnormal Pap <b>smear</b> were entered into the study. Patients were followed with biannual Pap <b>smear</b> and annual colposcopy and biopsy for 2 years. Results: At baseline, the majority of patients with abnormal Pap <b>smear</b> were normal on colposcopy and biopsy (68 % and 86 %, respectively). Six months after first abnormal Pap <b>smear</b> majority of patients in each group showed a significant regress to normal or less invasive lesion (P < 0. 001). Twelve patients (4 %) had no change in Pap <b>smear,</b> whereas 313 (94 %) had at least one stage improvement. Only nine (3 %) patients had deteriorated Pap <b>smear</b> after 6 months. All 308 patients who underwent colposcopy and biopsy had normal Pap <b>smear</b> 24 months after the first abnormal Pap <b>smear.</b> Conclusion: Pap <b>smear</b> is associated with a high rate of false-positive results. In addition, the majority of low-grade cervical lesions can spontaneously regress. A long-term follow-up of a patient with abnormal Pap <b>smear</b> can help us to avoid needless interventions...|$|R

Further in Bhagavata Purana, Rati {{undergoes}} severe penance and pleads with Parvati to intercede with Shiva to restore her husband. Parvati reassures her that Kama would be reborn as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna, the Avatar of the god Vishnu on earth, and Rati should wait {{for him in the}} demon (asura) Sambara's house. In other versions of the narrative like the Matsya Purana, the Padma Purana, the Shiva Purana, the Linga Purana and the Kathasaritsagara, it is Shiva who blesses Rati with the boon of Kama's resurrection. In other variants, she curses the gods who sent Kama for this doomed mission and the gods, as a group or Brahma, seeks relief for the grieving Rati from Shiva or the Supreme Goddess, Parvati being one of her many manifestations. In some legends, like the one in the Brahmanda Purana, the Goddess revives Kama immediately, hearing the pleading of the wailing Rati and the gods. The renowned Sanskrit poet Kalidasa dedicates canto IV discussing the plight of Rati in his Kumarasambhava, which focuses on the story of the wedding of Shiva and Parvati and the birth of their son Skanda, who kills Tarakasura. Canto IV narrates that Rati witnesses the death of her husband and laments his death, and then tries to immolate herself on a funeral pyre. A heavenly voice stops her on time, stating that after the marriage of Shiva, he will revive her husband.|$|E

While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix.

On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and <b>smears</b> it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women.
