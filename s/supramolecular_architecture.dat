5000|$|The key {{component}} that enables in situ control of <b>supramolecular</b> <b>architecture</b> via the WLA {{is the use}} of hemilabile ligands. Hemilabile ligands are polydentate chelates that contain at least two different types of bonding groups, denoted X and Y (Figure 3). The first group (X) bonds strongly to the metal center, while the other group (Y) is weakly bonding and easily displaced by coordinating ligands or solvent molecules (Z). In this way, the substitutionally labile group (Y) can be displaced from, yet remain available for recoordination to, the metal center. For WLA-generated structures, a typical ligand design consists of a phosphine-based strong binding group and a weak-binding group containing O, S, Se, or N.|$|E

S-layers in archaea with glycoprotein lattices as exclusive wall component are composed either of mushroom-like subunits with pillar-like, hydrophobic trans-membrane domains (a), or lipid-modified glycoprotein subunits (b). Individual S-layers can be composed of glycoproteins possessing both types of membrane anchoring mechanisms. Few archaea possess a rigid wall layer (e.g. pseudomurein in methanogenic organisms) as intermediate layer between the plasma membrane and the S-layer (c). In Gram-positive bacteria (d) the S-layer (glyco)proteins are bound to the rigid peptidoglycan-containing layer via secondary cell wall polymers. In Gram-negative bacteria (e) the S-layer is {{closely associated with the}} lipopolysaccharide of the outer membrane.

He is known to have pioneered the study of molecular self-assembly in India and is credited with {{the creation of a new}} category of self-assembled materials that are functionally soft. His work assisted in the design of larger molecular structures using self-assembling molecules and demonstrated ways to control their electricity conductivity through controlling external factors like temperature which have reported use in applications involving light harvesting, sensing, imaging and security. He was the first scientist to design functional Phenylenevinylene-based Organogels from designed building blocks, which has been detailed in his article, First Phenylenevinylene Based Organogels:  Self-Assembled Nanostructures via Cooperative Hydrogen Bonding and π-Stacking, published in 2001. One of the commercial applications of his researches is secret writing, thermally writable, non-copyable, and erasable fluorescent images useful for secret documentation by using a fluorescent gelator entrapped in a polystyrene film and the process has been developed by his team. His studies have been documented in several peer-reviewed articles; ResearchGate and Google Scholar, online repositories of scientific articles, have listed 202 and 162 of them respectively. He also holds patents for a number of processes he has developed.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{characterisation}} of supramolecular structures containing p-sulfonatocalix[n]arenes (where n= 4, 5, 6, 8) with suitable guest molecules and lanthanide metal cations. The characterisation is based primarily on X-ray diffraction but high-resolution NMR techniques have also been used to identify p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene/crown ether complexation in the solution phase. Notably, remarkable control can be achieved over the formation and geometries of nano-metre scale spheroids or tubules containing p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene via guest selection. Chapter 1 gives a short overview of supramolecular chemistry, molecular recognition and the history and synthesis of calixarenes. The supramolecular chemistry of the p-sulfonatocalx[n]tilarenes and a selection of interesting and recently reported nano-metre scale multi-component <b>supramolecular</b> <b>architectures</b> are also reviewed. Chapter 2 describes the pH dependent formation {{of a number of}} molecular capsule and bi-layer <b>supramolecular</b> <b>architectures</b> based on p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene, (di) aza-functionalised guest species and lanthanide metals. Chapter 3 describes the formation of several bi-layer structures based on p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene and lanthanide, metals. Incorporation of different lanthanide metal salts changed the resulting structures by either inclusion or exclusion of the anions in the <b>supramolecular</b> <b>architectures.</b> Chapter 4 describes a series of Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy experiments that were performed in collaboration with Dr. Julie Fisher at the University of Leeds. The experiments were based on calixarene/crown ether systems and the results showed 1 : 1 host-guest complexation in solution with a series of charged species. Chapter 5 describes the formation of Russian doll complexes and the design and control over nanometre scale spheroidal arrays composed of p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene. Chapters 6 and 7 describe the formation of novel supramolecular complexes that are based on the p-sulfonatocalix[5, 6, 8]arenes. The resulting <b>supramolecular</b> <b>architectures</b> include unprecedented bis-molecular capsules, coordination polymer chains and 3 -D networks. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of new π-donor molecules, {{extended}} tetrathiafulvalenes have been widely studies for their use as components of electronically conductive charge-transfer materials. In contrast with the planar π -systems, we have focused our attention on extended tetrathiafulvalenes containing a conjugated anthracenyl spacer (anthracenediylidene derivatives). These TTF derivatives adopt a saddle-shaped conformation in the neutral state and a drastic change of conformation occurs upon oxidation to the dication species. Our main objective {{was to investigate the}} molecular and <b>supramolecular</b> <b>architecture</b> of these compounds. At the molecular scale, we synthesised cyclophanes by bridging the preformed anthracene tetrathiafulvalene system and studied their redox properties and crystal packing.
