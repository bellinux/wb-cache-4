25|$|Japanese-spec {{vehicles}} with the twin turbo {{had a choice}} of manual or <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> called SportShift, that allowed the driver to push the automatic gearshift selector to the left, and then allow the driver to shift the automatic like a manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|The CB400A has a {{two-speed}} <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> It has a {{torque converter}} and two forward gears (high and low) {{that have to}} be manually selected by the rider. There is a gear position indicator in lieu of a tachometer in the instrument binnacle. A parking brake replaced the clutch lever. This model has 28mm Keihin carburettors which lower the peak power in exchange for low-down response.|$|E
25|$|The only actual turbine powered Batmobile in {{existence}} is {{a replica of}} the 1989 film car. It is powered by a military Boeing turboshaft engine driving the rear wheels through a 4 speed <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> and is street registered. This car was designed and constructed by Casey Putsch of Putsch Racing in 2011. Putsch Racing also created a V8 powered replica complete with retractable firing machine guns, automated canopy, internet, GPS, police/military scanner, etc.. That car was also street registered in the United States.|$|E
50|$|In the UK though, <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{have been}} very popular on buses for some time, from the 1950s right through to the 1980s, an example being the well known London AEC Routemaster, {{although}} the latter could also be driven as a full automatic in the three highest gears. Most heavy-duty bus manufacturers offered this option, using a gearbox from Self-Changing Gears Ltd of Coventry, and on urban single- and double-deck buses it was the norm by the 1970s. This coincided {{with the development of}} city buses with engines and transmissions at the rear rather than the front, which was beyond the capability of a manual gearchange/clutch linkage from the driver's position. Leyland manufactured many buses with <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> including its Leopard and Tiger coaches. Fully automatic transmission became popular with increasing numbers of continental buses being bought in the UK, and more and more British manufacturers began offering automatic options, mostly using imported gearboxes (such as those made by Voith and ZF), and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> lost favour. These days, very few buses with <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> remain in service, although many are still on the roads with private owners. Modern types of manumatic transmissions though are becoming more common, mostly replacing manual gearboxes in coaches.|$|R
50|$|Fluid {{couplings}} {{were used}} {{in a variety of}} early <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> and automatic transmissions. Since the late 1940s, the hydrodynamic torque converter has replaced the fluid coupling in automotive applications.|$|R
5000|$|Common North American setups include 9, 10, 13, 15, and 18 speeds. Automatic and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{for heavy}} trucks are {{becoming}} more and more common, due to advances both in transmission and engine power. In Europe, 8, 10, 12 and 16 gears are common on larger trucks with manual transmission, while automatic or <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> would have anything from 5 to 12 gears. Almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the [...] "range and split" [...] (double H shift pattern) type, where range change and so‑called half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection.|$|R
25|$|The race {{started with}} a bang, as Senna's hopes at a home Grand Prix victory were dashed after a clash with Berger in the first turn. In what {{would prove to be}} a regular {{occurrence}} during the season, the <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> in the Ferrari 640 allowed Berger to get a lightning start from 3rd on the grid and he attempted to go inside of Senna and Patrese into the turn. Patrese got through unscathed and in the lead of his record breaking 177th Grand Prix start whilst Berger was out on the spot (the first of 10 straight retirements for the Austrian driver) while Senna was forced to pit for repairs and would finish the race 2 laps down in 11th place.|$|E
500|$|The DB9 Morning Frost's paint finish is a {{pearlescent}} white. However, on the inside, the Morning Frost is {{fitted with}} metallic bronze leather {{and a black}} center console and interior door handles. On the outside, the Morning Frost has silver [...] 10-spoke wheels, silver brake calipers, and silver grilles. Like the Carbon Black, the DB9 Morning Frost has a six-speed <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
500|$|The DB9 Quantum Silver uses {{a silver}} paint scheme also {{found on the}} Aston Martin DBS in Quantum of Solace, hence its name. Inside, the Quantum Silver shares the black center console and leather. On the outside, it also has black grills and [...] wheels. The Quantum Silver has the same <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> as its counterparts, and shares a {{modified}} sports exhaust with the Carbon Black.|$|E
50|$|The Indonesian-spec Ignis was {{launched}} by Suzuki IndoMobil Motor on 17 April 2017. It {{is available in}} two trim levels: GL and GX, with manual, and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> which Suzuki called as Auto Gear Shift transmission.|$|R
50|$|Historically, underbones {{led the way}} in <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> and {{indicator}} systems. In other respects, {{the technical}} sophistication of underbones has tended to lag those of larger motorcycles, but they increasingly have similar electronic ignition, fuel injection etc.|$|R
50|$|Fluid {{couplings}} {{are found}} in some Diesel locomotives {{as part of the}} power transmission system. Self-Changing Gears made <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> for British Rail, and Voith manufacture turbo-transmissions for railcars and diesel multiple units which contain various combinations of fluid couplings and torque converters.|$|R
500|$|SYM Motors of Taiwan {{licensed}} the Super Cub {{design as}} the Symba 100, previously called the Symba 110, which they exported to the US. While keeping the basic design, SYM increased {{the size of}} the front brake from , and added an LED fuel gauge. Instead of leading link front forks, it uses telescopic forks. The Symba engine has a carbureted [...] single claimed to produce [...] at 8500rpm, with a four speed gearbox using a centrifugal clutch <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{sequential}} shifting three speed gearbox was manually shifted, but clutchless, {{without the}} need for a clutch lever control, using instead a centrifugal clutch along with a plate clutch slaved to the footchange lever to engage and disengage the gearbox from the engine. While not intuitive to learn, once the rider got used to it, the <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> [...] "took the terror out of motorcycling" [...] for novice riders. Unlike many scooter CVTs, the centrifugal clutch made it possible to push start the Super Cub, a useful advantage if the need arose.|$|E
500|$|The P4/5 has {{the same}} engine as the Enzo Ferrari it was built on, a 65° Ferrari F140 B V12. The 12cylinders have a total {{capacity}} of , each with 4valves. The redline rpm at 8200 and the torque of [...] at 5500rpm are both {{the same as the}} Enzo, but it produces marginally more power with [...] at 7800rpm. The P4/5 uses the 6speed <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> of the Enzo with black shifting paddles behind the wheel. It has two directional indicator buttons, one mounted {{on each side of the}} steering wheel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fluid drive}} fluid {{coupling}} {{was also used}} in conjunction with Chrysler’s M6 Presto-Matic <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The M6 was in reality a two-speed manual transmission with a conventional clutch mounted behind the same fluid coupling unit that was installed in straight Fluid Drive cars.|$|R
5000|$|Some manumatic and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{allow the}} driver to have full control of gear selection, though most will {{intervene}} to prevent engine stalling and redlining by shifting automatically {{at the low end}} and/or high end of the engine's normal operating range. Hydraulically-coupled Manumatics and most <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> also provide the option of operating {{in the same manner as}} a conventional automatic transmission, by allowing the transmission's computer to select gear changes. A few manumatics also allow an alternate automatic mode, often called [...] "sport" [...] mode, where gear selection is still fully automatic but the transmission will favor higher engine speeds (at which the engine will produce the highest horsepower and/or torque) by upshifting later when accelerating and downshifting earlier when slowing.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the wide}} variety of loads the semi may carry, they usually have a manual {{transmission}} to allow the driver to have as much control as possible. However, all truck manufacturers now offer <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> (manual gearboxes with automated gear change), as well as automatic transmissions.|$|R
500|$|Specific {{elements}} of the Super Cub's design were integral to the campaign, such as the enclosed chain that kept chain lubricant from being flung on the rider's clothing, and the leg shield that similarly blocked road debris and hid the engine, and the convenience of the <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Presenting the Super Cub as a consumer appliance [...] not requiring mechanical aptitude and an identity change into [...] "a motorcyclist", or worse, [...] "a biker", differentiated Honda's offering, because, [...] "the dedication required to maintain bikes of that era limited ownership to a relatively small demographic, often regarded as young men known for their black leather jackets and snarling demeanors." ...|$|E
500|$|The D 7 was the {{mass-production}} {{model and}} differed {{mainly from the}} D 6 by having different tracks and a Maybach NL 38 TRKM engine. The NL 38 TRK had proven to have too much compression for the 74 octane (OZ 74) gasoline decreed for use after 1 October 1938, {{and had to be}} modified with a new cylinder head and shorter pistons, but this did not change the engine's power. Deliveries began in October 1938 with one of the first machines off the production line demonstrated for the army on 11 October 1938. Early machines had two fuel tanks: one of [...] and the other of , but they were replaced by a single [...] at the end of 1939. Also the NL 38 TRKM engine was replaced in late 1939 by the HL 42 TRKM, for which the stroke had been increased to 110mm, thereby increasing the displacement form [...] to [...] and the power from [...] to [...] From the beginning of 1940, stronger road wheels came into use, and during 1940 the hull rear was reinforced to allow the vehicle to tow heavier loads like the 7.5 cm PaK 40 anti-tank gun, 15 cm sIG 33 infantry gun and the 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer. An air compressor was added later for loads equipped with air brakes. These were designated as Model (Ausführung - Ausf.) B. In 1943 the <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> was replaced by a manual transmission.|$|E
2500|$|The Enzo has a <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> (also {{known as}} the F1 gearbox) using paddles to control an {{automated}} shifting and clutch mechanism, with LED lights {{on the steering wheel}} telling the driver when to change gears. [...] The gearbox has a shift time of just 150milliseconds. [...] The transmission was a first generation [...] "clutchless" [...] design from the late 1990s, and there have been complaints about its abrupt shifting.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, {{automakers}} {{began to}} market cars {{with some sort}} of device that would reduce the amount of clutching and de-clutching and shifting required in stop and go driving. Most typically, a fluid coupling or a centrifugal clutch replaced the standard manual clutch to allow for stop and go driving without using the clutch pedal every time the car was brought to a stop. More sophisticated systems allowed for shifting while driving without using the clutch, and some systems did away with the clutch pedal altogether. <b>Semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> were phased out as technology advanced and automatic controls were developed to take care of changing gear ratios. Smaller, lower powered cars used <b>Semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> with a dry clutch because the mechanical connection offered a more efficient powertrain compared to a fluid coupling.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there were}} some AMG models in the 1980s with manual transmissions, almost all recent models have used {{automatics}} (5G-Tronic and later 7G-Tronic with Speedshift), in contrast to BMW M, which used manuals and recently <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> (the current type being a dual clutch transmission). Starting in 2009, however, AMG began adopting the seven-speed AMG SpeedShift MCT automatic transmission.|$|R
5000|$|Major {{technological}} innovations were introduced or were widely adopted during the 1930s, such as synchromesh manual <b>transmissions,</b> <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> automatic transmissions, hydraulic brakes, independent front suspension, and overhead-valve engines. The Cord 810 used front-wheel drive, had hidden headlights, and was offered with a supercharger. Exterior styling designs were more flowing, as shown most noticeably on the Auburn Speedster and the Cord 810/812. Radical air-streamed design was introduced on the Chrysler Airflow, a sales flop, and the Lincoln-Zephyr (both of which used unit-body construction). Packard introduced their [...] "Air Cool-ditioned" [...] car in 1940.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the weight saving measures, the Scuderia <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> gained improved [...] "Superfast", known as [...] "Superfast2", software for faster 60millisecond shift-times. A new traction control system combined the F1-Trac traction and stability control with the E-Diff electronic differential. The Ferrari 430 Scuderia accelerates from 0- in 3.6seconds, with {{a top speed of}} [...] [...] Ferrari claims that around their test track, Fiorano Circuit, it matches the Ferrari Enzo, and the Ferrari F430's successor, the Ferrari 458.|$|E
2500|$|The Belvedere {{remained}} {{a part of}} the Cranbrook series through the 1953 model year, which saw all Plymouth models completely restyled. Major style changes include a shorter [...] wheelbase, a one-piece windshield, flush rear fenders, and a lower hood line. In April 1953, Plymouths received the Hy-Drive <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> The engine was carried over from 1952 with the only enhancement being a slight increase in the compression ratio to 7.10:1, which yielded a rating of [...]|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, Oldsmobile was {{a pioneer}} in {{introducing}} a four-speed <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> called the [...] "Automatic Safety Transmission", although this accessory was actually built by Buick, which would offer it in its own cars in 1938. This transmission features a conventional clutch pedal, which the driver presses before selecting either [...] "low" [...] or [...] "high" [...] range. In [...] "low," [...] the car shifts between first and second gears. In [...] "high," [...] the car shifts among first, third and fourth gears.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> has evolved as vehicle manufacturers experimented with different systems. In one early mass-production example, Ferrari offered their Mondial {{model with a}} clutchless manual, which Ferrari called the Valeo transmission. In this system, the gear stick of a traditional manual transmission was retained; moving the shifter automatically engaged the electro-hydraulic clutch. Saab's Sensonic transmission worked in a similar fashion.|$|R
50|$|These {{control the}} {{transmission}} system, mainly the shifting of the gears for better shift comfort and to lower torque interrupt while shifting. Automatic transmissions use controls for their operation, and also many <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> having a fully automatic clutch or a semi-auto clutch (declutching only). The {{engine control unit}} and the transmission control exchange messages, sensor signals and control signals for their operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{proved to}} be so trouble-prone that Ford recalled virtually every unit, {{and replaced them with}} standard manual transmissions. The only known unit to exist is in the possession of the Early Ford V8 Foundation Museum in Auburn, Indiana. While Ford gave up on <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> after Liquimatic, Lincoln started using General Motors' Hydra-Matic in 1949, while Mercury got its own automatic, Merc-O-Matic, in 1951.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Sportshift" [...] <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> {{benefited from}} a {{software}} update, while a lightened flywheel was introduced for both the manual and the Sportshift. Aston Martin also stiffened the suspension and now uses Bilstein dampers. An optional sports pack is being offered with stiffer springs, tighter handling, and all-new 5-spoke alloy wheels. Sportshift-equipped models also receive a new dual throttle mapping update which allows the driver to choose from the default sport mode, or comfort mode, which gives more comfortable shifts and throttle input for drivability.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time since the 2005 Formula One season Williams {{maintained}} continuity with their engine supplier. The FW30 is powered by Toyota's RVX-08 engine, which conforms to FIA [...] V8 regulations. One major change within the engine package is due to the enforcement of a standardised, FIA-approved ECU, manufactured by McLaren Electronic Systems and distributed under the Microsoft brand. This was introduced to eliminate traction control and engine-assisted braking. Drive is via Williams's own seven-speed, <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> with an electro-hydraulically activated, seamless shift mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for the [...] season, Mansell became the last Ferrari driver to be personally selected by Enzo Ferrari {{before his death in}} August 1988, an honour Mansell described as [...] "one of the greatest in my entire career". Enzo Ferrari presented a 1989 Ferrari F40 as a gift to Mansell. In Italy he became known as [...] "il leone" [...] ("the lion") by the tifosi [...] because of his fearless driving style. The season was one of change in the sport, with the banning of turbo engines by the FIA and the introduction of the electronically controlled <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> by Ferrari.|$|E
50|$|BMW M {{vehicles}} {{typically used}} manuals and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> (the most recent type being a dual clutch transmission), {{in contrast to}} Mercedes-AMG which largely has automatic transmissions (the 7-speed AMG SpeedShift MCT dual clutch transmission was used on new models from 2009 onward). However, the BMW X5 M and X6 M were the first M-vehicles offered with automatic transmission, a 6-speed Steptronic unit, since this works with xDrive.|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} {{manual transmission}} is often considered standard equipment, while automated transmissions (automatic transmission including manumatics, continuous variable <b>transmissions</b> (CVTs), and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> including Dual clutch transmissions) are usually treated as options. The base engine in, say a midsize car or crossover SUV from a mainstream manufacturer, {{is usually a}} four-cylinder (inline-4) while the upgrade is a V6. Often, certain features and packages are only available {{in combination with the}} more powerful engines in a vehicle lineup.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally sports sedans have {{a manual}} {{transmission}} and tachometer {{in order to}} provide that [...] "sports look and feel" [...] and are rear wheel drive, have good handling characteristics, and adequate power. Because of the US move to automatic transmission and front wheel drive these types are now also {{to be found in the}} sport sedan category. Recent sport sedans such as the latest iterations of the BMW M5 and BMW M3 had implemented <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>transmissions.</b>|$|R
