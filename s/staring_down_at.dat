5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E
500|$|Batman conveys {{trademarks}} {{found in}} 1930s pulp magazines, notably {{the design of}} Gotham City stylized with Art Deco design. Richard Corliss, writing for Time, observed that Gotham's design was a reference to films such as Metropolis (1927) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). [...] "Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio backlot", he continued, [...] "is literally another character in the script. It has the demeaning presence of German Expressionism and fascist architecture, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the citizens." [...] Hanke further addressed the notions of Batman being a period piece, in that [...] "The citizens, cops, people and the black-and-white television looks like it takes place in 1939"; but later said: [...] "Had the filmmakers made Vicki Vale a femme fatale rather than a damsel in distress, this could have made Batman as a homage and tribute to classic film noir." [...] Portions of the climax pay homage to Vertigo.|$|E
500|$|It {{was decided}} that the sword needed to be {{different}} from other bat'leths seen on the show, and so a new hardened aluminium prop was ordered after numerous designs by John Eaves were considered on paper. As with the original bat'leth, Dan Curry created the prop. Sculptor Dragon Dronet then etched designs into the blade by hand using dental tools. The producers requested designs on the blade similar to the effects seen in Damascus steel, which was combined with Dronet's idea of forming these into a topographic map, with an effect described as being [...] "as if you're <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> mountains". Klingon names were then added {{to the side of the}} weapon. Dronet also created the stand for the sword out of plexiglas which was spray-painted to look metallic. The legs of the stand were carved to look like the feet of the Klingon animal, the targ. [...] "The Sword of Kahless" [...] also featured new prop designs for Starfleet-issued over-the-shoulder bags and the camping equipment used in the cave sequences.|$|E
60|$|Clad in sea-boots, {{oilskins}} and sou'wester, I had {{for some}} time been hanging upon the rail at the break of the poop, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> fascinated <b>at</b> the poor devils of sailors, repeatedly up to their necks in water, or submerged, or dashed like straws about the deck, while they pulled and hauled, stupidly, blindly, and in evident fear, under the orders of Mr. Pike.|$|R

60|$|After he {{had left}} the Squire's office, Hiram stood for a while in the street, bareheaded, his hat in his hand, <b>staring</b> unwinkingly <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the ground at his feet, with stupidly {{drooping}} lips and lackluster eyes. Presently he raised his hand and began slowly smoothing down the sandy shock of hair upon his forehead. At last he aroused himself with a shake, looked dully up and down the street, and then, putting on his hat, turned and walked slowly and heavily away.|$|R
2500|$|In the offseason, the Celtics' Big 3 {{was broken}} up {{following}} Ray Allen's joining of the Heat. When {{asked about their}} immediate reactions to their teammate leaving for their rival, Kevin Garnett claimed that he deleted Allen's phone number, while Paul Pierce admitted that it [...] "hurt", though he still considers Allen [...] "a brother to me" [...] for their 2008 championship run. Although the two teams would not meet in the playoffs, the animosity continued in their four regular season games. The season opener – a Heat victory – included Rondo clothes-lining Wade's neck, Garnett snubbing a handshake from Allen pre-game, and Garnett throwing an elbow at Mario Chalmers. During Miami's 2013 Streak, Paul Pierce went on record {{to say that he}} wished for Miami to lose all of its remaining games by that point. When James voiced his displeasure over the Chicago Bulls' physicality against him, Boston's general manager Danny Ainge called it [...] "embarrassing" [...] for LeBron to complain about it. Pat Riley, the Heat team president, retorted that [...] "Danny should shut the fuck up." [...] The teams met during the Streak, where it was five years to the day that the Celtics' stopped the Houston Rockets' own 20+-game winning streak. It ended in a Heat victory, one that featured James dunking on Jason Terry; he received a technical foul for <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Terry post-dunk. When asked about it after the game by reporters, James stated that he was [...] "glad it happened to him." ...|$|E

60|$|Westover {{looked up}} toward the Durgin house with a return of {{interest}} in the canvas he had left in the lane on the easel. Nothing had happened to it. At the door of the barn he saw the farmer and his eldest son slanting forward and <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> the hill <b>at</b> the point he had come from. Mrs. Durgin was looking out from the shelter of the porch, and she turned and went in with Jeff's dog at her skirts when Westover came in sight with the children.|$|R

The next night, Lily runs into their peach orchard and digs up a box {{containing}} several of her mother's possessions. Lily lies <b>down,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the stars and talking to her mother's spirit, but she hears her father calling. He accosts her, and takes her home and punishes her.|$|R
25|$|It started {{well for}} Australia, too. Including Michael Kasprowicz in the squad and {{gambling}} on winning the toss and subbing {{one of their}} bowlers off, they won it – and Kasprowicz got immediate reward. After the English openers had survived the opening overs of McGrath and Lee to be 25 for 0 after eight overs, Kasprowicz was brought on, and Strauss chopped an inside edge onto his own stumps. Nine balls and three runs later, captain Michael Vaughan was hit on the pads by an inswinging delivery from Glenn McGrath and was out for 1. Marcus Trescothick and Kevin Pietersen soon followed to the pavilion, and England were – yet again – <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> the barrel <b>at</b> 45 for 4.|$|R

Lingard, {{returning}} his stare steadily, dived slowly into various pockets, fished out at last a box of matches and proceeded to light his cheroot carefully, rolling it round and round between his lips, without taking his gaze for a moment off the distressed Almayer.

50|$|In “Our Last Best Chance”, King Abdullah writes {{as both a}} monarch bestowing wisdom {{from above}} and as a man whose life has been {{intertwined}} with war and {{making the case for}} peace.The memoir opens during the 1967 war, when the King, then a toddler, is dared by his brother to race across the lawn {{in the middle of an}} Israeli air raid. An explosion reverberates in the distance and the then-crown prince runs back into the house without having reached the other side. The incident serves as a potent symbol: Unsolved, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict looms over the region, threatening to disrupt daily life at a moment’s notice.The King goes on to detail his formative years, from <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> anti-Arab stereotypes <b>at</b> a US boarding school to his military career in Zarqa and proposing to Rania Yassin on Tal Rumman.|$|R
2500|$|The hosts Sri Lanka were {{yet again}} {{stunned by the}} West Indies' {{accurate}} and fierce pace bowling, as they chose to bowl first at Kandy. In the third over, they got immediate reward, having Sanath Jayasuriya caught behind off Daren Powell for 2 – however, TV replays indicated that the decision was unjustified. To the West Indians, that mattered little, as it gave them a much needed confidence boost. Ten overs later, Tino Best and Powell had dug out a further three wickets, and Sri Lanka were <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> the barrel <b>at</b> 42 for 4. Thilan Samaraweera and Tillakaratne Dilshan paired up for 56 for the fifth wicket before Best ran out Dilshan, but {{this time there was}} little wagging from the tail, only Muttiah Muralitharan making an unbeaten 18, as Powell took the last three wickets – both Rangana Herath and Lasith Malinga ending up caught behind – and Sri Lanka subsided for 150.|$|R
