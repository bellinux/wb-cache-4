5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking directly at the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to <b>solar</b> <b>UV,</b> and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWater {{pollution}} {{is an important}} problem in Mexico as it's in other countries around the world. The <b>UV</b> <b>Solar</b> Radiation can be useful for water detoxification, unfortunately now a days in Mexico doesn’t exist robust data bases about <b>UV</b> <b>Solar</b> Radiation and it's the first obstacle to develop projects like that. By other hand, the <b>UV</b> <b>Solar</b> Radiation is the responsible of several diseases like cataracts and melanoma and can detonate other illnesses. In Mexico, cataracts are considered a public health problem according with the health sector. In this work was developeda correlation between Global Radiation and <b>UV</b> <b>Solar</b> Radiation in Mexico City, {{taking advantage of the}} existing databases aboutGlobal Radiation. In order to find an appropriate model, it was necessary in first place to perform a statistical and seasonal analysis of Global and <b>UV</b> <b>Solar</b> Radiations, concluding that a linear model was the one approaching most between both variables. The results for Mexico City were that <b>UV</b> <b>Solar</b> Radiation is equal to 3. 57 % of horizontal Global Radiation. The next step was to study thecloudiness influence on the results obtained and for that reason, the clearness index was analyzed. Another result of this was that duringthesummer, when most of the days were partly cloudy, higher levels of <b>UV</b> <b>Solar</b> Radiation were reached. It was because the small water drops in the atmosphereactuatedas small lenses and this factor affects directly the <b>UV</b> <b>Solar</b> Radiation flow. For this reason this work aims to develop a <b>UV</b> <b>Solar</b> Radiation statistical model for mexican conditions and it will be validated using spectral models (SMART'S [1]) and ground measures that will be taken with carefully calibratedradiometers and UV spectrometers...|$|R

25|$|Then, data {{gathered}} by the orbital experiments ERA, BIOPAN, EXOSTACK and EXPOSE, determined that isolated spores, including those of B. subtilis, were killed by several orders of magnitude if exposed to the full space environment for a mere few seconds, but if shielded against <b>solar</b> <b>UV,</b> the spores were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years while embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). Though minimal protection is required to shelter a spore against UV radiation, exposure to <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> and cosmic ionizing radiation of unprotected DNA, break it up into its bases. Also, exposing DNA to the ultrahigh vacuum of space alone is sufficient to cause DNA damage, so the transport of unprotected DNA or RNA during interplanetary flights powered solely by light pressure is extremely unlikely. The feasibility of other means of transport for the more massive shielded spores into the outer Solar System – for example, through gravitational capture by comets – is at this time unknown.|$|E

25|$|The {{stratosphere}} is {{the middle}} layer of the Uranian atmosphere, in which temperature generally increases with altitude from 53K in the tropopause to between 800 and 850K at the base thermosphere. The heating of the stratosphere {{is caused by the}} downward heat conduction from the hot thermosphere as well as by absorption of <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> and IR radiation by methane and the complex hydrocarbons formed as a result of methane photolysis. The methane enters the stratosphere through the cold tropopause, where its mixing ratio relative to molecular hydrogen is about 3, three times below saturation. It decreases further to about 10−7 at the altitude corresponding to pressure of 0.1mbar.|$|E
25|$|Wallis and Wickramasinghe {{argued in}} 2004 that the {{transport}} of individual bacteria or clumps of bacteria, is overwhelmingly more important than lithopanspermia in terms of numbers of microbes transferred, even accounting for the death rate of unprotected bacteria in transit. Then {{it was found that}} isolated spores of B. subtilis were killed by several orders of magnitude if exposed to the full space environment for a mere few seconds. These results clearly negate the original panspermia hypothesis, which requires single spores as space travelers accelerated by the radiation pressure of the Sun, requiring many years to travel between the planets. However, if shielded against <b>solar</b> <b>UV,</b> spores of Bacillus subtilis were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). The data support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within meteorites, the so-called lithopanspermia hypothesis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{thermosphere}} {{and upper}} part of the stratosphere contain a large concentration of ions and electrons, forming the ionosphere of Uranus.

The electron density in the Uranian ionosphere is on average , reaching to as high as [...] in the narrow layers in the stratosphere. The ionosphere is mainly sustained by <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> radiation and its density depends on the solar activity. The auroral activity on Uranus is not as powerful as at Jupiter and Saturn and contributes little to the ionization.

Measured UV irradiances are employed to develop the values of the exponential decays, and the degradation coefficients for time dependence are found to vary with time at shorter wavelengths. Instrument sensitivity is described in terms of a functional relationship based on exponential decay with time with time-varying time dependence and on exponential decay with exposure with constant exposure dependence. The relationship provides a technique for treating data from the <b>solar</b> backscatter <b>UV</b> instrument both at short- and long-term intervals, and solar irradiance is calculated based on the approach...|$|R

Among all the samples, only lichens (Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans) fully survived the 2 weeks of exposure to outer space.
