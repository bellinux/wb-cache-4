This section also includes “change of occupancy ” within the <b>scoping</b> <b>statement</b> for the IGCC. In Section 202, Change of Occupancy is defined as “[a] change in the purpose or level of activity within a building that involves a change in application of the requirements of this code. ” The nebulous nature of this definition provides tremendous leeway for interpretive enforcement by adopting jurisdictions.

40|$|Aims of this study: • give {{theoretical}} and empirical limits to previous accounts of Reconstruction (in the gen-erative grammar framework); • show that Reconstruction is best analyzed within a dynamic framework where grammar and processing interact, i. e. {{in the spirit of}} Dynamic Syntax [CKM 05]. Main proposal: Reconstruction corresponds to a delay of interpretation. 1 Reconstruction: a Generative perspective Reconstruction 1 : interaction between (syntactic) displacement structures in language (inter-rogation, dislocation, relativization) and interpretation procedures such as the evaluation of referential expressions (proper names, pronouns and anaphors) or <b>scope</b> <b>statements.</b> In the generative framework, <b>scope</b> <b>statements</b> crucially rely on structural dominance (c-command) and referential expressions are evaluated through binding theory (c-command and co-indexation) 2. (1) [Which picture of himself 1] 2 did every student 1 give 2 to Mary? ⇒ The anaphor himself can be interpreted as a variable bound by every student, i. e. in the scope of this quantifier, and picture of himself has a distributive reading (a different picture for each student). However, there is no apparent c-command of the binder on the bindee. ∗I {{would like to thank the}} following persons for their help or comments: David Adger, Joseph Aoun, Hamida Demirdache for her constant help as a Phd supervisor, Danny Fox, Valérie Gautier, Mélanie Jouitteau for dis-cussing the data in Breton, Ruth Kempson, Eric Mathieu, Jairo Nunes, Gillian Ramchand and Alain Rouveret. 1 The word ”reconstruction ” comes from the first analysis of the phenomenon, based on a literal movement of the detached constituent. 2 -Condition on bound variable anaphora (BVA) : a pronoun or an anaphor α can be interpreted as a variable bound by a quantified argument β iff α is bound by β;-Condition A: an anaphor must be bound by an argument in its local domain;-Condition B: a pronoun must be free from any argument in its local domain;-Condition C: an R-expression must be free from any argument...|$|R

His political interest made him join the local classical liberal electoral association Burgerplicht, but it became apparent that its course could not be altered, and Willem Treub, along with others, established the radical electoral association Amsterdam. Treub was elected into the municipal council of Amsterdam in 1889, and became the city's alderman of finance in 1893. In this position, he introduced labour standards for municipal labourers, included clauses on minimum wages and maximum working hours in the <b>scope</b> <b>statements</b> of municipal projects, and instituted a municipal audit and construction supervision. As alderman for public works, an office he entered in 1895, Treub brought several private water supply and telephone companies under municipal ownership, and pushed for the nationalisation of tram and gas companies.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{collection}} assessment project is to develop and provide information {{about the nature and}} use of the DLESE collections to library builders and collection developers. This work is intended to {{serve as a model for}} collections evaluation and assessment for NSDL as a whole, and for other NSDL collections. Collections assessment is a systematic comparison of the actual collection with the desired or needed collection, as expressed through collection <b>scope</b> <b>statements,</b> collection development projects, user feedback, and user needs as expressed through searches in the collection. The goal is to provide information needed to support development of a highly relevant and useful digital library collection as a teaching and learning resource for a diverse user population. A collection geared to user’s needs is one of the many factors that contribute to a high quality, effective digital library, I devoted the first year and a half of the project to developing the prerequisites for a collection assessment for DLESE, a brand new digital library with just an early development test collection and a small group of early adopters as users and contributors.

The types of opportunities generated {{were based on the}} team’s familiarity with the possible solution and the team’s familiarity with the need the solution would address. To begin this opportunity identification process we created a <b>scope</b> <b>statement</b> that would guide our process. Based on the <b>scope</b> <b>statement</b> combined with the team’s previous knowledge and experiences we began to brainstorm possible opportunities. The opportunities brainstormed ranged from automotive tool improvements, travel accessories to innovative home products.

By the end of the process we had a pile of scribbled drawings and notes that represented a vast number of ideas.
