This study examined variation in sweating patterns in Puebla, Mexico, and Amherst, MA, and compared the levels of concordance between subjective and objective measures of hot flashes. DESIGN: Thirteen women in Puebla, Mexico, and 15 women in Amherst, MA, aged 45 to 61, completed <b>surveys,</b> body <b>diagrams</b> of heat flow during a hot flash, anthropometric measures, and the measurement of hot flashes through skin conductance monitoring. Hot flashes were measured through sternal (Mexico and Massachusetts) and nuchal (Mexico only) skin conductance. RESULTS: Mexican women {{were significantly more likely}} to describe the heat of hot flashes on the back of their neck (100 % vs 40 %) and on their arms and/or hands (85 % vs 40 %) compared with women in Massachusetts. Hot flashes in the midback were associated with concordance between nuchal, but not sternal, measures of skin conductance and subjective report in Mexico. In comparing average scores for concordance between subjective and sternal measures of hot flashes, there was a higher mean score for true positives in Mexico (61 % vs 29 %, P= 0. 06) and a significantly higher mean score for false-negative measures in Massachusetts (57 % vs 21 %, P= 0. 04).

40|$|The most {{important}} variable in roundabout geometric design is speed and its prior selection represents a fundamental step for road designers and traffic engineers. The design speed refers {{to that of}} an ideal vehicle on the shortest radius along the fastest allowable path in free-flowing conditions. It should be defined {{with respect to the}} geometry of the legs converging into the roundabout {{in order to ensure that}} the operating speed, which is conventionally set at the 85 th percentile of on-site recorded values in the above mentioned flow conditions, is as close as possible to the selected design speed or, in other words, that design consistency is achieved. This is a key factor in maintaining roundabouts as a safe intersection typology. When consistency is achieved, most of the vehicles (minimum 85 %) pass through the roundabout satisfying equilibrium and visibility conditions established by the designer. In this scenario, operating speeds of isolated vehicles are also similar in the circulatory roadway and relative speeds are lower compared to other intersection types. Design and operating speeds were evaluated in an experimental investigation carried out at some urban roundabouts in the Municipality of Cuneo (Italy). Operating speed data were gathered by means of a speed measuring system consisting of laser equipment, while geometric characteristics were derived by an on-site topographical <b>survey.</b> Speed <b>diagrams</b> for turn and through movements were derived in order to study the effects of the geometric characteristics of approach and exit legs. The results obtained focus mainly on possible divergences between predicted design speeds and observed operating speeds. The aim of this study is to determine if design consistency has been achieved and also to establish what kinds of defects might be responsible for any inconsistencies. Field observation highlighted the case of a roundabout characterized by tangent entering legs that generate anomalous speeds, which are greater in the circulatory roadway than in the approach legs.

However, due to {{the small number of}} known γ-ray emitting NLSy 1 (γ-NLSy 1) galaxies, a comprehensive study could not be performed. Here we report the first {{detection of}} significant γ-ray emission from four active galactic nuclei (AGN), recently classified as NLSy 1 from their Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical spectrum. Three flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) present in the third Large Area Telescope AGN catalog (3 LAC) are also found as γ-NLSy 1 galaxies. Comparing the γ-ray properties of these objects with 3 LAC blazars reveals their spectral shapes to be similar to FSRQs, however, with low γ-ray luminosity (≲ 10 ^ 46 - 47 erg s^- 1). In the Wide-field Infrared <b>Survey</b> Explorer color-color <b>diagram,</b> these objects occupy a region mainly populated by FSRQs. Using the H_β emission line parameters, we find that on average γ-NLSy 1 have smaller black hole masses than FSRQs at similar redshifts.

We conclude by noting that overall many observational properties of γ-NLSy 1 sources are similar to FSRQs and therefore, these objects could be their low black hole mass counterparts, as predicted in the literature.

The X-ray preliminary results from both the Chandra and optical surveys will be presented, including logN-logS vs. galactic position (l,b) and optical idenifications.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{results of a}} color-magnitude <b>diagram</b> <b>survey</b> of 25 {{candidate}} old LMC clusters. For {{almost all of the}} sample, it was possible to reach the turnoff region, and in many clusters we have several magnitudes of the main sequence. Age estimates based on the magnitude difference δ T_ 1 between the giant branch clump and the turnoff revealed that no new old clusters were found. The candidates turned out to be of intermediate age (1 - 3 Gyr) We show that the apparently old ages as inferred from integrated UBV colors can be explained by a combination of stochastic effects produced by bright stars and by photometric errors for faint clusters lying in crowded fields. The relatively metal poor candidates from the CaII triplet spectroscopy also turned out to be of intermediate age. This, combined with the fact that they lie far out in the disk, yields interesting constraints regarding the formation and evolution of the LMC disk. We also study the age distribution of intermediate age and old clusters This homogeneous set of accurate relative ages allows us to make an improved study of the history of cluster formation/destruction for ages > 1 Gyr. We confirm previous indications that there was apparently no cluster formation in the LMC during the period from 3 - 8 Gyr ago, and that there was a pronounced epoch of cluster formation beginning 3 Gyrs ago that peaked at about 1. 5 Gyrs ago. Our results suggest that there are few, if any, genuine old clusters in the LMC left to be found. Comment: LaTeX, to be published in Nov. 1997 Astronomical Journa...|$|R
40|$|GKN Aerospace Sweden AB in Trollhättan (abbreviated to GAS) {{develops}} {{and produces}} high quality parts for several aircraft OEM’s (including e. g. Rolls Royce and Pratt and Whitney), majorly comprising engines. Safety jurisdictions {{and level of}} technology have increased greatly {{over the past years}} in the aerospace industry, which has led to increased amount and level of demands and requirements, affecting the whole supply chain for every specific product in affected industries. New degree of demands are more difficult to assure while {{it at the same time}} increases the amount of data, information and knowledge along the life cycle of a product. An investigation was therefore established for evaluating: (1) How is the usage of measurement data (MD) effected depending on where in the product life cycle it is used? (2) What are the major obstacles against reuse of measurement data in technology, product and production development? (3) What technology and system has to be in place in order to support reuse of measurement data in technology, product and production de-velopment?The investigation was undertaken with a project strategy of PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) structure and the study was conducted inside of the firms’ industrial walls in order to establish a close-up thorough investiga-tion. With tools e. g. interviews, <b>surveys,</b> affinity <b>diagrams,</b> statistical tools and wide academic bases, empirical data of both qualitative and quantitative kind could be gathered. The interviews and observations established the major basis for the investigation with support from the survey about e. g. information and communication flows, departmental relations, specific needs, worker duties and vast issues or limitations. The findings was analyzed with support from a life cycle model for experience (i. e. data, information and knowledge) and con-clusions could be made for assuring that experience could be reused. Also, in the analysis particular attention was given towards communication since such affects the reuse process of new product development projects as well. It was found that (1) the studied company is generally good at perceiving the usage and implementation of MD in its processes over the whole product lifecycle, i. e. knowledge about usage of MD is present at GAS to a high degree. However the present company structure does not allow for an effective usage of MD in early stages of the product life cycle, suggesting problems with insufficient; IT-environment, repositories of MD, communication platforms, information media, and measurement standards, affecting the Pull process nega-tively (comprising activities of Search, Access and Use of MD). (2) The mindset towards using MD is con-sidered reactive since measurements mostly are conducted towards verification of product quality in produc-tion. Added to this, manual labor-based way-of-working and systems with unsupportive structure towards reuse of experiences with enough usability, traceability and availability was also found to be true. (3) The firm was concluded to be in need of a heterogeneous IT-based system allowing the transition of saving correct digital experience and receiving such with enough value and context for the specific user. The study is concluded with recommendations to GKN Aerospace Sweden AB along three different spans of 0 - 5, 5 - 10 and 10 - 20 years of time, where the major part is to be seen as a vision or long term strategy to strive for. The first span consists of boosting locally evolved but not fully implemented initiatives in the com-pany, allowing for the first important basis to be set. The 5 - 10 year span was comprised with implementation of a new heterogeneous IT-based system, acting as stable foundation for the next industrial revolution to be seen as the conceptual strategy to strive for later on along the 10 - 20 year recommendation. The whole rec-ommendation and this thesis is believed to allow the firm to be proactive in future product developments since information is proposed to be the new success driver towards business success and competitiveness.

40|$|The Herschel-Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) {{provides}} an unprecedented opportunity {{to search for}} blazars at sub-mm wavelengths. We cross-matched the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) radio source catalogue with the 11 655 sources brighter than 35 [*]mJy at 500 [*]μm in the ∼ 135 deg 2 of the sky covered by the H-ATLAS equatorial fields at 9 h and 15 h, plus half of the field at 12 h. We found that 379 of the H-ATLAS sources have a FIRST counterpart within 10 arcsec, including eight catalogued blazars (plus one known blazar that was found {{at the edge of}} one of the H-ATLAS maps). To search for additional blazar candidates we have devised new diagnostic diagrams and found that known blazars occupy a region of the log[*](S 500 [*]μm/S 350 [*]μm) versus log[*](S 500 [*]μm/S 1. 4 [*]GHz) plane separated from that of sub-mm sources with radio emission powered by star formation, but shared with radio galaxies and steep-spectrum radio quasars. Using this diagnostic we have selected 12 further possible candidates that turn out to be scattered in the (r − z) versus (u − r) plane or in the Wide-Field Infrared <b>Survey</b> Explorer colour–colour <b>diagram,</b> where known blazars are concentrated in well defined strips. This suggests that the majority of them are not blazars. Based on an inspection of all the available photometric data, including unpublished VISTA Kilo-degree Infrared Galaxy survey photometry and new radio observations, we found that the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of only one out of the 12 newly selected sources are compatible with being synchrotron dominated at least up to 500 [*]μm, i. e. with being a blazar. Another object may consist of a faint blazar nucleus inside a bright star-forming galaxy. The possibility that some blazar hosts are endowed with active star formation is supported by our analysis of the SEDs of Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue blazars detected at both 545 and 857 GHz. The estimated rest-frame synchrotron peak frequencies of H-ATLAS blazars are in the range 11. 5 ≤ log[*](νpeak, Hz) ≤ 13. 7, implying that these objects are low synchrotron peak. Six of them also show evidence of an ultraviolet excess that can be attributed to emission from the accretion disc. Allowing for the possibility of misidentifications and of contamination of the 500 [*]μm flux density by the dusty torus or by the host galaxy, we estimate that there are seven or eight pure synchrotron sources brighter than S 500 [*]μm = 35 [*]mJy over the studied area, a result that sets important constraints on blazar evolutionary models...|$|R
