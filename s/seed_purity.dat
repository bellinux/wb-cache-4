Number of rattail fescue (Festuca myuros) seeds and number of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) <b>seeds</b> in a <b>purity</b> sample were counted, and number of noxious weed seeds were also totaled. Uniformity in 30, 000 kilogram lots was measured by an H-test, heterogeneity value, state seed law labeling tolerance tables, and by a Chi-square test for homogeneity of a binomial distribution on each sub-lot. Subdivisionsof each seed lot were examined for uniformity by use of an analysis of variance test.

O experimento foi conduzido em campo, nos anos 2007 / 2008, demarcando-se parcelas de 5 m x 2 m, com 1 m de bordadura entre elas e distribuÃdas em sete tratamentos, ao acaso, com cinco repetiÃÃes cada. Durante o desenvolvimento da cultura, avaliaram-se os parÃmetros: Ãndice de velocidade de emergÃncia, desenvolvimento de planta e incidÃncia de espÃcies invasoras. ApÃs a colheita, em laboratÃrio, foram avaliadas as sementes colhidas pela determinaÃÃo de teor de Ãgua, massa de 100 sementes, pureza, produtividade, porcentagem de germinaÃÃo e vigor. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em esquema fatorial com dois fatores com testemunha e as mÃdias foram comparadas pelo teste de Tukey ao nÃvel de 5 % de significÃncia. Observa-se que as espÃcies invasoras nÃo diferiram estatisticamente entre os tratamentos. De maneira geral, os tratamentos nÃo influenciaram na altura de plantas e aumentaram a produtividade da soja. Entretanto, apresentaram sementes menos vigorosas quando submetidas ao teste de envelhecimento acelerado. A pureza das sementes foi menor quando submetida ao cultivo com aveia preta. A massa de 100 sementes foi alterada pelos tratamentos, sendo maior em cultivo sob aveia preta. Os demais parÃmetros analisados nÃo mostraram diferenÃas estatÃsticas. Conclui-se, portanto, que tais espÃcies sÃo indicadas como alternativa para cobertura de inverno, na rotaÃÃo de culturas com a soja, pois melhoram os aspectos agronÃmicos da cultura.

So, this trial aimed at analyzing the interference of black oats residues as well as black oat, common vetch and forage turnip consortium on weeds incidence, seeds emergence, seedling emergence, plants development, soybean productivity and its harvested seeds quality. The trial was carried out on field, from 2007 to 2008, with 5 m x 2 m plots and 1 m of border among them, distributed in seven randomized treatments with five replications each.

In the 28 potato cultivars analyzed, the number of heterozygous genotypes per locus varied between 6 to 28 with an average number of heterozygous genotypes per locus of 18, considering the 10 loci studied.

It as observed some differences between FEPAGRO-RS 11, FEPAGRO-RS 12, FEPAGRO 17 e FEPAGRO 18, concerning the levels of initial moisture, the mass of thousand seeds and the physiological qualities of the seeds. All the conducting treatments managed to obtain a purity quality superior to 99, 0 % It can be concluded that the sequence of conditioning consisted by the pre cleaning operations, polishing and cleaning, improves the visual aspect and does not damage the physiological potential of the seeds from silage sorghum...|$|R
40|$|Trials {{have been}} {{conducted}} in the subhumid zone of Nigeria to assess the potential of different weed control methods to improve seed quantity and quality using three tropical forage legumes: Centrosema pascuorum cv. cavalcade, chamaecrista rotundifolia cv. Wynn and Stylosanthes hamata cv. Verano. Manual weeding was done at different times and intervals {{during the growing season}} and a range of herbicides was tested at different application rates and times. Manual weeding generally produced higher <b>seed</b> yields and <b>purity</b> if plots were weeded in the early and mid growing season. Intervals between weedings and the frequency of weeding was flexible and suitable for small scale seed production. Susceptibility of weeds and tolerance of legumes to various herbicides differed. Trifluralin has potential in Cavalcade, a combined application of bentazon and cyloxidim in Verano and imazethapyr in Wynn. Herbicide application is very time specific and needs to be done using appropriate equipment, it is therefore only recommended for specialised farmers...|$|R
40|$|Plastids are {{functionally}} and structurally diverse organelles {{responsible for}} numerous biosyn-thetic reactions within the plant cell. Plastids from embryos have {{a range of}} properties depending upon the plant source but compared to other plastid types are poorly understood and therefore, we term them embryoplasts. Isolating intact plastids from developing embryos is challenging due to large starch granules within the stroma and the prevalence of nonplastid, storage organelles (oil bodies and protein storage vacuoles) which compromise plastid integrity and purity, respectively. To characterize rapeseed embryoplasts it was necessary to develop an improved isolation proce-dure. A new method is presented for the isolation of intact plastids from developing embryos of Brassica napus <b>seeds.</b> Intactness and <b>purity</b> of embryoplast preparations was determined using phase-contrast and transmission electron microscopy, immunoblotting, and multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) MS/MS. Eighty nonredundant proteins were identi-fied by MudPITanalysis of embryoplast preparations. Approximately 53 % of these proteins were components of photosystem, light harvesting, cytochrome b/f, and ATP synthase complexes, sug-gesting ATP and NADPH production are important functions for this plastid type...|$|R
