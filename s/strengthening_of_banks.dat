40|$|In this {{research}} analysis, {{the subject of}} credit risk, which carries a lot of significance for the banking sector, has been examined for the banking sector of the Northern Cyprus. When examined retrospectively, {{it is observed that}} the credit risk had a determining effect on the banking crisis previously experienced in the country. Regarding the fundamental ratios, until the starting point of the crisis, though, there were steady increases in the credit risk of banking sector as a whole. However, following the crisis, it is observed that with the administrative, legal and financial measures taken, the risk dropped. Not only this situation has been determined with the credit risk ratios, but it has also been found out during the regulatory and supervisory stage of credits that no provision for loan losses had previously been allocated. However, the necessity for <b>strengthening</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks,</b> {{from the point of view}} of equity capital, which is seen as a safety valve, has been very apparent. Furthermore, necessary preparations of technological, administrative, know-how and qualified personnel should be made in accordance with Basel II framework...|$|E

40|$|Changes are {{occurring}} {{in the provision of}} consumer credit, including the expansion of subprime and some fringe financial services (e. g., payday lending). We link two existing literatures on credit constraint and financial exclusion {{to assess the impact of}} these developments on the financial circumstances of low and modest-income consumers. We develop a model that identifies observable measures of credit constraint and financial exclusion and relate them to consumer characteristics and life cycle behaviour. We estimate this model using the two latest Surveys of Financial Security for 1999 and 2005, which provide consistent evidence of credit constraint and financial exclusion through time. We find modest overlap among our measures of financial exclusion, which include a zero balance/no account, credit card refusal, and using a pawnshop. Probit regression is used to investigate the factors influencing the incidence of financial exclusion. The results are similar for 1999 and 2005 and indicate rising incidence of financial exclusion as income and wealth fall, although the relationship is nonlinear such that incidence rises much faster at very low levels of income and wealth. Our analysis also suggests potentially important links between financial literacy, formal education, asset building, and financial exclusion and credit constraint. When we combine the samples, we find statistically significant evidence of growth in the incidence of each indicator of financial exclusion when other factors are held constant. Policy implications may include the <b>strengthening</b> <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> regulations that affect low-income Canadians and the promotion of universal financial literacy.

Nevertheless, temporary measurements such as personal income tax rates were cut from 24% to 15% to gain support for such adjustments. Real estate tax was introduced in 2009.

Findings reveal that bank credit negatively though significantly impacted on domestic investment in the long run while its short run impact is both positive and significant.

The aim is to provide directions and guidelines for further <b>strengthening</b> <b>of</b> the Macedonian <b>banking</b> sector. According to the comparative analysis of the efficiency indicators (net interest margin and operating costs) <b>of</b> the Macedonian <b>banking</b> sector and the countries of CSEE, the countries whose banking sector shows lower operating costs are characterized with a higher level of financial deepening and greater degree of financial intermediation. The high interest margins direct towards unsuitable allocation of financial resources and insufficient competitiveness in the domestic banking sector.

40|$|Summary According to the Commonwealth Bank, {{since the}} {{beginning}} of 2016 NSW has been Australia’s top performing economy, slightly ahead of Victoria and maintaining a healthy lead over other States and Territories. The April 2016 State of the States report found that NSW holds top ranking on five indicators: population growth, retail trade, dwelling starts, and unemployment. NSW does not hold top position on all economic indicators: it remains fourth ranked on construction work done and second ranked on economic growth, both led by the Northern Territory. Nevertheless, the State of the States report concluded that NSW retains a solid grip on the top ranking of economic performance. One reason for this ongoing economic strength, as noted by St George Bank last year, is the Australian economy’s ongoing transition away from mining to the non-resources sectors: While NSW may have felt like it was standing on the sidelines in the mining investment boom, the ongoing transition in Australian economic growth to other sectors is a boon for NSW. We expect solid economic growth in coming years. As discussed in past Economic Updates, the housing market continues to play a pivotal role in the NSW economy’s recent resurgence, driving dwelling investment, generating wealth and catalysing household consumption growth. However, as reported by the Australian Financial Review, house price growth is now at its slowest pace in 31 months, with no capital city recording an annual growth rate at 10 % or more over the past year. RBA Governor Glenn Stevens has argued that the slowdown indicates that the mid- 2015 <b>strengthening</b> <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> lending standards for housing has worked {{to reduce the risk of}} a major housing market downturn. Nevertheless, as noted by Merrill Lynch, the slowdown may result in “a period of weaker price growth or outright modest declines [that] is likely to become entrenched over coming years”. Whether this slowdown risks instigating a household debt crisis in the long term remains the topic of debate by many observers. Based on the latest quarterly movements, the strengthened and weakened areas of the NSW economy are summarised in the table on the following page. It is clear that NSW is performing relatively well in key areas, although business investment remains weak...|$|R
