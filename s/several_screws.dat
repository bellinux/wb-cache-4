40|$|The {{fractures}} of {{the hand}} are frequent and represent a problem of public health. The displacement of the fracture occurs because of post-traumatic mtiscalo-tendinoas imbalance. The fractures {{of the hand}} are to be treated according to four principles :anatomical redaction, followed, when possible, by immediate mobilization, if necessary, by immobilization of the injured parts in the « protective » position (metacarpophalangeal flexion, interphalangeal extension and with the first web space under stretch), and prevention of post-traumatic edema. When an osteosynthesis is performed, the mounting should be stable enough to allow early mobilization. The most useful techniques include external minifixation, and internal fixation using one or <b>several</b> <b>screws.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
30|$|Achieving {{stability}} after fibular transposition {{is the key}} to facilitating union. Rapid union {{between the}} graft and the recipient bone and the development of hypertrophy contributes to limb stability and the achievement of good functional results. Ozaki et al. [27] state that fixation with a long plate and <b>several</b> <b>screws</b> is better than minimal osteosynthesis, whereas Ebied et al. [10] recommended fixation with screws, K-wires, or cerclage wires and external fixation of the limb in a plaster cast, based on the results obtained for their series. The method of fixation used in this study was external fixation in all cases, with added proximal and distal screws in graft junctions. In this study, common peroneal nerve palsy was detected in two patients with proximal tibial tumors during the immediate postoperative period. Both of them completely recovered within six months. This was probably due to overtraction of the nerve.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} failure modes of cementless {{acetabular}} components is the loosening of the acetabular cup, which is mostly attributable to insufficient initial stability. A hemispherical cup with a porous coating which is inserted with press-fit fixation and secured with <b>several</b> <b>screws</b> {{is one of the}} most widely used approaches. Many studies have found that bone screws are very helpful aids for cup fixation, but the optimal surgical technique for inserting screws has not been clearly reported. In this study, hemispherical cups were fixed into blocks of foam bone with zero to three screws. The effects of three types of screw eccentricity (a 1 -mm offset and angular eccentricities of 15 ° and 25 °) on the initial stability of the acetabular cup were evaluated. The experimental results indicate that increasing the number of screws enhances the cup stability in the case of ideal screwing (i. e., with no eccentricity). An angular eccentricity of 15 ° did not affect the cup stability for fixation with one or two screws. However, the presence of 25 ° of angular eccentricity significantly reduced the stability of the cup, while 1  mm of offset eccentricity produced an even greater impact...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} a novel and original formula for the higher-order time derivatives, {{and also for}} the partial derivatives of screws, which are successively computed in terms of Lie products, thus leading to the automation of the differentiation process. Through the process and, due to the pure geometric nature of the derivation approach, an enlightening physical inter-pretation of <b>several</b> <b>screw</b> derivatives is accomplished. Important applications for the proposed formula include higher-order kinematic analysis of open and closed kinematic chains and also the kinematic synthesis of serial and parallel manipulators. More specifically, {{the existence of a}} natural relationship is shown between the differential calculus of screws and the Lie subalge-bras associated with the expected finite displacements of the end effector of an open kinematic chain. In this regard, a simple and comprehensible methodology is obtained, which consider-ably reduces theabstraction level frequently requiredwhenone resorts tomoreabstract concepts, such as Lie groups or Lie subalgebras; thus keeping the required mathematical background to the extent that is strictly necessary for kinematic purposes. Furthermore, by following the approach proposed in this article, the elements of Lie subalgebra arise in a natural way – due to the corre-sponding changes in screws through time – and they also have the typical shape of the so-called ordered Lie products that characterize those screws that are compatible with the feasible joint displacements of an arbitrary serial manipulator. Finally, several application examples – involv-ing typical, serial manipulators – are presented in order to prove the feasibility and validity of the proposed method. ...|$|R
