2500|$|Modern <b>shanties</b> {{were used}} to {{accompany}} work at the patent windlass, {{which was designed to}} raise anchor and was operated by the see-saw like action of pumping hand brakes. The up and down motion of the brake levers lent the action a binary form that was well-suited by many of the same songs used as halyard <b>shanties.</b> And yet, the continuous nature of the task also meant grand choruses were possible. So while halyard <b>shanties</b> and capstan <b>shanties</b> tended to be exclusive of one another, windlass <b>shanties</b> sometimes shared repertoire with each of those other types. Examples: [...] "Sally Brown," [...] "Heave Away, My Johnnies," [...] and [...] "Mister Stormalong." ...|$|R

25|$|Sea <b>shanties</b> are {{a type of}} work song {{traditionally}} sung by sailors. Derived {{from the}} French word 'chanter', meaning 'to sing', they may date from {{as early as the}} 15th century, but most recorded examples derive from the 19th century. <b>Shanties</b> were usually slow rhythmic songs designed to help with collective tasks on labour-intensive sailing and later steam ships. Many were call and response songs, with one voice (the shantyman) singing a lead line {{and the rest of the}} sailors giving a response together. There were derived from varied sources, including dances, folk songs, polkas, waltzes and even West African work-songs. Since different songs were useful for different tasks they are traditionally divided into three main categories, short haul <b>shanties,</b> for tasks requiring quick pulls over a relatively short time; halyard <b>shanties,</b> for heavier work requiring more set-up time between pulls; and Capstan <b>shanties,</b> for long, repetitive tasks requiring a sustained rhythm, but not involving working the lines. Famous <b>shanties</b> include, the 'Drunken Sailor' and 'Blow the Man Down'. There was some interest in sea <b>shanties</b> in the first revival from figures like Percy Grainger. In the second revival A. L. Lloyd attempted to popularise them, recording several albums of sea songs from 1965.|$|R
2500|$|Somewhere {{between these}} {{perspectives}} was Cecil Sharp's, whose English Folk-Chanteys (1914) {{was published in}} the same year, and was based on <b>shanties</b> he collected from aged English sailors in Britain. Sharp responds to Bullen's claims of African-American origins by ceding that many <b>shanties</b> were influenced through the singing of Black shantymen—a position that assumes English folk song was the core of the tradition by default. The title of Sharp's work reflects his project of collecting and grouping <b>shanties</b> as part of what he conceived to be a rather continuous English folk song tradition. Sharp states in the introduction that he deliberately excluded <b>shanties</b> which were obviously (i.e. to him) born of popular songs. This idea is problematic when one considers that the popular songs that were feeding <b>shanties</b> were largely American and based in real or imagined African-American musical traits. However, Sharp believed that by eliminating such <b>shanties</b> based on popular songs, he could concentrate those that were [...] "folk" [...] songs. Of his own admission, Sharp lacked any shantying or sea experience to intuitively judge <b>shanties</b> like someone such as Bullen, however he offers his objectivity, recording precisely what was sung to him, as consolation. While Sharp's manner of documenting <b>shanties</b> was more or less objective, the field of his research and his biases in what to collect certainly influenced the outcome of this study. And whereas Bullen's work was fairly inaccessible, Sharp was influential as the leader of a cohort of scholars who were actively creating the young field of folk song research.|$|R

5|$|About {{nine hours}} after Ernesto became a {{tropical}} storm, {{the government of}} Haiti issued a tropical storm watch from its border with the Dominican Republic to the southwestern tip of the country. As the storm strengthened, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, and about 15hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning. Several low-lying citizens in Gonaïves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20inches (500mm) of rain in some mountainous areas. Additionally, authorities advised residents in <b>shanty</b> towns near the ocean to evacuate to emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, Aristo {{published}} Politweet, {{an illustrated}} collection of flash fiction mostly dealing with politics. That same year, he cowrote the screenplay for Sang Penari (The Dancer) with Ifa Isfansyah and <b>Shanty</b> Harmayn; {{the work was}} an adaptation of Ahmad Tohari's trilogy Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk (The Ronggeng of Paruk Village). The trio were nominated for Best Screenplay at that year's Indonesian Film Festival. Later that year, he wrote Lima Elang (Five Eagles), a film directed by Rudy Soedjarwo.

25|$|Commenters on {{the ethnic}} or {{national}} origins of <b>shanties,</b> {{writing in the}} 19th century when <b>shanties</b> were still in wide use, generally supposed the genre to originate in America and recognized parallels to African-American singing—as opposed to earlier English traditions from Britain. An early article to offer an opinion {{on the origin of}} <b>shanties</b> (though not calling them by that name), appearing in Oberlin College's student paper in 1858, drew a comparison between Africans' singing and sailor work songs.|$|R
2500|$|Appearances of <b>shanties,</b> or {{songs and}} melodies labeled as [...] "shanties," [...] in popular media can be anachronistic and fanciful. In accord with popular {{perception}} of <b>shanties</b> as a genre {{many hundreds of}} years old, songs with documented existence to only the mid-19th century, at the earliest, have been freely used to portray scenes from the 18th century and earlier. By imagining modern <b>shanties</b> {{to have been in}} use during such eras as the Golden Age of Piracy and the French Revolutionary Wars, anachronistic associations have been formed between <b>shanties</b> and [...] "pirates" [...] or the British Navy. Evidence for all these uses and associations {{can be found in the}} examples that follow in this section.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Shanties</b> {{have also}} been {{well-documented}} in use for tasks other {{than those of the}} deep-water sailor. The working of cargo was performed by stevedores to the accompaniment of <b>shanties,</b> for example {{in the tradition of the}} Georgia Sea Island Singers of St. Simons Island, Georgia. They used such <b>shanties</b> as [...] "Knock a Man Down" [...] (a variation of [...] "Blow the Man Down") to load heavy timber. The category of menhaden chanties refers to work songs used on menhaden fishing boats, sung while pulling up the purse-seine nets. The musical forms, and consequently the repertoire, of menhaden chanties differ significantly from the deep-water <b>shanties,</b> most noticeably in the fact that the workers [...] "pull" [...] in between rather than concurrently with certain words of the songs. Common examples are [...] "The Johnson Girls" [...] and [...] "Won't You Help Me to Raise 'Em Boys." [...] Off-shore whalermen in parts of the Caribbean sang <b>shanties</b> whilst rowing their whaleboats and when hauling their catch onto land.|$|R
5|$|Nouakchott {{is built}} around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs {{northeast}} through the city centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas {{in the north and}} the medina quarter, along with the kebbe, a <b>shanty</b> town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable Mauritanian or international figures of the 1960s: Avenue Abdel Nasser, Avenue Charles de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were <b>shanty</b> towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and {{over a quarter of}} a million people lived here. Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E
5|$|Sang Penari was {{directed}} by Ifa Isfansyah.

5|$|The novella {{is divided}} into 29 {{chapters}} with introduction, notes, and acknowledgments sections. Structured similarly to a classical Greek drama, the storytelling alternates between Penelope's narrative and the choral commentary of the twelve maids. Penelope narrates 18 chapters with the Chorus contributing 11 chapters dispersed throughout the book. The Chorus uses a new narrative style in each of their chapters, beginning with a jump-rope rhyme and ending in a 17-line iambic dimeter poem. Other narrative styles used by the Chorus include a lament, a folk song, an idyll, a sea <b>shanty,</b> a ballad, a drama, an anthropology lecture, a court trial, and a love song.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Lima played an ambivalent {{role in the}} 1821–1824 Peruvian War of Independence; the city suffered exactions from Royalist and Patriot armies alike.

It enjoyed a short period of prosperity in the mid-19th century until the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific when it was occupied and looted by Chilean troops. After the war, the city went through a period of demographic expansion and urban renewal. Population growth accelerated in the 1940s spurred by immigration from the Andean regions of Peru. This gave rise to the proliferation of <b>shanty</b> towns as public services failed {{to keep up with the}} city expansion.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the hurricane, many {{residents}} in <b>shanty</b> towns failed to hear tropical cyclone warnings and watches. Some did hear the warnings, but they did not believe them as the same warning had been issued several weeks before and nothing had happened. In addition, city officials warned the residents living near the dam to take shelter in public buildings though most refused to leave. The government ignored all requests to shore up an earthen dam, as they did not believe Liza would pose a significant threat of damage to the Baja California Peninsula.

5|$|The Anderson Street Station had a wood {{siding with}} a {{shingled}} roof, two brick chimneys {{off the roof}} and two asphalt platforms in both directions. The station also had a garage door on the southern side of the building. No official style of architecture was mentioned for Anderson Street in the 1920 Final Engineering Report {{due to lack of}} design. Nearby, a wooden watchman's <b>shanty</b> was constructed near the team track. The station had two tracks run through it (one main track and a team track) and had a rail crossing between tracks. By 1870, the tracks had been extended northward to Hillsdale, and public service began on the line on March 4 of that year. Trains terminated at Hillsdale with fare of only $0.75 (1870 USD), but just one year later, the extension northward. The service was extended northward to the community of Haverstraw, New York, and in 1896, the rail line was leased by the private company to the Erie Railroad.|$|E
5|$|A {{settlement}} {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837. He made a more accurate survey of the reservation lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140km²) within the reservation. He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude {{certain parts of the}} east bank that {{had been part of the}} 1805 cession to Zebulon Pike. His plan was to stake a pre-emption claim at the falls. However, Franklin Steele also had plans to stake a claim. On July 15, 1838, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi Rivers. Steele rushed off to the falls, built a <b>shanty,</b> and marked off boundary lines. Plympton's party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to claim the most desirable land. Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele's claim, as did other settlers such as Pierre Bottineau, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin. Steele went on to build a dam at the falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from the Rum River area.|$|E
