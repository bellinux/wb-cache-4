5|$|Dresden {{spent much}} of her career overseas. After commissioning, she visited the United States in 1909 during the Hudson-Fulton Celebration, before {{returning}} to Germany to serve in the reconnaissance force of the High Seas Fleet for three years. In 1913, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Division. She was then sent to the Caribbean to protect German nationals during the Mexican Revolution. In mid-1914, <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> former dictator Victoriano Huerta to Jamaica, where the British had granted him asylum. She was due to return to Germany in July 1914, but was prevented by the outbreak of World War I from doing so. At the onset of hostilities, Dresden operated as a commerce raider in South American waters in the Atlantic, then moved to the Pacific Ocean in September and joined Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Emden {{spent the}} {{majority}} of {{her career as a}} training ship; in the inter-war period, she conducted several world cruises to train naval cadets. At the outbreak of war, she laid minefields off the German coast and was damaged by a British bomber that crashed into her. She participated in the invasion of Norway in April 1940, and then resumed training duties in the Baltic Sea. These lasted with minor interruptions until September 1944, when she was deployed to Norway to serve as the flagship of the minelaying forces there. In January 1945, <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> disinterred remains of Paul von Hindenburg from East Prussia to Pillau, to prevent his remains from falling {{into the hands of the}} advancing Soviet Army. While undergoing repairs in Kiel, Emden was badly damaged by British bombers and later run aground outside the harbor and was blown up. The wreck was ultimately broken up in 1949.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{she took}} Prime Minister İsmet İnönü from Varna to Istanbul {{and carried the}} Shah of Iran from Trebizond to Samsun the {{following}} year. Yavuz Sultan Selim had her name officially shortened to Yavuz Sultan in 1930 and then to Yavuz in 1936. Another short refit was conducted in 1938, and in November that year <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> remains of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from Istanbul to İzmit. She and the other ships of the navy were considered outdated by the British Naval Attache by 1937, partly due to their substandard anti-aircraft armament, but in 1938 the Turkish government began planning to expand the force. Under these plans the surface fleet was to comprise two 10,000 ton cruisers and twelve destroyers. Yavuz would be retained until the second cruiser was commissioned in 1945, and the navy expected to build a 23,000 ton ship between 1950 and 1960. The naval building program did not come about, as the foreign shipyards which were to build the ships concentrated {{on the needs of}} their own nations leading up to World War II.|$|E

Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence {{that all of the}} earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.|$|E

Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. <b>She</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E
