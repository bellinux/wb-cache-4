40|$|Financial {{economists have}} long been puzzled by {{investor}} demand for actively managed funds that generate, on average, negative after-fee, risk-adjusted returns. To shed new light on this puzzle, we exploit the fact that funds in different market segments compete for different types of retail investors. Within the <b>segment</b> of <b>funds</b> marketed directly to retail investors, we find that flows chase risk-adjusted returns, and that funds respond by investing more in active management. Importantly, within this direct-sold segment, we find little evidence that actively managed funds underperform index funds. In contrast, within the <b>segment</b> of <b>funds</b> sold through brokers, which we demonstrate face a weaker incentive to generate alpha, we find that actively managed funds significantly underperform index funds. We conclude that the well-known underperformance of the average actively managed fund in the full sample {{is driven by the}} large fraction of funds with weak incentives to identify and motivate skilled managers. ...|$|R

40|$|Unlike mutual funds, {{hedge funds}} are {{reluctant}} to {{provide detailed information on}} their investment portfolios. Since hedge funds may use niche investment strategies in narrow market <b>segments,</b> <b>fund</b> managers portend that thorough disclosure of their portfolio holdings—which are important to assessing future returns—would crowd out their trades, thus decreasing opportunities to generate outsized returns. However, incomplete disclosure can have some undesirable side effects. It might encourage hedge fund managers to take positions that are riskier than provided for by the manager’s mandate. Investors even risk fraudulent behavior, since the action of hedge fund management may be detected only when a fund has failed. This article presents the results of a comprehensive survey of hedge fund managers and investors on current hedge fund reporting practices. The authors find that the quality of hedge fund reporting is considered an important investment criterion. In analyzing the spectrum of opinions, the authors identify critical points of conflict between investors and managers. They find that investors are especially dissatisfied with the quality of information on liquidity and operational risk exposure. The survey also reveals that inappropriate performance measures are prevalent...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that the integration of multisensory signals from the body in fronto-parietal association areas underlies the perception of a body part as belonging to ones physical self. What are the neural mechanisms that enable the perception of ones entire body as a unified entity? In one behavioral and one fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis experiment, we used a full-body illusion to investigate how congruent visuo-tactile signals from a single body part facilitate the emergence of the sense of ownership of the entire body. To elicit this illusion, participants viewed the body of a mannequin from the first-person perspective via head-mounted displays while synchronous touches were applied to the hand, abdomen, or leg of the bodies of the participant and the mannequin; asynchronous visuo-tactile stimuli served as controls. The psychometric data indicated that the participants perceived ownership of the entire artificial body regardless of the body segment that received the synchronous visuo-tactile stimuli. Based on multivoxel pattern analysis, we found that the neural responses in the left ventral premotor cortex displayed illusion-specific activity patterns that generalized across all tested pairs of body parts. Crucially, a tripartite generalization analysis revealed the whole-body specificity of these premotor activity patterns. Finally, we also identified multivoxel patterns in the premotor, intraparietal, and lateral occipital cortices and in the putamen that reflected multisensory responses specific to individual body parts. Based on these results, we propose that the dynamic formation of a whole-body percept may be mediated by neuronal populations in the ventral premotor cortex that contain visuo-tactile receptive fields encompassing multiple body <b>segments.</b> <b>Funding</b> Agencies|European Research Council; James S.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between portfolio concentration {{and the performance of}} global equity funds. Concentrated funds with higher levels of tracking error display better performance than their more broadly diversified counterparts. We show that the observed relation between portfolio concentration and performance is mostly driven by the breadth of the underlying fund strategies; not just by fund managers' willingness to take big bets. Our results indicate that when investors strive to select the best-performing funds, they should not only consider fund managers' tracking-error levels. More important is that they take into account the extent to which fund managers carefully allocate their risk budget across multiple investment strategies and have concentrated holdings in multiple market <b>segments</b> simultaneously.

Furthermore, our results suggest that investors in the latter are more fee- and risk-aware than investors in standard segments. Overall, these results hint at investors in specialist segments being more sophisticated than investors in standard segments. Our results should have serious implications for the management of investment companies and for the behavior of fund managers.

They use this rationale when assigning newly hired fund managers as well as when reassigning managers they already employ.

As of mid-2008, $350 million from state bonds and federal assistance has been budgeted to begin replacing a 17-mile (27-km) stretch of LA 1, the road into Port Fourchon, because {{that part of}} the highway is not inside the hurricane levee system that protects inland communities, and the highway is prone to flooding from storm surge, even from tropical cyclones some distance away. The replacement will be an elevated highway that can stand up to a major storm and remain open even if the land around it floods.

50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the 130-30 funds is to tap into the large pool of assets {{allocated}} to long-only managers, while the primary rationale of the strategy is to attempt to construct more efficient portfolios by allowing limited short selling. The world’s 500 largest long-only fund managers have a total of assets under management of $63.7 trillion. In comparison global hedge fund assets are estimated to $2.48 trillion, or 3.9 percent of that. It is obvious that the long-only funds manage a large chunk of money that everyone is interested in. The global assets of 130-30 funds are in perspective very small, approximately $53.3 billion. Nevertheless, the <b>fund</b> <b>segment</b> is growing rapidly; assets increased with 78.5 percent over {{the first nine months of}} 2007. The fee structure of 130-30 funds is, as mentioned above, closer related to that of hedge funds than that of long-only funds. In general, the performance fee is on average very similar to the hedge fund average, while the management fee is typically lower, and in-between long-only and hedge funds.|$|R
