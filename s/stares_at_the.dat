5|$|Mulder and Scully put the {{apartment}} under surveillance, but Colton has them {{taken off the}} job. Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment and tries to call his partner, but her phone line has been cut. Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism. When Tooms is given food through a slot in the door, he <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thin slot and grins.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, Greatfoot is {{run over}} and killed while {{crossing}} a freeway during a hunt. The pups begin hearing a strange wolf howl, but when they track it they find a fresh kill and the familiar human scent. New kills appear every few days as the young wolves grow larger and stronger. One night when they hear the unusual howl, they are closer than usual to it and reach the kill in time to meet their benefactor, a human male. The pack <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man, before disappearing back into the forest, ignoring his howl. As he goes to leave, however, the six return {{to the edge of}} the clearing and howl.|$|E
5|$|Peggy tries {{in vain to}} {{extinguish}} the flames, but is forced out by her friends and family. Stacey, unaware of the events, heads upstairs to Lily and becomes trapped. She uses the crowbar to smash a boarded-up window and hands Lily over to Ryan, who has climbed a ladder. Peggy realises Phil is still inside {{and returns to the}} building with Billy. They find him trapped beneath a wooden beam, and are able to drag him out to safety. Ryan goes back up the ladder and carries an unconscious Stacey out. Stacey regains consciousness and sees that Lily is safe, and tells Ryan that Lily is his daughter. Peggy <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pub as it is completely destroyed.|$|E
60|$|Komba {{was much}} impressed. He returned; he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead {{rhinoceros}} and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hole in its throat; he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me; he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> still smoking rifle.|$|R
60|$|He {{came to a}} full stop. He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> notice-plate, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> glass door, {{and turning}} round, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> over-pathetic dead soldier {{on the arm of}} his over-heroic pistol-firing comrade; Mentana--and the date! Aaron {{wondered}} what and where Mentana was. Then at last he summoned his energy, opened the glass door, and mounted the first stairs.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they all}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me, {{and then they}} all <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ship lying <b>at</b> anchor.|$|R
5|$|Using Mulder's credentials, Roche kidnaps {{a girl in}} Swampscott, Massachusetts whom he met on {{his flight}} with Mulder to Boston. Scully and Skinner arrive {{the next day and}} the agents head to the site of Roche's old {{apartment}} in Revere. They find him with the girl in an abandoned bus nearby. Roche holds the gun on the girl and tells Mulder that he'll never know for sure whether the last victim is Samantha or not if he kills him. Mulder is then forced to shoot Roche, as he starts to pull on the trigger of the stolen gun. In his office Mulder <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> final cloth heart and puts it away, unsure of whether it belonged to Samantha or not.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{produced}} a sealed packet, which Captain Cuttle <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{as he had}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> keys.|$|R

5|$|Aslam and Khan confront {{one another}} as the police, having been alerted to Khan's {{location}} by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend {{himself in front of}} Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E
25|$|Pilot {{awareness}} and response. Ideally, pilots will {{be aware of}} laser and bright light hazards, and will know how to recover {{in case of an}} incident. Conversely, a pilot can make the situation worse if he or she overreacts, <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> light to try to locate its source, or takes immediate unnecessary evasive maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|As {{the month}} {{comes to an}} end, with the sun due to rise, the vampires start to burn down the town to destroy {{evidence}} of their presence, and prevent any survivors from telling the world what happened. Realizing Stella is trapped and that he cannot beat the vampires in his current state, Eben turns himself into a vampire by injecting himself with Billy's infected blood. He confronts Marlow, and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched through his head, causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms, while she <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, {{coming to grips with}} what has happened.|$|E
60|$|Now the High-Priest {{turned and}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> those behind him, and all who were present <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Queen.|$|R
60|$|Ingua <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{groceries}} and then <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Mary Louise. Her wan face flushed and then grew hard.|$|R

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "My Boxer" [...] premiered on 12 July 2013 through her official website and YouTube account. The clip features Oh Land riding {{on a bike}} through various streets. Towards {{the beginning of the}} video, an elderly lady <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> singer as she steers with a small puppy in her bicycle basket.|$|E
500|$|The Distrest Poet is an oil {{painting}} produced sometime around 1736 by the British artist William Hogarth. Reproduced as an etching and engraving, {{it was published}} in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740. The scene was probably inspired by Alexander Pope's satirical poem The Dunciad. [...] It depicts a scene in a small, dingy attic room where a poet sits at his desk in the dormer and, scratching his head, <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> papers on the desk before him, evidently looking for inspiration to complete the poem he is writing. [...] Near him sits his wife darning clothes, surprised by the entrance of a milkmaid, who impatiently demands payment of debts.|$|E
500|$|She {{then walks}} past several people, dances with several {{men and women}} in white and black suits and dresses, as the second chorus begins. Beyoncé and the dancers perform a dance routine together, and soon she meets a man, who dances with her. A {{particular}} scene shows all the dancers crouch down to the floor, and follow Beyoncé as she walks, before she blows them back. [...] The bridge starts, and the video moves to Beyoncé in a red room, where she and her dancers dance in short skirts, fishnets and black sparkling dresses. The group is later dance in the red and white rooms together. Leading into the final chorus, Beyoncé dances back in the room with the dancers, while Rowland, Williams and her sister sit on a black couch. As the video ends, Beyoncé {{stands in front of the}} mirror she was at the start and fades to black as she <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer through it.|$|E

500|$|A free copy {{from some}} two generations later {{is in the}} Prado in Madrid. This is in a {{vertical}} format and measures 47 x 36cm. [...] A large tree is added at the left, and the foreground rocks extended higher. [...] The landscape is somewhat different, and reflects the world landscape style of Joachim Patinir, to whom the painting has been attributed in the past. [...] This was largely because the jagged peaks in the distance {{have been added to}} and altered to Patinir's trademark depiction of the distinctive landscape of Dinant, his hometown. This panel was attributed by Max Jakob Friedländer to a [...] "Master of Hoogstraten", an anonymous follower of Quentin Massys, and dated around 1510. [...] The awkwardness of the figures has been rectified, the placement of his feet and knees [...] "made more rational" [...] according to Rishel, but St Francis <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> apparition. Another copy, placed tentatively in Brussels c.1500, is probably a copy of the Turin version.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} heavily derided by critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard panned it as [...] "even more {{abhorrent}} than the song." [...] While acknowledging that the album's previous videos were [...] "excellent", {{he pointed out}} that the [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] video [...] "tries to do nothing. Its laziness is demonstrated in the first 21 seconds, during which Lavigne holds a plush stack of cupcakes, shakes her hips, <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cupcakes, bounces her shoulders, and then, when she sings the line 'Someone chuck a cupcake at me'... tosses the fake cupcakes at the camera, her lip movement not matching up to the backing track whatsoever." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine called it [...] "truly eyebrow-raising, taking cultural mis-appropriation to cringe-inducing levels." [...] The Independent suggested that [...] "'Hello Kitty' will make your eyes and ears bleed", while Jezebel wrote: [...] "It looks like what would happen if someone scraped off the diseased underbelly of American pop culture from 2004-2010 and sprinkled it generously over a festering pile of garbage." ...|$|E
500|$|Artists, however, do not {{necessarily}} take geometry literally. As Douglas Hofstadter writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, Gödel, Escher, Bach, by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: [...] "The difference between an Escher drawing and non-Euclidean geometry {{is that in the}} latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pictures." [...] Hofstadter discusses the seemingly paradoxical lithograph Print Gallery by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a [...] "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" [...] to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical. The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and Hendrik Lenstra, who propose that it could contain a Droste effect copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.|$|E

500|$|On {{the way to}} the Beechcraft, Eko and Charlie find a {{parachute}} in a tree, which leads to the corpse of a Nigerian man dressed as a priest that Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) had previously found. When Eko sees the dead man's gold tooth, he tells Charlie that the man [...] "saved his life." [...] Charlie loses his way, and Mr. Eko tells him to climb a tree. As he is above the tree, explosions and a cloud of black smoke emerge from the jungle. It confronts him whilst flashing images to him of his past. Mr. Eko stands his ground, despite Charlie telling him to run, and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> smoke before it pulls back and disappears. Eko and Charlie then find the plane, inside which Eko finds another corpse which Eko recognizes as Yemi. After taking the cross from Yemi's body, Eko tells Charlie that it is his brother, gives Charlie a Virgin Mary statue [...] "for the one [...] broke" [...] and sets the plane on fire. Charlie asks Eko if he is a priest himself, and as Eko puts the cross around his neck he replies [...] "Yes, I am." [...] The two then recite Psalm 23 from the Old Testament as the plane burns.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E
2500|$|Utamaro {{depicts the}} courtesan Hanaōgi of the Ōgiya (...) as she composes a letter, writing brush held {{to her cheek}} as she <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> paper deep in thought. [...] The Ōgiya was a large, {{long-established}} shop in Yoshiwara, and Hanaōgi built her reputation in the 1780s for her beauty and her skills in singing, playing the koto, the tea ceremony, the Chinese classics, and incense.|$|E
