5|$|In {{addition}} to a cash prize, {{the winner of the}} tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949, and informally acquired by the champions for many years before that. The green <b>sport</b> <b>coat</b> is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon {{after the end of the}} tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the spectators. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} named after an {{incident}} at The Pump Room restaurant in Chicago, Illinois. Collins, entering the restaurant with former Led Zeppelin lead vocalist Robert Plant, was denied admittance {{because he did not}} meet the restaurant's dress code of [...] "jacket required" [...] for dinner while Plant was allowed in. Collins was wearing a jacket and argued about it. The maître d'hôtel argued that the jacket was not [...] "proper". Collins {{said in an interview with}} Playboy that he was, at that point, never so mad in his life. After the incident, the singer often appeared on shows such as Late Night with David Letterman and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, denouncing the restaurant and telling his story. The management of the restaurant later sent him a complimentary <b>sport</b> <b>coat</b> and an apology letter, stating that he could come to the restaurant wearing whatever he wanted.|$|E

2500|$|The clothes worn on Miami Vice had a {{significant}} influence on men's fashion. They popularized, if not invented, the [...] "T-shirt under Armani jacket"–style, and popularized Italian men's fashion in the United States. Don Johnson's typical attire of Italian <b>sport</b> <b>coat,</b> T-shirt, white linen pants, and slip-on sockless loafers became a hit. Even fine timepiece manufacturers got in on the action. Crockett initially wore an 18k Rolex Day-Date [...] "President" [...] model in the first season, until Ebel won the contract for the remaining seasons. Similarly, Crockett's perpetually unshaven appearance sparked a minor fashion trend, inspiring men to wear {{a small amount of}} beard stubble, also known as a five o'clock shadow (or [...] "designer stubble") at all times. In an average episode, Crockett and Tubbs wore five to eight outfits, appearing in shades of pink, blue, green, peach, fuchsia, and the show's other [...] "approved" [...] colors. Designers such as Vittorio Ricci, Gianni Versace, and Hugo Boss were consulted in keeping the male leads looking trendy. Costume designer Bambi Breakstone, who traveled to Milan, Paris, and London in search of new clothes, said that, [...] "The concept of the show is to be on top of all the latest fashion trends in Europe." [...] Jodi Tillen, the costume designer for the first season, along with Michael Mann, set the style. The abundance of pastel colors on the show reflected Miami's Art-deco architecture.|$|E
