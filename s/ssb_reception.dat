J. Baghdady A. SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS IN A LIMITER WITH FEEDFORWARD A theoretical study of a feedforward system excited by a signal plus random noise has been completed. The signal is assumed to be a constant-amplitude sinusoid, and the noise is considered to be narrow-band Gaussian with a rectangular spectral density centered on the signal frequency. Two models for the limiter characteristic have been chosen: (a) a vth-law detector, in which the output, y(t), is related to the input, x(t), by y(t) = axV(t) and (b) the error-function limiter, in which y(t) = a erf x(t) The limiter is spanned by a feedforward amplifier with gain Gff, and the signals from the two paths are combined so that subtraction occurs. The system is followed by a bandpass filter with a rectangular characteristic and a bandwidth equal to the width of the input noise spectrum. A parameter, K, which is the ratio of the amplifier output to the limiter output when the input is an undisturbed sinusoid, is chosen...|$|E
50|$|Typically, a {{communications}} receiver {{is of the}} superheterodyne type in double, triple or, more rarely, quad conversion. It features multiple RF and IF amplification stages and may {{have at least one}} IF stage that is crystal controlled. It usually has a BFO and a product detector for <b>SSB</b> and CW <b>reception.</b> The frequency coverage of receivers of this type is typically in the range of 500 kHz to 30 MHz. Communication receivers are suited for operation near powerful transmitting facilities and so must have good internal shielding, and effective front-end filtering. They have design features to provide high selectivity and stability. Rejection of unwanted signals (images, intermodulation products) will typically be much greater than a consumer-type general coverage or broadcast receiver.|$|R
