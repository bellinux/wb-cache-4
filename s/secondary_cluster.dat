A novel application of desorption/ionization methods of mass spectrometry, e. g. plasma desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS), is the analysis of both the composition and structure of solid materials in one experiment. Cluster ions emitted from the impact of a 252 Cf fission fragment on a surface may represent a "view" of the solid construction over atomic distances if composed of atoms from adjacent sites in the surface. A clearer understanding of the mechanism of <b>secondary</b> <b>cluster</b> ion formation is necessary to evaluate the usefulness of PDMS as a surface characterization technique. The aim of this research was to use metal acetate samples to study <b>secondary</b> <b>cluster</b> ion formation in PDMS. In two sets of experiments, metal acetates from period IV and group IIB of the periodic table were used to measure the influence on cluster formation by the ground state electronic configuration and the ionic size, respectively, of the metal constituent. Relative yields for homologous negative and positive <b>secondary</b> <b>cluster</b> ions were determined and compared to thermochemical properties of the metal ion or the metal acetate molecule (AHf and lattice energy). Secondary ions in negative PDMS mass spectra attributable to a gas phase recombination formation mechanism follow trends predicted by these thermochemical properties. Another series of cluster ions, however, with the composition [M(Ac) 2]Ac-(where Ac = acetate) does not follow the same trends, indicating possible formation via intact emission from the solid surface. Positive <b>secondary</b> <b>cluster</b> ions showed differences from the negative ions both in the relative yield distribution and the types of ions observed. Positive cluster ions from metal acetates from the fourth period of the periodic table were mainly metal oxides. On the other hand, positive clusters ions from the group IIB of the periodic table were mainly mirror images of the negative spectra. These differences suggest that the bonding characteristics of the metal ion {{play an important role in}} the <b>secondary</b> <b>cluster</b> ion formation process...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hemorrhagic fever with renal {{syndrome}} (HFRS) {{is highly}} endemic in mainland China, where human cases account for 90 % {{of the total}} global cases. Zibo City {{is one of the}} most serious affected areas in Shandong Province China with the HFRS incidence increasing sharply from 2009 to 2012. However, the hotspots of HFRS in Zibo remained unclear. Thus, a spatial analysis was conducted with the aim to explore the spatial, spatial-temporal and seasonal patterns of HFRS in Zibo from 2009 to 2012, and to provide guidance for formulating regional prevention and control strategies. Methods: The study was based on the reported cases of HFRS from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Annualized incidence maps and seasonal incidence maps were produced to analyze the spatial and seasonal distribution of HFRS in Zibo City. Then spatial scan statistics and space-time scan statistics were conducted to identify clusters of HFRS. Results: There were 200 cases reported in Zibo City during the 4 -year study period. One most likely cluster and one <b>secondary</b> <b>cluster</b> for high incidence of HFRS were identified by the space-time analysis. And the most likely cluster was found to exist at Yiyuan County in October to December 2012. The human infections in the fall and winter reflected a seasonal characteristic pattern of Hantaan virus (HTNV) transmission. The <b>secondary</b> <b>cluster</b> was detected at the center of Zibo in May to June 2009, presenting a seasonal characteristic of Seoul virus (SEOV) transmission.

The aim {{was to assess the}} contribution of Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) to the distribution of tuberculosis and to provide information for the improvement of the National Tuberculosis Program. We investigated the role of KAP to distribution patterns of pulmonary tuberculosis in Antananarivo. First, we performed spatial scanning of tuberculosis aggregation among permanent cases resident in Antananarivo Urban Township using the Kulldorff method, and then we carried out a quantitative study on KAP, involving TB patients. The KAP study in the population was based on qualitative methods with focus groups. The disease still clusters in the same districts identified in the previous study. The principal cluster covered 22 neighborhoods. Most of them are part of the first district. A <b>secondary</b> <b>cluster</b> was found, involving 18 neighborhoods in the sixth district and two neighborhoods in the fifth.

Knowledge about TB was limited to that acquired at school or from relatives with TB. The attitude and practices of patients and the population in general indicated that there is still a stigma attached to tuberculosis.

As TB is a major public health problem in China, spatial analysis could be applied to detect geographic distribution of TB clusters for targeted intervention on TB epidemics. Methods: Spatial analysis was applied for detecting TB clusters on county-based TB notification data in the national notifiable infectious disease case reporting surveillance system from 2005 to 2011. Two indicators of TB epidemic were used including new sputum smear-positive (SS+) notification rate and total TB notification rate. Global Moran’s I by ArcGIS was used to assess whether TB clustering and its trend were significant. SaTScan software that used the retrospective space-time analysis and Possion probability model was utilized to identify geographic areas and time period of potential clusters with notification rates on county-level from 2005 to 2011. Results: Two indicators of TB notification had presented significant spatial autocorrelation globally each year (p< 0. 01). Global Moran’s I of total TB notification rate had positive trend as time went by (t= 6. 87, p< 0. 01). The most likely clusters of two indicators had similar spatial distribution and size in the south-central regions of China from 2006 to 2008, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>clusters</b> in two regions: northeastern China and western China.

In this study, zirconia nanoparticles have been modified with a series of carboxylic acids {{so that they can be}} dispersed in polar protic/aprotic solvents or nonpolar organic solvents as transparent colloidal sols. The dispersed state in these solvents was characterized by SAXS and SANS. In most cases, the transparent sol consists of "soft" <b>secondary</b> <b>clusters</b> generated from the ZrO 2 nanoparticles. The size and fractal structure of the dispersed clusters varied with the acid modifier.

A semiautomated analysis pipeline was constructed to download, parse, assemble, align, combine, and build trees from {{a pool of}} 11, 881 sequences. Initial steps included all-against-all BLAST similarity searches coupled with assembly, using a novel strategy for building length-homogeneous primary sequence clusters. This was followed by a combination of global and local alignment protocols to build larger <b>secondary</b> <b>clusters</b> of locally aligned sequences, thus taking into account the dramatic differences in length of the heterogeneous coding and noncoding sequence data present in GenBank. Next, clusters were checked for the presence of duplicate genes and other potentially misleading sequences and examined for combinability with other clusters on the basis of taxon overlap. Finally, two supermatrices were constructed: a "sparse" matrix based on the primary clusters alone (1794 taxa x 53, 977 characters), and a somewhat more "dense " matrix based on the <b>secondary</b> <b>clusters</b> (2228 taxa x 33, 168 characters). Both matrices were very sparse, with 95 % of their cells containing gaps or question marks. These were subjected to extensive heuristic parsimony analyses using deterministic and stochastic heuristics, including bootstrap analyses.
