These bacteria are carried by fleas, which can be transferred to humans through contact with rats. Flea bites carry the disease into the lymphatic system, through which it makes {{its way to the}} lymph nodes. Here the bacteria multiply and form swellings called buboes, from which the term bubonic plague is derived. After three or four days the bacteria enter the bloodstream, and infect organs such as the spleen and the lungs. The patient will then normally die after a few days. A different strain of the disease is pneumonic plague, where the bacteria become airborne and enter directly into the patient's lungs. This strain is far more virulent, as it spreads directly from person to person. These types of infection probably both played a significant part in the Black Death, while a third strain was more rare. This is the <b>septicaemic</b> <b>plague,</b> where the flea bite carries the bacteria directly into the blood stream, and death occurs very rapidly.|$|E

5|$|Because fleas carry plague, {{they have}} seen service as a {{biological}} weapon. During World War II, the Japanese army dropped fleas infested with Y. pestis in China. The bubonic and <b>septicaemic</b> <b>plagues</b> are the most probable form of the plague that would spread {{as a result of}} a bioterrorism attack that used fleas as a vector.|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} types of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases in type II FAS are called FabB, FabF, and FabH synthases. FabH catalyzes the quintessential ketoacyl synthase reaction with malonyl ACP and acetyl CoA. FabB and FabF catalyze other related reactions. Given that their function is necessary for proper biological function surrounding lipoprotein, phospholipid, and lipopolysaccharide synthesis, they have become a target in antibacterial drug creation. Bacteria {{has the ability to}} adapt to its environment; bacteria can alter the phospholipid composition of its membrane to best suit the environment, so inhibiting this pathway is integral in disrupting bacterial proliferation. By studying Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic, pneumonic, and <b>septicaemic</b> <b>plagues,</b> researchers have shown that FabB, FabF, and FabH can theoretically all be inhibited by the same drug due to similarities in their binding sites. However, such a drug has not yet been developed. Cerulenin, a molecule that appears to inhibit by mimicking the “condensation transition state” can only inhibit B or F, but not H. Another molecule, thiolactomycin, which mimics malonyl ACP in the active site, can ony inhibit FabB. Lastly, platensimycin also has possible antibiotic use due to its inhibition of FabF.|$|R
50|$|Septicemic (or <b>septicaemic)</b> <b>plague</b> {{is one of}} {{the three}} main forms of plague. It is caused by Yersinia pestis, a gram-negative species of bacterium. Septicemic plague is a {{life-threatening}} infection of the blood, most commonly spread by bites from infected fleas.|$|E
50|$|Pneumonic plague can {{be caused}} in two ways: primary, which results from the {{inhalation}} of aerosolised plague bacteria, or secondary, when <b>septicaemic</b> <b>plague</b> spreads into lung tissue from the bloodstream. Pneumonic plague is not exclusively vector-borne like bubonic plague; instead it can be spread from person to person. There have been cases of pneumonic plague resulting from the dissection or handling of contaminated animal tissue. This is one type of the plague {{formerly known as the}} Black Death.|$|E

Plague is a disease caused by Yersinia pestis, a gram negative coccobacillus belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. It has a characteristic bipolar staining with aniline dyes and appears as a “safety pin ” under microscopy. It has low resistance to environmental factors that it is readily killed by sunlight, high temperatures, desiccation, and ordinary disinfectants or preparation containing chlorine. (1, 2) Clinical Manifestation 3. Plague infection in human commonly manifests as three clinical forms including bubonic plague, <b>septicaemic</b> <b>plague,</b> and pneumonic plague. Bubonic plague, the commonest form, refers to the lymphadenitis which develops in the lymph nodes that drain the site of flea bite. <b>Septicaemic</b> <b>plague</b> refers to bloodstream dissemination of th...|$|E
40|$|The human {{pathogens}} Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica cause enterocolitis, while Yersinia pestis {{is responsible}} for pneumonic, bubonic, and <b>septicaemic</b> <b>plague.</b> All three share an infection strategy that relies on a virulence factor arsenal {{to enable them to}} enter, adhere to, and colonise the host while evading host defences to avoid untimely clearance. Their arsenal includes a number of adhesins that allow the invading pathogens to establish a foothold in the host and to adhere to specific tissues later during infection. When the host innate immune system has been activated, all three pathogens produce a structure analogous to a hypodermic needle. In conjunction with the translocon, which forms a pore in the host membrane, the channel that is formed enables the transfer of six ‘effector’ proteins into the host cell cytoplasm. These proteins mimic host cell proteins but are more efficient than their native counterparts at modifying the host cell cytoskeleton, triggering the host cell suicide response. Such a sophisticated arsenal ensures that yersiniae maintain the upper hand despite the best efforts of the host to counteract the infecting pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Ketoacyl-acyl {{carrier protein}} reductases (FabG) are ubiquitously {{expressed}} enzymes that catalyse {{the reduction of}} acyl carrier protein (ACP) linked thioesters within the bacterial type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII) pathway. The products of these enzymes, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, are essential components of the bacterial cell envelope. The FASII reductase enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) {{has been the focus}} of numerous drug discovery efforts, some of which have led to clinical trials, yet few studies have focused on FabG. Like FabI, FabG appears to be essential for survival in many bacteria, similarly indicating the potential of this enzyme as a drug target. FabG enzymes are members of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, and like other SDRs, exhibit highly conserved secondary and tertiary structures, and contain a number of conserved sequence motifs. Here we describe the crystal structures of FabG from Yersinia pestis (YpFabG), the causative agent of bubonic, pneumonic, and <b>septicaemic</b> <b>plague,</b> and three human pandemics. Y. pestis remains endemic in many parts of North America, South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa, and a threat to human health. YpFabG shares a high degree of structural similarity with bacterial homologues, and the ketoreductase domain of the mammalian fatty acid synthase from both Homo sapiens and Sus scrofa. Structural characterisation of YpFabG, and comparison with other bacterial FabGs and the mammalian fatty acid synthase, provides a strong platform for virtual screening of potential inhibitors, rational drug design, and the development of new antimicrobial agents to combat Y. pestis infections...|$|E
