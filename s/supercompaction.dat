40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that multi-stage compaction (<b>supercompaction)</b> (high-force compaction) {{has an important}} role to play in treating metallic LLW. A specialized shear/compactor can produce significant labor and burial cost savings, as well as better operational safety and environmental protection. A case study is the <b>supercompaction</b> facility presently nearing completion at the DOE East Tennessee Technology Park [...] ETTP [...] (formerly, the K- 25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant) in Oak Ridge. The facility will initially process some 63, 000 tons of mainly metallic materials arising from the D&D clean-up project presently being undertaken by BNFL Inc. for the DOE. These materials cannot be economically recycled and prior to burial disposal will be supercompacted with up to 7 : 1 volume reduction. The paper will confirm progress toward facility handover to production in October 2000. 1.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{to the group of}} low-level, intermediate, mixed and hazardous waste describes the conditioning of intermediate-level mixed waste (dose rate above 10 mSv/h at the surface) from Research Centre Juelich (FZJ). Conditioning of the waste by <b>supercompaction</b> is performed at Research Centre Karlsruhe (FZK). The waste described is radioactive waste arising from research at Juelich. This waste includes specimens and objects from irradiation experiments in the research reactors Merlin (FRJ- 1) and Dido (FRJ- 2) at FZJ. In principle, radioactive waste at Forschungszentrum Juelich GmbH is differentiated by the surface dose rate at the waste package. Up to a surface dose rate of 10 mSv/h, the waste is regarded as low-level. The radioactive waste described here has a surface dose rate above 10 mSv/h. Waste up to 10 mSv/h is conditioned at the Juelich site according to different conditioning methods. The intermediate-level waste can only be conditioned by <b>supercompaction</b> in the processing facility for intermediate-level waste from plant operation at Research Centre Karlsruhe. Research Centre Juelich also uses this waste cell to condition its intermediate-level waste from plant operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this waste {{analysis}} plan is to document the necessary characterization, sampling, screening, analysis, and waste acceptance criteria for waste received at the WRAP Module 1. Waste expected to be received at WRAP Module 1 includes newly generated and retrieved waste. The newly generated waste will undergo verification prior to treatment, storage, or disposal. Retrieved waste from the burial grounds or above ground storage will undergo further characterization (as needed), treatment, <b>supercompaction,</b> and repackagin...|$|E
