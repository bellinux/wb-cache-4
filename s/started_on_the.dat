5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, talk <b>started</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{construction}} of a bridge to cross the Mississippi River at Greenville. In 1936, {{a group called the}} Arkansas-Mississippi-Alabama US 82 Association was formed to raise funds for the bridge. In 1937, Milton C. Smith (the mayor at that time) worked with John A. Fox, (the secretary of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce), to get Congress to pass a law authorizing the bridge. The bill authorizing the bridge was signed into law in August 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1938, Smith applied for money from the Works Progress Administration to fund the estimated $4.5 million it would take to build the bridge. The Works Progress Administration agreed to the proposal in September 1938, and construction <b>started</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge a few months later.|$|E

To {{allow for}} {{the extension of the}} line south from Times Square, the entire western wall of the subway between 43rd Street and 44th Street was removed, all while service continued uninterrupted. The line was mostly built in an open-cut, excluding the segments within the limits of Battery Park, the widened portions of Varick Street, and the new Varick and Seventh Avenue Extensions. Filled in ground was found south of Varick Street along Greenwich Street, which approximately marked the old shore line of the Hudson River {{during the time of the}} American Revolution. Many buildings had to be underpinned during the construction of the line, especially those on the lower sections through Greenwich Street.|$|E
