5|$|In 1910 Habsburg was {{extensively}} modernized and lightened: {{one of her}} superstructure decks {{removed to}} reduce weight. In 1911, her <b>sister</b> <b>ship,</b> Árpád underwent the same renovations. Following these renovations, Habsburg and her sister ships were converted to coastal defense vessels.|$|E
5|$|Like her <b>sister</b> <b>ship</b> , Illinois {{was still}} under {{construction}} {{at the end of}} World War II. She was canceled in August 1945, but her hull remained as a parts hulk until she was broken up in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū {{was one of}} {{two large}} {{carriers}} approved for construction under the 1931–32 Supplementary Program. Originally designed as the <b>sister</b> <b>ship</b> of Sōryū, her design was enlarged and modified in light of the Tomozuru and Fourth Fleet Incidents in 1934–35 that revealed many IJN ships were top-heavy, unstable and structurally weak. Her forecastle was raised and her hull strengthened. Other changes involved increasing her beam, displacement, and armor protection.|$|E

50|$|Kee Lung is {{the only}} one of her <b>sister</b> <b>ships</b> to be {{equipped}} with LAMPS III system and flight deck strengthened.

5|$|Protecteur was {{decommissioned}} at {{a farewell}} ceremony on 14 May 2015. Plans for replacing Protecteur and her <b>sister</b> <b>ship,</b> Preserver, were first {{brought up in}} 2004. Lack of spare parts for the ship's boiler {{and the fact that}} she is a single-skinned tanker were the main driving points to replacing Protecteur and Preserver.|$|E
5|$|The Kongō-class {{ships were}} redesignated as 3rd-class coast defense ships in 1898 {{although}} they continued their training duties. They played a minor {{role in the}} Russo-Japanese War before they were reclassified as survey ships in 1906. Kongō was stricken from the Navy List in 1909 and sold the next year for scrap. Hiei was struck from the Navy List two years after her <b>sister</b> <b>ship</b> and was sold before 25 March 1912.|$|E
5|$|This arrangement, however, left Wyoming—the third-most {{powerful}} ship of the division—as {{the spare}} ship because she lacked a matched pair. As a result, Rodman requested that Delaware—the oldest {{ship in the}} division—be replaced with Wyomings <b>sister</b> <b>ship</b> , leaving Florida as the spare. Arkansas, however, did not join Battleship Division Nine until 29 July 1918. Delaware sailed from Scapa Flow for the United States the next day.|$|E

5|$|Tiger was {{the sole}} battlecruiser {{authorised}} in the 1911–12 Naval Programme. According to naval historian Siegfried Breyer, a <b>sister</b> <b>ship</b> named Leopard was considered in the 1912–13 Programme and deferred until 1914 as a sixth member of the , {{but there is no}} record of any additional battlecruiser being provided for in any naval estimates before 1914.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with her}} <b>sister</b> <b>ship,</b> , she bombarded German fortifications in October–November 1914 {{during the final}} stage of the Battle of Tsingtao. The ship was present in Yokosuka on 8 January 1915 when the victorious Second Squadron {{returned}} to Japan after the Battle of Tsingtao. She was assigned to the First Squadron from 1915–1917 and refitted that latter year.|$|E
5|$|U-2 {{was built}} {{as part of}} a plan by the Austro-Hungarian Navy to {{competitively}} evaluate foreign submarine designs from Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland. The Austro-Hungarian Navy ordered plans for U-2 (and <b>sister</b> <b>ship</b> U-1) in 1906 from the Lake Torpedo Boat Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut. U-2 was built at the Pola Navy Yard and was launched on 3 April 1909.|$|E

50|$|Like her <b>sister</b> <b>ships,</b> Tian Dan was {{constructed}} by China SB Corp., at its primary shipyard in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, Republic of China. But this ship {{is different from}} her <b>sister</b> <b>ships</b> by not having the two Bofors 40mm/L70 guns installed. Tian Dan is named after Tian Dan, a general of the Warring States period.|$|R

5|$|U-3 {{was built}} {{as part of}} a plan by the Austro-Hungarian Navy to {{competitively}} evaluate foreign submarine designs from Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland. The Austro-Hungarian Navy authorized the construction of U-3 (and <b>sister</b> <b>ship,</b> U-4) in 1906 by Germaniawerft of Kiel, Germany. U-3 was laid down on 12 March 1907 and launched on 20 August 1908. After completion, she was towed via Gibraltar to Pola, where she arrived on 24 January 1909.|$|E
5|$|When the Italo-Turkish War of 191112 {{began on}} 29 September 1911, Pisa was the {{flagship}} of Rear-Admiral Ernesto Presbitero, {{commander of the}} 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. Pisa and her <b>sister</b> <b>ship,</b> , were among the ships selected for the initial blockade of Tripoli. On 2 October, the Training Division relieved the 1st Squadron in blockade duty, allowing them to join the main Italian fleet.|$|E
5|$|Yorks {{design was}} based on the earlier County classes but was {{intended}} to be smaller and cheaper, although better armoured. She was easily distinguishable from her <b>sister</b> <b>ship,</b> , as the latter had straight masts and funnels, while those of York were angled to the rear. In addition, York also had a very tall bridge designed to clear the aircraft catapult originally planned to be carried on the superfiring ('B') gun turret forward.|$|E

50|$|T. Mariotti {{constructed}} the ship at their shipyard in Genoa, Italy. Seabourn Quest was built using same design as her preceding <b>sister</b> <b>ships,</b> the Seabourn Odyssey and Seabourn Sojourn.

5|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army—needing transports to get its men and materiel to France—had a select committee of shipping executives pore over registries of American shipping. The committee selected Montanan, her <b>sister</b> <b>ship</b> Dakotan, and 12 other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough fuel in their s for transatlantic crossings, and, most importantly, were in port or not far at sea. After Montanan discharged her last load of cargo, she was officially {{handed over to the}} Army on 29 May.|$|E
5|$|Crusader {{was built}} by the Melbourne Harbour Trust at Williamstown Dockyard. She was the largest {{all-welded}} steel vessel to have been constructed in Australia at the time, and her final price of £124,000 was considerably more than Steele's deliberate underestimate. The ship was launched on 8 August 1945 after being named by Steele's wife, and later became the largest ship to be commissioned by the Australian Army during World War II. Construction of a <b>sister</b> <b>ship,</b> to be called AV2768 Corsair, was also begun, but this ship was cancelled when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|Directly after commissioning, König {{conducted}} sea trials, {{which were}} completed by 23 November 1914. Her crew consisted of 41 officers and 1,095 enlisted men. Afterward, {{the ship was}} attached to the V Division of the IIIBattle Squadron of the German High Seas Fleet, where she would later be joined by her sister ships. On 9 December, König ran aground in the Wilhelmshaven roadstead. Her <b>sister</b> <b>ship</b> Grosser Kurfürst, following right behind, rammed her stern and caused some minor damage. König was then freed from the bottom and taken back to Wilhelmshaven; repair work lasted until 2 January 1915.|$|E
