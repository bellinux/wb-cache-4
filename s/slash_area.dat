40|$|Field {{measurements}} of moisture distribution in organic layers under mature stands and in exposed <b>slash</b> <b>areas,</b> {{and the effect}} of additional precipitation are presented and discussed. Implications of the moisture distribution to control of prescribed fires and their relation to the Stored Moisture Index and the Drought Code of the Forest Fire Behaviour system are presented in the form of guidelines for initiating the annual prescribed burning program...|$|R
50|$|Heliocybe is an agaric genus closely allied to Neolentinus and the bracket fungus, Gloeophyllum, all {{of which}} cause brown rot of wood. Heliocybe sulcata, the type and sole species, is {{characterized}} by thumb-sized, tough, revivable, often dried, mushroom fruitbodies, with a tanned symmetric pileus that is radially cracked into a cartoon sun-like pattern of arranged scales and ridges, distant serrated lamellae, and a scaly central stipe. Microscopically it differs from Neolentinus {{by the absence of}} clamp connections. Like Neolentinus, it produces abundant, conspicuous pleurocystidia. Heliocybe sulcata typically fruits on decorticated, sun-dried and cracked wood, such as fence posts and rails, vineyard trellises in Europe, branches in <b>slash</b> <b>areas,</b> and semi-arid areas such on sagebrush or on naio branches in rain shadow areas of Hawaii, or in open pine forests.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{woodland}} manipulation on forage phytomass was studied in a Caatinga of Petrolina, PE, Brazil. There were five treatments: 1) Control of native vegetation; 2) Thinning 1 / 3 of shrub canopy cover; 3) Thining 2 / 3 of shrub cover; 4) Caatinga slashing; and 5) Treatment 4 + burning. Slashing and burning {{were carried out}} in September/ 84, and thinning done in January/ 85. Herbaceous mass in the control was 528 kg/ha, half grasses and half forbs, in the only evaluation made (May/ 85). The <b>slashed</b> <b>area</b> had a higher grass mass than the control (675 vs 251 kg/ha). Forb mass increased from treatment 1 to 5, but only these two were significantly different (1, 609 vs 277 kg/ha). Neoglaziovia variegata showed the opposite trend, decreasing from treatment 1 to 5 (1, 413 vs 25 kg/ha). Slashing was superior to the other treatments in shrub mass, including slashing and burning (706 vs 317 kg/ha), and caused {{an increase in the}} tree stratum forage mass over the other treatments (236 vs 50 - 78 kg/ha), due to coppicing...|$|R
50|$|The {{crop area}} used for jhum {{cultivation}} rotates in Mizoram; that is, the <b>area</b> <b>slashed</b> and burnt for a crop is abandoned {{for a few}} years and then jhumias return to slash and burn the same plot after a few years of non-use. The primary reasons for cyclical jhum cultivation includes, according to Goswami et al., personal, economic, social and physical. Jhum cultivation practice offers low crop yields and is a threat to the biome of Mizoram; they suggest increased government institutional support, shift to higher income horticultural crops, assured supply of affordable food staples for survival as means to further reduce jhum cultivation.|$|R
50|$|The {{start of}} Nepalese farmers growing broom grass has {{increased}} the local biodiversity in the communities. Now that the farmers have to tie up their livestock since they feed on the broom grass, other plant species in the area can successfully regrow and multiply. Broom grass that have been planted in <b>areas</b> where <b>slash</b> and burn cultivation took place has caused tree stumps to grow branches and other vegetation to grow back. Endangered animals such as the Barking Deer and Monkey are now reappearing in the infertile <b>slash</b> and burn <b>areas</b> where they once lived, as the broom grass used to rehabilitate the soil helps promote the growth of other vegetation the animals use for food. Broom grass does not compete for land with cereal crops {{so they can be}} grown simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} aspen regeneration on decking {{areas as}} affected by season of log deck building {{and duration of}} log storage; as well as root wounding, soil com- paction, and slash depth. On former decking areas that were built after a summer harvest, aspen regeneration was 50 % lower and root death 35 % greater compared to former decking areas of a fall harvest. Duration of log storage after a fall harvest {{had little effect on}} aspen regeneration; short (1. 5 – 3 months) or long (11 months) storage resulted in similar regeneration. Slash load was greatly increased on decking areas while root wounding and soil bulk density were only slightly increased compared to controls. For best management practices, log storage after summer harvest should be avoided especially when logs are kept over the growing period when suckering occurs. Additionally, removing the inter- woven mat of <b>slash</b> covering decking <b>areas</b> and limiting machine traffic to frozen soil will ensure vigorous suckering...|$|R
50|$|New England is a Northeastern {{region of}} the United States {{bordering}} the Maritime Provinces of Canada and portions of Quebec in the north. It includes the six states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, with its cultural capital Boston, founded in 1630. The Native American cuisine {{became part of the}} cookery style that the early colonists brought with them. Tribes like the Nipmuck, Wampanoag, and other Algonquian cultures were noted for <b>slashing</b> and burning <b>areas</b> to create meadows and bogs that would attract animals like moose and deer, but also encourage the growth of plants like black raspberries, blueberries, and cranberries. In the forest they would have collected nuts of species like the shagbark hickory, American hazel, and American chestnuts and fruits like wild grapes and black cherries. All of these eventually showed up in the kitchens of colonial New England women and many were sent back to England and other portions of Europe to be catalogued by scientists, collectors, and horticulturalists.|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the recolonization by a Sudano-Sahelian rodent community of an <b>area</b> <b>slashed</b> and {{burned in the}} middle of the dry season (Gonse Forest in Burkina Faso). A series of abundance cycles occurred. The first began with the wet season and the arrival of a succession of four species: Taterillus gracilis, Tatera guineae, Nannomys sp. and Mastomys erythroleucus. Taterillus gracilis appeared to be the least demanding species. It was sexually active whatever the season and took advantage of reduced competition among species on the burned tracts. Tatera guineae also extended its spatial distribution but failed to reproduce. Nannomys sp. rapidly increased after the first rains. Although generally held to be the most prolific and opportunistic of the species involved, M. erythroleucus only found conditions amenable to its colonization late on. The timing of the disruption and whether or not it coincides with the reproductive period and the mobility phase of each species are decisive factors. This information is useful for a clearer understanding of the dynamics of each species and for evaluating the risk and probable locations of outbreaks of certain species...|$|R
5000|$|Lake Of The Woods County {{was known}} for its logging {{industry}} during the early 1900s. Similar to other forest fires, this disaster took place over dry, harvested land which was vulnerable to potential fire destruction. Homesteaders earned their money by cutting and selling their wood to various buyers. The main workforce employing {{the majority of the}} area was the logging industry. Several large sawmills were established early on at Rainy River, Baudette and Spooner on the bay of the Baudette river. Timber was floated down the tributaries of the Rainy River to the mills or hauled to the various railroad depots for shipment via rail. [...] When the logging industry was at its peak, one could walk across the bay due to the large amount of logs covering the bay area. Most of the homesteads were still covered with timber. What fields there were, were small and used to grow enough grain for animal feed and for household use. This large tract of forest, broken up with small fields and <b>slash</b> filled cut-over <b>areas</b> was a textbook fuel arrangement for a large conflagration to develop.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this piece is to provide {{commentary}} of an article, Child Welfare Waivers: The Stakes for Your State, that discusses the recent reauthorization of the Title IV-E Child Welfare Waivers. The article {{provides an overview of}} funds available to the states for child welfare programs and their intended purpose and restrictions placed on use. As structured, the present system rewards states monetarily for maintaining foster care. Research from waiver programs shows promising results for improved outcomes at the same or lower financial cost by utilizing safe, proven alternatives to the current foster care system. Waiver funds also protect the financial commitment to child welfare because state legislative budget <b>slashing</b> in this <b>area</b> will result in the loss of Federal funding. The independent analysis required with the grant of a waiver must be maintained to provide ongoing analysis and oversight of the increase spending flexibility. Stakeholders must be aware of the program and its results and use these funds as an opportunity to assess new concepts and apply programs best suited to the needs of children in their state. Allowing those “on the ground” to determine appropriate programming and careful result assessment may be the best means for protecting children, preserving families and doing both in a manner that makes the most efficient use of available resources...|$|R
40|$|Ma {{village is}} one of the 15 villages of Vinh Kien commune, Yen Binh district, Yen Bai {{province}} in the northern mountainous region of Viet Nam. Ma village was selected as a site for the Climate Smart Village (CSV) development under the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). It has a topography, landscape and climate conditions representing most in the region and faces increasing challenges caused by climate variability, natural resources degradation, and environmental pollution. The village’s current production systems have low sustainability and profits. Maize and cassava are largely produced in dominant monoculture systems on sloping lands representing most of the village’s total arable lands, while rice is planted in a small <b>area.</b> <b>Slash</b> and burn practices are used largely in sloping lands, while unbalanced fertilizer levels (often with too much nitrogen) are applied for all the crops, and integrated pest management is yet to be promoted. All these have caused high intensity soil erosion, land degradation, and GHG emission. In addition, improper waste management, particularly from cassava, has resulted in severe water pollution in all river and lake systems. Organizations are present to support Ma village and the province in the areas of agriculture, forestry, food security, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. However, coordination between organizations remains poor. The local systems currently do not have the capacity to solve the multiple problems in the village. Human and financial resources. Inadequate. Support from CCAFS in important to help the village address the increasing problems caused by climate change, water pollution, soil erosion, and land degradation...|$|R
