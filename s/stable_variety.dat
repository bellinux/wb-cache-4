Upon the dilemma, the Soccer Centre committee has decided to construct a more <b>stable</b> <b>variety</b> of roof, with other options consisting of not to rebuild the expansion at all and keep the Subway Soccer Centre as a single structure. According to Perry Logan, the general manager of the Soccer Centre, the collapse was most likely caused by an anchor supporting the bubble collapsing before carving a rip in the material.

Given any projective space where G acts linearly, we construct a moduli space for <b>stable</b> spherical <b>varieties</b> over, that is, pairs (X,f), where X is a <b>stable</b> spherical <b>variety</b> and f : X → is a finite equivariant morphism. This space is projective, and its irreducible components are rational. It generalizes the moduli space of pairs (X,D), where X is a <b>stable</b> toric <b>variety</b> and D is an effective ample Cartier divisor on X which contains no orbit. The equivariant automorphism group of acts on our moduli space; the spherical varieties over and their stable limits form only finitely many orbits.

The yield of N 11 at each site was plotted against an estimate of potential yield derived from the yield of NCo 376.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new approach}} to the definition of the moduli functor of stable varieties. While there is wide agreement as to what classes of varieties should appear, the notion of a family of stable surfaces is quite subtle, as key numerical invariants may fail to be constant in flat families. Our approach is to add natural stack structure to stable varieties. For example, given a canonical model we take the global-quotient stack structure arising from its realization as Proj of the canonical ring. Deformations of the stack structure preserve key numerical invariants of the <b>stable</b> <b>variety,</b> including the top self-intersection of the canonical divisor. This approach yields a transparent construction of the moduli stack of stable varieties as a global quotient of a suitable Hilbert scheme of weighted projective stacks. Comment: 31 page...|$|E

The goal {{of this paper is to}} investigate variability and stability of nitrogen harvest index of twelve bread wheat genotypes, on three nitrogen levels. ANOVA showed that nitrogen harvest index was mostly under influence of the year x genotype interaction, year of investigation and genotype, and in the smallest amount of the nitrogen rate. Increasing doses of nitrogen did not lead to increased nitrogen harvest index. AMMI analysis showed that most genotypes differed in both the main effect and in GxE interaction. The highest stability i. e. the smallest interaction effect, was found in varieties Axis, Ilona, Sonata and Renan on N 0 rate, and in varieties Malyska, Petrana, Axis and Evropa 90 on N 100 rate.

40|$|To {{study the}} grain yield {{stability}} of winter type canola cultivars (Brassica napus L.) in multiple environments, 18 winter type canola cultivars were evaluated {{in a complete}} randomized block design with four replications. The {{study was conducted in}} two years and eight cold and temperate regions of Iran. Simple and combined analysis of variance revealed significant differences among genotypes. Moreover, combined analysis of variance displayed significant differences in genotype × location and location × year interactions. Four first interaction principle components (IPCs) were involved in genotype × environment variation (over 75 % of G×E interaction). Mean grain yield comparison of genotypes showed that Ebonite, ARC- 5 and Elite were the three high yielding varieties (3436, 3338 and 3244 kg ha- 1, respectively) on the other hand Opera, Okapi and Licord produced 2698, 2816 and 2823 kg ha- 1 grain yield, respectively and were classified as low ranking genotypes. Bi-plot graph of first principle component against grain yield showed that Geronimo, Modena and Sunday (having the lowest principle component) could be grouped as <b>stable</b> <b>varieties.</b> However, Ebonite and ARC- 5 were recognized as the most unstable genotypes.

Using the HPSG formalism, we develop computational lexicons for Hindi and English, and explore how these can be merged to obtain a fused-lect lexicon. We consider the Hindi-English Code Switching variety (HECS), a <b>stable</b> <b>variety</b> that has resulted from contact between these languages. HECS uses words and larger phrasal constituents from one language with the syntax of the other, with the matrix language being predominantly Hindi. The grammar developed here captures this mixing of the two languages {{in terms of a}} unified lexicon that mixes pure English, pure Hindi, and cross-referenced lexical structures based on synset information for the entries. The construct of a hinge word is proposed to capture the cross-linguistic linkages which preserve the HPSG-based head-subcategory schema of the source lexicons.

The experimental design was randomized complete blocks with four replications in these three years. The combined analysis of variance indicated significant difference among genotypes, for the traits studied. This indicates genetic variation among genotypes understudy.

Our main result says that X admits a Kahler-Einstein metric iff X has semi-log canonical singularities i. e. iff X is a <b>stable</b> <b>variety</b> {{in the sense}} of Kollar-Shepherd-Barron and Alexeev (whose moduli spaces are known to be compact). By definition a Kahler-Einstein metric in this singular context simply means a Kahler-Einstein on the regular locus of X with volume equal to the algebraic volume of K (X), i. e. the top intersection number of K (X). We also show that such a metric is uniquely determined and extends to define a canonical positive current in c (1) (K (X)). Combined with recent results of Odaka our main result shows that X admits a Kahler-Einstein metric iff X is K-stable, which thus confirms the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture in this general setting of (possibly singular) canonically polarized varieties.

40|$|Administration of a birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine (HepB vaccine) to neonates is recommended to prevent mother-to-infant transmission and chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Although manufacturers recommend HepB vaccine distribution and storage at 2 - 8 degrees C, {{recognition of the}} heat stability {{of hepatitis}} B surface antigen stimulated research into its use after storage at, or exposure to, ambient or high temperatures. Storage of HepB vaccine at ambient temperatures would enable birth dosing for neonates delivered at home in remote areas or at health posts lacking refrigeration. This article reviews the current evidence on the thermostability of HepB vaccine when stored outside the cold chain (OCC). The reports reviewed show that the vaccines studied were safe and effective whether stored cold or OCC. Field and laboratory data also verifies the retained potency of the vaccine after exposure to heat. The attachment of a highly <b>stable</b> <b>variety</b> of a vaccine vial monitor (measuring cumulative exposure to heat) on many HepB vaccines strongly supports policies allowing their storage OCC, when this will benefit birth dose coverage. We recommend that this strategy be introduced to improve birth dose coverage, especially in rural and remote areas. Concurrent monitoring and evaluation should be undertaken to affirm the safe implementation of this strategy, and assess its cost, feasibility and effect on reducing HBV infection rates. Meanwhile, release of manufacturer data verifying the potency of currently available HepB vaccines after exposure to heat will increase confidence {{in the use of}} vaccine vial monitors as a managerial tool during storage of HepB vaccine OCC...|$|E
