40|$|Purpose – In {{order to}} reduce the number of {{injuries}} on construction sites, a European Directive prescribes that the clients shall appoint <b>safety</b> and health <b>coordinators</b> in their projects. The purpose of this paper is to find out who are appointed to be health and <b>safety</b> <b>coordinators</b> for the design and planning phase and what they do in order to prevent injuries on sites. Design/methodology/approach – Since the 1 st of January 2009, there shall be a coordinator for the design and planning phase in Swedish construction projects. Telephone interviews were made with the coordinators in 42 Swedish building projects. Findings – The coordinators’ education and experiences varied widely, as well as their descriptions of their duties: no duties, administration and active injury prevention. The coordinators who were classified as most active had at least one additional leading role in the projects. Research limitations/implications – The study is qualitative for an increased understanding, not a statistical reflection of the coordinator population. Practical implications – The legislation needs to clarify whether the early conceptual phase of the project is included in the coordinator’s commission and whether she/he is supposed to participate in identifying, assessing and reducing risks through design changes. These clarifications will have an influence on when the coordinator should be appointed and what competence she/he needs. Originality/value – The study increases the understanding of how the health and <b>safety</b> <b>coordinators</b> of the planning and projecting phase of building projects perceive their mission and what factors, according to them, have an influence on what they do.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a system of}} critical factors defined after four years observation and study. The system is oriented to a multiplicity of actors - involved {{at different levels of}} the building process in the evaluation and control of the time and costs of an intervention - such as project managers, designers, <b>safety</b> <b>coordinators</b> and contractors' technicians. The different factors dealt with by the paper have been sorted in main classes, in turn divided in subclasses in which the factors in question are explained. The advantage of having a table of preventive analysis (i. e. the Criticality Report) allows to evaluate with more reliability the time and costs of carrying out of an intervention before the tender, by reducing the contentious during the works and, above all, by avoiding accelerations or "inappropriate tricks" for the attainment of expected quality and safety that may become necessary in order to respect the contract "at any cost"...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Urban {{green spaces}} works and {{maintenance}} are high-risk activities and usually represent possible sources of injuries. The management issues {{are complex and}} strongly influenced by companies' policies in terms of safety management and human factor. A high number of tasks - including protecting {{public health and safety}} and safe working procedures - need to be faced by professional arborists or gardeners. Method The present paper provides a preparatory groundwork for modeling and describing the real risk levels during the abovementioned activities. The methodology represents a useful tool for decision making both for group leaders and <b>safety</b> <b>coordinators.</b> This goal is reached by collecting data emerging from several workplaces located in North East Italy regarding the frequency and severity of injuries. Results The preliminary results point out that the most frequent injuries in green maintenance activities are represented by cuts, contusions, and ocular lesions, but none of them have lead to particularly serious consequences for the operators; indeed, the high levels of severity are related to traumas, fractures, and acute lumbar herniated discs. The riskiest activities are related to pruning, especially using mobile elevating work platforms, and grass cutting, especially when operated in escarpments and banks. Workers' behavior and companies' safety policies are key elements for a correct safety management system...|$|R

Decision-making skill building is often incorporated into substance abuse prevention, violence prevention, and conflict management programs.

In addition, it provides information on selected programs implemented in Broward County Public Schools. Broward staff priorities echo national priorities.

40|$|This essay {{contains}} {{the study of}} various projects that have been executed {{for a period of}} time of four months (this is the time that I have dedicated to carry out this essay) with the aim of analysing the methodology of the Safety and Health Coordination used during the execution of the construction site and making a proposal of how to improve that methodology. Due to the actual economical situation, I have had to base the analysis on three different building works, as one of the was stopped two months after it started. The building works that are the object of our study are: ‐ Expansion and reformation project of the industrial building ‘PDL’, with the construction of a slab between the ground floor and the current slab the first floor. ‐ Project for a photovoltaic solar installation connected to the electrical supply in the ceiling of the industrial building ‘PDL’. ‐ Project for the execution of the FC Barcelona ‘Masia’. The first and the second construction works take place during the same period of time and ion the same location, but even so they are independent. The property developer of these two works is the ‘Diputación’ of Barcelona, which designates the same <b>Safety</b> and Health <b>Coordinator</b> for both projects in the execution phase. Therefore, there are two different construction works that share the property developer and the <b>Safety</b> and Health <b>Coordinator,</b> although each has its own Project Management Team. The analysis of the FC Barcelona ‘Masia’ construction work has been based only on the realization of a photographic monitoring of my visits to the construction works (that take place at least twice a week). In order to carry out the Safety and Health Coordination in an organized and efficient way, several projects have been created.
