50|$|Sepang {{starts with}} a long pit {{straight}} where the DRS zone exists - {{it is important to}} get a good exit out of the last corner to gain as much speed as possible. Turn 1 is a very long, slow corner taken in second gear. You brake incredibly late and lose speed gradually as you file round the corner, similar to Shanghai's first turn but slower. Turn 1 leads straight into Turn 2, a tight left hairpin which goes downhill quite significantly. The first two corners are quite bumpy, making it hard to put power onto the track. Turn 3 is a long flat out right hander which leads into Turn 4 - known locally as the Langkawi Curve - a second gear, right-angle right-hander. Turns 5 and 6 make up an incredibly high-speed, long chicane that hurts tyres and puts a lot of stress on drivers due to high G-Force. It is locally known as the Genting Curve. Turns 7 and 8 (the KLIA curve) make up a long, medium-speed, double-apex right hander, and a bump can cause the car to lose balance here. Turn 9 is a very slow left-hand hairpin (the Berjaya Tioman Corner), similar to turn two but uphill. Turn 10 leads into a challenging, medium-speed right hander at turn 11, requiring braking and turning simultaneously. Turn 12 is a flat-out, bumpy left which immediately leads into the flat right at turn 13, then the challenging 'Sunway Lagoon' curve at turn 14. Similar to turn 11, it requires hard-braking and steering at the same time. It is taken in second gear. The long back straight can be a good place for overtaking as you can brake hard into turn 15, a left-handed, <b>second-geared</b> hairpin {{but you have to be}} careful not to get re-overtaken as you come into turn 1.|$|R
50|$|The {{powertrain}} {{control module}} in 2000-2002 automatic transmission models with the SelectShift option originally {{would not allow}} the car to start off in first gear when shifting manually (the car started in second gear). It would quickly shift to first gear, however, if the throttle were depressed more than 60%. <b>Second-gear</b> starts were programmed to meet fuel economy regulations {{as required by the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This was changed in 2003 when the regulations were amended and first-gear starts were permitted.|$|E
50|$|The circuit {{starts with}} a double left hander; the first corner is taken in second gear, with the drivers {{accelerating}} through the second turn. This opens up onto a straight 1.160 km long, which in turn feeds into the slowest corner on the circuit, a <b>second-gear</b> right-hand bend. The cars follow a shorter straight, home to the support pits, before a series of tight switchbacks at turns four, five and six; all three are taken in second gear. The circuit then opens up again, flowing {{through a series of}} fast fifth-gear bends, before the driver must brake for turn ten, a tight right-hander whose approach is made more difficult by the position of the braking zone on a downward-sloping incline. The remainder of the circuit is modelled on a street circuit, and follows a labyrinth series of left and right-hand bends that lead to turn seventeen, a long right-hander that is completely blind as it is surrounded by walls. The final turn on the circuit is a left-hand kink that feeds onto the main straight.|$|E
5000|$|Berger passed Senna on lap 5 at the Racetrack Hairpin, a tight <b>second-gear</b> right hander {{at the end}} of the Brabham Straight, {{and began}} a {{determined}} drive, catching and passing Prost at the same place on lap 14. By lap 23 he had a three-second lead before coming up to lap the Eurobrun-Ford Cosworth of Stefano Modena and the Ligier-Judd of notorious blocker Ren√© Arnoux. True to form, Arnoux seemingly ignored the flags and his mirrors telling him he was about to be lapped and turned into the hairpin, causing the Ferrari's left front wheel to ride the rear right wheel of the Ligier and send both cars into a spin. Both cars stopped in the middle of the corner, with the Ligier having stalled and the Ferrari unable to continue with suspension damage. All this handed Arnoux's ex-Renault teammate a lead he would not lose as he cruised past just a few seconds later. Many, such as BBC commentators Murray Walker and [...] World Champion James Hunt, blamed Arnoux for taking Berger out of the race, but the Austrian explained in a television interview with Barry Sheene after he'd returned to the pits that his hard early charge had left him with a [...] "long brake pedal" [...] and that he simply didn't have the stopping power to pull up before Arnoux turned into the corner. Sheene also interviewed Arnoux a few minutes later and the Frenchman expressed regret for having taken Berger out of the race, but also admitted that he had not actually seen the Ferrari as it had been behind the EuroBrun down the straight, though most chose to believe that it confirmed that the Frenchman, the oldest driver in Formula One at the time (he was 40), rarely used his mirrors.|$|E
50|$|Turn 1 is {{the main}} {{overtaking}} point at Catalunya, {{as it is a}} braking zone {{at the end of a}} long DRS straight. The inside and outside are equally difficult for overtaking; drivers who can hold the line around the outside of turn one, can get the inside line for turn two. The corners themselves make up a medium-speed chicane - drivers brake rather late for turn one (Elf) and shift down to gear two, and turn two is almost full throttle as they try to gain as much exit speed as possible. Turn 3 (Renault) is a long, flat-out (in most cars) right-hander that has a g-force of about four, and it leads to a short straight before turn 4, the Repsol curve. Another right-hander, turn four is similar to Monza's Curva Parabolica - drivers brake and take an early apex (in third gear), carrying lots of speed out of the exit. Turn 5 (Seat) comes immediately after and is a slow left-hander taken in second gear which drops rapidly downhill towards the left kink of turn 6 which is ignored by F1 cars. Turns 7 and 8 make up a medium-speed, uphill, left-right chicane. Drivers brake and shift down to gear three, and must not run too wide as turn eight has a large kerb on its apex which could potentially damage cars' suspensions. Turn 9, Campsa Corner, is a very fast, sixth-gear right-hander which is made incredibly difficult by being completely blind (drivers cannot see the apex on approach). It is initially quite steep uphill but the exit is then downhill, so it is quite easy to run wide onto the astroturf. The long back straight leads into turn 10 (La Caixa), a <b>second-gear,</b> left-hand hairpin, then turns 11 and 12, a left kink before a long, slow, third-gear right. The next section has been redesigned by German engineer Hermann Tilke to lower speeds onto the 1,047-metre pit straight - which in turn increases overtaking opportunities and safety. Turn 13 is a tight, third-gear right-hander and drivers have to cross the track quickly to take the racing line through the slow left-right chicane of turns 14 and 15, taken in second gear. Good traction is needed here as it determines speed down the pit straight. Turn 16 (New Holland) is a flat-out right-hander which takes cars across the start/finish line.|$|E
