25|$|News of the Sarajevo {{assassination}} reached Xavier and <b>Sixte</b> in Austria, {{en route}} to Asia. Enraged by murder of their step-cousin, both brothers intended to enlist to the Austrian army and seek revenge. Things changed when France declared war on Vienna. Though some of the Bourbon-Parma siblings – Zita, René, Felix and the half-brother Élie – sided with Austro-Hungary and males joined the imperial troops, Xavier and <b>Sixte</b> felt Frenchmen through and through. They openly intended to enlist to the French army, the declaration which might have cost them detention. It took personal appeals of Zita before the kaiser took steps which prevented their incarceration and allowed them to leave Austria for a neutral country. When back in France Xavier and <b>Sixte</b> indeed volunteered, {{only to find that}} the French law banned members of foreign dynasties from serving. Determined to join, they contacted their cousin Elisabeth, the queen consort of Belgium, who looked to it that both were allowed to serve in the Belgian military. Due to car accident suffered by <b>Sixte,</b> the brothers joined ranks of the Belgian army no earlier than in late November 1914. Xavier was initially accepted as private in medical services and was seconded to the 7th artillery regiment. Exact details of his service are not clear; {{what was left of the}} pre-war Belgian army served on a relatively calm sector of the frontline, in the Belgian and French Flanders next to the English Channel. At unspecified time Xavier was released from the line and got seconded to an officer training course, organized by the Belgian general staff, which he completed successfully. In mid-1916 he was sub-lieutenant, later to grow to captain.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war Xavier was engaged in {{assisting}} Zita and Karl following their deposition. In 1919 together with <b>Sixte</b> he travelled to England and contacted king George V; the British support materialized as a liaison officer, dispatched to the republican Austria to assist the unhappy couple on their route to exile. However, it soon turned {{out that it was}} his own business which attracted most of Xavier’s attention. Following wartime financial turmoil and expropriations of some family estates, economic prospects of both brothers seemed rather bleak. As a counter-measure, they decided to challenge the French state, which in 1915 seized Chambord as property of Élie, the Austrian officer; the Versailles Treaty stipulations allowed to conclude the seizure legally if combined with paying compensation fee. <b>Sixte</b> and Xavier sued; they claimed that the family-agreed 1910 partition, based on the Austrian concept of an indivisible , was not applicable in the French law, and that the Chambord property should be divided; they claimed also that as volunteers to the French and Belgian armies, they should be exempted from expropriation procedure. Centred on fortune-worth Chambord property, in fact the lawsuit was directed against Élie. In 1925 the court accepted brothers’ point of view, the decision immediately appealed by their half-brother. In 1928 the case was overturned in favor of Élie, the decision appealed by both brothers. In 1932 the Court of Cassation upheld the 1928 decision, which eventually left Xavier and <b>Sixte</b> frustrated in their bid.|$|E
50|$|Trident Studios {{had become}} {{famous for the}} {{recording}} of many seminal albums from the late <b>sixtes</b> and early seventies, including sessions by The Beatles, Elton John, David Bowie, T Rex etc. In his first few weeks he found himself making tea and running errands for sessions with acts such as Queen, Elton John, Supertramp and Ace, with producers Roy Thomas Baker, Ken Scott and Gus Dudgeon.|$|R
25|$|In 1972 Don Javier {{suffered}} life-threatening injuries {{resulting from}} a traffic accident and formally transferred all political authority to Carlos Hugo. In 1974, upon childless death of his step-nephew Roberto Bourbon-Parma, Don Javier ascended to head of the Bourbon-Parmas and assumed the Duke of Parma title. On the one hand, he was in position to enjoy family life; though his 4 younger children did not marry, the older 2 did, the marriages producing 8 grandchildren (born between 1960 and 1974). On the other hand, family relations were increasingly subject to political tension. While Hugues, Marie-Thérèse, Cécile and Marie des Neiges formed one team advancing the progressist agenda, the oldest daughter Françoise Marie, the youngest son <b>Sixte</b> and their mother Madeleine opposed the bid. <b>Sixte,</b> in Spain known as Don Sixto, openly challenged his brother; he declared himself the standard-bearer of Traditionalism and started building own organization.|$|E
25|$|In 1910 {{the wealth}} of the late Robert Bourbon-Parma was divided among the family. Children from the first marriage, and {{especially}} Élie, custodian of his handicapped siblings, were allocated most of the real estate; Robert’s second wife and children from the second marriage were earmarked hefty financial compensation, usufruct rights and minor properties. Already on his own, Xavier was based in Paris but cruised across Europe. One reason was family business, often with political background; e.g. in 1911 Xavier travelled to Austria to attend the wedding of his sister with archduke Karl Habsburg, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne; in 1912 he travelled via Spain to Portugal, accompanying his aunt during a Portuguese legitimist plot. Another reason was following his personal interest. Xavier seemed heavily influenced by <b>Sixte,</b> who developed a knack for geographical exploration. In 1909 both brothers travelled to the Balkans; in 1912 they roamed across Egypt, Palestine and the Near East. In 1914 they intended to travel to Persia, India and possibly the Himalayas.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of <b>Sixte</b> in 1934 Xavier became the most senior Bourbon-Parma partner of Alfonso Carlos. The two must have {{discussed}} the question of Carlist succession extensively, {{yet there is no}} information on details. In particular, {{it is not clear whether}} Alfonso Carlos suggested that Xavier succeeds him as a king – proposal possibly rejected by the Bourbon-Parma, or whether regency was the option preferred from the onset. Scholars speculate that it was prince Xavier’s legitmism, Christian spirit, modesty, impartiality and lack of political ambitions which prompted Alfonso Carlos to appoint him as a future regent. What prompted Xavier to accept the proposal remains unclear. Some suspect that he gave in to the pressure of his uncle, and considered accepting the regency as his family, legitimist and Christian duty. In any case, Xavier probably viewed his future regency, announced in the Carlist press in January 1936 and to commence after death of Alfonso Carlos, in terms of months rather than years. It was supposed to provide royal continuity before a general Carlist assembly appoints a new king.|$|E
500|$|Finally, for {{the bulk}} of his estate, which {{included}} his main house, New Place, his two houses on Henley Street and various lands in and around Stratford, Shakespeare had set up an entail. [...] His estate was bequeathed, in descending order of choice, to the following: 1) his daughter, Susanna Hall; 2) upon Susanna's death, [...] "to the first sonne of her bodie lawfullie yssueing & to the heires Males of the bodie of the saied first Sonne lawfullie yssueing"; 3) to Susanna's second son and his male heirs; 4) to Susanna's third son and his male heirs; 5) to Susanna's [...] "ffourth ... ffyfth <b>sixte</b> & Seaventh sonnes" [...] and their male heirs; 6) to Elizabeth Hall, Susanna and John Hall's firstborn, and her male heirs; 7) to Judith and her male heirs; or 8) to whatever heirs the law would normally recognise. This elaborate entail is usually taken to indicate that Thomas Quiney was not to be entrusted with Shakespeare's inheritance, although some have speculated that it might simply indicate that Susanna was the favoured child.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1916 Xavier got {{engaged in the}} {{so-called}} Sixtus Affair, a secret Austrian attempt to conclude a separatist peace. The new kaiser Karl I decided to exploit his family ties and friendship with the Bourbon-Parma brothers, trusting especially in the skills and intelligence of <b>Sixte.</b> As loyal French citizens, both agreed to undertake the mission only having first obtained consent of the French government. The role of Xavier is generally considered secondary to this of <b>Sixte,</b> though he was present during some crucial meetings, be it with the French authorities in Paris or with the Austro-Hungarian envoys in Switzerland and in Vienna; however, some scholars refer to [...] "mediation des princes <b>Sixte</b> et Xavier". Negotiations broke down in early 1917 and the issue seemed closed; leaked by Clemenceau in May 1918, {{it turned into a}} political crisis and a scandal, which wrecked the prestige of the young emperor. Xavier and <b>Sixte,</b> at that time in Vienna, were considered endangered, menaced either by the Austrian foreign minister Czernin, willing to get rid of witnesses, or as victims of popular wrath. The incident is considered [...] "perhaps the ultimate example of amateurish aristocratic diplomacy gone awry during the First World War", though none of the sources consulted tends to blame Xavier for the final failure. It is not clear whether he returned to military service afterwards. At the moment of the armistice he was in the rank of a major of the Belgian army, awarded the French Croix de Guerre, the Belgian Croix de Guerre, and the Belgian Ordré de Léopold.|$|E
2500|$|In 1899 Xavier {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} his older brother <b>Sixte</b> and entered Stella Matutina, a prestigious Jesuit establishment in the Austrian Feldkirch. Though catering to Catholic aristocracy from all over Europe, the school offered Spartan conditions; when later enquired how he survived the Nazi concentration camp, prince Xavier joked: [...] "I frequented the Stella. It's not easy to kill us". The school ensured a model of humble religiosity, the staff ensured high teaching standards, and the mix of boys from different countries ensured a spirit of international comradeship. Xavier graduated in the mid-1900s; in 1906 moved to Paris, still trailing his older brother and commencing university studies. Unlike <b>Sixte,</b> who studied law, he pursued two different paths: political-economic sciences and agronomy. He completed both, graduating as engineer in agronomy and doctor in politics/economy. The year or years of him completing the curriculum are not clear; one source points to 1914. He has never commenced a professional career.|$|E
2500|$|As the Bourbon-Bussets enjoyed {{significant}} wealth {{the marriage}} changed financial status of Xavier, especially that Madeleine had no living older brothers. The couple settled in Bostz castle, where Xavier managed the rural economy of his in-laws; {{their first child}} was born in 1928, {{to be followed by}} the other 5 throughout the 1930s. Following the 1932 death of his father-in-law, Xavier became head of the family business, crowned with the [...] Little is known of his public activity at that time, except that he was engaged in various non-political though conservatism-flavored Catholic initiatives. Perhaps the most happy period of his life was punctured by the premature 1934 death of <b>Sixte,</b> for decades Xavier’s best friend and sort of a mentor.|$|E
2500|$|Incent died {{intestate}} 18 {{months after}} his school opened, {{in order to protect}} the school from legal challenges, school was incorporated by an Act of Parliament as The Free Schole of King Edwarde the <b>Sixte</b> in Berkhampstedde. Amongst the school's former students was the author Graham Greene. The schools oldest building the Old Hall was built in 1544 and is Grade I listed, records of the time state that Incent [...] "builded with all speed a fair schoole lartge and great all of brick very sumptuously", and [...] "when ye said school was thus finished, ye Deane sent for ye cheafe men of ye towne into ye school where he kneeling gave thanks to Almighty God". In 1988 the school merged with Berkhamsted School for Girls (another large independent private school in the town), which had been founded in 1888. The school has 1,500 fee paying pupils, aged 3 to 18.|$|E
2500|$|Exact {{political}} views of Xavier are not clear; until the mid-1930s {{he did not}} engage in openly political activity, though he figured prominently in some French royalist initiatives. Himself son of a deposed ruler and his own sister deposed as empress, he had some relatives – associated with France, Spain and Portugal – engaged in legitimist politics, though others – associated with Luxembourg, Belgium, Denmark and Italy – fit rather in a general liberal-democratic monarchist framework. None of the sources consulted provides information on his views on ongoing French politics. Few note that his brother <b>Sixte</b> was a legitimist, who in scientific dissertation advanced rights of the Spanish Bourbons to the crown of France; on the other hand, his half-brother Élie openly abandoned the legitimist outlook. Some scholars claim that prince Xavier remained within [...] "más pura doctrina tradicionalista"; others suggest that he nurtured democratic ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{milestone}} came in 1961-62. First, in {{a symbolic}} gesture Don Javier declared Hugues [...] "duque de San Jaime", a historic title borne by Alfonso Carlos; then, he instructed {{his followers to}} perceive the prince as embodiment of [...] "a king". Hugues, styling himself as Carlos Hugo, settled in Madrid and set up his Secretariat, a personal advisory body. For {{the first time in}} history, a Carlist heir officially lived in the capital and openly pursued his own politics. From this moment onwards, Don Javier was increasingly perceived as ceding daily business to his son and merely providing general supervision from the back seat. Carlos Hugo was gradually taking control of communication channels with his father, replacing him also as a key person representing the house of Bourbon-Parma in Spain. Moreover, three daughters of Don Javier, all in their 20s, with apparent consent of their father engaged themselves in campaigns intended to enhance the standing of their brother in the Spanish public ambience; the younger son of Don Javier, <b>Sixte,</b> soon followed suit.|$|E
2500|$|Barely {{noted in}} Spain until the Civil War, also {{afterwards}} Don Javier remained a little known figure, partially {{the result of}} censorship; Franco considered him a foreign prince. Among European royals he was respected but politically isolated. In the Carlist realm he grew from obscurity to iconic status, yet since the late 1950s he was being abandoned by successive groups, disappointed with his policy. Disintegration of Carlism accelerated after Don Javier’s death; Partido Carlista won no seats in general elections and in 1979 Carlos Hugo abandoned politics. This was also the case of his 3 sisters, though Marie Therese became a scholar in political sciences and advisor to Third World politicians. <b>Sixte</b> is heading , one of two Traditionalist grouplets in Spain, and poses as a Carlist standard-bearer. The oldest living grandson of Don Javier, Charles-Xavier, styles himself {{as the head of}} the Carlist dynasty, oddly enough, without claiming the Spanish throne. In France a grouplet referred to as [...] called him in 2015 a [...] "king of France for tomorrow". The group is classified by some as Far Right and by some associated with Trotsky, Mao and Gaddaffi.|$|E
60|$|After that, I {{resolved}} {{to abandon the}} attempt to disarm him by pressure, and I turned my attention to drawing him into a position that might lend itself to seizure. But even as I was making {{up my mind to}} this--we were engaged in <b>sixte</b> at the time--I saw a sudden chance. His point was held low while he watched me; so low that his arm was uncovered and my point was in line with it. To see the opening, to estimate it, and to take my resolve was all the work of a fraction of a second. The next instant I had straightened my elbow, my blade shot out in a lightning stroke and transfixed his sword-arm.|$|E
60|$|He {{went in with}} {{lightning}} rapidity. For a moment his point seemed to La Tour d'Azyr to be everywhere at once, and then from a low engagement in <b>sixte,</b> Andre-Louis stretched forward with swift and vigorous ease to lunge in tierce. He drove his point to transfix his opponent whom a series of calculated disengages uncovered in that line. But to his amazement and chagrin, La Tour d'Azyr parried the stroke; infinitely more to his chagrin La Tour d'Azyr parried it just too late. Had he completely parried it, all would yet have been well. But striking the blade in the last fraction of a second, the Marquis deflected the point from the line of his body, yet not so completely but {{that a couple of}} feet of that hard-driven steel tore through the muscles of his sword-arm.|$|E
