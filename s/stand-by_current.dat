40|$|SOI {{technology}} offers significant assets for low-voltage, low-power high-speed logic. The steeper subthreshold slope of SOI MOSFETs not only improves design of low-voltage logic circuits, but also offers also opportunities for low-power analog design. Identical DC gains {{can be achieved}} in SOI and bulk either with less current or smaller geometries, or both. This is illustrated by plots of total area and <b>stand-by</b> <b>current</b> versus DC open-loop gain of two identical Miller op amps, one bulk and one SO...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for estimation and optimization of the average stand-by power dissipation in large MOS digital circuits. To overcome the complexity of state dependence in average leakage estimation, we introduce the concept of “dominant leakage states” and use state probabilities. Our method achieves speed-ups of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude over exhaustive SPICE simulations while maintaining accuracies within 9 % of SPICE. This accurate estimation is used in a new sensitivity-based leakage and performance optimization approach for circuits using dual V t processes. In tests {{on a variety of}} industrial circuits, this approach was able to obtain 81 - 100 % of the performance achievable with all low V t transistors, but with 1 / 3 to 1 / 6 the <b>stand-by</b> <b>current...</b>|$|E
40|$|As CMOS process {{technology}} advances into deep sub-micron era, static leakage power becomes an important design consideration for engineers. Static {{random access memory}} (SRAM) occupies over 50 % of total transistor counts in a SoC design, and therefore {{it is essential to}} minimize its <b>stand-by</b> <b>current</b> for low power applications. This thesis presents a single ended input/output 6 T SRAM cell with write-assist (WAcell) feature in 90 nm CMOS technology. Without the bit-lines being constantly precharged, the static power of a WAcell is reduced by 6. 3 X using leakage-biased bit-line technique. The minimized subthreshold currents can be collected to build charge pools and used as a power source to help charge bit lines. The proposed write-assist SRAM memory has reduced overall active power by 42 % and standby power by 75 % compared to traditional SRAM memory. A complete memory design using WAcell with decoders, write driver and sense amplifiers is also presented in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of sleep}} {{transistors}} as power-gating elements to cut-off sub-threshold leakage <b>stand-by</b> <b>currents</b> {{has become a}} very popular solution to tackle the rise of leakage energy consumption in nano-CMOS designs. One {{of the most critical}} challenges in sleep-transistor based power gating is the sizing of the sleep transistor, which mainly depends on the discharge current pattern over time of the set of cells that share a single sleep transistor. In this work we provide a sleep transistor clustering and sizing methodology that improves over previous solutions by (i) accounting for sleep transistor area constraints (thus implying the possibility of gating only a subset of the cells of the design), and (ii) by utilizing the temporal variations in discharge current pattern to achieve improved leakage power-savings. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show that we can achieve improvement in leakage power savings, compared to previous works, ranging from 12 % to 17 % on average, depending on the allowed area constrain...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new device and circuit scheme that {{drastically}} suppresses the <b>stand-by</b> leakage <b>current</b> for the deep sub- 0. 1 pm era {{while maintaining the}} circuit speed. Applying boosted gate voltage on the low leakage switches with higher V, and thicker To,, extremely low stand-by power for battery type application is achieved, while degradation of circuit performance and an increase of area overhead are sufficiently suppressed. The combination with a negative gate voltage scheme {{and the application of}} the boosted voltage scheme to SRAMs are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The power {{efficiency}} of source-coupled logic (SCL) topology for implementing ultra-low-power and low-activityrate circuits is investigated. It is shown that in low-activityrate circuits, where the subthreshold leakage consumption of conventional CMOS circuits is more pronounced, subthreshold SCL (STSCL) {{can be used}} effectively for reducing the power consumption. An STSCL-based static random-access memory (SRAM) array has been implemented to demonstrate the performance of this topology for ultra-low-power consumption and low-activity-rate digital circuits. A novel 9 T memory cell has been developed to reduce the <b>stand-by</b> (leakage) <b>current</b> to 10 pA/cell while the SRAM array is operating at 2. 1 MHz clock frequency. The power consumption benefits of the proposed circuit style can be maintained in nanometer CMOS technology nodes. I...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need to analyze and {{optimize}} the stand-by component of power in digital circuits designed for portable and battery-powered applications. Since these circuits remain in stand-by (or sleep) mode significantly longer than in active mode, their <b>stand-by</b> <b>current,</b> and not their active switching current, determines their battery life. Hence, stringent specifications are being placed on the stand-by (or leakage) current drawn by such devices. As the power supply voltage is reduced, the threshold voltage of transistors is scaled down to maintain a constant switching speed. Since reducing the threshold voltage increases the leakage of a device exponentially, leakage current has become a dominant factor {{in the design of}} VLSI circuits. In this paper, we describe a method that uses simultaneous dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and adaptive body biasing (ABB) to reduce the total power consumption of a processor under dynamic computational workloads. Analytical models of the leakage current, dynamic power, and frequency as a function of supply voltage and body bias are derived and verified with SPICE simulation. Given these models, we show how to derive an analytical expression for the optimal trade-off between supply voltage and body bias, given a required clock frequency and duration of operation. The proposed method is then applied to a processor and is compared with DVS alone for workloads obtained using real-time monitoring of processor utilization for four typical applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|Limited energy {{resources}} and environmental concerns due to ever increasing en-ergy consumption, {{more and more}} emphasis is being put on energy savings. Smart networks are promoted worldwide as a powerful tool used to improve the energy ef-ficiency through consumption management, {{as well as to}} enable the distributed power generation, primarily based on renewable energy sources, to be optimally explored. To make it possible for the smart networks to function, a large number of electronic devices is needed to operate or to be in their stand-by mode. The con-sumption of these devices is added to the consumption of many other electronic de-vices already in use in households and offices, thus giving rise to the overall power consumption and threatening to counteract the primary function of smart networks. This paper addresses the consumption of particular electronic devices, with an em-phasis placed on their thermal losses when in stand-by mode and their total share in the overall power consumption in certain countries. The thermal losses of elec-tronic devices in their stand-by mode are usually neglected, but it seems theoreti-cally possible that a massive increase in their number can impact net performance of the future smart networks considerably so that above an optimum level of energy savings achieved by their penetration, total consumption begins to increase. Based on the <b>current</b> <b>stand-by</b> energy losses from the existing electronic devices, we pro-pose that the future penetration of smart networks be optimized taking also into ac-count losses from their own electronic devices, required to operate in stand-by mode.
