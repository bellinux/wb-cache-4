5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction: The {{coexistence}} of myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is very rare. Case report: Herein we report an 82 year old man a known case of adenocarcinoma of bladder who came with ptosis in left eye, diplopia, and dysphagia, weakness of both lower extremities and autonomic dysfunction. According to history, physical examination and para clinical work ups coexisting of myasthenia gravis and LEMS was diagnosed. Discussion: our patient {{is the first}} patient with Overlap myasthenic syndrome {{on the base of}} adenocarcinoma of bladder. The purpose of this case report is to emphasize on this fact that a patient with LEMS <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluate</b> carefully for detecting underlying malignancies. Although in the most cases the origin is lung, extra pulmonary origin such as urinary system <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluate</b> carefully too...|$|R

25|$|There is no {{specific}} antidote for trazodone. Management of overdosage should, therefore, be symptomatic and supportive. Any person {{suspected of having}} taken an overdosage <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> at a hospital as soon as possible. Activated charcoal, and forced diuresis {{may be useful in}} facilitating elimination of the drug, gastric lavage has been shown to not be useful unless done during the first hour after intake.|$|E
25|$|Children {{and adults}} with chronic dry cough, {{increased}} work of breathing (fast respiratory rate, {{shortness of breath}} at rest or with activities) and absence of an infectious process to explain respiratory symptoms <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> for interstitial lung disease or another intrapulmonary process. Evaluation by a Pulmonologist and a CT scan of the chest {{should be considered in}} individuals with symptoms of interstitial lung disease or to rule other non-infectious pulmonary processes. People diagnosed with interstitial lung disease may benefit from systemic steroids.|$|E

However, in more serious cases tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used.

25|$|Following Duchamp {{during the}} first half of the twentieth century, a {{significant}} shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the old 7 World Trade Center is remarkable {{because it was the}} first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily as a result of uncontrolled fires. Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the {{collapse of}} the twin towers, and urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that fire resistance <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable; and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered. Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse, the main point of NIST's recommendations is that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable.|$|E

25|$|Further, the {{distinction}} between a legal system which utilizes judges as triers of both law and fact, {{as opposed to a}} system which incorporates jury trials, has been termed artificial. In a jurisdiction such as the United Kingdom, the same test applies to both jury and non-jury cases. Arguably in a non-jury legal system, there is more public interest in ensuring that judges remain accountable to the people. Hence, there should be greater freedom to discuss the manner in which judges carry out their functions. Finally, {{it has been said that}} the preference for the inherent tendency test because it allows the court to take action before the administration of justice is affected <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> carefully, as it may have an undue chilling effect on speech.|$|E
25|$|Pulsatile {{tinnitus}} can be {{a symptom}} of intracranial vascular abnormalities and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> for irregular noises of blood flow (bruits). Some people experience a sound that beats in time with their pulse (pulsatile tinnitus, or vascular tinnitus). Pulsatile tinnitus is usually objective in nature, resulting from altered blood flow, increased blood turbulence near the ear (such as from atherosclerosis, venous hum, {{but it can also}} arise as a subjective phenomenon from an increased awareness of blood flow in the ear. Rarely, pulsatile tinnitus may be a symptom of potentially life-threatening conditions such as carotid artery aneurysm or carotid artery dissection. Pulsatile tinnitus may also indicate vasculitis, or more specifically, giant cell arteritis. Pulsatile tinnitus may also be an indication of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.|$|E

50|$|One of Sen's main {{arguments}} is {{that the}} project of social justice <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> in binary terms, as either achieved or not.

Furthermore, he argues {{that we do not}} need a fully established abstract ideal of justice to evaluate the fairness of different institutions. He claims that we can meaningfully compare the level of justice in two institutions without positing an ideal, transcendental idea of justice. He names the opposite position institutional transcendentalism.|$|R

500|$|The {{situation}} {{of people who}} were half or quarter Jews, and of Jews who were married to non-Jews, was more complex. Under the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, their status had been left deliberately ambiguous. Heydrich announced that Mischlings (mixed-race persons) of the first degree (persons with two Jewish grandparents) would be treated as Jews. This would not apply if they were married to a non-Jew and had children by that marriage. It would also not apply if they had been granted written exemption by [...] "the highest offices of the Party and State." [...] Such persons would be sterilised or deported if they refused sterilisation. [...] "Mischlings of the second degree" [...] (persons with one Jewish grandparent) would be treated as Germans unless they were married to Jews or Mischlings of the first degree, had a [...] "racially especially undesirable appearance that marks him outwardly as a Jew", or had a [...] "political record that shows that he feels and behaves like a Jew". Persons in these latter categories would be killed even if married to non-Jews. In the case of mixed marriages, Heydrich recommended that each case <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> individually and the impact on any German relatives assessed. If such a marriage had produced children who were being raised as Germans, the Jewish partner would not be killed. If they were being raised as Jews, they might be killed or sent to an old-age ghetto. These exemptions applied only to German and Austrian Jews, and were not always observed even for them. In most of the occupied countries, Jews were rounded up and killed en masse, and anyone who lived in or identified with the Jewish community in any given place was regarded as a Jew.|$|E
