500|$|Hendrickson told TVSource {{magazine}} {{that she was}} [...] "petrified" [...] of filming the heavily emotional storyline. She stated, [...] "I was just really intimidated because I don’t have a child. I’ve never experienced that unconditional love with someone – for someone [...] I really didn’t have that much to connect to in my own personal life. I think that’s what <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> the most – how I {{was going to find}} it within myself to tell a truthful story." [...] Having previously noted that becoming a mother [...] "matured" [...] Chloe, Hendrickson said, [...] "I would love to see {{a little bit of the}} old Chloe come out of this extreme loss that she’s just experienced. I think it would make a lot of sense." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the first verse of [...] "Born Again" [...] were written while Third Day's lead singer, Mac Powell, was folding laundry. Powell {{recalled}} that [...] "I was doing some chores at home. I was sitting {{down on the floor}} folding laundry and I had that song in my head. All of a sudden it just came out--a full first verse literally. It wasn’t like I said a line and worked out a few other lines, it literally just came out. I just spoke it and sang it and it <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> because that never happens". Powell said he then [...] "got up and I was running around the house, throwing stuff everywhere looking for a pen and a piece of paper".|$|E
500|$|After joining Black Flag in 1981, Rollins {{quit his}} job at Häagen-Dazs, sold his car, and moved to Los Angeles. Upon {{arriving}} in Los Angeles, Rollins got the Black Flag logo tattooed on his left biceps and also {{on the back of}} his neck, chose the stage name of Rollins, a surname he and MacKaye had used as teenagers. Rollins played his first show with Black Flag on August 21, 1981 at Cuckoo's Nest in Costa Mesa, California. Rollins was in a different environment in Los Angeles; the police soon realized he was a member of Black Flag, and he was hassled as a result. Rollins later said: [...] "That really <b>scared</b> <b>me.</b> It freaked me out that an adult would do that. [...] My little eyes were opened big time." ...|$|E

500|$|As an {{adolescent}} during the 1950s, Hendrix {{became interested in}} rock and roll artists such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. In 1968, he told Guitar Player magazine that electric blues artists Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and B.B. King inspired him during {{the beginning of his}} career; he also cited Eddie Cochran as an early influence. Of Muddy Waters, the first electric guitarist of which Hendrix became aware, he said: [...] "I heard one of his records when I was a little boy and it <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> to death because I heard all of these sounds." [...] In 1970, he told Rolling Stone that he was a fan of western swing artist Bob Wills and while he lived in Nashville, the television show the Grand Ole Opry.|$|E
500|$|Director Ole Christian Madsen {{had read}} the book They Saw It Happen about the Nazi Resistance when he was 12. He was {{especially}} attracted by {{the story of the}} pair because of their moral ambiguity. Madsen stated, [...] "They both fascinated and <b>scared</b> <b>me,</b> and I sensed there was something dark and untold in their story." [...] He [...] "wanted to make a film that would revive and reassess their reputation". Years later, he met writer Lars K. Andersen, who had also read the book during his childhood, and this led them to envision a film. The project started in 1999; the idea for the film did not attract sponsors because it was viewed as [...] "past history" [...] or because it portrayed the resistance [...] "outrageously". This was precisely one of Madsen's objectives: to talk about their story because Danish wartime archives listed many fatalities simply as casualties of war instead of counting them as murders, thus [...] "suppress" [...] their real story. He wanted to bring attention to a part of Danish history [...] "the nation has since neglected to talk about", resulting in a [...] "collective misrepresentation".|$|E
500|$|In 1993, {{she played}} a young wife in the CBS miniseries Return to Lonesome Dove, Nonnie Parker in the Disney film A Far Off Place and had a minor role in Jack the Bear, which {{garnered}} her the Young Artist Award for Best Youth Actress Co-star. The next year, Witherspoon had another leading role as Wendy Pfister in the 1994 film S.F.W., directed by Jefery Levy. [...] In 1996, Witherspoon starred in two major films: the thriller Fear alongside Mark Wahlberg, as Nicole Walker, a teenage girl who starts dating a man with obsessive tendencies, and the black-comedy thriller Freeway, alongside Kiefer Sutherland and Brooke Shields, where she held the lead role. [...] Her character in Freeway, Vanessa Lutz, is a poor girl living in Los Angeles, who encounters a serial killer {{on the way to}} her grandmother's home in Stockton. The film received positive reviews from the press. Among them was the San Francisco Chronicle, with Mick LaSalle commenting, [...] "Witherspoon, who does a Texas accent, is dazzling, utterly believable in one extreme situation after the other." [...] Witherspoon's performance won her the Best Actress Award at the Cognac Police Film Festival and helped establish her as a rising star. The making of the film also gave Witherspoon significant acting experience; as she said, [...] "Once I overcame the hurdle of that movie– which <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> to death– I felt like I could try anything." ...|$|E

500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It <b>scared</b> <b>me,</b> the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of the Beach Boys' peers combined with Brian's competitive nature drove him to reach higher creative peaks. He has said, [...] "It isn't easy for me. So many things have <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> in my life – I've got fears, lots of stuff. I mean, boy, just all the records that have <b>scared</b> <b>me.</b> So many records just rocked my world, man. It's heavy." [...] He named [...] "What a Fool Believes" [...] (1978) as a song he considers a [...] "scary record" [...] and once believed that Procol Harum's [...] "A Whiter Shade of Pale" [...] (1967) was his funeral march. In 1986, Brian told David Toop: [...] "I listened {{to a lot of}} orchestral music. I learned a lot of tricks too. Nelson Riddle taught me a lot about arranging." [...] Alice Cooper reported that Wilson once considered the traditional standard [...] "Shortnin' Bread" [...] to be the greatest song ever written, as he quotes Wilson for an explanation: [...] "I don't know, it's just the best song ever written." ...|$|E

[...] He named [...] "What a Fool Believes" [...] (1978) as a song he considers a [...] "scary record" [...] and once believed that Procol Harum's [...] "A Whiter Shade of Pale" [...] (1967) was his funeral march.

2500|$|Brood's outspoken {{statements}} in the press about sex and drug use brought him into the Dutch public arena even more than his music. He was romantically involved with the German singer Nina Hagen, with whom he appeared in the 1979 film Cha-Cha. He is reputed {{to be the subject}} of her song [...] "Herrmann Hiess Er" [...] (English title [...] "Herrmann Was His Name") from the 1979 Unbehagen album, a song about a drug addict. Brood relished the media attention and became the most famous hard drug user in the Netherlands. [...] "It is quite common for an artist to use drugs, but not for him to tell everybody. I admit that it <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> that my popularity could make people start using drugs," [...] he once said in an interview.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the artists}} who {{influenced}} Peterson's music during the earlier type of years were Teddy Wilson, Nat [...] "King" [...] Cole, James P. Johnson and Art Tatum, to whom many tried to compare Peterson in later years. One of his first exposures to Tatum's musical talents came early in his teen years when his father played a recording of Tatum's [...] "Tiger Rag" [...] for him, and Peterson was so intimidated by what he heard that he became disillusioned about his own playing, {{to the extent of}} refusing to play the piano at all for several weeks. In his own words, [...] "Tatum <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> to death", and Peterson was [...] "never cocky again" [...] about his mastery at the piano. Tatum was a model for Peterson's musicianship during the 1940s and 1950s. Tatum and Peterson eventually became good friends, although Peterson was always shy about being compared with Tatum and rarely played the piano in Tatum's presence.|$|E

5000|$|Adelson {{questioned}} the Obama administration {{in an interview}} with Forbes: What <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> is the continuation of the socialist-style economy we've been experiencing for almost four years. That <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism, and to more of the government controlling people's lives. What <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience, just let the government take care of everything. U.S. domestic politics {{is very important to me}} because I see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great. … I’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give. People are less willing to share. There are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government. I believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current Administration's quest to socialize this country. It won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy.|$|R
