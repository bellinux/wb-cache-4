40|$|The {{nasal cavity}} of 67 dogs with {{malignant}} nasal neoplasia {{was treated with}} radiation. Preirradiation surgical cytoreduction of the tumor was done in 41 dogs. Fifty dogs were irradiated by use of 10 fractions over 22 days, and 17 dogs were given a similar total dose in 5 fractions over 35 days. The range of survival times (0. 5 to 42 months), median survival time (8. 5 months), and 1 - and 2 -year survival rates (38 % and 30 %, respectively) were better than those expected for other methods of treatment. Serious complications were few (4 %). Survival times for dogs were determined {{on the basis of}} histologic tumor type and on the basis of megavoltage (cobalt or linear accelerator) vs <b>softer</b> deep <b>radiation</b> (cesium or orthovoltage) treatment, with or without cytoreductive surgery. Survival times of 10 dogs given <b>softer</b> <b>radiation</b> without surgery were shorter than those of 14 dogs that were given <b>softer</b> <b>radiation</b> and had cytoreductive surgery. Survival times of dogs that were given <b>softer</b> <b>radiation</b> and had surgery were similar to those of dogs that were given megavoltage radiation only. Cytoreductive surgery did not improve survival times for dogs that were given megavoltage radiation. Median survival time for 38 dogs with adenocarcinoma was 12 months, compared with 6 months for 14 dogs with squamous cell or undifferentiated carcinoma. Median survival time for 16 dogs with a variety of sarcomas was 11. 2 months. Survival times of dogs with adenocarcinoma or sarcoma were significantly better (P less than 0. 02 or 0. 03) than for dogs with squamous cell or undifferentiated carcinoma.

Introduction Hard scattering in QCD is accompanied by <b>soft</b> <b>radiation</b> of gluons caused by the drastic accelerations of color charge. The resulting antenna patterns are predicted to be particularly simple for 2 ! 2 hard scattering processes in which one of the final particles is colorless [1, 2]. The possibility of using the radiation pattern to identify the underlying parton structure of observed events has been called "partonometry" [1]. In this paper, we address the question of how partonometry can be carried out in practice, and how it {{can be used to}} make further studies of QCD.

In theories whose only stable particle is the graviton, conservation laws are used to argue that such correlations are in principle sufficient for the soft gravitons to purify the hard thermal ones.

40|$|Abstract. Two massive binaries, Cyg X- 3 and LSI 303 o + 61, {{are inside}} the error boxes of γ-ray sources {{detected}} by the Compton GRO. If somewhere inside such binary systems are injected very high energy (VHE) γ-rays, {{as suggested by}} some Cherenkov observations, they may initiate the inverse Compton e ± pair cascade in the <b>soft</b> <b>radiation</b> of a massive companion, and the detected high energy γ-ray emission {{may be caused by}} the secondary γ-rays of such cascade process. Since VHE γ-rays has to propagate in the anisotropic radiation of a massive star (the place of injection does not cover with the source of <b>soft</b> <b>radiation),</b> the intensities of secondary γ-rays depend on the angles of observation measured from direction defined by the place of injection of VHE γ-rays and the center of a massive star. We compute γ-ray spectra formed in such anisotropic cascade by using the Monte Carlo method. It is found that the intensity of secondary γ-rays does not varies strongly for the angles of observation greater than ∼ 90 o, but the highest intensities are observed at the angles corresponding to the limb of a massive star. Moreover, some cascade γ-rays can also emerge from behind the massive star, i. e. from the opposite site than the location of a source of primary γ-rays. This interesting feature can be called as a focusing of γ-rays by the <b>soft</b> <b>radiation</b> of a massive star...|$|E

40|$|An electron-positron {{atmosphere}} is inevitably created around {{a black hole}} accretion disc whose spectrum extends to MeV energies. Pairs created in photon-photon collisions outside the disc are blown away by <b>soft</b> <b>radiation</b> (which dominates the bolometric luminosity of the disc) and form a semi-relativistic outflow. We simulate numerically {{the conversion of the}} MeV radiation into a vertical e+- outflow above a disc-like source. The outflowing e+- plasma becomes optically thick to Thomson scattering if the compactness of the gamma-ray source exceeds 30. The scattering by e+- then collimates the bulk of <b>soft</b> <b>radiation</b> along the disc axis, and the apparent bolometric luminosity of the disc depends strongly on its inclination to the line of sight. The anisotropic central emission may account for the lack of Fe K-alpha lines in the X-ray spectra of bright radio-quiet quasars.

40|$|We study single jet {{production}} in electron-nucleus collisions e^- + N_A -> J + X, using the 1 -jettiness (τ_ 1) global event shape. It inclusively quantifies {{the pattern of}} radiation in the final state, gives enhanced sensitivity to <b>soft</b> <b>radiation</b> at wide angles from the nuclear beam and final-state jet, and facilitates the resummation of large Sudakov logarithms associated with the veto on additional jets. Through their effect on the observed pattern of radiation, 1 -jettiness can be a useful probe of nuclear PDFs and power corrections from dynamical effects in the nuclear medium. This formalism allows for the standard jet shape analysis while simultaneously providing sensitivity to <b>soft</b> <b>radiation</b> at wide angles from the jet. We use a factorization framework for cross-sections differential in τ_ 1 and the transverse momentum (P_J_T) and rapidity (y) of the jet, in the region τ_ 1 << P_J_T. The restriction τ_ 1 << P_J_T allows only <b>soft</b> <b>radiation</b> between the nuclear beam and jet directions, thereby acting as a veto on additional jets. This region is also insensitive {{to the details of}} the jet algorithm, allowing for better theoretical control over resummation, while providing enhanced sensitivity to nuclear medium effects. We give numerical results at leading twist, with resummation at the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) level of accuracy, for a variety of nuclear targets. Such studies would be ideal for the EIC and the LHeC proposals for a future electron-ion collider, where a range of nuclear targets are planned. Comment: 49 pages, 13 Figures, journal versio...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} non-local effects which {{arise when}} radiation emitted at one radius of an accretion disk either heats or cools gas at other radii through Compton scattering. We discuss three situations: 1. Radiation {{from the inner}} regions of an advection-dominated flow Compton cooling gas at intermediate radii and Compton heating gas at large radii. 2. <b>Soft</b> <b>radiation</b> from an outer thin accretion disk Compton cooling a hot one- or two-temperature flow on the inside. 3. <b>Soft</b> <b>radiation</b> from an inner thin accretion disk Compton cooling hot gas in a surrounding one-temperature flow. We describe how previous results are modified by these non-local interactions. We find that Compton heating or cooling of the gas by the radiation emitted in the inner regions of a hot flow is not important. Likewise, Compton cooling by the soft photons from an outer thin disk is negligible when {{the transition from a}} cold to a hot flow occurs at a radius greater than some minimum R_tr,min. However, if the hot flow terminates at R < R_tr,min, non-local cooling is so strong that the hot gas is cooled to a thin disk configuration in a runaway process. In the case of a thin disk surrounded by a hot one-temperature flow, we find that Compton cooling by <b>soft</b> <b>radiation</b> dominates over local cooling in the hot gas for Ṁ 10 ^- 3 αṀ_Edd, and R 10 ^ 4 R_Schw. As a result, the maximum accretion rate for which an advection-dominated one-temperature solution exists, decreases by a factor of ∼ 10, compared to the value computed under an assumption of local energy balance.
