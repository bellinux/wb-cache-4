50|$|Because many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish {{people who}} survived the Holocaust were unable, or found it too upsetting, to relate their {{experiences}} in readable stories, at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1950s David Silberman and other activists began to covertly gather information from Jewish <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust living in Latvia.

5|$|The Christians, {{believing that}} this tribulation came upon {{them for their}} neglect of the Law of God and their {{religious}} duties, began to fervently read the Krista Purana, an epic poem {{on the life of}} Jesus Christ written by the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens (1549–1619). On discovering this, some Muslims destroyed the books, but the Christians constructed subterranean refuges in which to perform their religious devotions, read the books, and strengthen their faith. According to Mr. Silva of Gangollim, a <b>survivor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment ordered by Tipu was amputation of the ears, nose, feet and one hand.|$|E
