2500|$|Armed {{with the}} signed search warrant, police and {{evidence}} technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> {{and that the}} crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug {{and waited for the}} water to drain. After it had done so, an evidence technician named Daniel Genty entered the 28-by-38-feet (8.5 x 11.5 m) crawl space and crawled to the southwest area and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered putrefied flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder. Genty added the ominous remark: [...] "I think this place is full of kids." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} where {{basement}} flooding happens regularly and to solve dampness {{where the water}} table is above {{the foundation of a}} home. <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> send water away from a house to any place where it is no longer problematic, such as a municipal storm drain or a dry well.|$|R

5000|$|Automatic vs. manual {{operation}} - Selection of a manual <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> means that one will turn the pump {{on and off}} when appropriate. Selecting an automatic <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> means that a switch is wired to the <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> {{to turn it on}} or off at appropriate water levels. Automatic switches include pressure switches, low level pressure switches, float switches, and a solid state water sensor called field-effect.|$|E

50|$|Sump basins and <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> must be maintained. Typical {{recommendations}} suggest examining equipment every year. Pumps running frequently due {{to higher}} water table, water drainage, or weather conditions {{should be examined}} more frequently. <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps,</b> being mechanical devices, will fail eventually, {{which could lead to}} a flooded basement and costly repairs. Redundancy in the system (multiple/secondary pumps) can help to avoid problems when maintenance and repairs are needed on the primary system.|$|R
5000|$|Phase and voltage - <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> powered {{from the}} AC mains are {{available}} with single-phase or three-phase induction motors, rated for 110-120, 220-240, or 460 volts. Three-phase power is typically not available in residential locations.|$|R
50|$|Basement {{waterproofing}} involves {{techniques and}} materials {{used to prevent}} water from penetrating {{the basement of a}} house or a building. Waterproofing a basement that is below ground level can require the application of sealant materials, the installation of drains and <b>sump</b> <b>pumps,</b> and more.|$|R

Once considered acceptable, this practice may now violate the plumbing code or municipal bylaws, {{because it can}} overwhelm the municipal sewage treatment system. Municipalities urge homeowners to disconnect and reroute <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> discharge away from sanitary sewers. Fines may be imposed for noncompliance. Many homeowners have inherited their <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> configurations and do not realize that the pump discharges into the sewer.|$|E

50|$|Alternative <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> {{systems can}} be driven by {{municipal}} water pressure. Water-powered sump pumps are similar to backup-battery-driven systems with a separate pump, float and check valves. During installation, the float is mounted in the sump pit above the normal high water mark. Under normal conditions, your main electric powered <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> will handle all the pumping duties. When water rises higher than normal for any reason, the backup float in the sump is lifted and activates the backup <b>sump</b> <b>pump.</b> As municipal water rushes through the ejector, it creates a powerful suction force which causes the PVC pipe {{to act like a}} giant soda straw, drawing water up from the sump and ejecting it outdoors. There are no impellers, turbines, motors, or mechanical parts to wear out. There are no batteries, wires, or chargers to monitor, tend to, or replace.|$|E
50|$|Interior French drain {{installation}} {{is an effective}} way to waterproof a basement but requires the use of a <b>sump</b> <b>pump.</b> Many contractors will install plastic sump pumps that can quickly break down or neglect to install a battery backup <b>sump</b> <b>pump,</b> making the basement vulnerable to flooding during power outages. Sump pumps should be installed with a battery backup system in a proper sump liner of 20 gal size or larger to prevent the sump from having too little water and turning on and off continuously.|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{the studio}} took nearly double {{the amount of time}} and money as planned: permits were delayed {{numerous}} times, the site flooded due to heavy rains during demolition, and <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> had to be installed (then soundproofed) after it was determined that the building sat on the tributary of an underground river, Minetta Creek. A six-figure loan from Warner Brothers was required to save the project.|$|R
5000|$|Three Mile Island Unit 2 {{was unable}} to contain about 480 PBq of {{radioactive}} noble gases from release into the environment and around 120 kL of radioactive contaminated cooling water from release beyond the containment into a neighbouring building. The pilot-operated relief valve at TMI-2 was designed to shut automatically after relieving excessive pressure inside the reactor into a quench tank. However the valve mechanically failed causing the PORV quench tank to fill, and the relief diaphragm to eventually rupture into the containment building. [...] The containment building <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> automatically pumped the contaminated water outside the containment building. Both a working PORV with quench tank and separately the containment building with sump provided two layers of passive safety. An unreliable PORV negated its designed passive safety. The plant design featured only a single open/close indicator based {{on the status of}} its solenoid actuator, instead of a separate indicator of the PORV's actual position. [...] This rendered the mechanical reliability of the PORV indeterminate directly, and therefore its passive safety status indeterminate. The automatic <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> and/or insufficient containment sump capacity negated the containment building designed passive safety.|$|R

50|$|When {{examining}} a <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> and cleaning it, dirt, gravel, sand, and other debris {{should be removed}} to increase efficiency and {{extend the life of}} the pump. These obstructions can also decrease the pump's ability to drain the sump, and can allow the sump to overflow. The check valve can also jam from the debris. Examine the discharge line opening, when applicable, to ensure there are no obstructions in the line. Even a partially obstructed discharge line can force a <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> to work harder and increase its chance of overheating and failure.|$|E

50|$|Usually {{hardwired}} into a home's electrical system, <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> {{may have}} a battery backup. The home's pressurized water supply powers some pumps, {{eliminating the need for}} electricity at the expense of using potable water, potentially making them more expensive to operate than electrical pumps and creating an additional water disposal problem. Since a sump basin may overflow if not constantly pumped, a backup system is important for cases when the main power is out for prolonged periods of time, as during a severe storm.|$|R
