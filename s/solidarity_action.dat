The group thought this would slow down collection of tolls and cause widespread congestion across the local area. The CSAG believed Cornwall should receive similar subsidies to South Wales and Merseyside, which were receiving regeneration grants from the government.|$|E

After a runoff ballot, Jorge Antonio Serrano Elías was inaugurated on 14 January 1991, completing {{the first successful}} transition from one democratically elected civilian government to another. Because his Movement of <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Action</b> (MAS) Party gained only 18 of 116 seats in Congress, Serrano entered into a tenuous coalition with the Christian Democrats and the National Union of the Center (UCN) to form a government.|$|E

50|$|This {{understanding}} {{could also}} lead to the group isolating itself when struggles did break as with the Miners' Strike {{in the middle of}} the decade. At that time Miners Support Groups developed in all of Britain's major cities but the SWP chose in the first months of the strike not to join them, on the basis that they were inadequate to deliver the <b>solidarity</b> <b>actions,</b> such as mass picketing and <b>solidarity</b> strike <b>action,</b> which the SWP argued were the tactics needed for the Miners Strike to be concluded victoriously. Later this stance was reversed. Although the SWP continued to argue that the Miners' Strike could only be won if other sections of workers were able to provide <b>solidarity</b> <b>actions,</b> as was the case in a number of major disputes in the 1970s, its members continued to be active around the dispute which was considered doomed to failure without <b>solidarity</b> <b>actions.</b> The hit squads which appeared late in the strike were seen as symptomatic of the desperation and isolation of the more committed younger miners and were firmly disapproved of.|$|R

2500|$|Under {{the slogan}} [...] "Work and Wages", YCL members worked to {{organize}} the unemployed who populated relief camps across the country. [...] "The leading preoccupation of the YCL when I became secretary," [...] Maurice Rush says in his autobiography, [...] "was to organize unemployed youth." [...] Like many other observers, Rush (who was leader of the YCL in British Columbia after 1935) claims that the YCL {{was active in the}} Relief Camp Worker's Unions (RCWU), and played a role in mobilizing relief camp youth to participate in the On to Ottawa Trek. During the Trek, many working people opened their homes and cupboards to the protestors, sometimes sharing family relief rations. Communist women in Vancouver issued a call for a <b>solidarity</b> <b>action,</b> and five thousand working-class women came out to a special [...] "Mother's Day" [...] demonstration on behalf of the camp workers and to demand the closing of the camps.|$|E

2500|$|Although the New Deal {{had created}} a minimum safety net of labor rights, and aimed to enable fair pay through {{collective}} bargaining, a Republican dominated Congress revolted when Roosevelt passed away. Against the veto of President Truman, the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 limited the right of labor unions to take <b>solidarity</b> <b>action,</b> and enabled states to ban unions requiring all people in a workplace becoming union members. A series of Supreme Court decisions, held the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 not only created minimum standards, but stopped or [...] "preempted" [...] states enabling better union rights, {{even though there was}} no such provision in the statute. Labor unions became extensively regulated by the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. Post-war prosperity had raised people's living standards, but most workers who had no union, or job security rights remained vulnerable to unemployment. As well as the crisis triggered by Brown v Board of Education, and the need to dismantle segregation, job losses in agriculture, particularly among African Americans was a major reason for the civil rights movement, culminating in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom led by Martin Luther King Jr.. Although Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802 of 1941 had prohibited racial discrimination in the national defense industry, people still suffered discrimination because of their skin color across other workplaces. Also, despite the increasing numbers of women in work, sex discrimination was endemic. The government of John F. Kennedy introduced the Equal Pay Act of 1963, requiring equal pay for women and men. Lyndon B. Johnson introduced the Civil Rights Act of 1964, finally prohibiting discrimination against people for [...] "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." [...] Slowly, a new generation of equal rights laws spread. At federal level, this included the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, now overseen by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.|$|E
