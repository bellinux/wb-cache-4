Poly(A) + RNA populations were analysed by translation in vitro, followed by two-dimensional gel analysis by using both isoelectric focusing (ISODALT system) and non-equilibrium pH-gradient electrophoresis (BASODALT system) as the first-dimension separation. The relative concentrations of poly(A) + RNA <b>species</b> <b>coding</b> for seven translation products were significantly altered in Down's syndrome, {{as determined by}} both visual comparisons of translation-product fluorograms from normal and Down's-syndrome samples and by quantitative radioactivity determination of individual translation products. The relative concentrations of mRNA <b>species</b> <b>coding</b> for two proteins (68 kDa and 49 kDa) were increased in Down's syndrome and may represent genes located on chromosome 21. The relative concentrations of mRNA <b>species</b> <b>coding</b> for five proteins (37 kDa, 35 kDa, 25. 5 kDa, 24. 5 kDa, 23 kDa) were decreased in Down's syndrome, these probably representing secondary effects of the trisomy.

40|$|The {{isolation}} and purification {{of two major}} phenobarbitone-induced hepatic cytochromes P- 450 from male Wistar rats is described. These forms (designated cytochromes P- 450 B 1 and P- 450 B 2) were extensively characterised and structurally and functionally compared to two other homogeneous isoenzymic forms, cytochromes P- 452 (clofibrate-induced) and cytochrome P- 447 (BNF-induced). These characterisation studies (including catalytic, immunological, physical and spectral analysis) indicated that all four isoenzymes were distinct, unique hemoproteins. The above characterisation was extended towards the induction profiles of these hemoproteins in hepatic and renal microsomes, following single dose xenobiotic pretreatment. Of primary interest was the immunoquantitation data which revealed the presence of cytochrome P- 452 as a major constitutive isoenzyme. This data {{in conjunction with the}} metabolic data also indicated that xenobiotic induction of cytochromes P- 450 was both a specific and precise event. In order to determine the induction profile of these hemoproteins following xenobiotic pretreatment, analysis of the mRNA species was also undertaken. In vitro rabbit reticulocyte translation systems in conjunction with immunoprecipitation analysis (using monospecific antibodies against the specific cytochrome P- 450) revealed that following phenobarbitone and beta-napthoflavone pretreatment the induction of the specific translatable mRNA species was due to a difference in the amount of specific mRNA and not to a change in its translatability. This induction profile corresponded to that found on analysis of the holoenzyme cytochromes P- 450 present within hepatic microsomes. The temporal aspects of the induction of the mRNA <b>species</b> <b>coding</b> for cytochrome P- 452 was not in agreement with the metabolic and immunochemical data for this isoenzyme in hepatic microsomes. This discrepancy is possibly believed to relate to the activation/repression of genes coding for similar and related cytochrome P- 452 isoenzymes.

This tRNA is enriched more than 150 fold in the particles as compared to its content in total cellular tRNA where it represents less than 0. 1 % (initiator tRNA(Met) and tRNA(Ser) AGA being 11 and 4 fold enriched respectively).

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that successful development of the parasitic helminth Schistosoma mansoni must be dependent on an adaptative molecular dialogue with its hosts and on the existence of receptors for growth factors and hormones. Attempts to identify a homolog of the insulin receptor (IR) have led us to characterize a new receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) molecule in S. mansoni. SmRTK- 1 is an integral membrane protein with a single membrane-spanning sequence separating an extracellular ligand-binding domain and a cytoplasmic TK domain. Structural and phylogenetic analyses of the kinase domain of SmRTK- 1 confirmed its similarity to IR catalytic domains. However, sequence analysis of the extracellular domain of SmRTK- 1 revealed similarity with various proteins (such as drug receptors) that share a structure known as the Venus Flytrap (VFT) module. Alignment with other VFT modules for which the structure has been solved was used to generate a 3 D model of the putative VFT module of SmRTK- 1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the SmRTK- 1 VFT module was closer to that of the GABAB receptor.

40|$|Protein size is an {{important}} biochemical feature since longer proteins can harbor more domains and therefore can display more biological functionalities than shorter proteins. We found remarkable differences in protein length, exon structure, and domain count among different phylogenetic lineages. While eukaryotic proteins have an average size of 472 amino acid residues (aa), average protein sizes in plant genomes are smaller than those of animals and fungi. Proteins unique to plants are ∼ 81  aa shorter than plant proteins conserved among other eukaryotic lineages. The smaller average size of plant proteins could neither be explained by endosymbiosis nor subcellular compartmentation nor exon size, but rather due to exon number. Metazoan proteins are encoded on average by ∼ 10 exons of small size [∼ 176 nucleotides (nt) ]. Streptophyta have on average only ∼ 5. 7 exons of medium size (∼ 230  nt). Multicellular <b>species</b> <b>code</b> for large proteins by increasing the exon number, while most unicellular organisms employ rather larger exons (> 400  nt). Among subcellular compartments, membrane proteins are the largest (∼ 520  aa), whereas the smallest proteins correspond to the gene ontology group of ribosome (∼ 240  aa). Plant genes are encoded by half the number of exons and also contain fewer domains than animal proteins on average. Interestingly, endosymbiotic proteins that migrated to the plant nucleus became larger than their cyanobacterial orthologs. We thus conclude that plants have proteins larger than bacteria but smaller than animals or fungi. Compared to the average of eukaryotic species, plants have ∼ 34 % more but ∼ 20 % smaller proteins. This suggests that photosynthetic organisms are unique and deserve therefore special attention {{with regard to the}} evolutionary forces acting on their genomes and proteomes...|$|E
40|$|A maximum parsimony {{analysis}} of a data matrix including 42 temnospondyl species and 14 outgroup <b>species</b> <b>coded</b> for 246 characters results in eight shortest trees. Temnospondyls emerge as two distinct radiations: one includes edopoids and eryopoids-basal archegosauriforms; the other includes dissorophoids and dvinosaurs. Both receive low statistical support. The branching pattern of dissorophoids remains elusive and is obscured by recurrent homoplasies. The two Micropholis morphs appear as sister taxa near {{the base of the}} dissorophoid clade. Perryella is either placed as sister taxon to dvinosaurs or nested within them. Temnospondyls such as the genera Balanerpeton and Dendrerpeton occur close to the node that subtends the dvinosaur–dissorophoid separation. Disparity analysis using Principal Coordinate Analysis of both Manhattan and Euclidean intertaxon distance matrices reveals that all major temnospondyl groups are widely separated in morphospace. Levels of disparity are comparable in the various clades examined, but the dvinosaurs tend to be morphologically more diverse than other groups when variance-derived metrics are used. For range-derived metrics, dissorophoids are more disparate than other groups. Overall disparity is similar in edopopids and eryopoids-basal archegosauriforms, as is in dissorophoids and dvinosaurs. However, the latter two groups are invariably slightly more disparate than the former two...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{effects on}} {{macromolecular}} synthesis {{essential for the}} Chinese hamster cell to traverse the life cycle and to divide have been investigated. Life-cycle analysis techniques employing inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis were used in determining the kinetics of cell growth for specific {{segments of the population}} following spontaneous recovery from radiation-induced division delay. The results indicated that recovery does not occur in the absence of functional protein synthesis. Under conditions which inhibit normal RNA and DNA synthesis, irradiated cells can recover the capacity to traverse the life cycle and to divide. The stability of mRNA <b>species</b> <b>coding</b> for proteins essential for division in irradiated cells was also measured. The mean functional lifetime of these mRNA species was 1 hr. The data demonstrate the existence of a specific segment of the population consisting of cells which have completed transcription related to division but not concomitant translation and which can recover from the radiation injury without synthesis of additional RNA. Thus, initial recovery of the ability to divide has an obligate requirement for protein synthesis but no corresponding requirement for nucleic acid synthesis during the period when original messenger remains intact...|$|R
40|$|Rats {{maintained}} on a {{protein-free diet}} for 3 days have an altered time course of hepatic DNA synthesis during liver regeneration. The delay in DNA synthesis is eliminated {{by the administration}} of casein hydrolysate (given as late as 6 h after partial hepatectomy), but not by glucose or incomplete amino acid mixtures. Despite {{the change in the}} timing of DNA synthesis, the increases in hepatic amino acid pools, which take place at the earliest stages of the regenerative process, occur in a normal pattern in the regenerating liver of rats fed the protein-free diet. Protein-deprived rats have increased protein synthesis and decreased rates of protein degradation in the liver in response to partial hepatectomy, but these adaptations do not prevent a lag in protein accumulation and low protein/RNA ratios. The regenerating livers of these animals show a deficit in the accumulation of cytoplasmic polyadenylated mRNA as well as a smaller proportion of free polyribosomes. It is suggested that the deficit in free polyribosomes found in the regenerating liver of protein-deprived rats might be a consequence of the slow accumulation of mRNA <b>species</b> <b>coding</b> for intracellular proteins...|$|R
