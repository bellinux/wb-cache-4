The fortified line ran through hilly and densely wooded country in completely linear fashion, deviating in its entire length only once, for a distance of 1.6km, to avoid a steep valley.

500|$|The {{question}} of measurement reform in France {{was placed in}} the hands of the French Academy of Sciences who appointed a commission chaired by Jean-Charles de Borda. Borda could be said to have been a fanatic for decimalization: he had designed the repeating circle, a <b>surveying</b> <b>instrument</b> which allowed a much-improved precision in the measurement of angles between landmarks, but insisted that it be calibrated in [...] "grades" [...] ( [...] of a quarter-circle) rather than degrees, with 100minutes to a grade and 100seconds to a minute. The instrument was manufactured by Étienne Lenoir. For Borda, the seconds pendulum was a poor choice for a standard because the second (as a unit of time) was insufficiently decimal: he preferred the new system of 10hours to the day, 100minutes to the hour and 100seconds to the minute.|$|E

General Lodge, sitting at his campfire some rods away, and bending over his drawings, did not see King's arrival.|$|E

A review of extant literature and a focus-group interview among 20 college students were done. Based on the review of extant literature and focus-group interview, an initial <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> was developed. The initial <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> was further reviewed by 11 college students. After the review, a trial-run of the <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> was conducted among 17 college students. The comments from the trial-run participants became the bases {{for the development of}} the main-try-out <b>survey</b> <b>instrument.</b> The main-try-out <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> was used in the final test administration with 1, 210 college students as participants. Responses from the final test administration participants served as bases in determining the descriptive statistics of items, evaluation of validity, and evaluation of reliability of the <b>survey</b> <b>instrument.</b> Based on information gathered, the final <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> was developed and was named “Survey of College Academic Stressors. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{highlights}} the instrument development {{to measure the}} relationship between statistical process control success factors construct and performance construct. From an extensive review of literature of statistical process control implementation, eleven dimensions of statistical process control success factors and three dimensions of performance were identified. In this paper, a <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> to measure SPC success factors construct associated with quality and firm performance was proposed. The {{reliability and validity of}} this <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> were tested using data from 122 respondents. It was concluded that instrument developed in this paper has satisfactory psychometric properties, reliable and valid. Hence the researcher can use this <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> to build the model to find the relationship between statistical process control success factors construct and performance construct. Industrial practitioners can use this <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> to identify and predict the success of their SPC implementation projects through managing of these associated factors The development of a <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> for measuring a relationship between statistical process control success factors and performance...|$|R

A <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> was developed by using some existing scales from prior instruments and by creating additional items which might appear to fit the construct definitions. In addition, a pilot study was conducted by distributing the survey to 25 users of a mobile service called Mobile Student Information Systems. As a result, a <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> containing 22 items were retained. Furthermore, the results showed that the reliabilities of all the scales in the <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> were above the target acceptance level...|$|R
