It has been speculated that he may have died in 1662 or 1663, when the parish burial records are incomplete, or that he may have left Stratford-upon-Avon. He is known to have had a nephew, living in London, who by this time was holding the lease to The Cage.|$|E

5|$|Ida Marcia Camelhor {{was born}} on 31 October 1882 in Kovno, Russia to Mary (née Dember) and Louis Camelhor (also noted as Lieb Kamelhorn). She was the only <b>surviving</b> <b>child</b> {{of a family of}} eight. Before her first birthday, her parents immigrated to New York and then when she was around ten years old, they moved to Providence, Rhode Island. She {{attended}} public grammar school and high school and, at sixteen years old, went to work as a bookkeeper for Archibald Silverman. Archibald, also an immigrant, had begun his career as a designer of costume jewelry. Together with his brother, Charles, he established the Silverman Brothers jewelry company in Providence in 1897. After two years of working in the jewelry business, Camelhor agreed to marry her boss; they wed in 1900.|$|E
5|$|In 1816, {{the couple}} famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} her novel Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley {{gave birth to her}} last and only <b>surviving</b> <b>child,</b> Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, probably caused by the brain tumour that was to kill her at the age of 53.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{buildings}} with which Beatrice would have been familiar, continue to be regularly used by the royal family: Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Balmoral Castle, and Kensington Palace. She died at Brantridge Park, the home of her niece, Princess Alice, and her husband, the Earl of Athlone, at the time serving as Governor General of Canada. Osborne House, her mother's favourite home, is accessible to the public. Her Osborne residences, Osborne and Albert Cottages, remain in private ownership after their sale in 1912. At her death, Beatrice was the only <b>surviving</b> <b>child</b> of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The future Elizabeth II, Beatrice's great-grandniece, was eighteen years of age at that time.|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{uncertainty about}} the number of <b>surviving</b> <b>children.</b> Under prohibition of child labor, a higher survival probability of a child can increase opportunities for education investment as the fertility rate declines with a temporary {{increase in the number of}} <b>surviving</b> <b>children.</b> However, per capita GDP may decrease until the start of education investment. When people accumulate their human capital, the effect of an increase in the survival probability would be ambiguous. By applying panel estimation, we examine economic development with the effect of child mortality on the fertility rate and number of <b>surviving</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R

5|$|Vincent Willem van Gogh {{was born}} on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the {{predominantly}} Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands. He was the oldest <b>surviving</b> <b>child</b> of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. Van Gogh was given {{the name of his}} grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), who received a degree in theology at the University of Leiden in 1811, had six sons, three of whom became art dealers. This Vincent may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).|$|E
5|$|William was {{succeeded by}} two of his sons: William II, then Henry I. Henry made a {{controversial}} decision to name his daughter Matilda (his only <b>surviving</b> <b>child)</b> as his heir. Following Henry's death in 1135, one of William I's grandsons, Stephen, laid claim to the throne and took power {{with the support of}} most of the barons. Matilda challenged his reign; as a result, England descended into a period of disorder known as the Anarchy. Stephen maintained a precarious hold on power, but agreed to a compromise under which Matilda's son Henry would succeed him. Henry accordingly became the first Angevin king of England and the first monarch of the Plantagenet dynasty as Henry II in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Balchen {{was born}} in February 1670, the only <b>surviving</b> <b>child</b> of the yeoman gentleman, John Balchen, and his wife, Ann Edspur. Home educated, Balchen took a {{commission}} in the Royal Navy aged 15 and, seven years later, gained promotion to lieutenant. For most of this period Balchen was stationed in the West Indies and, during his service there, was lucky in his health; the West Indies command was considered very dangerous during this period, mortality rates amongst sailors stationed there being very high due to malaria and yellow fever. The high death rate led to rapid promotion for those who survived, and Balchen was made Post Captain at the relatively young age of 27 during the Nine Years' War. Balchen had spent the war aboard HMS Dragon and HMS Cambridge under Admiral John Neville, who was impressed enough with his subordinate to give him command of the prize ship HMS Virgin, the safe conduct of which to England earned him the step to captain.|$|E

5|$|Childe {{was born}} on 14 April 1892 in Sydney, New South Wales. He was the only <b>surviving</b> <b>child</b> of the Reverend Stephen Henry (1844–1923) and Harriet Eliza Childe (1853–1910), a middle-class couple of English descent. Stephen Childe was a second-generation Anglican priest, ordained into the Church of England in 1867 after gaining a BA from the University of Cambridge. Becoming a teacher, in 1871 he married Mary Ellen Latchford, {{together}} having five children. They moved to Australia in 1878. It was here that Mary died, and in 1886 Stephen married Harriet, an Englishwoman from a wealthy background who had moved to Australia as a child. Gordon Childe was raised alongside five half-siblings at his father's palatial country house, the Chalet Fontenelle, in the township of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. Reverend Childe worked as the minister for St. Thomas' Parish, but proved unpopular, arguing with his congregation and taking unscheduled holidays.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Poe {{first met}} his cousin Virginia in August 1829, {{four months after}} his {{discharge}} from the Army. She was seven at the time. In 1832, the family – made up of Elizabeth, Maria, Virginia, and Virginia's brother Henry – {{was able to use}} Elizabeth's pension to rent a home at what was then 3 North Amity Street in Baltimore. Poe's older brother William Henry Leonard Poe, who had been living with the family, had recently died on August 1, 1831. Poe joined the household in 1833 and was soon smitten by a neighbor named Mary Devereaux. The young Virginia served as a messenger between the two, at one point retrieving a lock of Devereaux's hair to give to Poe. Elizabeth Cairnes Poe died on July 7, 1835, effectively ending the family's income and making their financial situation even more difficult. Henry died around this time, sometime before 1836, leaving Virginia as Maria Clemm's only <b>surviving</b> <b>child.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of twenty years, Maria Theresa gave birth to sixteen children, {{thirteen}} of whom survived infancy. The first child, Maria Elisabeth (1737–1740), was born {{a little less than}} a year after the wedding. Again, the child's gender caused great disappointment and so would the births of Maria Anna, the eldest <b>surviving</b> <b>child,</b> and Maria Carolina (1740–1741). While fighting to preserve her inheritance, Maria Theresa gave birth to a son named after Saint Joseph, to whom she had repeatedly prayed for a male child during the pregnancy. Maria Theresa's favourite child, Maria Christina, was born on her 25thbirthday, four days before the defeat of the Austrian army in Chotusitz. Five more children were born during the war: Maria Elisabeth, Charles, Maria Amalia, Leopold and Maria Carolina (1748–1748). During this period, there was no rest for Maria Theresa during pregnancies or around the births; the war and child-bearing were carried on simultaneously. Five children were born during the peace between the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War: Maria Johanna, Maria Josepha, Maria Carolina, Ferdinand and Maria Antonia. She delivered her last child, Maximilian Francis, during the Seven Years' War, aged 39. Maria Theresa asserted that, had she not been almost always pregnant, she would have gone into battle herself.|$|E
