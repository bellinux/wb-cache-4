5|$|In {{the adult}} {{versions}} of the game, there are <b>scenes</b> <b>with</b> sexual CGs depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex.

Yūichi Suzumoto, a scenario writer who worked on later Key titles, commented that the sex scenes in Kanon are very self-contained, and can be easily removed without altering the story.

5|$|Mavis {{was portrayed}} as moralising, repressed, and dithering, and often {{appeared}} in comic <b>scenes</b> <b>with</b> her boss Rita Sullivan or her husband Derek Wilton. She was generally well received by critics, {{described as a}} national institution and one of Coronation Street's best loved characters, an old-fashioned spinster. Barlow has been praised for her portrayal of Mavis, a character notably spoofed by impressionist Les Dennis during the 1980s.|$|E

In 1970, business manager Michael Jeffery committed Hendrix to contributing to the soundtrack for Rainbow Bridge; his music is heard during surfing <b>scenes</b> <b>with</b> David Nuuhiwa and others. Pioneer surf guitarist Dick Dale, who claimed to have met Hendrix in Los Angeles in 1964, believed the mention was Hendrix's way of encouraging his recuperation when Dale was seriously ill.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} {{attempted to}} limit the use of digital effects. However, {{because he wanted to}} evoke a Southern Gothic fantasy tone for Big Fish, color grading techniques were applied by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Stan Winston Studios, with whom Burton worked with on Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Batman Returns (1992), designed Helena Bonham Carter's prosthetic makeup and created the animatronics. <b>Scenes</b> <b>with</b> Karl the Giant were commissioned using forced perspective filmmaking.|$|E

5|$|Wong {{appeared}} alongside Marlene Dietrich as a self-sacrificing courtesan in Sternberg's Shanghai Express. Her sexually charged <b>scenes</b> <b>with</b> Dietrich {{have been}} noted by many commentators and fed rumors {{about the relationship between}} the two stars. Though contemporary reviews focused on Dietrich's acting and Sternberg's direction, film historians today judge that Wong's performance upstaged that of Dietrich.|$|E
5|$|A {{very similar}} archway {{is found in}} Dieric Bouts's c. 1445 Mary Altarpiece, {{including}} spandrels with warriors. Art historians are unsure which was painted earlier– Christus's Nativity or Bouts's altarpiece. Equally, van der Weyden's arched triptychs were executed {{at roughly the same}} period, but art historians are more certain Rogier's archivolt design set the precedent. Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden, Christus appears to have used the device to encompass a single scene, incorporating all the main characters within the arch, instead of a linked series of <b>scenes</b> <b>with</b> separate archways.|$|E

Oldman met with Oswald's wife, Marina, and her two daughters to prepare for the role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with Marina Oswald.

5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} <b>scenes</b> <b>with</b> Eskimo women when coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E
