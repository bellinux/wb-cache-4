40|$|International audiencePressed by {{the urgent}} need to {{mitigate}} climate change, renewable energy sources are already replacing fossil fuels. Temporary drops in the spot price of electricity now occur in Europe when peak solar and wind output coincides with <b>slack</b> demand. <b>Management</b> of intermittent energy sources and energy storage are consequently crucial issues for the medium term. Two possible routes are of particular importance: on the one hand, funding of generating capacity – via a market instrument yet to be devised – to cover only periods of peak demand and intermittent supply; on the other temporary demand-side management of end-users. These two routes have been studied in detail by energy actors and encouraged by public-sector sponsorship of research. But they have so far made no allowance for local authorities, resident groups and intermediate bodies, {{despite the fact that}} they are playing an increasingly important part in deploying renewables and achieving greater energy efficiency. Being more complex than commercial transactions, the relations between the various actors have given rise to sharply divergent analysis by different disciplines. The socio-technical approach – a current of thought in the social sciences – has largely demonstrated the links between technology and society: the effect of institutional regulation on energy governance (Poupeau, 2013) and the deployment of technical systems (Berkhout et al, 2004; Geels and Schot, 2007); the organization of large technical networks and its subsequent dependence paths (Coutard, 2002); the enmeshing of town planning and networks (Dupuy et al, 2008; Rutherford and Coutard, 2014).

To achieve this, we propose four scenarios for coordinating energy in an urban environment between now and 2040.

In this paper, {{for a set of}} periodic tasks, where some tasks are preferably executed as soon as possible (ASAP) and others as late as possible (ALAP), we investigate preference-oriented fixed-priority scheduling algorithms. Specifically, following the idea in dual-priority scheduling, we derive promotion times for ALAP tasks (only). Then, we devise a dual-queue based fixed-priority scheduling algorithm that retains ALAP tasks in the waiting queue until their promotion times to delay their executions while putting ASAP tasks into the ready queue immediately once they arrive for early execution. We also investigate online techniques to further expedite (delay) the executions of ASAP (ALAP) tasks, respectively. Our evaluation results show that the dual-queue technique with ALAP tasks ’ promotion times can effectively address the execution preferences of both ASAP and ALAP tasks, which can be further improved at runtime with wrapper-task based <b>slack</b> <b>management.</b> Our technique is shown to yield clear advantages over a simple technique that periodically inserts idle intervals to the schedule before ALAP tasks are executed...|$|E

This necessitates the development of power management techniques that address communication subsystems, such as radios, as opposed to computation subsystems, such as embedded processors, to which most of the research effort thus far has been devoted.

40|$|Abstract—In {{multimode}} distributed systems, active task {{sets are}} assigned to their distributed components for realizing one or more functions. Many of these systems encounter runtime task variations at the input and across the system while processing their tasks in real time. Very few efforts {{have been made to}} address energy efficient scheduling in these types of distributed systems. In this paper, we propose an analytical model for energy efficient scheduling in distributed real-time embedded systems to handle time-varying task inputs. A new slack distribution scheme is introduced and adopted during the schedule of the task sets in the system. The slack distribution is made according to the service demand at the nodes which affects the energy consumption in the system. The active component at a node periodically determines the service rate and applies voltage scaling according to the dynamic traffic condition observed at various network nodes. The proposed approach uses a comprehensive traffic description function at nodes and provides adequate information about the worst-case traffic behavior anywhere in the distributed network, thereby enhancing the system power management capabilities. We evaluate the proposed technique using several benchmarks employing an event driven simulator and demonstrate its performance for multimode applications. Experimental results indicate significant energy savings in various examples and case studies.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers, all of which deal {{with the effects of}} deepening European integration on the food and beverage industry and market. The focus is on the period after Swedish EU membership in 1995. The last two papers use firm data and focus on the Swedish food and beverage industry, an industry which is an interesting case study as it was considered to be protected from foreign competition prior to EU membership. The first paper uses the prices of individual items for EU cities in order to study the impact of the process of integration on the EU food and beverage market. When controlling for distance, language barriers and retail costs, it is shown that a significant border effect has remained in the EU market for food and beverages since 1995. However, the results reveal that the enlargement in 1995 has meant that the new member countries have become rapidly integrated with other EU countries. In addition, price differences may be ascribed, albeit to a lesser extent, to transport distances, as compared to the early 1990 s, suggesting that the Single Market Programme has contributed to reducing transport costs. The second paper investigates the impact of EU membership on the productivity of the Swedish food and beverage industry. When trade is liberalized, productivity within an industry is expected to increase for two reasons; firms have larger incentives to reduce <b>slack</b> in <b>management</b> as they face a tougher import competition, and market shares are allocated to the most productive firms that are likely to prosper in the international market. The results find no evidence of an overall productivity growth although productivity increased in sub-industries that already had experience of selling abroad. A conclusion is that firms in the sub-industries that were protected from international competition are hampered by an overcapacity in the more competitive environment. The third paper examines how the export decision among firms in the Swedish food and beverage industry has changed with EU membership. When Sweden became an EU member, tariffs were abolished between Sweden and the other EU countries. Besides, Swedish food regulations had already been harmonised with EC law one year prior to EU membership. The results show that sunk costs for exporting, i. e., irreversible costs for exporting, have become less important since the implementation of the EC food regulations but that they have not been reduced after the year of membership, 1995. The results therefore suggest that the EU has been less successful in reducing trade barriers in the EU food market since the mid- 1990 s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{managerial}} implications of {{the introduction of a}} fiscal scheme for advance payment partial exemption in favour of highly qualified researchers in business enterprises in Belgium. The measure has been introduced in January 2006 and the rate of exemption amounts to 75 % from January 2009 onwards. The amount deliberated by the exemption can be freely used by the company. As such it qualifies the condition for financial slack resources not committed to a necessary additional expenditure. 	This unabsorbed financial slack can allow R&D management to steepen creativity (exploration) or to buffer existing research (mainly exploitation) to face an economic slowdown. However, the paper highlights that the outcomes depend on differences in how the financial slack obtained by the tax credit measure is made visible for the internal management; i. e. visible treatment as a revenue or as a wage cost reduction, or less visible registration of net effects. 	The analysis is based on a triangulation of quantitative and qualitative survey results for firms benefitting from R&D tax credits in Belgium in the period 2006 - 2010. With regard to creativity and buffering of research activities, no significant differences according to cost or revenue registration of financial slack have been identified. However, a low-visible treatment of the <b>slack</b> resources for <b>management</b> turned out to be significantly less related to sustainment of existing R&D employment jobs and of existing R&D projects. This refers to a lack of buffering function of unabsorbed financial slack.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relative importance of the information effect on corporate takeover in total takeover gains. It develops the measure of information effect based on the residual income valuation model with I/B/E/S analysts' abnormal earnings forecast revisions. Empirical results show that the information effect and the synergy are estimated to be around 4 percent and 22 percent respectively in the 1, 372 US samples during 1980 - 2006. Furthermore, almost all of the synergy gains disappear as the deal is expected to be failed while the measured information effect remains afterwards. The evidence suggests that the information effect is more evident in the disciplinary (failed & high Tobin's-q for bidders) or acquisitional (small capitalization & high book-to-market ratio for targets) takeovers while the synergy is greater in the successful tender-offer. Overall, the corporate takeover bid generates information gains up to 15 percent of total takeover gains. It also develops a theoretical model on the market for corporate control using the assumption that there exists <b>management</b> <b>slack</b> which does not contribute to shareholder wealth. This model provides explanations to several questions about corporate takeovers, which include the following: Why do managers prefer takeovers to other investment alternatives? When are they likely to occur? What are the sources of takeover gains? Do takeovers create value? Why are stock offers more common? Who gains from such transactions both in the long and short runs? Why do they occur in massive waves? Why is diversification often attractive to bidder managers? How does corporate governance play its role during this process? And why do managers often resist takeovers? The agency model this paper develops is compatible with existing theories on takeovers including neoclassical, inefficient stock market, and the free cash flow approach. Furthermore, it is consistent with most of the empirical evidence available...|$|R

Increase in predictability enables better design management and better interaction between high level and low level tools. This is highly instrumental in generating better quality designs. In this work, I focus on the resource binding problem to demonstrate the idea of predictability. First I focus on the low power problem and propose a spectrum of methodologies for improving power predictability in RT-Level designs. A comprehensive design flow is built which takes functions written in C and extracts data flow graphs. These DFGs are then scheduled and binded for power and predictability. Commercial tools like Synopsys design compiler and VSS simulator are used to characterize the modules for switching activity. This characterization {{is used by the}} resource binder to generate optimized solutions. The generated RT-Level designs are then translated into gate level using Synopsys design compiler.

40|$|Abstract—Multicore {{processors}} {{have emerged}} {{to be the}} popular and powerful computing engines to address the increasing performance demands and energy efficiency requirements of modern real-time applications. Voltage and frequency island (VFI) was recently adopted as an effective energy management technique for multicore processors. For a set of periodic real-time tasks that access shared resources running on a VFI-based multicore system with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) capability, we study both static and dynamic synchronization-aware energy management schemes. First, based on the enhanced MSRP resource access protocol with a suspension mechanism, we devise a synchronization-aware task mapping heuristic for partitioned-EDF scheduling. The heuristic assigns tasks that access similar set of resources to the same core to reduce the synchronization overhead and thus improve schedulability. Based on the result task-to-core mapping, static energy management schemes with both a uniform and different scaled frequencies for VFIs are studied. To further exploit dynamic slack for more energy savings, we propose an integrated synchronization-aware <b>slack</b> <b>management</b> framework to appropriately reclaim, preserve, release and steal slack at runtime {{to slow down the}} execution of tasks subject to the common voltage/frequency limitation of VFIs and timing/synchronization constraints of tasks. Taking the additional delay due to task synchronization into consideration, the new scheme allocates slack in a fair manner and scales down the execution of both non-critical and critical sections of tasks for more energy savings. Simulation results show that, the synchronization-aware task mapping scheme can significantly improve the schedulability of tasks. The energy savings obtained by the static scheme with different frequencies for VFIs is close to that of an optimal INLP (integer non-linear programming) solution...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the seminal}} work of Cooper et al. (1994), the {{relationship}} between initial resources and new venture performance has been frequently studied (e. g. Bamford et al., 2004; Kessler, 2007). So far, however, empirics didn’t succeed in demonstrating unequivocal performance effects of theoretically deemed valuable initial resources such as financial, human or social capital. A possible explanation for this is supplied by the capabilities perspective stating {{that it is not}} so much the access to or ownership of specific resources that matters for firm performance but rather how these resources are deployed within the firm to develop capabilities (e. g. Vorhies et al., 2009), hence suggesting that capabilities mediate the resource-performance relationship (Holcomb et al., 2007). Capabilities have been referred to as the abilities of an organization to perform a coordinated set of tasks, utilizing organizational resources, for the purpose of achieving a particular end result, such as adaptation and growth (Helfat and Peteraf, 2003; Newey and Zahra, 2009). A capability considered crucial for firm success is an organization’s ability to respond to changing environmental conditions (Homburg et al., 2007; Newey & Zahra, 2009). As organizational environments become increasingly unpredictable, dynamic, and complex, companies must constantly evaluate (the sustainability of) their competitive position and act if this position becomes endangered. As such, to survive and prosper, firms must at all times be able to appropriately respond to environmental changes. This is especially true for young firms given their general lack of buffers to overcome a period of organizational misfit with the environment. In this study, we investigate whether and how three initial resources (human, financial and social capital) influence the development of a market responsiveness capability (MRC) in a later stage of the new venture’s life and whether and how the MRC influences new venture performance. Doing so, we contribute to existing literature in two ways. First, this study contributes to a better understanding of the start-up process by examining how initial resources affect performance. Second, this study contributes to the further elaboration of the capability and resource-based literature. By examining the antecedents of the MRC, next to its outcomes, in a new business venture context, this study meets the complaint of several authors that the process of capability development has been an underresearched topic (e. g. McKelvie & Davidsson, 2009), as well as the complaint that most research and theory building on capabilities has focused on established companies (Zahra et al., 2006). Furthermore, by examining capabilities as mediators in the resource-performance relationship, we add to the integration of the resource-based and capability literature. We rely on a longitudinal sample of 153 start-ups that were less than 2 years old and employed at most 49 people in September 2003. At that time, we questioned these firms on their initial resources (human, financial and social capital). In 2006, a second survey was set out among these start-ups in which their MRC was measured. Both datasets were further completed with secondary data on the firms’ financial performance in 2007, 2008 and 2009. To develop the measures for our survey we relied on existing scales and variables coming from previous research in market orientation and entrepreneurship literature. This working method guarantees the validity of the independent variables, enhances the reliability of the firm performance measures, excludes common method bias and accurately addresses the issue of causality. The data are also tested for different types of biases, i. e. survivor, attrition and non-response bias. Yet, no significant biases exist that could influence the relationships under study. The mediation model is tested by means of structural equation modeling. The results show that initial resources indeed influence new venture performance through the development of a MRC. Financial <b>slack,</b> <b>management</b> education, and formal network diversity are all positively related to the MRC, whereas management sector experience is not. Contrary to our expectations, the results show a negative effect of MRC on return on equity (ROE) in 2007. This implies that start-ups that are able to respond in a timely manner to changing competitor and customer behavior worsen their performance. It is possible that firms that constantly direct and adapt themselves to changes in the outside environment are not able to optimize their internal processes thereby jeopardizing their efficiency. Yet on the long term, theory predicts that adaptability is needed to safeguard survival. Hence, on the long term, a MRC should generate a positive effect on profitability, a prime determinant of survival (Pompe & Bilderbeek, 2005). Post hoc analyses in which the ROE in 2007 was replaced by the ROE of 2008 and 2009 show that this negative effect diminishes and becomes statistically insignificant in later years. Therefore, we expect that this effect will eventually become positive as time passes by. Besides contributing to the relevant literature streams, this study provides guidance for new business managers. Start-ups that wish to be prepared to environmental shocks need to create a financial buffer, compose a highly educated management team and establish diverse formal network ties. Additionally, this study learns that, in the short term, adaptability will not necessarily lead to better efficiency. However, our expectation is that adaptability will pay off in the long run by keeping the firm in the market. status: publishe...|$|E
