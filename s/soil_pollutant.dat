30|$|In general, <b>soil</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{levels are}} {{assessed}} in Germany using the precautionary, assessment and action/restriction {{values of the}} Federal Soil Protection Ordinance (BBodSchV) [50]. For PCDD/Fs, the BBodSchV gives only action/restriction limits for the soil–human pathway. To prevent children’s exposure, the BBodSchV gives an action/restriction limit of 100  ng I-TEQ/kg dm for children’s playgrounds and of 1000  ng I-TEQ/kg dm for all residential areas. The critical PCDD/F levels for laying hens are thus approx. 300 times lower than the values for residential areas, where chickens are kept mostly in backyard with associated consumption of eggs. Currently, the BBodSchV is being revised and will be extended to the so-called “Mantelverordnung”. In the ministerial draft of the “Mantelverordnung” from February 2017 the action values for children’s playgrounds and residential areas now refer to the sum of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs (PCDD/F–PCB-TEQ (2005)) but numerical values will remain unchanged [281].|$|E

In human health risk assessment for sites contaminated with heavy metals, this later the major exposure route and is used to calculated the remediation thresholds. Currently, it is assumed that the fraction of the pollutant which reaches the systemic circulation (i. e. the bioavailable fraction) is equal to the bioavailability of the same pollutant in the matrix used for the establishment of the toxicological reference value. The measurement of the bioavaiiable fraction needs in vivo experiment which might be cost and time consuming and ethically problematic.

We describe a novel sensitive solid-phase contact assay for in situ toxicity testing of <b>soil</b> <b>pollutants</b> based on a recombinant bioluminescent reporter strain of Nitrosomonas europaea. A slurry of the reporter strain and soil sample was shaken for 1 h, after which bioluminescence was measured either directly (soil slurry protocol) or in the supernatant obtained after centrifugation (soil extract protocol). The assay was validated for both protocols by using linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) as a toxic and adsorptive model compound in the soil samples. Interestingly, LAS showed the same toxicity to the reporter strain with either soil incubation (both protocols) or pure culture, suggesting that adsorbed LAS pools contributed to the observed toxicity. The solid-phase contact assay that used the reporter strain of lux-marked N. europaea was slightly more sensitive for the detection of LAS toxicity in soil than activity-based assays targeting indigenous nitrifiers and much more sensitive than assays targeting indigenous heterotrophic microbes. We conclude that the new solid-phase contact assay, which is based on direct interaction of the test microorganisms with bioavailable pools of the toxicants in soil, provides a most sensitive and relevant method for evaluating the in situ toxicity and assessing the risks of soil contaminants...|$|R

40|$|Toxic {{effects of}} cadmium (Cd), a common <b>soil</b> <b>pollutant,</b> {{are still not}} very well understood, {{particularly}} in regard to its epigenetic impact. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to assess DNA methylation changes and their persistence in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris upon chronic low dose Cd exposure using methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP). Moreover, the biomarker response and fitness of the earthworms, as well as the expression of detoxification-related genes (metallothionein (MT) and phytochelatin synthase (PCS)) was evaluated. Low levels of Cd caused an increase in genome-wide DNA methylation, which remained partly modified, even after several months of recovery in unpolluted soil. Increased cellular stress seemed to decrease after two weeks of exposure whereas fitness parameters remained unaffected by Cd, probably as a result from the activation of detoxification mechanisms like the expression of MTs. Interestingly, even though the level of Cd exposure was very low, MT expression levels indicate the development of acclimation mechanisms. Taken together, this study demonstrates that acclimation, as well as epigenetic modifications can occur already in moderately polluted environments. In addition, these effects can have long-lasting impacts on key species of soil invertebrates and might persist long after the actual heavy metal challenge has passed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Some {{methods of}} {{contaminated}} soils remediation reduces the mobile fraction of trace elements, which could contaminate groundwater or {{be taken up}} by soil organisms. Cadmium (Cd) as a heavy metal has received much attention {{in the past few}} decades due to its potential toxic impact on soil organism activity and compositions. Cadmium is a <b>soil</b> <b>pollutant</b> of no known essential biological functions, and may pose threats to soil-dwelling organisms and human health. Soil contamination with Cd usually originates from mining and smelting activities, atmospheric deposition from metallurgical industries, incineration of plastics and batteries, land application of sewage sludge, and burning of fossil fuels. Heavy metal immobilization using amendments is a simple and rapid method for the reduction of heavy metal pollution. One way of the assessment of contaminated soils is sequential extraction procedure. Sequential extraction of heavy metals in soils is an appropriate way to determine soil metal forms including soluble, exchangeable, carbonate, oxides of iron and manganese, and the residual. Its results are valuable in prediction of bioavailability, leaching rate and elements transformation in contaminated agricultural soils.

Responses of arylsulfatase and phosphodiesterase to solarization and mulching and azide treatment were found to be affected in the same way, suggesting a similar mode of action. Soil pH in control soils was significantly increased by azide application; however, in mulched soils, pH was decreased. The significant decrease in soil pH in mulched soils may be very important in explaining the increase in the acid phosphatase activity observed in mulched soils.
