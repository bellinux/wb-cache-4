5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E
5|$|Royce begins rapping in {{a prison}} cell, until he finds a poster and peels it off the wall to find a door compartment, a {{reference}} to 1994 drama film The Shawshank Redemption. He crawls through it and finds himself in the tunnel. Royce lights a flare to help navigate through the system. As Mars sings the bridge, the two rappers find {{their way out of}} the tunnels, through a manhole which leads them to a field where Mars sings.

5|$|As {{the story}} begins, {{a woman named}} Emmy Altava is hired to be Professor Layton's {{assistant}} at the fictional Gressenheller University. Upon her introduction to him, he reveals that he is currently heading towards a town named Misthallery. According to a letter allegedly sent by his close friend, Clark Triton, a specter is attacking the village at night. As the pair reach Clark's house, though, they find that the letter was sent not by Clark, but by his son, Luke, who has learned how to predict the specter's attacks and wished to enlist Layton's help in {{putting an end to}} them. Luke sneaks out of his house to join Layton and Emmy's investigation. After they finish exploring Misthallery for the day, they go to spend the night at a local hotel. As they look out from the window in their room, they hear the sound of a flute and <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> shadowy figure emerge from the mist, which proceeds to forge a path of destruction through the town, including their hotel room, before vanishing without a trace.|$|E

25|$|Later Meteor {{variants}} would <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{variety of}} changes {{from the initial}} Meteor F.1 introduced to service in 1944. Much attention was given to raising the aircraft's top speed, often by improving the airframe's aerodynamic qualities, incorporating the latest engine developments, and increasing {{the strength of the}} airframe. The Meteor F.8, which emerged in the late 1940s, was considered to have substantially improved performance over prior variants; the F.8 was reportedly the most powerful single-seat aircraft flying in 1947, capable of ascending to 40,000 feet within five minutes.|$|E

In the evening and overnight hours, a major derecho with destructive winds and some scattered tornadoes were possible farther east, particularly in the eastern Dakotas, western Minnesota and western Iowa. However, that basically busted as little severe weather happened as the cap held up in most areas. Only five tornadoes and scattered wind reports took place.|$|E
25|$|This type of cricket {{is popular}} in the South Asian sub-continent, USA and Canada. In this game a harder version of tennis ball is used. The number of overs in the game varies from 6 to 25 overs. Considering that the ball is not as hard as the {{professional}} cricket ball, the use of protective gear like gloves, pads and helmets is optional. As tennis ball cricket games are shorter {{when compared to the}} conventional version, it suits the US and Canadian lifestyle where one would <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of people participating. Where cricket pitches are not available, part of a baseball diamond is used as a pitch in most parts of USA and Canada.|$|E
25|$|The LHC physics {{programme}} {{is mainly}} based on proton–proton collisions. However, shorter running periods, typically one month per year, with heavy-ion collisions {{are included in}} the programme. While lighter ions are considered as well, the baseline scheme deals with lead ions (<b>see</b> <b>A</b> <b>Large</b> Ion Collider Experiment). The lead ions are first accelerated by the linear accelerator LINAC 3, and the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) is used as an ion storage and cooler unit. The ions are then further accelerated by the PS and SPS before being injected into LHC ring, where they reached an energy of 2.3 TeV per nucleon (or 522 TeV per ion), higher than the energies reached by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The aim of the heavy-ion programme is to investigate quark–gluon plasma, which existed in the early universe.|$|E

500|$|The ten-corner {{track is}} [...] long and was {{designed}} by Rodrigo Nunes. It was constructed in eight days and was completed on the Friday before the event because the local authorities denied permission for the streets to be closed to traffic before that day. US$2.6 million (HK$20 million) was spent on relocating street lighting and cutting down trees, lowering underground facilities covers and converting existing roadside infrastructure. The circuit received positive feedback from drivers. Ma called the track [...] "very exciting" [...] and felt that the race would <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> amount of overtaking manoevures. Rosenqvist felt the track appeared [...] "incredible" [...] which went beyond his expectations. It reminded him more of race circuits in the United States than Macau and noted that the track was bumpy. However, concerns were raised over the turn three chicane which had no kerbs or any visible markings. Heidfeld felt there was an risk of a driver crashing his car in the area with António Félix da Costa backing up the latter's view and stated that tyres needed to be installed along with observation of the turn's run-off area.|$|E

500|$|The {{survivors}} {{split up}} {{into two groups}} {{to head to the}} Others' camp. Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), and Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) walk on land to the camp, bringing guns and ammunition with them. Meanwhile, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) plan to use Desmond's sailboat to go by sea. Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal, saying that [...] "this time, they will know that we are coming", a reference to the attacks in the first-season finale. When the boat reaches the Others' camp, Sayid finds it to be deserted. Meanwhile, Michael, Jack, Sawyer, Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them, and Sawyer kills one. Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap, and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby. They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach, ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid. There, they <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> pile of pneumatic tubes, suggesting that the reports sent out from the [...] discovered in the episode [...] "?" [...] had never been read. Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile, they hear whispers, and suddenly Sawyer, Kate, and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts. The hostages, bound and gagged, are brought to a dock, where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Gale keeps his bargain with Michael, returning his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued. Michael threatens Henry that he could tell the outside world of the island's location. Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn't matter as they {{would not be able to}} find the island, should they return. He also gives Michael a counter-threat: if he did tell people of the island's location, people would know what he did to get his son back. Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are, to which Henry responds [...] "We're the good guys, Michael". Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island. Hurley is then released and sent back to the other survivors with a message that they are to stay away from the Others' part of the island. As Hurley is let go, the other three captives are taken away.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result of}} the {{hearings}} was the cancellation of Kaiser's contracts for both the C-119 and the C-123 in June 1953, despite the Air Force having already spent $30 million USD on preparation for production of the C-123, with another $40 million having been earmarked for use by Chase Aircraft directly for production of parts. The C-123 contract was put out for re-bid, with Fairchild proving to be the winning contractor; under Fairchild's name, the C-123 went on to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> production run and extensive service in the Vietnam War.|$|E
2500|$|The Homestead Act of 1862 {{provided}} free land to settlers {{who could}} claim and [...] "prove-up" [...] of federal {{land in the}} midwest and western United States. Montana did not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> influx of immigrants from this act because 160 acres was usually insufficient to support a family in the arid territory. The first homestead claim under the act in Montana was made by David Carpenter near Helena in 1868.

2500|$|The {{arrival of}} English-speaking {{settlers}} in Texas began in 1821.

[...] California, on the other hand, did not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> influx of settlers from the United States until after the Mexican-American War. However, in slightly different ways, both areas contributed {{to the evolution of}} the iconic American cowboy. Particularly with the arrival of railroads and an increased demand for beef {{in the wake of the}} American Civil War, older traditions combined with the need to drive cattle from the ranches where they were raised to the nearest railheads, often hundreds of miles away.|$|E
