This allows for simulations of biomolecules in realistic reconstructions of living cells, including cells with complex geometries like those of neurons. As an illustration, Figure 3 shows a screenshot from a simulation of calcium-regulated proteins. The reaction compartment is a reconstruction of a dendritic spine. Visualizations are supported by a specialized plug-in ("CellBlender") for the open <b>source</b> <b>program</b> Blender.|$|E
500|$|ABA Games {{released}} its first shoot 'em up game for Windows PCs—Noiz2sa—in 2002, and the positive feedback Cho received {{encouraged him to}} concentrate on the genre. ABA Games' creations are [...] "avant-garde" [...] re-imaginings of classic arcade shoot 'em ups, using modern 3D graphics techniques to emulate older vector graphics and employing [...] "imaginative, fresh" [...] gameplay ideas. According to Cho, his graphical style was inspired by the game Rez as well as street billboards, and his attempts at innovative gameplay features have been inspired by games such as Radiant Silvergun, Ikaruga and Gradius V. ABA Games' works also tend to be set in random rather than scripted events. Its games are developed for Windows, but some have been ported to other systems including macOS, iPhone, iPod touch, and PSP, with its game Tumiki Fighters forming the basis of Wii game Blast Works (which included a selection of his games as bonus content). Cho has also created BulletML, an open <b>source</b> <b>program</b> which can replicate bullet patterns from other shoot 'em up games.|$|E

2500|$|IBM {{introduced}} a smaller, more affordable computer in 1954 that proved very popular. The IBM 650 weighed over 900kg, the attached power supply weighed around 1350kg {{and both were}} held in separate cabinets of roughly 1.5 meters by 0.9 meters by 1.8 meters. It cost US$500,000 ($ as of [...] ) or could be leased for US$3,500 a month ($ as of [...] ). Its drum memory was originally 2,000 ten-digit words, later expanded to 4,000 words. [...] Memory limitations such as this were to dominate programming for decades afterward. [...] The program instructions were fetched from the spinning drum as the code ran. [...] Efficient execution using drum memory was provided {{by a combination of}} hardware architecture: the instruction format included the address of the next instruction; and software: the Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program, SOAP, assigned instructions to the optimal addresses (to the extent possible by static analysis of the <b>source</b> <b>program).</b> Thus many instructions were, when needed, located in the next row of the drum to be read and additional wait time for drum rotation was not required.|$|E
