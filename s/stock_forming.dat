5000|$|As {{an example}} of Viking relics, a hoard of Viking coins and silver objects was {{discovered}} in the Eden valley at Penrith. Also in the Eden valley were finds at Hesket and at Ormside, which has been mentioned above {{as the site of}} a possible Viking grave-good. The other areas of Viking finds include Carlisle (west of the Cathedral), pagan graves at Cumwhitton [...] and finds in the Lune valley and on the west coast (for example, Beckermet, where a hoard was discovered in 2014, Aspatria and St. Michael's Church, Workington). However, relatively little else has come down to us apart from the sculpture. Despite this, interest in the Viking aspect of Cumbria, arguably almost on a par with that of the Neolithic, Roman and Border Reivers aspects, has been fuelled, particularly from the 19th century on, by the tourism boom in the Lake District (with its preponderance of Scandinavian names), by notions of rugged, free and independent 'statesmen' (estates men) of Viking <b>stock,</b> <b>forming,</b> according to William Wordsworth, a [...] "Perfect Republic of Shepherds and Agriculturalists", and by an interest in Scandinavian history and language promoted by writers and antiquaries such as W.

40|$|AbstractExpensive {{parts of}} {{machines}} {{do not have}} to be discarded when broken. Instead they can be repaired and put back into <b>stock,</b> <b>forming</b> a repairable item system. Lots of methods are known to determine stock levels, the number of backordered parts and waiting times in repairable item systems. Some of these methods consider limited repair capacity, but assume the capacity to be constant. In industrial practice, however, the capacity in the repair shop varies due to vacation times of the workers, reducing it temporarily. At the end of the vacation times the backorders of unrepaired, broken parts in the repair shop and unfulfilled part requests at the depot have to be diminished. Furthermore, the varying capacity influences the performance of the spare parts provisioning, incurring the need for higher stock levels. The impact of varying repair capacity on a system for repairable items is analyzed in this paper. It is shown how the stock levels have to be adjusted to guarantee a maximum backorder level of waiting request during the entire year...|$|E

40|$|In mountainous {{areas of}} southwestern China, {{especially}} Guizhou province, continuous, broadly distributed karst landscapes with harsh and fragile habitats {{often lead to}} land degradation. Research indicates that vegetation located in karst terrains has low aboveground biomass and land degradation that reduces vegetation biomass, but belowground biomass measurements are rarely reported. Using the soil pit method, we investigated the root biomass of karst vegetation in five land cover types: grassland, grass–scrub tussock, thorn–scrub shrubland, scrub–tree forest, and mixed evergreen and deciduous forest in Maolan, southern Guizhou province, growing in two different soil-rich and rock-dominated habitats. The results show that roots in karst vegetation, especially the coarse roots, and roots in rocky habitats are mostly distributed in the topsoil layers (89 % on the surface up to 20 cm depth). The total root biomass in all habitats of all vegetation degradation periods is 18. 77 Mg ha − 1, in which roots in rocky habitat have higher biomass than in earthy habitat, and coarse root biomass is larger than medium and fine root biomass. The root biomass of mixed evergreen and deciduous forest in karst habitat (35. 83 Mg ha − 1) is not {{greater than that of}} most typical, non-karst evergreen broad-leaved forests in subtropical regions of China, but the ratio of root to aboveground biomass in karst forest (0. 37) is significantly greater than the mean ratio (0. 26 ± 0. 07) of subtropical evergreen forests.

40|$|For most of {{the period}} {{associated}} with the Industrial Revolution in Britain, English law restricted access to incorporation and the Bubble Act explicitly outlawed the formation of unincorporated joint stock companies with transferable shares. Furthermore, firms in the manufacturing industries most {{closely associated with the}} Industrial Revolution were overwhelmingly partnerships. These two facts have led some scholars to posit that the antiquated business organization law was a constraint on the structural transformation and growth that characterized the British economy during the period. Importantly, however, the vast majority of manufacturing firms in the modern sector were partnerships. An easy explanation for the predominance of partnerships is that the legal restrictions on access to the joint <b>stock</b> <b>form</b> gave entrepreneurs no other choice of legal vehicle for their collective enterprises. It is not a large leap to then argue that these restrictions inhibited the development of the English economy. Those who make this argument implicitly envision a counterfactual in which legal restrictions on the joint <b>stock</b> <b>form</b> were absent, firms in the modern sector used the joint <b>stock</b> <b>form</b> to access external sources of funds to finance investment, and consequently capital accumulation and output accelerated more rapidly in the modern sector. The goal of this Essay is to challenge this view and to point towards other possible explanations for industrial entrepreneurs’ use of the partnership form. In short, the restrictions on access to the joint <b>stock</b> <b>form</b> lacked bite. While firms did not have general access to incorporation until 1844, creative businessmen and lawyers crafted an alternative legal form—the unincorporated joint stock company—that served as a functional replacement for the business corporation. Restrictions on unincorporated joint stock companies were unenforced and largely ignored. Thus, the use of the partnership by entrepreneurs in the modern sector must be understood as a choice; the law did not dictate their firms’ legal form. This Article proposes a resolution of this puzzle based on the pecking order theory of corporate finance. For the vast majority of firms in the modern sector it was optimal to use only debt, not equity, for any external financing. Industrial entrepreneurs chose the partnership form because it minimized the costs of debt financing. The unlimited liability of partners gave firm creditors additional collateral and provided better incentives against opportunism by partners, thereby lowering the cost of credit to the firm. Furthermore, the tighter nexus between control and residual financial claims in the partnership form resulted in better incentives for the owner-managers to exert effort and make efficient decisions in running the firm. Part II begins with a short overview of the early history of the joint <b>stock</b> <b>form</b> in England and then turns to the legal framework for business organization during the Industrial Revolution and explain that the supposed restrictions on organizing as a joint stock company were not binding. Part IV develops an explanation based on the pecking order theory of corporate finance for why industrial entrepreneurs nonetheless organized their businesses as partnerships...|$|R
