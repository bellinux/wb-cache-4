40|$|The current {{designs of}} wind turbine hubs contain many faults. The <b>slew</b> <b>ring</b> bearing {{that connects the}} blade to the hub takes on a large bending moment {{that in many cases}} causes the joints to fail and the blade to break off. The design of the hub is very large, heavy, and {{expensive}} to machine. The objective of this research is to reappraise the existing design of wind turbine hub and to suggest an alternative design, which does not have the design faults that are currently found. Drawings and sketches are presented along with all necessary calculations for the current and new wind turbine hub. The proposed redesign of the hub will have a bearing pack that will distribute the load of the blade and a new hub which is lighter, less complex, and simple to machine. This new design will be much safer than the current design and will produce more reliable wind turbines. by Bridget I. Hunter-Jones. Thesis: S.

40|$|Polymer melts often {{crystallise}} from heterogeneous nuclei to form ribbon-like lamellae, {{which have}} a folded chain molecular structure. They commonly radiate outwards from the nucleation point, to form spherical features called spherulites - which are often quite large. The characteristic Maltese cross pattern, seen when viewed between crossed polars, results from isoclinic fringes formed {{when one of the}} principal vibration directions is approximately parallel to the polariser. In some cases (including the Poly- 3 -hydroxy butyrate (PHB) viewed here), the lamella twist as they grow outwards, in phase with their neighbours. This gives rise to the observed ring pattern.

The contribution of the second process strongly depends {{on the nature of the}} amino acid, being absent in the natural amino acids while in the alpha-alkyl-alpha-methyl derivatives it parallels the steric bulkiness of the alkyl substituent (Me<i-Pr<t-Bu).

Significant variations in measured post-peak shear strengths were observed, and problems with the pore pressure response in the soil surrounding the slickensided plane are discussed. As a result of these problems, it was concluded that fast Bromhead ring shear tests may not be suitable for evaluating the effects of fast shearing on the strengths of slickensided surfaces.

Slow ammine loss then occurs to give the isomer of [PtCl(NH 3) (Hmet-N,S) ](+) with chloride hans to sulfur. When methionine is in excess, a reaction sequence is proposed in which trans-[PtCl(NH 3) (Hmet-S) (2) ](+) isomerises to the cis-isomer, with subsequent ring closure reactions leading to cis-[Pt(Hmet-N,S) (2) ](2 +). Near pH 7, methionine is unreactive toward cis-[PtCl(OH) (NH 3) (2) ]. By contrast, L-cysteine reacts readily with cis- [PtCl(OH) (NH 3) (2) ] at pH 7, but there were many reaction products, including bridged species. Cis-[PtCl(OH) (NH 3) (2) ] reacts with reduced thiols in ultrafiltered plasma but these are oxidized if the plasma is not fresh or appropriately stored. With very low concentrations of the platinum complexes (35. 5 mu M), HPLC experiments (UV detection at 305 nm) indicate that the thiolate (probably cysteine) reactions become simpler as bridging becomes less important.

40|$|Aromatic ring flips of Phe and Tyr {{residues}} are {{a hallmark}} of protein dynamics {{with a long history}} in molecular biophysics. Ring flips lead to symmetric exchange of nuclei between sites with distinct magnetic environments, which can be probed by NMR spectroscopy. Current knowledge of ring-flip rates originates from rare cases in which the chemical shift difference between the two sites is sufficiently large and the ring-flip rate sufficiently slow, typically kflip < 10 (3) s(- 1), so that separate peaks are observed in the NMR spectrum for the two nuclei, enabling direct measurement of the flip rate. By contrast, a great majority of aromatic rings show single peaks for each of the pairs of δ or ε nuclei, which commonly are taken as inferential evidence that the flip rate is fast, kflip ≫ 10 (3) s(- 1), even though rate measurements have not been achieved. Here we report a novel approach that makes it possible to identify <b>slow</b> <b>ring</b> flips in previously inaccessible cases where only single peaks are observed. We demonstrate that Y 21 in the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) has a slow ring-flip rate, kflip < 100 s(- 1), a result that contrasts with previous estimates of 10 (4) - 10 (6) s(- 1) inferred from the single-peak spectrum of Y 21. Comparison with a recent 1 ms molecular dynamics trajectory of BPTI shows qualitative agreement and highlights the value of accurate aromatic ring flip data as an important benchmark for molecular dynamics simulations of proteins across wide time scales...|$|R

40|$|Carbohydrates are {{important}} feed stocks in synthesis of natural products and so attract {{the interest of}} many organic researchers throughout the world, most notably in the last 10 years. The work described within explores the manipulation of the glucose-derived glucal. The addition of a reactive substituted cyclopropane across the alkene has been employed synthetically for many years, the subsequent ring breaking/expansion has been identified in the lab as slow and needing the support of catalysts. We ask the question, “Will cyclopropanated carbohydrates undergo the <b>slow</b> <b>ring</b> breaking/expansion {{in the presence of}} proteins, and are we able to identify which of the two types of mechanisms the reaction is going through?” The cyclopropane will act as a warhead to bind to proteins through Ferrier like rearrangements, resulting in irreversible inhibition. To identify the potential of such compounds, a combination of techniques are used to identify potential pathways, protein targets and reactivity through structure activity relationships. The key steps involved in finding out the potential of cyclopropanated carbohydrates are to determine biological activities through bio-assays, structure activity relationships, selective binding, chemical genetics and chemical proteomics. The bio-assays together with structure activity relationships provides evidence on which chemical mechanism is occurring when the biological target is interacting with the bioactive cyclopropanated carbohydrates. The most active compound, benzose (7), was subjected to chemical genetic analysis to determine the pathways and processes that are involved with the mode of action. The chemical genetic analysis was complimented by chemical proteomics to identify the direct biological target.

The ring of Tyr 6 is buried sandwiched between a beta-sheet and alpha-helices (the water-accessible area is less than 0. 26 nm 2), its hydroxyl proton being involved in an internal hydrogen bond. The ring flip rates 10 (1) - 10 (5) s(- 1) were determined from the line shape analysis of H(delta 1, delta 2) and H(epsilon 1,epsilon 2) of Tyr 6, giving an activation volume DeltaV++ of 0. 044 +/- 0. 008 nm 3 (27 mL mol(- 1)), an activation enthalpy DeltaH++ of 89 +/- 10 kJ mol(- 1), and an activation entropy DeltaS++ of 16 +/- 2 JK(- 1) mol(- 1).

These enzymes also accept the decarboxylated thyroid hormone metabolites, iodothyronamines (TAMs), as substrates for deiodination. Naphthalene-based selenium and/or sulphur-containing small molecules have been shown to mediate the regioselective tyrosyl ring deiodination of thyroid hormones and their metabolites.

40|$|Division site {{positioning}} {{is critical}} for both symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions. In many organisms, positive and negative signals cooperate to position the contractile actin ring for cytokinesis. In rod-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells, division at midcell is achieved through positive Mid 1 /anillin-dependent signaling emanating from the central nucleus and negative signals from the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase family kinase Pom 1 at the cell poles. In this study, we show that Pom 1 directly phosphorylates the F-BAR protein Cdc 15, a central component of the cytokinetic ring. Pom 1 -dependent phosphorylation blocks Cdc 15 binding to paxillin Pxl 1 and C 2 domain protein Fic 1 and enhances Cdc 15 dynamics. This promotes ring sliding from cell poles, which prevents septum assembly {{at the ends of}} cells with a displaced nucleus or lacking Mid 1. Pom 1 also <b>slows</b> down <b>ring</b> constriction.

40|$|A {{number of}} alkyl-substituted cyclopropanes {{for which the}} rates of ring opening of the {{corresponding}} cyclopropylcarbinyl radicals have been determined (see preceding paper in this issue) {{have been used as}} substrates for hydroxylation by phenobarbital-induced, rat liver microsomal cytochrome P- 450 at 37 0 C. Three of these compounds gave both ring-closed and ring-opened alcohols, thus allowing the rate constant, kOH, for "oxygen rebound" onto the corresponding carbon-centered radicals to be determined. In particular, both trans- (1 bH) and cis- (1 cH) 1, 2 -dimethylcyclopropane gave 4 -penten- 2 -ol (2 bOH) and 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 1 -ol (3 bOH) together with the corresponding trans- (1 bOH) or cis- (1 cOH) 2 -methylcyclopropanemethanols. Of much greater importance, for both 1 bH and 1 cH the ratios of the yields of the secondary-to-primary ring-opened alcohols, i. e., [2 bOH]/[3 bOH], were the same, within experimental error as the ratio of the rates of ring opening of the corresponding trans- (1 b 2 ̆ 022) and cis- (1 c 2 ̆ 022) methylcyclopropylmethyl radicals in solution at 37 0 C. This indicates that when 1 b 2 ̆ 022 and 1 c 2 ̆ 022 are formed from their parent hydrocarbons by H-atom abstraction in the hydrophobic pocket of cytochrome P- 450 they are not detectably constrained in their subsequent reactions by their unusual environment. From the ratio of the yields of the unrearranged alcohol to each of the rearranged alcohols we calculate kOH values of 1. 5 and 1. 6 7 1010 s- 1 for 1 bH as substrate and values of 1. 9 and 1. 8 7 1010 s- 1 for 1 cH as substrate. Consistent with these values we have obtained kOH = 2. 2 7 1010 s- 1 for bicyclo[2. 1. 0]pentane as substrate. Substrates such as methylcyclopropane and 1, 1 -dimethylcyclopropane, for which the corresponding cyclopropylmethyl radicals undergo relatively <b>slow</b> <b>ring</b> opening, yielded only the ring-closed alcohols on oxidation with cytochrome P- 450. 1, 1, 2, 2 -Tetramethylcyclopropane gave only a trace of a ring-opened alcohol, corresponding to kOH = 2. 5 7 1011 s- 1 for this substrate. Hexamethylcyclopropane gave no detectable ring-opened alcohol from which observation a limit for kOH > 5 7 1011 s- 1 can be calculated.

40|$|From 1995 to {{the present}} the {{friction}} stir welding (FSW) process has been under study at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). This is {{an account of the}} progressive emergence of a set of conceptual tools beginning with the discovery of the shear surface, wiping metal transfer, and the invention of a kinematic model and making possible a treatment of both metallurgical structure formation and process dynamics in friction stir welding from a unified point of view. It is generally observed that the bulk of the deformation of weld metal around the FSW pin takes place in a very narrow, almost discontinuous zone with high deformation rates characteristic of metal cutting. By 1999 it was realized that this zone could be treated as a shear surface like that in simple metal cutting models. At the shear surface the seam is drawn out and compressed and pressure and flow conditions determine whether or not a sound weld is produced. The discovery of the shear surface was followed by the synthesis of a simple 3 - flow kinematic model of the FSW process. Relative to the tool the flow components are: (1) an approaching translational flow at weld speed V, (2) a rotating cylindrical plug flow with the angular velocity of the tool, and (3) a relatively <b>slow</b> <b>ring</b> vortex flow (like a smoke ring) encircling the tool and driven by shoulder scrolls and pin threads. The rotating plug flow picks up an element of weld metal, rotates it around with the tool, and deposits it behind the tool (wiping metal transfer); it forms plan section loops in tracers cut through by the tool. Radially inward flow from the ring vortex component retains metal longer in the rotating plug and outward flow expels metal earlier; this interaction forms the looping weld seam trace and the tongue and groove bimetallic weld contour. The radial components of the translational and ring vortex flows introduce parent metal intrusions into the small grained nugget material close to the tool shoulder; if this feature is pronounced, nugget collapse may result. Certain weld features, in particular internal banding seen in transverse section as onion rings and associated surface ridges called tool marks, have long implied an oscillation flow component, but have only recently been attributed in the literature to tool eccentricity. Rotating plug shape, typically a hollow cylinder flared at the end where it sticks to the shoulder, varies as pressure distribution on the tool determines where sticking occurs. Simplified power input estimates balanced against heat loss estimates give reasonable temperature estimates, explain why the power requirement changes hardly at all over a wide range of RPM s, and yield isotherms that seem to fall along boundaries of parameter windows of operation...|$|R

Through the interpretation of the otolith and its edge, a sequence of annual rapid and <b>slow</b> growth <b>rings</b> was observed, otoliths with the opaque edge (rapid growth) showing the highest percentages in the period from June to September. Otolith total diameters, from valid readings, were measured and seems to follow an allometric model: TL = aODb (a = 24. 25, b = 1. 12 and r 2 = 0. 82). These results were related with those obtained from tagging surveys in the area in order to describe the movements along the life cycle of the species...|$|R
50|$|The mill was rebuilt, {{but in a}} new form: as a ring {{spinning}} mill, thus replacing the <b>slower</b> mules with <b>ring</b> frames. Mules still produced the finest spin, {{but that was a}} more niche market, and money was now made with rings. More ring spindles could be operated in the same space. Many mills were converted to ring frames, but the most efficient ring frames required a greater floor height, and the positioning of the floor support pillars (and hence the bay size) needed to be changed in order to achieve the greatest spindle density. The new mill was called the Ellenroad Ring Mill to distinguish it from the former Ellenroad mule mill. The opportunity was also taken to reconfigure the engine. The four-cylinder triple-expansion horizontal engine by J & W McNaught was rebuilt as a twin tandem which would deliver the extra power required by the increased number of spindles.|$|R
60|$|The man did {{not answer}} him. Wrayson {{continued}} to climb the hill which skirted the park. He did not turn round, but he heard the gates open, and {{he was convinced that}} he was being watched, if he was not followed. He kept on, however, until he came to some more iron gates, from which stretched the grass avenue which led straight to the gardens of the château. Dimly, through the gathering dusk, he caught a view of it, which was little more than an impression; silver grey and quiet with the peace which the centuries can bring, it seemed to him, with its fantastic towers, and imperfectly visible outline, like a palace of dreams rather than a dwelling house, however magnificent, of material stone and brick. An owl flew out from the trees a few yards to the left of him, and drifted slowly over his head, with much flapping of wings, and a weird, soft call, faintly answered in the distance by his mate; from far away down in the valley came the <b>slow</b> <b>ringing</b> of a single evening bell. Save for these things, a silence almost wonderful reigned. Gradually Wrayson began to feel that sense of soothed nerves, of inexpressible relief, which Nature alone dispenses--her one unequalled drug! All the agitation and turmoil of the last few months seemed to fall away from him. He felt that he had been living in a world of false proportions; that the maze of doubts and fears through which he had wandered was, after all, no part of life itself, merely a tissue of irrelevant issues, to which his distorted imagination had affixed a purely fictitious importance. What concern of his was it how Morris Barnes had lived or died? And who was Bentham that his fate should ever disturb him? The secrets of other people were theirs to keep. His own secret was more wonderful by far. Alone, from amidst the tangle of his other emotions, he felt its survival--more than its survival, its absolute conquest of all other feelings and considerations. It was truth, he knew, that men sought after in the quiet places, and it was the truth which he had found. If he could but see her coming down the avenue, coming to him across the daisy-strewn grass, beneath the shadow of the stately poplars! The very thought set his heart beating like a boy's. He felt the blood singing in his veins, the love-music swelling in his heart. He shook the gates. They, too, were padlocked. Then he listened. There was no sound of any footfall in the road. He moved a few steps higher up, and, making use of the pillars of the gate, he climbed on to the wall. It was a six-foot drop, but he came down noiselessly into a bed of moss. Once more he paused to listen. There was no sound save the burring of some night insect over his head. Stealthily, and keeping {{in the shadow of the}} trees, he began to climb the grassy avenue towards the château.|$|R
40|$|The curing {{kinetics}} of UV-curable {{powder coatings}} based on commercial unsaturated polyesters were monitored using photo-DSC, Real-Time FTIRATR and a modified rheometer {{equipped with a}} UV source. The effect of physical and chemical factors on curing such as type of photoinitiator, photoinitiator concentration, temperature and atmosphere of curing were evaluated. Coatings containing amounts of photoinitiator from 0. 5 to 10 wt% were cured at different temperatures in less than 10 s reaching conversions approximately of 60 %. The increase of the temperature of curing reduces the final conversion and also the rate of polymerization due to the chain transfer process and depolymerization that dominates the photopolymerization at high temperatures. The reactivity of the photoinitiators was similar for all the studied photoinitiators apart from benzophenone that {{was found to be}} the <b>slowest</b> initiator. <b>ring</b> kinetics of UV-curable powder coatings based on commercial unsaturated polyesters were monitored using photo-DSC, Real-Time FTIRATR and a modified rheometer equipped with a UV source.

40|$|Space {{scientists}} have explored, described, and explained the terrestrial magnetosphere for four decades. Rarely do {{they point out}} that the planetary and solar wind parameters controlling the size, shape, and activity of Earth's magnetosphere map out {{only a small portion of}} the space of dimensionless parameters that govern magnetospheric properties. With the discovery of Ganymede's magnetosphere, the range of parameters relevant to magnetospheric studies has grown by orders of magnitude. Consider the extremes of Ganymede's and Jupiter's magnetospheres. Jupiter's magnetosphere forms within a plasma flowing at super-Alfvenic speed, whereas Ganymede's forms in a sub-Alfvenic flow. The scale sizes of these magnetospheres, characterized by distances to the magnetopause of order 7 x 10 (exp 6) km and 5 x 10 (exp 3) km, respectively, differ by three orders of magnitude, ranging from 100 to 0. 1 times the scale of Earth's magnetosphere. The current systems that control the structure and dynamics of a magnetosphere depend on specific plasma and field properties. Magnetopause currents at Ganymede differ greatly from the forms familiar for Earth and Jupiter, principally because the Mach number of the ambient plasma flow greatly influences the shape of the magnetosphere. A magnetodisk current, present at Jupiter because of its rapid rotation, is absent at Earth and Ganymede. The ring current, extensively investigated at Earth, is probably unimportant at Ganymede because the dynamical variations of the external flow are <b>slow.</b> The <b>ring</b> current is subsumed within the magnetodisk current at Jupiter. This paper describes and contrasts aspects of these and other current systems for the three bodies...|$|R
