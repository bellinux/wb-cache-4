40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a nested {{logit model}} for <b>space</b> <b>heat</b> and water heat choice {{using data from}} the 1980 Pacific Northwest Energy Survey (PNW). The estimated structure involves six alternative <b>space</b> <b>heat</b> systems and three alternative water heat fuel types. Operating and capital costs are predicted for each residence using an energy thermal model. To relax the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives assumption we employ a family of nested logit models. We illustrate the two-step estimation method and use a Lagrange multiplier test for nested logit structure. Finally, we use the estimated models to forecast the market shares of alternative <b>space</b> <b>heat</b> systems under an assumed scenario for the course of relative fuel prices. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Lighting {{heat gain}} {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to the space cooling load in a buildings and it is necessary to determine the lighting heat gain distribution specifically the fractions of convective heat gain, radiative <b>heat</b> gain, conditioned <b>space</b> <b>heat</b> gain, and plenum <b>space</b> <b>heat</b> gain. Traditional lighting heat gain distribution has been determined and the data is available on the ASHRAE Handbook. However, {{there is a lack of}} relevant data for the LED lighting heat gain. As the LED lighting fixtures are an emerging lighting technology, the need to identify LED lighting heat gain becomes highly demanded. In this project, fourteen LED lighting luminaries’ heat gain distributions were determined through systematically designed experiments. Specifically, the split between the convective heat gain and the radiative heat gain, and the split between the conditioned <b>space</b> <b>heat</b> gain and ceiling plenum heat gain (if applicable) were determined. This paper describes the approach and official test for determining the LED heat gains...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} room-air {{stratification}} {{is critical to}} the design and operation of successful underfloor-air-distribution (UFAD) systems, representing an oftentimes complex balancing act: Increasing stratification by reducing airflow or mixing for a given <b>space</b> <b>heat</b> load saves energy, while decreasing stratification by boosting airflow or mixing for a given <b>space</b> <b>heat</b> load improves occupant comfort. The Center for the Built Environment (CBE) has conducted full-scale laboratory experiments to study the impact of stratification in interior and perimeter office spaces. Because the findings cover topics that are of considerable interest to the industry at this time, the following interim guidelines are offered. Each of the topics outlined in this article require more research for specific guidelines to be offered.
