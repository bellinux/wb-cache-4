50|$|In rock blasting, {{sympathetic}} detonations {{occur when}} the blastholes are sufficiently close to each other, usually 24in or less, and especially in rocks that poorly attenuate the <b>shock</b> <b>energy.</b> Ground water in open channels facilitates sympathetic detonation as well. Blasthole spacing of 36in or more is suggested. However, in some ditch blasting cases sympathetic detonations are exploited purposefully. Nitroglycerine-based explosives are especially susceptible. Picric acid is sensitive as well. Water gel explosives, slurry explosives, and emulsion explosives tend to be insensitive to sympathetic detonations. For most industrial explosives, the maximum distances for possible sympathetic detonations are between 2-8 times of the charge diameter. Uncontrolled sympathetic detonations may cause excessive ground vibrations and/or flying rocks.|$|E

40|$|Although {{diffusive}} shock acceleration (DSA) {{could be}} simulated by some well-established models, {{the assumption of}} the injection rate from the thermal particles to the superthermal population is still a contentious problem. But in the self-consistent Monte Carlo simulations, because of the prescribed scattering law instead of the assumption of the injected function, hence particle injection rate is intrinsically defined by the prescribed scattering law. We expect to examine the correlation of the energy injection with the prescribed multiple scattering angular distributions. According to the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, the energy injection and the losses in the simulation system can directly decide the <b>shock</b> <b>energy</b> spectrum slope.

40|$|The {{initial state}} of the porous {{elemental}} powders is taken at 298 °K. The final state is the fully reacted powders at the adiabatic temperature, T_(ad). Energy is input by the shock wave E_(shock) and by the negative enthalpy of formation ΔH_f of the silicide, E_(in) = E_(shock) – ΔH_f. The adiabatic process takes place on a closed system, and therefore T_(ad) depends only on the end points {{and not on the}} path of the process. We may therefore assume full reaction takes place first, followed by the input of the <b>shock</b> <b>energy.</b> Three regimes for T_(ad) are considered, where the heat of fusion of the silicide is given by ΔH_m. Define a function F(T_(upper)) as the integral of c_pdT from 298 °K to temperature T_(upper), where c_p is the specific heat of the silicide given by c_p = A+ 10 ^(- 3) BT+ 10 ^ 5 CT^(- 2) with constants A, B, and C. The input energy is converted to heat, and T_(ad) is obtained from: Regime I: T_(ad) T_m, v = 1, for E_(in) > F(T_m) + ΔH_m, and T_(ad) = T_m + [E_(in) - F(T_m) – ΔH_m]/c_(pl). The pressure dependence of the silicide melting points has not been determined and the zero pressure melting points were used in the calculations. (The silicon melting point decreases by 54 °K/GPa (2), while that of the metals increases (3).) An iterative method of solution was employed to obtain T_(ad) in regime I.

40|$|ObjectivesCardiac arrest after open surgery has an {{incidence}} of approximately 3 %, of {{which more than}} 50 % of the cases are due to ventricular fibrillation. Electrical defibrillation {{is the most effective}} therapy for terminating cardiac arrhythmias associated with unstable hemodynamics. The excitation threshold of myocardial microstructures is lower when external electrical fields are applied in the longitudinal direction with respect to the major axis of cells. However, in the heart, cell bundles are disposed in several directions. Improved myocardial excitation and defibrillation have been achieved by applying shocks in multiple directions via intracardiac leads, but the results are controversial when the electrodes are not located within the cardiac chambers. This study was designed to test whether rapidly switching shock delivery in 3 directions could increase the efficiency of direct defibrillation. MethodsA multidirectional defibrillator and paddles bearing 3 electrodes each were developed and used in vivo for the reversal of electrically induced ventricular fibrillation in an anesthetized open-chest swine model.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Conventional powder metallurgical techniques have the drawback in that metastable {{properties of the}} powder can be lost during the sintering stage. The use of shock waves to bond particles of powder together can, in principle, circumvent this drawback and produce bulk solids which retain metastable properties of the initial powder. However, {{the effects of the}} relevant shock and powder parameters on the final properties of the compacts must be understood before this technique can be used optimally. In the present investigation the influence of shock pressure, shock duration, and surface oxides on the mechanical and metallurgical properties of compacted steel, molybdenum, and nickel-molybdenum alloy powders were studied. In addition, to improve our fundamental understanding of shock waves in metallic powder media, the shock temperature at the junction between two layers of copper and constantan powders was measured via the thermoelectric effect for varying shock pressure and energy. The measured homogeneous temperatures in the copper-constantan powders varied from 150 C to 940 C as the <b>shock</b> <b>energy</b> was increased from 50 to 360 kJ/kg (shock pressure from 1. 3 to 9. 4 GPa). These results indicate that almost all of the energy in the shock front is converted into thermal energy. Furthermore, the rise time of the shock front is less than 23 ns which corresponds to a shock front width of less than 37 [ [...] . ],a dimension comparable to the powder particle diameter. 	 Rapidly solidified AISI 9310 steel powders were consolidated and the dependence of the microhardness and the ultimate tensile strength of the compacts on the <b>shock</b> <b>energy</b> from 94 to 770 kJ/kg (3. 6 to 19. 0 GPa) were measured for an initial powder distension of 1. 64 and a shock duration of 2 - 3 [ [...] . ]. Photomicrographs and SEM fractographs were used to study the interparticle bonding in the compacts. Results show that, for shock energies below 200 kJ/kg (4. 9 GPa), the compacts have negligble strength. However, above this threshold the strength of the compact rises rapidly until a maximum value of 1. 3 GPa is reached at a <b>shock</b> <b>energy</b> of 500 kJ/kg (12. 4 GPa). This strength which is larger than that of wrought AISI 9310 remains constant before decreasing at the higher shock energies. In marked contrast, with increasing <b>shock</b> <b>energy,</b> the diamond pyramid hardness increases very gradually from a value of 340 for the initial powder to 500 at a <b>shock</b> <b>energy</b> of 500 kJ/kg. Microhardness also begins to decrease at higher shock energies. The maximum strength obtained correlates well with the strength expected from microhardness measurements. 	 The AISI 9310 powders were also used to study the effect of shock duration on the compact's strength. Results indicate that, for consolidations with a <b>shock</b> <b>energy</b> of 400 kJ/kg (10 GPa), shock durations greater than 0. 4 [ [...] . ] are needed to produce strong compacts. This lower limit on shock duration {{can be attributed to the}} condition that the duration of the compressive shock wave must exceed the solidification and strengthening time of the melt produced by the shock wave. 	 Molybdenum powders with a distension of 1. 67 were used to study the effect of surface oxides. Results indicate that, by reducing the surface oxides, the tensile strength of the compact can be increased from nearly zero to 0. 76 GPa for a <b>shock</b> <b>energy</b> of 580 kJ/kg (17. 8 GPa). The final strength is comparable to that of bar stock of molybdenum. 	 Powders of glass forming Mark- 1064 alloy [ [...] . ] with a distension of 2. 0 were used to study the amount of melt produced during the shock consolidation process. Such measurements were possible because the melt was quenched rapidly enough to form the amorphous phase which could be delineated from the microcrystalline phase during metallographic examination. The results indicate that shock energies above 190 kJ/kg (3. 4 GPa) are required before the occurence of measurable melting. The amount of melt is much less than the upper bound limit and the melt distribution is nonuniform. 	 Finally, the conceptual understanding of the shock consolidation process is discussed and the criteria for producing well-bonded compacts are enumerated. These criteria can be conveniently expressed in terms of a shock consolidation map which plots a dimensionless shock duration versus a dimensionless <b>shock</b> <b>energy.</b> The existing models for the shock consolidation process are evaluated in light of the recently acquired results...|$|E

A step up protocol was used, delivering a 3  J/kg body weight dc shock, then a 4  J/kg shock (maximum 360  J), and finally a second 4  J/kg shock using the alternative paddle location.  RESULTS—The two groups were comparable for the all clinical variables evaluated. The cumulative percentage of patients successfully converted to sinus rhythm was 58 % in group AL and 67 % in group AP with low energy dc shock (NS); this rose to 76 % in group AL and to 87 % in group AP with high energy dc shock (p =  0. 013).

Results are reported for a Monte Carlo simulation that includes both the back reaction of accelerated particles on the inflowing plasma, producing a smoothing of the shock transition, and the free escape of particles allowing arbitrarily large overall compression ratios in high-Mach-number steady-state <b>shocks.</b> <b>Energy</b> spectra and estimates of the proportion of thermal ions accelerated to high energy are obtained...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the statistical analysis}} of energy distribution of strong seismic <b>shocks</b> (<b>energy</b> E ≥ 105 J) occurred in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin {{which is one of}} the most seismically active mining areas in the world. In the USCB tremor epicenters do not occur uniformly throughout the whole basin but group in several regions belonging to different structural units and are separated by regions where strong shocks are not observed. The aim of the studies was to determine the modality of the energy distributions and to compare the modal types in regions of the USCB where the shocks epicenters cluster. An analysis was made for <b>shocks</b> with <b>energies</b> equal to or greater than 105 J recorded by Upper Silesian Regional Seismological Network operated by Central Mining Institute (CMI), which took place between 1987 – 2012. The analysis has proven the bimodality of seismic energy distribution in the three of five studied areas of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. The Gumbel’s distribution II type best fit the experimental energy distribution for almost all studied tectonic units except the main syncline area, where the Gumbel’s distribution I type matched better the low-energy mode. This is due to too short time window, causing a shortage of the strongest shocks in seismic catalogue...|$|R
