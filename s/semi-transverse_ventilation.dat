40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to analyze the carbonation of the tunnel linings concentrating on the 7 public service-in road tunnels in Korea and to compare the trend of carbonation as to ventilation systems. The progress of carbonation in study was more conspicuous {{at the end of}} tunnels than the beginning of it. Likewise, it was remarkable in the tunnels of <b>semi-transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> and transverse ventilation system rather than natural ventilation system, because traffic and other contaminants are more in such ventilation systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of tunnel safety systems for fire protection and ventilation provision is evaluated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Ventilation safety systems {{commonly used in}} tunnels are reviewed first. The safety aspects related to tunnel fire and ventilation are then discussed. Air flow induced by an accidental vehicular fire in a tunnel is simulated using CFD. Based on the results, performances of different safety systems are evaluated and compared. Systems considered are longitudinal, semi-transverse, transverse, partial transverse, and combined longitudinal and <b>semi-transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses {{on the effects of}} the grid size, and number of iterations on the required computing time and accuracy of the results are carried out.

40|$|This work aims to the {{modeling}} of CO transport in one section considered {{critical of the}} Boqueron I tunnel, located {{on the outskirts of}} Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela, with a scenario where vehicles are stopped by an interruption of traffic. This scenario considers a relationship between the number of large-sized vehicles (buses or trucks) and small-sized vehicles (passenger cars) reported by transit statistics and also, it considers the <b>semi-transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> system in the tunnel. It is explored the influence of the ventilation on the flow patterns and its relationship to the regions with the highest CO concentration. The finite-volume based finite element method is used for the discretization of the computational domain and the integration of the governing equations. The transient 3 D-incompressible Navier-Stokes, energy, mass and species conservation equations, along with the k-e turbulence equations, were discretized, using higher-order numerical schemes in space. The numerical simulation is performed using a fully implicit coupled treatment of the set of resulting discrete transport equation...|$|E
40|$|Performing {{accurate}} measurements during {{a set of}} fire tests in a road tunnel is a notoriously difficult task to carry out. As in addition the full three-dimensional, unsteady problem is {{out of reach of}} numerical methods, the knowledge of the flow field inside road tunnels under fire conditions and also during normal operation is in many cases only approximate and partial. As a consequence, also the influence of road tunnel ventilation on fire development and spread are still not clarified, even for the simple longitudinal ventilation. Aiming at performing easy and accurate in situ measurements of the flow field in road tunnel under different conditions, a portable experimental facility including a survey rake with five bidirectional vane anemometers has been designed and built. This paper reports the design procedure of the measurement facility, all the details of the measurement chain and also results of the first experimental campaign carried out under the 11611 meters long Mont Blanc road tunnel. Unlike data provided by the S. C. A. D. A., a monotonic axial velocity profile resulted, which is theoretically justified in the case of <b>semi-transverse</b> <b>ventilation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Peer {{reviewed}} paper {{published in}} 2010 {{in the journal}} Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology. The capabilities of the ventilation systems in the two road tunnels at Dartford (London, UK) are analysed using a multi-scale modelling approach. Both tunnels have complex <b>semi-transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems with jet fans to control longitudinal flow. The construction and ventilation systems in the tunnels are described and the current emergency ventilation strategies are presented. The analysis includes a coupling of a 1 D network model with 3 D components, representing the operational jet fans, built using computational fluid dynamics. The jet fans were experimentally characterized on-site and the findings were compared to the model predictions. The predicted ventilation flows {{for each of the}} emergency ventilation strategies are presented and discussed. In cold-flow conditions, ventilation velocities significantly above 3 m/s can be generated throughout the tunnels. However, it is observed that 1 / 3 of the flow generated in the East tunnel is diverted from the tunnel up the extract shafts. The model was used to simulate various reduced fan combinations and thus the level of redundancy in each of the systems has been estimated. It is found that an acceptable level of ventilation may be produced in the West tunnel, even if several pairs of jet fans are disabled. In the East tunnel there is less redundancy, but an acceptable level of ventilation control can be maintained with one or two jet fans disabled...|$|E
40|$|Since the COINTE tunnel in Liege, Belgium, {{had been}} {{designed}} for a <b>semi-transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, the solution commonly adopted {{with this kind of}} system in case of fire, is extracting smoke through openings in the roof. The dimensions of these openings, as well as the extracting capacity of the entire fan system are calculated according to some thumb rules, themselves, of course, being determined by the so-called "maximum " heat release rates of a fire that the designers agree on to take into account. However, besides a sufficient extracting capacity, of equal importance, if not more, is having the smoke movements in the tunnel under control. Experience and simulations show that this control is at best achieved with a longitudinal ventilation system. Hence, the combination of both ventilation systems would normally cover a wider range of fires. Simulations on computer showed indeed that, if the COINTE tunnel has to allow traffic of dangerous goods, the initial solution would by far not suffice to master high fire loads that can go up to [...] . 250 [...] . 300 MW. The objective of the paper is to discuss this solution, probably unique, that the authors propose for the COINTE tunnel. Based on information from literature, and own experience, the paper reviews the current state of art. It develops the underlying assumptions where the design in general, and that of the COINTE tunnel in particular, is based on...|$|E
