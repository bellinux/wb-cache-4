40|$|Objective To {{fabricate}} hemostatic gelatin {{for surgery}} in Chiang Mai University, and then study it for characterization, and animal and clinical trials. Materials and methods Medical grade gelatin powder was fabricated to gelatin sponge by using boiled water and lyophilization, before sterilizing with gamma ray. Laboratory charac-terization used ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry for water solubility, ignition for residual ash, digestion by enzyme pepsin, water absorption, and sterilization in bacterial agar. The animal trial used soft tissue implantation for the biocompatibility test and real-time hemostasis compared with standard hemostatic agent. The clinical trial {{was carried out}} in 50 neurosurgical volunteers. Results Gelatin powder could be processed to <b>sponge</b> <b>plate</b> with three dimensions inter-connecting with continuous porosity. The material was not soluble in water after being immersed for 7 d, water absorption was 41. 7 times that of dry weight, residual ash was 1. 37 % after ignition and the material was completely digested by enzyme pepsin in 46. 7 min, with no bacterial growth seen in the cultural agar. After implantation in the soft tissue of rats, th...|$|R

40|$|Changes in habitat-forming organisms {{can have}} complex {{consequences}} for associated species. Sessile epibenthic glass “plate” sponges (Porifera: Hexactinellida) are conspicuous inhabitants of soft-sediment abyssal areas and their siliceous spicules create persistent spicule patches on the seafloor. Sponge spicule patch density, spatial dispersion, and percent cover were examined over a seven-year period (2006 – 2013) using {{remotely operated vehicle}} videos from Station M in the abyssal northeast Pacific (50 ˚ 00 N, 123 ˚ 00 W, 4, 000 m depth).

Among the 28 megafaunal taxa occurring {{in association with}} the patches, the distribu-tions of three taxa [two sponge taxa (Porifera) and brittle stars (Ophiuroidea) ] suggested selectivity for the sponge spicule patches. The community structure of visible mega-fauna within sponge spicule patches was different when compared with that outside the patches suggesting that the sponges, after death, provide preferred habitat patches for certain benthic megafauna. These findings indicate that sponge spicule patches contribute to habitat heterogeneity in space and time...|$|R

The battery consisted of seven pasted lead-antimony grid positives and eight plated copper-screen egatives covered with sponge cadmium. Open-circuit voltage is ap-proximately 2. 4. The batteries were discharged at the constant current density shown in Fig. 1. The performance characteristics are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. Table I shows the capacity of a representative cadmium-lead peroxide cell at various discharge rates and at tempera-tures of- 28. 9 ~ (- 20 ~ to + 26. 7 ~ (80 ~ Lower dis-charge voltages and lower capacities result when batteries are dry-stored for extended periods. The sponge-cadmium cells have a slightly higher discharge voltage and a shghtly greater capacity than the lead-lead peroxide cells at higher discharge rates and at lower tempera-tures. They also are lighter in weight. This system has been adapted to special military-purpose units where high drain and light weight are important factors. These units must be used promptly after activation since <b>sponge</b> cadmium <b>plates</b> react vigorously with the sulfuric acid electrolyte, with liberation of hydrogen.

40|$|Improved {{sanitation}} procedures during {{shell egg}} processing {{may reduce the}} risk of food-borne illness. Experiments were conducted to determine the ability of an alcohol-quaternary ammonium sanitizer or water to reduce Salmonella inoculated onto stainless steel and shell egg processing equipment. A nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella typhimurium (ST) isolate was grown on agar plates at 37 °C for 18 - 24 h; cells were harvested and added to Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to generate 8. 5 Salmonella cells/mL inoculum in two experiments. Both experiments were repeated twice. In the first experiment four stainless steel beakers were contaminated by spraying 10 mL of inoculum, respectively. Beakers were allowed to dry for 15 min. Two of the beakers were sprayed with 20 mL of water and the other two were sprayed with a sanitizer solution (70 % isopropyl alcohol and 200 ppm quaternary ammonium). After 5 min and 24 h each beaker was swabbed with a PBS moistened <b>sponge</b> and <b>plated</b> onto BGS supplemented with 200 ppm nalidixic acid to enumerate surviving ST. In the second experiment, inoculum was sprayed onto two brushes from shell egg packing machinery. After 15 min, one brush was sprayed with water for five min and the other was sprayed with the sanitizer for 30 s. Each brush was sampled by swabbing three times after 5 min and 24 h. After 5 min, 5. 5 and 0. 6 log CFU/mL ST and after 24 h, 2. 8 and 0. 0 log CFU/mL ST were recovered from stainless steel, respectively. Packer head brush average results were 4. 7 and 3. 1 log CFU/mL ST after 5 min and were 4. 0 and 0. 00 log CFU/ml ST after 24 h. This sanitizer solution and delivery system were 100 to 10, 000 times more effective than water in reducing Salmonella numbers...|$|R
40|$|Quarrying {{across a}} {{potential}} GSSP {{of the base}} of Cambrian Stage 5 /Series 3 at the Wuliu-Zengjianyan section in south China indicates {{a significant change in}} trilobite and brachiopod faunas. The Wuliu Quarry spans approximately 4. 5 m across the potential boundary, which is the FAD of Oryctocephalus indicus (Reed, 1910) in the Wuliu-Zengjiayan section of the Kaili Formation. Trilobite taxa found consist of one Pagetia, one Redlichia, one Burlingia, two Olenoides, eleven oryctocephalid, and seven ptychopariid species. Non-trilobite taxa found in the Wuliu Quarry, but not described in this publication, include tubular shells, inarticulate and articulate brachiopods, molluscs, echinoderm <b>plates,</b> <b>sponges,</b> algae, acritarchs, and trace fossils. Collected specimens display both flattening, secondary calcite preservation, and tectonic distortion. Many of the species have previously been based on length to width ratios. Given the range of morphologies demonstrated in these collections, several previously named species have been synonymized. Detailed collections from the Wuliu Quarry show that the faunas of the Ovatoryctocara cf. granulata-Bathyonotus holopygus and the O. indicus zones changed in a 20 cm, relatively barren interval. This faunal turnover does not coincide with a lithologic change and suggests that the section would be a good location for the GSSP of the base of Cambrian Stage 5 /Series 3...|$|R
