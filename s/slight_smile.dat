5|$|The {{limestone}} {{sculpture of}} Seneb {{and his family}} {{is part of the}} collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E
2500|$|Without {{hesitation}} {{and knowing}} {{the fate of}} his community hung on his answer, Reb Kalish told the translator (in Yiddish): [...] "Zugim weil wir senen orientalim—Tell him [...] because we are Orientals." [...] The governor, whose face had been stern throughout the confrontation, broke into a <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b> In spite of the military alliance, he did not accede to the German demand and the Shanghai Jews were never handed over.|$|E
60|$|Mr Hatton {{shook his}} head with a <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> of contemptuous incredulity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, sir,' said Mannering, {{without the}} <b>slightest</b> <b>smile</b> of sympathy, 'but to the purpose. You {{say that this}} lady had power to settle her estate on Miss Bertram, and that she did so?' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him, and a <b>slight</b> {{sinister}} <b>smile</b> contracted her white face.|$|R
6000|$|Mary Louise {{caught the}} <b>slight,</b> scornful <b>smile</b> {{that for a}} moment curled Alora's lips. But the girl replied very seriously: ...|$|R
60|$|A <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> {{hovered over}} the other's lips, but he quickly {{controlled}} it.|$|E
60|$|He {{returned}} her gaze steadily, but {{shook his head}} with a <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|A <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> flickered {{upon her}} lips. The man's adroitness always excited her admiration.|$|E
60|$|But then most refreshingly {{she picked}} up Mr. Direck's gaze {{and gave him the}} <b>slightest</b> of <b>smiles.</b> She hadn't {{forgotten}} him.|$|R
60|$|They {{seemed to}} know Peggy at Rector's. Paul, the head waiter, beamed upon her paternally. One or two men turned and looked after her as she passed. The waiters <b>smiled</b> <b>slight</b> but {{friendly}} <b>smiles.</b> Rutherford, intent on her, noticed none of these things.|$|R
40|$|He painted her {{for nothing}} but her love, A Cherbourg tailor’s {{daughter}} without means    For such a tender rendering as this: Desirous, tense, yet teasingly serene, Those earth-brown irises, that <b>slightest</b> <b>smile,</b> Hair clipped, severe, in a tied ribboned cap, The look of expectation, quiet surprise Directed at this man her brother knew Who stroked her {{there with his}} dark oils and eyes Until she came alive on canvas threads That held her as he held her when they wed. And though she soon would pa [...] ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{the divine}} {{inclined}} his head, though the assent {{was accompanied by}} <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|A <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> {{seemed to}} move {{the corner of the}} lip that was on his side.|$|E
60|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders. There was a <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> upon {{his lips and}} his eyes twinkled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] said Boardman, {{showing his}} teeth, fine {{and even as}} grains of pop-corn, in a <b>slight</b> sarcastic <b>smile.</b> [...] "Sort of poetical justice," [...] he suggested.|$|R
60|$|Sally {{listened to}} all this with a <b>slight,</b> slow <b>smile,</b> not much embarrassed, for she was {{accustomed}} to her father's outbursts, but with an easy modesty which was very attractive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, Beniah," [...] {{interrupted}} the girl, with the <b>slightest</b> possible <b>smile.</b> [...] "You are a dear, good old creature, and I know you won't betray me. Remember your solemn promise." ...|$|R
60|$|Helen showed it. He {{glanced at}} the initials, and laid it down with a <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{stood in}} {{the opening of the}} doorway looking at them, a <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> upon his lips.|$|E
60|$|Mary cast {{down her}} eyes, and {{the corners of}} her mouth twitched as if with a <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|Automatically, {{her first}} act {{had been to}} set the coffee-pot back. It was not until she had done this that she glanced at Messner. But already he had {{composed}} himself. She saw only a man {{sitting on the edge}} of the bunk and incuriously studying the toes of his moccasins. But, as she turned casually to go about her cooking, he shot another swift look at her, and she, glancing as swiftly back, caught his look. He shifted on past her to the doctor, though the <b>slightest</b> <b>smile</b> curled his lip in appreciation of the way she had trapped him.|$|R
60|$|She paid no heed to this, {{except that}} he noticed her face now wore a <b>slight</b> {{constrained}} <b>smile</b> {{as she looked at}} him. She was shy. Still she continued to regard him curiously.|$|R
6000|$|She {{stood still}} with {{repulsion}} and uncertainty. Mr. Harby, large and male, with his overhanging moustache, stood {{by with a}} <b>slight,</b> ugly <b>smile</b> {{at the corner of}} his eyes. The woman went on insidiously, not quite human: ...|$|R
60|$|After a {{while she}} ventured to speak of her own plans and hopes. He listened with a <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} sparkling. Falkner withdrew his own with a <b>slight</b> <b>smile,</b> {{and raised his}} rifle with {{provoking}} deliberation.|$|E
60|$|I {{closed the}} door. Lady Angela was {{lounging}} in my easy {{chair with a}} <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> upon her lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think {{everybody}} seems {{happy to be}} your guest," [...] she replied, parrying, as was her custom, with a <b>slight</b> kind <b>smile,</b> and a low, sweet, unembarrassed voice, any personal allusion from Lothair of unusual energy or ardor.|$|R
6000|$|Those {{were exactly}} my own foolish words, for which I could have beaten myself afterwards; but Mr. Castleford only gave a <b>slight</b> grave <b>smile,</b> and said, 'You mean that your brother's real defect is in courage, moral and physical.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you over-rate my abilities," [...] he said, with a <b>slight</b> deprecating <b>smile.</b> [...] "But at any rate, please {{be sure of}} one thing. You could not have asked the advice of anyone more anxious to serve you." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{silence was}} prolonged. Then {{he glanced up}} to find her {{watching}} him with a <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> curving her lips.|$|E
60|$|She moved {{aside to}} let him pass, and sat {{listening}} with a <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> as she heard him moving about the room.|$|E
60|$|They {{heard the}} nurse at the door, and Philip hurriedly got up. The nurse entered. There was a <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> on her lips.|$|E
60|$|It was at {{this point}} that {{interrupting}} his flow of talk to light his pipe but holding us with his eye he inquired whether we had known Powell. Marlow with a <b>slight</b> reminiscent <b>smile</b> murmured that he remembered him very well.|$|R
60|$|Emma {{looked at}} Edwin for a second, and, with a <b>slight</b> but perplexed <b>smile</b> of acknowledgment, passed on.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave me a}} <b>slight,</b> odd <b>smile,</b> and ran back. Her {{face was}} long and sallow and her nose rather red. But her gloomy black eyes {{softened}} caressively {{to me for a}} moment, with that momentary humility which makes a man lord of the earth.|$|R
