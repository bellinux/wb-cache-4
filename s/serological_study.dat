50|$|Quaranfil {{virus is}} the type virus of the Quaranjavirus genus in the virus family Orthomyxoviridae. It has a {{negative}} sense, single-stranded RNA genome composed of 6 segments. Its hosts are ticks, birds, and humans. It was isolated from ticks near Cairo, Egypt in 1953. The virus can infect humans, as confirmed by <b>serological</b> <b>study</b> of human serum samples in Egypt in the 1960s that showed that 8% of the local population had neutralizing antibodies to the virus. The virus {{has not yet been}} connected to a human disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{field of}} {{biochemistry}} has greatly developed since Darwin's time, and this <b>serological</b> <b>study</b> {{is one of}} the most recent pieces of evidence of evolution. A number of biochemical products like nucleic acids, enzymes, hormones and phosphagens clearly show the relationship of all life forms. The composition of body fluid has shown that the first life originated in the oceans. The presence of nitrogenous waste products reveal the aquatic ancestry of vertebrates, and the nature of visual pigments points out the fresh water ancestry of land vertebrates. Serological tests indicate relationships within these animal phyla.|$|E
5000|$|Recently, {{a second}} type of canine {{coronavirus}} (Group II) {{has been shown to}} cause respiratory disease in dogs. [...] Known as canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) and found to be similar to strain OC43 of bovine and human coronaviruses, it was first isolated in the United Kingdom in 2003 from lung samples of dogs and has since been found on the European mainland and in Japan. [...] A <b>serological</b> <b>study</b> in 2006 has also shown antibodies to CRCoV to be present in dogs in Canada and the United States.

40|$|Background <b>Serological</b> <b>studies</b> {{can detect}} {{infection}} {{with a novel}} influenza virus {{in the absence of}} symptoms or positive virology, providing useful information on infection that goes beyond the estimates from epidemiological, clinical and virological data. During the 2009 A(H 1 N 1) pandemic, an impressive number of detailed <b>serological</b> <b>studies</b> were performed, yet the majority of serological data were available only after the first wave of infection. This limited the ability to estimate the transmissibility and severity of this novel infection, and the variability in methodology and reporting limited the ability to compare and combine the serological data. Objectives To identify best practices for conduct and standardisation of <b>serological</b> <b>studies</b> on outbreak and pandemic influenza to inform public policy. Methods/Setting An international meeting was held in February 2011 in Ottawa, Canada, to foster the consensus for greater standardisation of influenza <b>serological</b> <b>studies.</b> Results Best practices for serological investigations of influenza epidemiology include the following: classification of studies as pre-pandemic, outbreak, pandemic or inter-pandemic with a clearly identified objective; use of international serum standards for laboratory assays; cohort and cross-sectional study designs with common standards for data collection; use of serum banks to improve sampling capacity; and potential for linkage of serological, clinical and epidemiological data. Advance planning for outbreak studies would enable a rapid and coordinated response; inclusion of <b>serological</b> <b>studies</b> in pandemic plans should be considered. Conclusions Optimising the quality, comparability and combinability of influenza <b>serological</b> <b>studies</b> will provide important data upon emergence of a novel or variant influenza virus to inform public health action. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|The {{discovery}} of a new ANCA antigen termed lysosomal associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) stirred lot of excitement in the ANCA research community recently. [...] The UNC research team set up a collaborative and comprehensive <b>serological</b> <b>study</b> to determine the prevalence of the antibodies against LAMP-2 antigen in ANCA glomerulonephritis patient cohorts. Sera samples were tested at both UNC-Kidney Center, NC, and at Massachusetts General Hospital, MA. In stark contrast to previous reports, anti-LAMP-2 autoantibodies were not present in patient cohorts at a frequency higher than found in the general population. The UNC group concluded that anti-LAMP-2 antibodies are identifiable, low titer, natural or induced antibodies occasionally found in the population and not a marker of disease.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Vector-borne infections namely dirofilariosis, ehrlichiosis, {{anaplasmosis}} and lyme borreliosis {{are being}} recognized as emerging and/or re-emerging problems in dogs and man due to rapid extension of zoogeographical ranges of many causative agents through international tourism and increase mobility of dogs at {{national and international}} level towards meeting the demand for companion animals in the present day society. Anticipating such situation, a <b>serological</b> <b>study</b> was conducted in dogs from North East India to estimate the prevalence of zoonotically important Dirofilaria immitis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi along with Ehrlichia canis.

The report shows that the diagnostic criteria for SLE proposed by the American Rheumatology Association may not be fulfilled at the time of the initial evaluation in all cases, and that some patients may exhibit signs attributable to primary renal disease.

40|$|Mosaic {{disease of}} maize and grasses is {{commonly}} found in Sulawesi. The symptoms resemble the common mosaic symptoms of virus infection, but the pathogen has not been identified. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the causal agent of the mosaic disease of maize and grasses in Sulawesi. Transmissions of the virus were studied by mechanical inoculation and the insect vector aphid. <b>Serological</b> <b>study</b> was done by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
