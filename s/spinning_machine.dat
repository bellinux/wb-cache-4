25|$|In Yorkshire, a mill is {{a textile}} factory. The {{original}} mill {{was built by}} John Moore in 1875 for worsted spinning. In 1919 the clock tower was built as a war memorial to those lost in World War I, and two floors were added. The mill was later sold to W & J Whitehead, who ran the ring <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> which {{is still in the}} spinning gallery. In 1970 Bradford Council bought the mill and it opened as a museum on 14 December 1974.|$|E

Here he was put to operate a <b>spinning</b> <b>machine.</b> On 8 May 1857 his right arm was entangled in a cogwheel and mangled so badly it had to be amputated. He did not receive any compensation.|$|E
25|$|In 1893 Leeds {{had been}} granted city status. These {{industries}} that developed in the industrial revolution had included making machinery for <b>spinning,</b> <b>machine</b> tools, steam engines and gears {{as well as other}} industries based on textiles, chemicals and leather and pottery. Coal was extracted on a large scale and the still functioning Middleton Railway, the first successful commercial steam locomotive railway in the world, transported coal into the centre of Leeds. The track was the first rack railway and the locomotive (Salamanca) was the first to have twin cylinders.|$|E

25|$|Powell's Pool {{was created}} in 1730 as a millpond for Powell's Pool Mill, a steel-rolling mill. In 1733, a cotton <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> was tested at the mill by John Wyatt {{with the help of}} Lewis Paul, helping to kickstart the {{creation}} of the UK's cotton industry in the 18th century. In total, Sutton Coldfield has had 15 watermills, 13 of which were powered by Plants Brook, and the remaining two using an independent water supply. There were also two windmills in the town, at Maney Hill and at Langley.|$|E
25|$|The {{spinning}} mule spins {{textile fibres}} into yarn by an intermittent process. In the draw stroke, the roving is pulled through rollers and twisted; {{on the return}} it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the throstle frame or ring frame uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule {{was the most common}} <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1,320 spindles, which would operate four times a minute for 56 hours a week.|$|E
25|$|Spinning is {{the final}} stage in {{converting}} wool to worsted yarns, the roving being drawn out to its final thickness and twist added for strength. There are three types of <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> or frame in common use in the United Kingdom, namely flyer, cap and ring. Another machine used for spinning worsted yarns is the worsted mule. All three types of machine or frame are similar in their method of drawing out or drafting the roving to make the required count or thickness, but differ {{in the way in}} which twist is imparted and the yarn wound onto the bobbin. Drafting takes place between the back and front rollers. The front rollers revolve faster than the back ones, drawing out the roving to the fineness of yarn required. Between the rollers are carriers which support and help to control the fibres as they are being drafted.|$|E

500|$|Silk {{was made}} using various breeds of lepidopterans, both wild and domestic. While wild silks were {{produced}} in many countries, {{there is no}} doubt that the Chinese were the first to begin production on such a large scale, having the most effective species for silk production, the Bombyx mandarina and its domesticated descendent B. mori. Chinese sources claim the existence of a machine to unwind silkworm cocoons in 1090. The cocoons were placed in a large basin of hot water, the silk would leave the cauldron by tiny guiding rings, and would be wound onto a large spool, thanks to a backwards and forward motion. Little information exists about spinning techniques in use in China. [...] The spinning wheel, in all likelihood moved by hand, was known by the beginning of the Christian era. The first accepted image of a spinning wheel appears in 1210. There is an image of a silk <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> powered by a water wheel that dates to 1313.|$|E

2500|$|In 1738, Lewis Paul (one of the {{community}} of Huguenot weavers that had been driven out of France in a wave of religious persecution) settled in Birmingham and with John Wyatt, of that town, they patented the Roller <b>Spinning</b> <b>machine</b> and the flyer-and-bobbin system, for drawing wool to a more even thickness. [...] Using two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds yarn could be twisted and spun quickly and efficiently. [...] This was later used in the first cotton spinning mill during the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

For the company Linum-Taussig Kornél Tolnai also worked as a {{supervisor}} {{in the city of}} Győr (German: Raab) at their <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> factory there. Győr is the most important industrial city of northwest Hungary and is situated about 30km from Budapest between Budapest and Vienna, with waggons and machinery factories. The factory system began widespread use somewhat later when cotton spinning of textiles was mechanized.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advent of}} the Industrial Revolution in Britain {{provided}} a great boost to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain's leading export. In 1738, Lewis Paul and John Wyatt, of Birmingham, England, patented the roller <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> {{as well as the}} flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later, the invention of the James Hargreaves' spinning jenny in 1764, Richard Arkwright's spinning frame in 1769 and Samuel Crompton's spinning mule in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of Manchester acquired the nickname [...] "Cottonopolis" [...] due to the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the heart of the global cotton trade.|$|E

2500|$|In 1789, {{due to a}} lack {{of trade}} in the Darlington flax mills, Murray and his family moved to Leeds to work for John Marshall, who was to become a {{prominent}} flax manufacturer. John Marshall had rented a small mill at Adel, for the purpose of manufacture but also to develop a pre-existing flax-spinning machine, with the aid of Matthew Murray. After some trial and error, to overcome the problem of breakages in the flax twine during the spinning of the flax, sufficient improvements were made to enable John Marshall to undertake the construction of a new mill at Holbeck in 1791, Murray was in charge of the installation. The installation included new flax-spinning machines of his own design, which Murray patented in 1790. In 1793 Murray took out a second patent on a design for [...] "Instruments and Machines for Spinning Fibrous Materials". His patent included a carding engine and a <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> that introduced the new technique of [...] "wet spinning" [...] flax, which revolutionised the flax trade.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spinning}} frame or water frame {{was developed by}} Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright. [...] For each spindle, the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle. [...] The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length. [...] Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread. [...] The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight. [...] The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length. [...] The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth {{to be made in}} Britain. [...] A horse powered the first factory to use the {{spinning frame}}. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.|$|E
