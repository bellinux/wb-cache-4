5|$|Agriculture in Wales {{is heavily}} subsidised by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy with farmers getting annual {{payments}} {{for the area}} they farm.

5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Arnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia, {{and was a}} {{prominent}} figure on the social scene. During the summer of 1778, he met Peggy Shippen, the 18-year-old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen, a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city. Peggy had been courted by British Major John André during the British occupation of Philadelphia. Peggy and Arnold married on April 8, 1779. Peggy and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramours across the battle lines, despite military bans on communication with the enemy. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> communication was effected through the services of Joseph Stansbury, a Philadelphia merchant.|$|E

5|$|Aside from fossils clearly {{belonging}} to Plateosaurus, {{there is much}} prosauropod material from the German Knollenmergel in museum collections, most of it labeled as Plateosaurus, that {{does not belong to}} the type species and possibly not to Plateosaurus at all. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> material is not diagnostic; other material has been recognized to be different, but was never sufficiently described.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|Carter also {{reflects}} on the intriguing possibility, however remote, that a discovery in an unexplored library might one day bring <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> missing music to light. As of 2015 this has not occurred; however, a setting of Rinuccini's libretto by the British composer Alexander Goehr was performed at London's Royal Opera House on 15 September 1995, under the title Arianna. Goehr worked from Rinuccini's original script and, {{as a tribute to}} the historic opera, incorporated sections of Monteverdi's setting of the lament into his score.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower was commercially successful, selling {{close to}} half a million copies. Kono {{attributed}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> success to Resident Evil generating interest in horror games {{and the success of}} the PlayStation. Critical reviews of Clock Tower were mixed. The game's horror atmosphere and storyline were praised, although most other aspects were found to be mediocre. Most of the negative critique was directed towards the game's slow pace, which was compared unfavorably to other PlayStation games of the era, particularly the more action-oriented and fast-paced Resident Evil. These factors influenced some critics to recommend Clock Tower purely for point-and-click adventure fans.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky, the Indiana cities of Jeffersonville, New Albany, and Port Fulton saw increased trade and military activity. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> increase {{was due to}} Kentucky's desire to stay neutral in the war. In addition, Kentucky was home to many Confederate sympathizers. Military bases in southern Indiana were needed to support Union operations against Confederates in Kentucky, and it was safer to store war supplies in towns {{on the north side}} of the River. Jeffersonville served as an important military depot for Union troops heading south. Towards the end of the war, Port Fulton was home to the third-largest hospital in the United States, Jefferson General Hospital.|$|E
