40|$|International audienceThe Hedgehog (HH) {{signaling}} pathway is crucial {{for the development of}} many organisms and its inappropriate activation is involved in numerous cancers. HH signal controls the traffic and activity of the seven-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO), leading to the transcriptional regulation of HH-responsive genes. In Drosophila, the intracellular transduction events following SMO activation depend on cytoplasmic multimeric complexes that include the Fused (FU) protein kinase. Here we show that the regulatory domain of FU physically interacts with the last 52 amino acids of SMO and that the two proteins colocalize in vivo to vesicles. The deletion of this region of SMO leads to a constitutive activation of SMO, promoting the ectopic transcription of HH target genes. This activation is partially dependent of FU activity. Thus, we identify a novel link between SMO and the cytoplasmic complex(es) and reveal a negative role of the SMO C-terminal region that interacts with FU. We propose that FU could act as a <b>switch,</b> <b>activator</b> in presence of HH signal or inhibitor in absence of HH...|$|E
40|$|Kaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (also called human herpesvirus type 8 [HHV 8]) latently infects {{a number}} of cell types. Reactivation of latent virus can occur by treatment with the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) or with the transfection of plasmids expressing the lytic <b>switch</b> <b>activator</b> protein K-Rta, the gene product of ORF 50. K-Rta expression is sufficient for the activation of the entire lytic cycle and the transactivation of viral genes necessary for DNA replication. In addition, recent evidence has suggested that K-Rta may participate directly in the initiation of lytic DNA synthesis. We have now generated a recombinant HHV 8 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) with a large deletion within the ORF 50 locus. This BAC, BAC 36 Δ 50, failed to produce infectious virus upon treatment with TPA and was defective for DNA synthesis. Expression of K-Rta in trans in BAC 36 Δ 50 -containing cells was able to abolish both defects. Real-time PCR revealed that K-bZIP, ORF 40 / 41, and K 8. 1 were not expressed when BAC 36 Δ 50 -containing cells were induced with TPA. However, the mRNA levels of ORF 57 were over fivefold higher in TPA-treated BAC 36 Δ 50 -containing cells than those observed in similarly treated wild-type BAC-containing cells. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis showed that while the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) was expressed in the mutant BAC-containing cells, ORF 59 and K 8. 1 expression was not detected in TPA-induced BAC 36 Δ 50 -containing cells. These results showed that K-Rta is essential for lytic viral reactivation and transactivation of viral genes contributing to DNA replication...|$|E

They use different DNA-binding domains for target recognition. Most interestingly, Eyg acts exclusively as a repressor, whereas Ey is an activator. Several vertebrate Pax proteins are known to <b>switch</b> between <b>activator</b> and repressor activities, but none as repressors only.

40|$|Studies of gene {{regulation}} {{have revealed that}} several transcriptional regulators can <b>switch</b> between <b>activator</b> and repressor depending upon both the promoter and the cellular context. A relatively simple prokaryotic example {{is illustrated by the}} Escherichia coli CytR regulon. In this system, the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) assists the binding of RNA polymerase as well as a specific negative regulator, CytR. Thus, CRP functions either as an activator or as a corepressor. Here we show that, depending on promoter architecture, the CRP/CytR nucleoprotein complex has opposite effects on transcription. When acting from a site close to the DNA target for RNA polymerase, CytR interacts with CRP to repress transcription, whereas an interaction with CRP from appropriately positioned upstream binding sites can result in formation of a huge preinitiation complex and transcriptional activation. Based on recent results about CRP-mediated regulation of transcription initiation and the finding that CRP possesses discrete surface-exposed patches for protein-protein interaction with RNA polymerase and CytR, a molecular model for this dual regulation is discussed...|$|R

The transcription factor Net is activated by phosphorylation induced by Ras, an indirect regulator of angiogenesis. Net is expressed at sites of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during early mouse development, suggesting that it could have a role in blood vessel formation. We show here that down-regulation of Net inhibits angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. Ras-activated phosphorylated Net (P-Net) stimulates the mouse VEGF promoter through the - 80 to - 53 region that principally binds Sp 1. P-Net and VEGF are coexpressed in angiogenic processes in wild-type mouse tissues and in human tumors. We conclude that Net is a regulator of angiogenesis that can <b>switch</b> to an <b>activator</b> following induction by pro-angiogenic molecules...|$|R

Our mutation and perturbation analysis revealed the inputs to each of the modules. The complex and dynamic expression of foxa is regulated by a combination of repressors, permissive <b>switches</b> and localized <b>activators.</b> We applied a kinetic model to solve a critical question regarding foxa dynamic regulation.

40|$|Bmper, {{which is}} {{orthologous}} to Drosophila melanogaster crossveinless 2, is a secreted factor that regulates Bmp activity in a tissue- and stage-dependent manner. Both pro- and anti-Bmp activities have been postulated for Bmper, although the molecular mechanisms through which Bmper affects Bmp signaling are unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that as molar concentrations of Bmper exceed Bmp 4, Bmper dynamically <b>switches</b> from an <b>activator</b> to an inhibitor of Bmp 4 signaling. Inhibition of Bmp 4 through a novel endocytic trap-and-sink mechanism {{leads to the}} efficient degradation of Bmper and Bmp 4 by the lysosome. Bmper-mediated internalization of Bmp 4 reduces the duration and magnitude of Bmp 4 -dependent Smad signaling. We also determined that Noggin and Gremlin, but not Chordin, trigger endocytosis of Bmps. This endocytic transport pathway expands the extracellular roles of selective Bmp modulators to include intracellular regulation. This dosage-dependent molecular switch resolves discordances among studies that examine how Bmper regulates Bmp activity and has broad implications for Bmp signal regulation by secreted mediators...|$|R

Four separate cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) cooperate to control foxa expression in different spatial domains of the endomesoderm, and at different times.

40|$|When a cell's {{environment}} changes, a large transcriptional response {{often takes}} place. The exquisite {{sensitivity and specificity}} of these responses are controlled {{in large part by}} the combinations of cis-regulatory elements that reside in gene promoters and adjacent control regions. Here, we present a study aimed at accurately modeling the relationship between combinations of cis-regulatory elements and the expression levels they drive in different environments. We constructed four libraries of synthetic promoters in yeast, consisting of combinations of transcription factor binding sites and assayed their expression in four different environments. Thermodynamic models relating promoter sequences to their corresponding four expression levels explained at least 56 % of the variation in expression in each library through the different conditions. Analyses of these models suggested that a large fraction of regulated gene expression is explained by changes in the effective concentration of sequence-specific transcription factors, and we show that in most cases, the corresponding transcription factors are expressed in a pattern that is predicted by the thermodynamic models. Our analysis uncovered two binding sites that <b>switch</b> from <b>activators</b> to repressors in different environmental conditions. In both the cases, the switch was not the result of a single transcription factor changing regulatory modes, but most likely due to competition between multiple factors binding to the same site. Our analysis suggests that this mode of regulation allows for large and steep changes in expression in response to changing transcription factor concentrations. Our results demonstrate that many complex changes in gene expression are accurately explained by simple changes in the effective concentrations of transcription factors...|$|R
40|$|Serum amyloid A (SAA), one of {{the major}} acute-phase proteins, {{increases}} several hundredfold in concentration in plasma following acute inflammation, primarily {{as a result of a}} 200 -fold increase in its transcriptional rate. Functional analysis of the rat SAA 1 promoter has identified a 65 -bp cytokine response unit (CRU; positions - 135 to - 71) that could confer cytokine responsiveness on a heterologous promoter. Within this CRU, two cis-regulatory elements, corresponding to NF-kappa B- and C/EBP-binding sites, were found to be functionally important and exerted synergistic effects on induced SAA 1 expression. In this report, we show that a third transcription factor interacts with the CRU through a region located between the NF-kappa B- and C/EBP-binding sites. On the basis of its gel mobility shift patterns, ubiquitous binding activity, sequence specificity of DNA binding, zinc-dependent binding activity, and gel mobility supershift by specific antibodies, we concluded that this factor is identical to YY 1. Methylation interference studies revealed that YY 1 binding sequences overlapped with those of NF-kappa B, and gel mobility studies showed that NF-kappa binding to the CRU was effectively inhibited by YY 1. Consistent with its presumed antagonistic role to NF-kappa B, YY 1 exerted a negative effect on SAA 1 expression, whereas disruption of its binding in the promoter elevated basal and cytokine-induced activities. Furthermore, overexpression of YY 1 trans-repressed SAA 1 promoter activity. Thus, our results demonstrate that SAA 1 expression is tightly regulated by an on-off <b>switch</b> of <b>activators</b> and repressors, presumably to ensure that it is expressed only under appropriate physiological conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work we extend {{and analyze the}} scope of our {{recently}} proposed stochastic model for transcriptional regulation, which considers an arbitrarily complex cis-regulatory system using only elementary reactions. Previously, we determined the role of cooperativity on the intrinsic fluctuations of gene expression for activating transcriptional switches, by means of master equation formalism and computer simulation. This model allowed us to distinguish between two cooperative binding mechanisms and, even though the mean expression levels were not affected differently by the acting mechanism, we showed that the associated fluctuations were different. In the present generalized model we include other regulatory functions {{in addition to those}} associated to an <b>activator</b> <b>switch.</b> Namely, we introduce repressive regulatory functions and two theoretical mechanisms that account for the biphasic response that some cis-regulatory systems show to the transcription factor concentration. We have also extended our previous master equation formalism in order to include protein production by stochastic translation of mRNA. Furthermore, we examine the graded/binary scenarios {{in the context of the}} interaction energy between transcription factors. In this sense, this is the first report to show that the cooperative binding of transcription factors to DNA promotes the "all-or-none" phenomenon observed in eukaryotic systems. In addition, we confirm that gene expression fluctuation levels associated with one of two cooperative binding mechanism never exceed the fluctuation levels of the other.

40|$|Voltage-dependent calcium {{channels}} {{constitute the}} main entry pathway for calcium into excitable cells. They are heteromultimers formed by an α 1 pore-forming subunit (CaVα 1) and accessory subunits. To achieve a precise coordination of calcium signals, the expression and activity of these channels is tightly controlled. The accessory β-subunit (CaVβ), a membrane associated guanylate kinase containing one guanylate kinase (β-GK) and one Src homology 3 (β-SH 3) domain, has antagonistic effects on calcium currents by regulating {{different aspects of}} channel function. Although β-GK binds to a conserved site within the α 1 -pore-forming subunit and facilitates channel opening, β-SH 3 binds to dynamin and promotes endocytosis. Here, we investigated the molecular switch underlying the functional duality of this modular protein. We show that β-SH 3 homodimerizes through a single disulfide bond. Substitution of the only cysteine residue abolishes dimerization and impairs internalization of l-type CaV 1. 2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes while preserving dynamin binding. Covalent linkage of the β-SH 3 dimerization-deficient mutant yields a concatamer that binds to dynamin and restores endocytosis. Moreover, using FRET analysis, we show in living cells that CaVβ form oligomers and that this interaction is reduced by CaVα 1. Association of CaVβ with a polypeptide encoding the binding motif in CaVα 1 inhibited endocytosis. Together, these findings reveal that β-SH 3 dimerization is crucial for endocytosis and suggest that channel activation and internalization are two mutually exclusive functions of CaVβ. We propose that {{a change in the}} oligomeric state of CaVβ is the functional <b>switch</b> between channel <b>activator</b> and channel internalizer...|$|R
40|$|HOX {{proteins}} are homeodomain-containing transcription factors {{essential for}} embryonic patterning. Despite amino acid differences, all HOX homeodomains recognize highly similar sites on DNA. One {{mechanism by which}} HOX proteins achieve specificity is through interaction with cofactors of the PBX and MEIS/PREP 1 families. Higher order complexes between HOX, PBX and MEIS/PREP 1 proteins form in vivo and are essential for target recognition and transcriptional regulation. Another level of control of HOX function is the nuclear availability of its cofactors. This thesis addresses the regulation of the nuclear availability of the PBX protein by MEIS/PREP 1 family members. We identified two nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the PBX homeodomain and showed that the NLS are masked {{in the absence of}} MEIS/PREP 1. Upon a conformational change in PBX induced by MEIS/PREP 1 binding, the NLS are exposed and a receptor-mediated active transport of PBX into the nucleus is allowed. This thesis also investigates the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by the HOX·PBX complexes. We show that HOX·PBX complexes repress transcription and are <b>switched</b> to transcriptional <b>activators</b> in response to cell signaling. We demonstrate that PBX mediates the repression function by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to HOX target promoters. Inhibition of HDAC activity or stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling converts the HOX·PBX complex into a net activator of transcription. The activation function is mediated by the HOX protein through its recruitment of CREB-binding protein (CBP), a coactivator with histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) activity. We propose a model whereby HOX·PBX transcriptional activity is determined by cell signaling, and is mediated by the local modification of chromatin structure in the promoter of downstream targets...|$|R
40|$|Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk 5) is a {{peculiar}} proline-directed serine/threonine kinase. Unlike {{the other members}} of the Cdk family, Cdk 5 is not directly involved in cell cycle regulation, being normally associated with neuronal processes such as migration, cortical layering and synaptic plasticity. This kinase is present mainly in post-mitotic neurons and its activity is tightly regulated by the interaction with the specific activators, p 35 and p 39. Despite its pivotal role in CNS development, Cdk 5 dysregulation has been implicated in different pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and, most recently, prion-related encephalopathies (PRE). In these neurodegenerative conditions, Cdk 5 overactivation and relocalization occurs upon association with p 25, a truncated form of the normal activator p 35. This <b>activator</b> <b>switching</b> will cause a shift in the phosphorylative pattern of Cdk 5, with an alteration both in targets and activity, ultimately leading to neuronal demise. In AD and PRE, two disorders that share clinical and neuropathological features, Cdk 5 dysregulation is a linking event between the major neuropathological markers: amyloid plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic and neuronal loss. Moreover, this kinase was shown to be involved in abortive cell cycle re-entry, a feature recently proposed as a possible step in the neuronal apoptosis mechanism of several neurological diseases. This review focuses on the role of Cdk 5 in neurons, namely in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, synaptic function and cell survival, both in physiological and in pathological conditions, highlighting the relevance of Cdk 5 in the main mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and other brain pathologies...|$|R
2500|$|In resting cells, axin {{molecules}} oligomerize {{with each}} other through their C-terminal DIX domains, which have two binding interfaces. Thus they can build linear oligomers or even polymers inside the cytoplasm of cells. DIX domains are unique: the only other protein known to have a DIX domain is Dishevelled. (The single Dsh protein of Drosophila corresponds to three paralogous genes, Dvl1, Dvl2 and Dvl3 in mammals.) Dsh associates with the cytoplasmic regions of Frizzled receptors with its PDZ and DEP domains. When a Wnt molecule binds to Frizzled, it induces a poorly known cascade of events, that result in the exposure of dishevelled's DIX domain {{and the creation of}} a perfect binding site for axin. Axin is then titrated away from its oligomeric assemblies – the β-catenin destruction complex – by Dsh. Once bound to the receptor complex, axin will be rendered incompetent for β-catenin binding and GSK3 activity. Importantly, the cytoplasmic segments of the Frizzled-associated LRP5 and LRP6 proteins contain GSK3 pseudo-substrate sequences (Pro-Pro-Pro-Ser-Pro-x-Ser), appropriately [...] "primed" [...] (pre-phosphorylated) by CKI, as if it were a true substrate of GSK3. These false target sites greatly inhibit GSK3 activity in a competitive manner. [...] This way receptor-bound axin will abolish mediating the phosphorylation of β-catenin. Since beta-catenin is no longer marked for destruction, but continues to be produced, its concentration will increase. Once β-catenin levels rise high enough to saturate all binding sites in the cytoplasm, it will also translocate into the nucleus. Upon engaging the transcription factors LEF1, TCF1, TCF2 or TCF3, β-catenin forces them to disengage their previous partners: Groucho proteins. Unlike Groucho, that recruit transcriptional repressors (e.g. histone-lysine methyltransferases), beta-catenin will bind transcriptional <b>activators,</b> <b>switching</b> on target genes.|$|R
40|$|Innate {{immunity}} in Caenorhabditis elegans {{requires a}} conserved PMK- 1 p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that regulates the basal and pathogen-induced expression of immune effectors. The {{mechanisms by which}} PMK- 1 p 38 MAPK regulates the transcriptional activation of the C. elegans immune response have not been identified. Furthermore, in mammalian systems the genetic analysis of physiological targets of p 38 MAPK in immunity has been limited. Here, we show that C. elegans ATF- 7, {{a member of the}} conserved cyclic AMP–responsive element binding (CREB) /activating transcription factor (ATF) family of basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors and an ortholog of mammalian ATF 2 /ATF 7, has a pivotal role in the regulation of PMK- 1 –mediated innate immunity. Genetic analysis of loss-of-function alleles and a gain-of-function allele of atf- 7, combined with expression analysis of PMK- 1 –regulated genes and biochemical characterization of the interaction between ATF- 7 and PMK- 1, suggest that ATF- 7 functions as a repressor of PMK- 1 –regulated genes that undergoes a <b>switch</b> to an <b>activator</b> upon phosphorylation by PMK- 1. Whereas loss-of-function mutations in atf- 7 can restore basal expression of PMK- 1 –regulated genes observed in the pmk- 1 null mutant, the induction of PMK- 1 –regulated genes by pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA 14 is abrogated. The switching modes of ATF- 7 activity, from repressor to activator in response to activated PMK- 1 p 38 MAPK, are reminiscent of the mechanism of regulation mediated by the corresponding ancestral Sko 1 p and Hog 1 p proteins in the yeast response to osmotic stress. Our data point to the regulation of the ATF 2 /ATF 7 /CREB 5 family of transcriptional regulators by p 38 MAPK as an ancient conserved mechanism for the control of innate immunity in metazoans, and suggest that ATF 2 /ATF 7 may function in a similar manner in the regulation of mammalian innate immunity.

40|$|Iron-sulfur {{clusters}} are protein cofactors {{that are}} critical for all life forms. Elaborate multi-component systems have evolved for the biosynthesis of these cofactors to protect organisms from the toxic effects of free iron and sulfide ions. In eukaryotes, the Fe-S cluster assembly machinery operates in the matrix space of the mitochondria and contains a myriad of proteins that mediate sulfur, iron, and electron transfer to assemble Fe-S clusters on the scaffold protein ISCU 2 and then distribute these clusters to target proteins. Our lab has recently described stable 3, and 4 -protein complexes composed of the cysteine desulfurase NFS 1, the co-chaperone ISD 11, and ISCU 2 (SDU), and NFS 1, ISD 11, ISCU 2, and FXN (SDUF) subunits. In the latter, SDUF, FXN functions as an allosteric <b>activator</b> <b>switching</b> this assembly complex on for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. Insufficient expression of the mitochondrial protein FXN leads to a progressive neurodegenerative disease, Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA). In ~ 2 % of patients, FRDA is caused by one of 15 known missense mutations on one allele accompanied by the GAA repeat on the other leading to a complicated phenotype that includes loss of Fe-S clusters. Here we present in vitro evidence that FRDA FXN variants are deficient {{in their ability to}} bind the SDU complex, their ability to stimulate the sulfur transfer reaction from NFS 1 to ISCU 2, and in their ability to stimulate the rate of cluster assembly on ISCU 2. Here, in vitro evidence is presented that FXN accelerates the sulfur transfer reaction from NFS 1 to ISCU 2. Additionally, we present kinetic evidence that identifies the most buried cysteine residue, C 104 on ISCU 2 as the sulfur acceptor residue suggesting, FXN stabilizes a conformational change to facilitate sulfur delivery. Subsequent mutational studies suggest FXN binding to SDU results in a helix to coil transition in ISCU 2 exposing C 104 to accept the persulfide sulfur and thereby accelerating the rate of sulfur transfer. We further provide the first biochemical evidence that the persulfide transferred to ISCU 2 from NFS 1 is viable in Fe-S cluster formation. In contrast to human FXN, the Escherichia coli FXN homolog CyaY has been reported to inhibit Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. To resolve this discrepancy, a series of inter-species enzyme kinetic experiments were performed. Surprisingly, our results reveal that activation or inhibition by the frataxin homolog is determined by which cysteine desulfurase is present and not by the identity of the frataxin homolog. These data are consistent with a model in which the frataxin-less Fe-S assembly complex exists as a mixture of functional and nonfunctional states, which are stabilized by binding of frataxin homologs. Intriguingly, this appears to be an unusual example in which modifications to an enzyme during evolution inverts or reverses the mode of control imparted by a regulatory molecule...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{all animals}} develop {{from a single}} cell, fertilized egg, with {{multiple}} and progressive processes. In these processes, that we call DEVELOPMENT, fertilized egg is divided, proliferates, and differentiates into specific tissues or organs to form precise adult body. A major challenge in developmental biology is the elucidation of how a pattern is formed. One general mode of pattern formation of the living things {{is based on the}} "Morphogen" and "Positional information", which is well known as French flag model. Another general mode of pattern formation is "Prepattern" proposed by Stern in 1968 based on his work of bristle patterning of Drosophila. The prepattern concept is based on that {{in order to make a}} pattern it is necessary to generate a spatial variation in something which resembles in some way the pattern. This mode of pattern formation is useful for explain a precise and complex pattern formation for instance a bristle pattern of adult Drosophila. On the dorsal part of the mesothorax (called notum) of Drosophila, large bristles (macrochaetes) develop in fixed numbers at constant positions. Pattern formation of macrochaetes on the notum has provided an ideal model system for studying two-dimensional patterning. The accurate positioning of the macrochaetes is established during the third larval to early pupal stage within the epithelial sheets of the notum region of the wing imaginal discs (thoracic disc). Initially, in the thoracic disc, a group of cells called a proneural cluster, characterized by the expression of the proneural genes achaete (ac) and scute (sc), are formed around the positions where macrochaetes will form. Namely, precise positioning of the macrochaete on the notum depends on the complex expression pattern of the ac and sc genes in the thoracic disc. Hence the factors that establish a prepattern on the notum must affect the expression of proneural genes. Recently, several genes which contribute to the establishment of prepattern (we call these genes "prepattern genes") on the notum were characterized. For instance, pannier (pnr) which encodes a GATA family transcription factor, extramacrochaetae (emc) which encodes a helix-loop-helix protein devoid of a basic domain, were identified as prepattern genes. These genes are expressed some specific regions of the thoracic disc, and seem to establish a prepattern on the notum field. Local specific expression of prepattern genes could explain the pattern formation of macrochaetes on the notum. However, one of the problems of prepatterning on the notum (indeed this is a problem of prepattern concept itself) is how local maxima (or minima) of prepattern gene expression (or activation/repression of the prepattern gene product) are generated. One possible explanation about this problem is that some morphogen gradients could contribute the regulation of prepattern genes expression on the notum, suggesting that two general approaches of pattern formation are inseparable and parts of same developmental process. One candidate factor that can contributes to the establishment of prepattern on the notum as a morphogen gradient is Decapentaplegic (Dpp). Dpp is a BMP family member protein that is thought to play essential roles in the development of various species. Dpp is thought to acts as a morphogen, and provides the positional information to cells in the wing imaginal disc. This property suggests that Dpp could participate in the prepattern formation in the thoracic disc. In this study, he has attempted to reveal how morphogen gradient contributes to the establishment of prepattern, using the notum region of Drosophila as a model system. In chapter 2, whether Dpp, as a morphogen gradient, plays a part in the prepatterning of the macrochaetes on the notum were examined. Experiments using both gain-of-function and conditional loss-of-function mutants for Dpp signaling revealed that Dpp participates in this process in two major ways. One is induction of the proneural cluster in cooperation with signaling of Wingless (Wg), which is a Wnt family member protein, and the other is restriction of the wg expression domain in the thoracic disc. Furthermore, the analysis using different copies of activated Dpp receptor expressing flies suggesting that a difference should exist between the threshold level of Dpp signaling required for proneural gene induction and that required for repression of wg expression. In chapter 3, first, the expressions of two prepattern genes, pnr and u-shaped (ush) on the loss-of and gain-of-function mutants for Dpp signaling were examined. These analyses revealed that both pnr and ush expression is positively regulated by Dpp signaling in a concentration dependent manner. Then, the mechanisms for the regulation of notal wg expression were analyzed. Analysis of wg expression in wild-type and several allelic combinations of pnr mutants revealed that Pnr has two opposing roles, induction and repression, in the regulation of the wg expression, and that Ush <b>switches</b> the <b>activator</b> function to the repressor. It is also shown that notal wg expression is affected by Wg signaling itself. In the last chapter, the presented results and combined mechanism of pattern formation were summarized. These findings suggest that the pattern formation based on morphogen is not an antithesis of prepattern, but rather these two modes of pattern formation are parts of same developmental process in the patterning of the Drosophila developing notum...|$|R
40|$|When {{symbiosis}} {{between the}} residential intestinal flora and the epithelial {{cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract is broken one endpoint may be chronic inflammation, e. g. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The disruption of the epithelial lining elicits activation of NF-kappaB and secretion of potent inflammatory mediators. In the case of IBD, elevated levels of NF-kappaB have been observed and interestingly several nuclear receptors {{have been reported to}} attenuate NF-kappaB activity. One such receptor is PPARgamma. My thesis presents evidence of a possible molecular mechanism whereby commensal bacteria not only regulate the expression of PPARgamma, but also its ability to export NF-kappaB from the nucleus, independently Of IkappaB, suggesting a novel pathway for nuclear export of NF-kappaB [...] In paper I we show that TLR 4 signalling can increase expression levels of PPARgamma. Moreover we also show that germ free mice do not express PPARgamma indicating that bacteria can regulate its expression. Interestingly, patients with ulcerative colitis, one of the two main forms of IBD, display a defect in protein levels of PPARgamma in colonic epithelial cells compared to Crohn's disease patients and healthy controls. In the second paper, we assess the possible anti-inflammatory effects of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a common anaerobic commensal bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract, upon co-infection in CaCo- 2 cells with the pathogenic Salmonella enterica. Immunohistochemistry in combination with biochemical and functional experiments revealed that PPARgamma upon exposure to B. thetaiotaomicron, possess the ability to shuttle NFkappaB from the nucleus to the cytosol. In the third manuscript we extend the observations presented in paper one and assess whether there is a relationship between high levels of NF-kappaB and low PPARgamma levels in the colonic epithelium of IBD patients. No strict correlation was observed between low intestinal levels of PPARgamma and elevated NF-kappaB levels. Individual variations of the absolute NFkappaB levels among IBD patients were however observed In addition, we show that the apoptosis inducing ligand, TRAIL, is expressed at lower levels in inflamed colon mucosa, thereby linking it to chronic inflammation. A DNA-binding protein may <b>switch</b> between an <b>activator</b> and a repressor, depending on cofactor assembly. This prompted us to assess whether such a factor could be identified for PPARgamma since opposing effects of its function in colonic tumor cells had been reported. One possible factor is the transcriptional co-factor beta-catenin. In the final manuscript we examine the possible interplay between PPARgamma and beta-catenin. Biochemical data show that beta-catenin interacts with PPARgamma which results in elevated protein levels of PPARgamma. Functional data show that beta-catenin and the known chemical agonist of Writ signalling Lithium chloride, can activate a PPARgamma dependent reporter gene in a dose dependent manner. Hence, under conditions where abnormal levels of beta-catenin is observed, e. g. in colon cancer, it is tempting to speculate that the altered beta-catenin levels may change the net function of PPARgamma in favour of cell growth. In summary, the data presented in this thesis, provide some aspects as to how homeostasis may be tightly regulated by a very limited set of factors and that these factors may be intimately connected to execute multiple functions under stringent control. The fine tuning of these functions can be guided by epigenetic factors, such as microbes and nutrients. The strategic tissue distribution of PPARgamma, and its pleiotropic functions serve as one example of an inflammatory gatekeeper that integrates gut homeostasis and metabolic control...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{expression}} {{is critical for}} the development, patterning, and homeostasis of the organism. Precise temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression {{at the level of}} transcription requires a large network of sequence-specific factors, general transcription factors, co-factors, and epigenetic regulators. Malignancies of specific tissues often arise from perturbation of various gene expression levels. Hematopoiesis {{is one of the most}} sensitive biological processes to mis-regulation of transcription. To generate all blood cell types from embryonic development throughout the lifetime of the organism, hematopoiesis requires an intricate balance between the maintenance of a permanent stem cell pool and differentiation of multi-potent stem cells into cell types with unique functions. To generate a terminally differentiated, functional immune cell, multiple lineage-restricting steps are involved, with each governed by a specific transcription program. Therefore, gene expression regulation in hematopoietic differentiation is particularly important for an organism to properly develop, maintain oxygen transport to all tissues, and fight against infections. Furthermore, because of detailed understanding of how to isolate cells at different stages and lineages of hematopoietic differentiation, it provides an important model to study the development and differentiation of other adult tissues. Hematopoietic stem cells can be driven to differentiate along three main lineages: myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid. Despite the discoveries of several transcription factors for specific lineages of hematopoietic differentiation, understanding the gene expression program that allow stem cells to make the decision to initiate lymphoid development still remains incomplete. For example, how is the preinititation complex of transcription (PIC) recruited to the gene promoters? Additionally, how are interactions, if any, coordinated among various sequence-specific factors that were identified via gene-by-gene knockout (KO) approaches?To form the PIC at any gene promoter, transcription factor (TF) IIA, B, D, E, F, and H, and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) must coordinate their promoter-binding and enzymatic activities. TFIID, especially, is important for promoter recognition. As a multi-subunit complex containing TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and 13 - 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs), TFIID binds to sequences in the proximal promoter and allows the recruitment of other TFs and Pol II. Previously thought to be invariant from one cell type to another, recently tissue-specific roles for certain TAFs have been uncovered. TAF 4 B is one of the first TAFs found to have cell-specific expression, since it was identified in human B cells {Dikstein: 1996 wk}, though a role for its function in hematopoiesis has remained elusive. I used a Taf 4 b KO mouse line to study its function in both myeloid and lymphoid differentiation. I found that Taf 4 b KO mice were able to generate myeloid and lymphoid progenitors as well as their wild-type (WT) littermates. Furthermore, both of these types of progenitors from Taf 4 b KO mice can terminally differentiate into mature cells as well as those from WT mice. Finally, TAF 4 B-null cells are as competent as heterozygous cells (equivalent to WT in terms of Taf 4 b expression) to reconstitute the hematopoietic compartment of lethally irradiated mice in all cell lineages tested. In conclusion, TAF 4 B is dispensable in both myeloid and B cell differentiation. This could be due to TAF 4 B's high sequence homology with TAF 4 A. Alternatively, TAF 4 B can play a role in fine-tuning expression levels of certain B cell or myeloid-specific genes, together with another transcription factor, which cannot be uncovered in a KO mouse approach. I have made a TAF 4 B-specific polyclonal antibody that can be used to identify its transcriptional targets, as well as identify any potential interaction partners. Though the basal machinery does not seem to play a role in hematopoietic lineage determination, sequence-specific factors have long been implicated in this process. A study using an inducible hematopoietic-specific KO mouse line found that myocyte enhancer factor 2 c (MEF 2 C) is necessary for multi-potent progenitors to differentiate into the lymphoid lineage {StehlingSun: 2009 df}. Through a candidate approach, I have identified early B cell factor 1 (EBF 1) to be a specific interacting partner of MEF 2 C. Together, they co-occupy and functionally co-activate many B cell specific genes. When MEF 2 C is depleted in mice, the animals had reduced B cell gene expression as well as increased myeloid gene expression, consistent with MEF 2 C's role as a lineage fate regulator. I have identified and confirmed several B cell-specific genes that are co-regulated by EBF 1 and MEF 2 C through a genome-wide survey of their binding via chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by exonuclease treatment and deep-sequencing (ChIP-exo). Furthermore, I found that p 38 MAPK is the pathway through which MEF 2 C is phosphorylated and activated to drive B cell differentiation. When phosphorylated, MEF 2 C prefers to bind its co-activator EBF 1, and not its co-repressor HDAC 7. Taken together, the results presented in this thesis elucidated the mechanism of activation, binding partners, and downstream targets by which MEF 2 C is able to regulate lymphoid-specific differentiation. This study contributes to understanding how transcriptional regulation of genes can drive progenitor cells to differentiate down a particular lineage, and provide a novel mechanism for a transcription repressor to <b>switch</b> to an <b>activator</b> during cellular differentiation...|$|R
