For a few days, {{it was thought that}} Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk {{would not be able to}} go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though that would have been the typical thing to do if someone else were there. Rather, they simply peer through the <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E

It may be simply covered by a rubber flap, {{or it may be}} an actual door hinged on the top that the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only {{allowing}} pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic tag to enter.|$|E
25|$|By now {{the murders}} had {{attracted}} widespread media attention and many students were taking extra precautions, such as changing their daily routines and sleeping together in groups. Because the spree was happening {{so early in}} the fall semester, some students withdrew their enrollment or transferred to other schools. Twenty-three year old Tracy Paules was living with Manny Taboada, also 23, her burly 200lb roommate. On Monday, August 27, Rolling broke into the apartment by prying open the <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> with the same tools he had used previously. Rolling found Taboada asleep in one of the bedrooms and, after a struggle with the young man, eventually killed him.|$|E

He waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m. she entered the apartment and Rolling surprised her from behind, placing her in a choke-hold. After she had been subdued, he taped her mouth shut, bound her wrists together and led her into the bedroom, where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her face-down and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her heart. He then decapitated the body and posed her head on a shelf facing the corpse, adding to the shock of whoever discovered her.|$|E

Meanwhile, at the salvage yard, Odell is shredding documents when Ray appears. Harry feigns friendliness while he gets the shotgun out of his desk drawer. He blasts Ray through a <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door.</b> Ray’s detached arm begins to rebuild itself with metal. Harry is transfixed by this sight as Ray kills him. The next morning, Doggett checks out the new murder scene and finds an interesting shredded document. Doggett goes to Chamber Technologies and learns about [...] "smart metals"—metals that rebuild their original forms but are still a metallurgist’s pipe dream at the moment. On the phone, Doggett mentions the [...] "smart metals" [...] and Scully tells Doggett about how Ray Pearce’s medical records show his whole cellular structure was changing due to exposure to an unknown substance. Meanwhile, Larina sees Ray’s obituary in the paper and is watching the television news story about the murder at the salvage yard. She decides to call Ray’s widow.|$|E

5000|$|Swinging <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> are {{a better}} choice than the typical <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors,</b> since they offer a much tighter seal, but glass - even the best type of glass, chosen {{according}} to the climate zone - is always a poor insulator, making doors based on them a poor choice from a thermal comfort perspective.|$|R

2500|$|Before closing arguments, Judge Perry {{ruled that}} the defense could argue that a {{drowning}} occurred due to reasonable conclusions aided by witness testimony, but that arguing sexual abuse was not allowed since {{there was nothing to}} support the claim that George Anthony sexually abused Casey Anthony. Baez began by contending that there were holes in the prosecution's forensic evidence, saying it was based on a [...] "fantasy". He told the jury that the prosecution wanted them to see stains and insects that did not really exist, that they had not proven that the stains in Anthony's car trunk were caused by Caylee's decomposing body, rather than from a trash bag found there. He added that the prosecutors tried to make his client look like a promiscuous liar because their evidence was weak. He said the drowning is [...] "the only explanation that makes sense" [...] and showed jurors a photograph of Caylee opening the home's <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> by herself. He stressed that there were no child safety locks in the home and that both of Casey Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, testified that Caylee could {{get out of the house}} easily. Although Cindy Anthony testified that Caylee could not put the ladder on the side of the pool and climb up, Baez alleged that Cindy Anthony may have left the ladder up the night before. [...] "She didn't admit to doing so in testimony", he said, [...] "but how much guilt would she have knowing it was her that left the ladder up that day?" ...|$|E
2500|$|House {{pictures}} were released on June 27, 2007. The house has an Alice in Wonderland theme and contains an over sized bedroom {{and a small}} bedroom. The small bedroom features a very small doorway and five beds which are only five feet long, while the over sized bedroom features shoulder-height beds and enormous drawers which need a ladder to reach. A third bedroom is decorated all in red, and two large, round beds sit {{in the center of}} the room. The walkway to the Head of Household room is a modernist inspired enchanted forest.

50|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> or patio door, {{is a type}} of {{sliding door}} in {{architecture}} and construction, is a large glass window opening in a structure that provide door access from a room to the outdoors, fresh air, and copious natural light. A <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> is usually considered a single unit consisting of two panel sections, one being fixed and one a being mobile to slide open. Another design, a wall sized glass pocket door has one or more panels movable and sliding into wall pockets, completely disappearing for a 'wide open' indoor-outdoor room experience.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> {{are popular}} in Southern Europe and {{throughout}} the United States, being used in: hotel rooms, condominiums, apartments, and residences; for access to upper balconies; for large views out - enhanced natural light in; and to increase incoming fresh air. In addition <b>Sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> are commonly used in some regions as doors between the interior rooms of a home and a courtyard, deck, balcony, patio, and a garden, backyard, barbecue or swimming pool area. They are often called Patio doors in this context. They are also used in interior design, often in offices and automobile sales areas, to give soundproof but visually accessible private office space. In residential interiors they are used, often with translucent 'frosted' glass replicating a traditional Shōji door, to allow daylight to penetrate further into the dwelling and expand the sense of interior spatial size.|$|R

5000|$|The Chula Vista Residential Burglary Reduction Project which studied over 1,000 {{incidents}} {{found that}} [...] "methods {{found to have}} relatively low effectiveness included: <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> braces, such as wooden dowels, as opposed to sliding door channel or pin locks; deadbolts installed {{in the front door}} only; and outdoor lights on dusk-to-dawn timers".|$|E
50|$|The <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> was {{introduced}} {{as a significant}} element of pre-war International style architecture in Europe and North America. Their precedent is the sliding Shōji and Fusuma panel door in traditional Japanese architecture. The post-war building boom in modernist and Mid-century modern styles, and on to suburban ranch-style tract houses, multi-unit housing, and hotel-motel chains has made them a standard element in residential and hospitality building construction in many regions and countries.|$|E
50|$|Passive {{daylighting}} is {{a system}} of both collecting sunlight using static, non-moving, and non-tracking systems (such as windows, <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors,</b> most skylights, light tubes) and reflecting the collected daylight deeper inside with elements such as light shelves. Passive daylighting systems are different from active daylighting systems in that active systems track and/or follow the sun, and rely on mechanical mechanisms to do so.|$|R
