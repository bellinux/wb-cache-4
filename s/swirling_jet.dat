Simulation results indicate that spreading angle of the <b>swirling</b> <b>jet</b> is greater than that of the non-swirling jet, and the swirling intensity of the jet is strongly influenced by the length of the nozzle body but weakly by the number of tangential inlets.

The combustor operates with partially premixed, swirl-stabilized flames {{and can be}} operated in single- and different multiple-burner setups. The design parameters of the combustor prevent large-scale flame–flame interactions in the multiple-burner arrangements. The objective is to investigate how {{the interaction of the}} <b>swirl</b> <b>jets</b> affects the thermoacoustic stability of the combustor. Results of measurements of pressure oscillations and high-speed OH*-chemiluminescence imaging for the single-burner setup and two multiple-burner setups are discussed. Additionally, results of investigations with different flame characteristics are presented. These are achieved by varying the ratio of the mass flow rates through the swirlers of the double-concentric swirl nozzle. Several unstable modes with high pressure amplitudes are observed in the single-burner setup {{as well as in the}} multiple-burner setups. Numerical studies of the acoustic behavior of the combustor setups were performed that indicate that the different geometries show similar acoustic behaviors. The results lead to the conclusion that the interaction of the <b>swirl</b> <b>jets</b> in the multiple-burner setups affects the thermoacoustic response spectrum of the flame even in the absence of large-scale flame–flame interactions. Based on the findings in earlier studies, it is concluded that the differences in the flame response characteristics are induced by the reduction of the swirl intensity in the multiple-burner arrangements, which is caused by the exchange of momentum between the adjacent <b>swirl</b> <b>jets...</b>|$|R

This study show that the number of vanes and their inclination of the diffuser, the sense of rotation of peripheral jets relative to the central jet and their arrangement in temperatures and positions, affects the quality of the thermal homogenization of ambiance. Experiences concerning the interaction of several jets show that the resulting jet is clearly more homogenized under swirling influence. Among the studied different configuration, the one which consists of a <b>swirling</b> central <b>jet</b> controlling the behavior of tow <b>swirling</b> <b>jets</b> in counter-rotation, is shown to be the most effective in terms of thermal homogenization. The current study is carried out under uniform heat flux condition for each diffuser, the air being the working fluid and flow rate was adjusted at the Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 3. 104. In this work, the three dimensional simulations have been carried out using the finite volume CFD solver Fluent, in which the standard k-e, k-e R. N.

Overall predictions obtained with the RSM model are in better agreement with the experimental data compared to those of the standard k-e model.

It appears that the central jet plays an important role in the enhancement of the thermal homogenization.

Spatial linear stability analysis {{is applied to the}} mean flow of a turbulent <b>swirling</b> <b>jet</b> at swirl intensities below the onset of vortex breakdown. The aim of this work is to predict the dominant coherent flow structure, their driving instabilities and how they are affected by swirl. At the nozzle exit, the <b>swirling</b> <b>jet</b> promotes shear instabilities and, less unstable, centrifugal instabilities. The latter stabilize shortly downstream of the nozzle, contributing very little to the formation of coherent structures. The shear mode remains unstable throughout generating coherent structures that scale with the axial shear-layer thickness. The most amplified mode in the nearfield is a co-winding double-helical mode rotating slowly in counter-direction to the swirl. This gives rise to the formation of slowly rotating and stationary large-scale coherent structures, which explains the asymmetries in the mean flows often encountered in <b>swirling</b> <b>jet</b> experiments. The co-winding single-helical mode at high rotation rate dominates the farfield of the <b>swirling</b> <b>jet</b> in replacement of the co- and counter-winding bending modes dominating the non-swirling jet. Moreover, swirl is found to significantly affect the streamwise phase velocity of the helical modes rendering this flow as highly dispersive and insensitive to intermodal interactions, which explains the absence of vortex pairing observed in previous investigations. The stability analysis is validated through hot-wire measurements of the flow excited at a single helical mode and of the flow perturbed by a time- and space-discrete pulse. The experimental results confirm the predicted mode selection and corresponding streamwise growth rates and phase velocities...|$|E

Although swirl flow measurements have been conducted in the past using dual-wire probes, the literature does not include clear methodologies to compensate for both gradient effects and changes to the mean flow direction, particularly in flow regions with high shear and strong swirl over a range spanning (S = 0 - 1. 05).

40|$|The {{high heat}} {{transfer}} rate obtainable with impinging jets is widely recognized and explained in scientific literature {{and the use of}} jets is very popular in many industrial applications like paper drying, glass tempering and turbine blades cooling. A huge quantity of data is available for single, rows and arrays of jets with also correlations for heat and mass transfer. A major disadvantage of impinging isothermal and flame jets, however, is that the local heat flux can be highly non-uniform (Viskanta, 1993). For some applications, like electronic cooling or chemical vapour deposition, high values of heat and mass transfer with radial uniformity are requested. The <b>swirling</b> impinging <b>jets,</b> characterized by tangential velocity components that cause a spiral-shaped motion and the broadening of the jet, could be a possible solution to achieve both high heat transfer and radial uniformity. The purpose of this work is to study the flow field and the heat transfer in <b>swirling</b> impinging <b>jets.</b> For the present study the <b>swirling</b> <b>jets</b> are obtained with helical inserts based on the concept of the cross swirling strips inside the nozzle and two experimental techniques are used: Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (Elsinga et al., 2006) for the three-dimensional three-components flow field measurements and IR thermography along with the “heated thin foil” heat transfer sensor (Carlomagno and Cardone, 2010) for the heat transfer measurements. In chapter one the literature about free and impinging jets is reviewed in attempt to explain how the flow field influences the heat transfer distribution on the wall and to describe {{the state of the art}} in the field of <b>swirling</b> impinging <b>jets</b> and <b>swirl</b> flows. This literature review motivates the study of <b>swirling</b> impinging <b>jets</b> in order to understand both the fluid mechanics characteristics and the heat transfer performances. So far, has not yet been formulated a comprehensive framework where all the results about vortex dynamics in swirl flows can be satisfactorily explained, and the modelling of rotating and swirling flows is still considered a perpetual challenge (Jakirlic et al. 2002). Most of the quantitative experimental studies on swirling flows have been limited to examining flow details using single-point measurement techniques, such as Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), or planar techniques, such as PIV in particular. The inability to make instantaneous volumetric measurements often leads to ambiguities in the interpretation of the data, which necessitates various assumptions to link these reduced dimensional representations to the three-dimensional instantaneous structure of the flow. At the same time, while numerical simulation such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) in particular, has been instrumental in elucidating the three-dimensional dynamical features of swirling flows (see e. g. García-Villalba et al. 2006, Ranga Dinesh and Kirkpatrick 2009), they have to face with the difficulty of obtain reliable velocity profiles at the nozzle exit as boundary conditions (Ortega-Casanova et al. 2010). On the heat transfer side, almost all data related to <b>swirling</b> impinging <b>jets</b> reported in literature are presented as radial distribution even though, to assess the behavior of the flow field on the wall, two dimensional measurements are required. Furthermore, is not available in literature a quantitative analysis for the concept of heat transfer uniformity. In chapter two, the basic working principles and the state of art of research about Tomographic PIV are described in order to understand the main parameters involved in the design of the experiments for the flow field measurements. In chapter three, the basic working principles and the state of art of research on IR thermography for convective heat transfer measurements are described in order to understand the main parameters involved in the design of the experiments for the heat transfer measurements. In chapter four, the flow field measurements are presented. A first study is performed by means of time resolved tomographic PIV on the three dimensional flow field of free <b>swirling</b> <b>jets</b> (at Reynolds number equal to 1, 000) in order to analyze the main features of this complex flow. The development of the jets, the effect of swirl and the growth and interactions of coherent structures is discussed describing flow topology in <b>swirling</b> <b>jets.</b> <b>Swirling</b> impinging <b>jets</b> (at Reynolds number equal to 10, 000) are then studied at low nozzle to plate distance analyzing both instantaneous measurements and flow statistics. This study allows to understand how the impinged plate influences the development of the jets and the lifetime of its coherent structures; a special attention is put on the development of the jet in the “wall jet” region. In chapter six, are presented experimental two-dimensional measurements of convective heat transfer between a flat plate and a <b>swirling</b> air <b>jet</b> impinging on it. This work is performed at a fixed Reynolds number (Re = 28, 000) for different nozzle-to-plate distances and for different Swirl numbers. The heat transfer performances of <b>swirling</b> <b>jets</b> are also compared with those of a circular jet in order to account for both effects of the swirl and of the cross strips in the nozzle. Data are reported as Nusselt number surface maps, surface averaged Nusselt number and surface standard deviation percentage of the Nusselt number, in the attempt to quantify {{heat transfer rate}} and uniformity. In particular, this work represents the first effort to quantify non-uniformity in convective heat transfer coefficients in case of swirling, multichannel and circular jets. Moreover, the author proposes the use of the standard deviation percentage of the Nusselt number as a quantitative estimator for the heat transfer uniformity...|$|R

It is concluded that the integrated swirl effect, reflected in the swirl number, is inadequate in describing the mean <b>swirling</b> <b>jet</b> behavior in the near field...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a numerical setup to simulate <b>swirling</b> <b>jet</b> flow undergoing vortex breakdown. Our simulation code CONCYL solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates using high-order numerical schemes. A nozzle {{is included in}} the computational domain to account for more realistic inflow boundary conditions. Preliminary results of a Re = 5000 compressible <b>swirling</b> <b>jet</b> at Mach number Ma = 0. 6 with an azimuthal velocity as high as the maximum axial velocity (swirl number S = 1. 0) capture the fundamental characteristics of this flow type: At a certain point in time the jet spreads and develops into a conical vortex breakdown. A stagnation point-flow {{in the vicinity of the}} jet axis is clearly visible with the stagnation point located close to the nozzle exit. The stagnation point precesses in time around the jet axis, moving up- and downstream. c © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1 Simulation methodology Swirling jets undergoing vortex breakdown occur in many technical applications, e. g. vortex burners, turbines and jet engines. At the stage of vortex breakdown the flow is dominated by a conical shear layer and a large recirculation zone around the jet axis. In our group we {{developed a}} numerical tool to investigate <b>swirling</b> <b>jet</b> flow undergoing vortex breakdown (see [1] and references therein). For spatial derivatives we use high-order finite difference schemes [2] and a spectral method. The time integration scheme is a LDDRK method of fourth order [3]. We included a canonical nozzle with isothermal wall int...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of non-isothermal <b>swirling</b> <b>jets</b> undergoing vortex breakdown, {{with an emphasis on}} helical coherent structures. It is proposed that the dominant helical coherent structure can be suppressed by heating the recirculation bubble. This proposition is assessed with Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the breakdown region of isothermal and heated <b>swirling</b> <b>jets.</b> The coherent kinetic energy of the dominant helical structure was derived from PIV snapshots via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. For one set of experimental parameters, mild heating is found to increase the energy content of the dominant helical mode. Strong heating leads to a reduction by 30 % of the coherent structures energy. For a second set of experimental parameters, no alteration of the dominant coherent structure is detectable. Local linear stability analysis of the time-averaged velocity fields shows that the key difference between the two configurations is the density ratio at the respective wavemaker location. A density ratio of approximately 0. 8 is found to correlate to a suppression of the global mode in the experiments. A parametric study with model density and velocity profiles indicates the most important parameters that govern the local absolute growth rate: The density ratio and the relative position of the density profiles and the inner shear layer...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we explore the effect of {{buoyancy}} in controlling vortex breakdown (VB) in <b>swirling</b> <b>jets.</b> The experimental apparatus consists of a vertical <b>swirling</b> water <b>jet</b> which discharges into a large tank, in which the temperature difference between the jet and its surrounding is controlled. Three non-dimensional parameters govern the flow: the jet exit Reynolds number, the swirl ratio and the Richardson number (buoyancy). Vector maps of the vertical mid-plane and horizontal cross-sections are obtained by PIV measurements. It is demonstrated that VB can be effectively suppressed (enhanced) by prescribing a negative (positive) temperature difference between the jet core and its surrounding fluid. Moreover, the experimental critical swirl ratio for the appearance of VB agrees with a value predicted by simple criterion. Finally, the transition of VB from a closed bubble to an open cone configuration is mapped {{in terms of the}} Reynolds and Richardson numbers...|$|R

The rate of molecular mixing, which was quantified by the scalar dissipation rate was computed from measured scalar fields that were recorded by using Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) of acetone. The influence of the swirl number on the scalar mixing, unconditional and conditional scalar dissipation rate statistics was investigated. Scalar fields were measured with an average error of 3...|$|R
