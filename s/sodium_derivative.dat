40|$|The {{saturated}} ring hydrocarbons {{are generally}} believed {{to behave as}} aliphatic compounds, for which reason they are frequently referred to as alicyclic. Just as in an homologous series of aliphatic chain compounds {{there is not a}} steady gradation in behaviour (e. g. the extreme lack of reactivity of neopentyl derivatives in negative ion-replacement reactions as compared with the corresponding propyl and isobutyl derivatives (1)), so in the alicyclic series, striking differences have been observed in the chemical behaviour of cyclohexyl derivatives as compared with derivatives of smaller and larger saturated rings. For example, although the rates of esterification of cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol and cycloheptanol decrease steadily with {{increase in the number of}} carbon atoms in the ring (2), the rate of decomposition of <b>sodium</b> bisulphite <b>derivatives</b> of alicyclic ketones shows a minimum with the six membered ring (3).
