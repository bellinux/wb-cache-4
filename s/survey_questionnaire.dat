5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaire</b> to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E

30|$|Key {{factors and}} {{subsequent}} factors and their relationships as per Stage II {{can be identified}} from the <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaires</b> and summarised reports. Often the <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaires</b> are well structured and questions are grouped into categories. A BN model can be structured based on such well structured questionnaires where key factors represent major question groups and lower level factors may represent multiple inner layers in each question group. A well structured questionnaire can also provide the BN modeller clear guidance for identifying relationships between factors as described in Stage IV. In particular the relationships between key factors and their sub factors are clearly evident in grouped questions. All the relationships between factors may not be identifiable from the survey structure alone, hence active involvement of domain experts is strongly suggested.|$|R
