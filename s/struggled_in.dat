40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} theory of {{recognition}} by Axel Honneth {{and whether or not}} a <b>struggle</b> <b>in</b> his theory is necessarily a power struggle. I distinguished three different forms of <b>struggles</b> <b>in</b> Honneth's work: a conflict of interests, a conflict for recognition, and a collision. Only the last two are within the scope of {{the theory of}} recognition. A struggle for recognition is a situation in one is not recognized as an equal - this is a power <b>struggle.</b> <b>In</b> a collision there is mutual recognition, but a difference in how this should be expressed - this is not a power struggle. This means that a <b>struggle</b> <b>in</b> the theory of recognition is not necessarily a power <b>struggle.</b> <b>In</b> the last chapter I point out the importance of trust in order to cultivate relationships based on mutual recognition...|$|R
5|$|Hassett <b>struggled</b> <b>in</b> two warm-up matches against Tasmania {{before the}} Australians left for England, and despite winning both fixtures, {{it was not}} to be a happy tour on the field. In the first match on English soil, against East Molesey, Bill Johnston, Australia’s leading wicket-taker in 1948, broke down with a serious knee injury. Hassett <b>struggled</b> <b>in</b> the opening {{first-class}} matches in England, passing 40 only once in six innings. In the last match before the Tests, against Sussex, he hit an unbeaten 108. Australia's progress before the Tests was constantly curtailed by bad weather. Of the six first-class matches that Hassett played, three did not reach the second innings, although Australia did manage two victories.|$|E
