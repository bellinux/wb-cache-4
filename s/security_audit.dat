The recent literature suggests that expert sys-tem techniques can offer significant benefits when applied to security procedures such as risk analysis, <b>security</b> <b>auditing,</b> and intrusion detec-tion. This chapter presents an example of a novel expert system appli-cation, an expert system for <b>security</b> <b>auditing</b> (AudES). Issues in the development and use of the expert system that are unique to the appli-cation domain are discussed. The importance of effective computer security measures has become increasingly evident with the advent of recently publicized intrusion at-tempts and virus attacks. Any organization implementing computer se-curity policies is faced {{with a wide range of}} potential threats. Although some types of threats can be effectively countered using real-time methods (Anderson 1980; Denning 1987; Lunt and Jagannathan 1988), detection of others remains too time or resource intensive to address in real time. After-the-fact <b>security</b> <b>auditing</b> is frequently used to detect anomalous events that fall out of the scope of real-time securi-ty measures. A landmark study by Anderson (1980) suggests that exter-From: IAAI- 90 Proceedings. Copyright © 1990, AAAI (www. aaai. org).

Some recent literature indicates that AI techniques (expert system methods in particular) might have much to offer computer security practitioners (Summers and Kurzban 1988; Lunt 1988). The AudES ex-pert system is an experiment in investigating potential expert system applications in the area of computer <b>security</b> <b>auditing.</b> It is designed to automate manual <b>security</b> <b>auditing</b> procedures and alleviate the bur-den on human auditors. AudES is interposed between a human auditor and the resource access control facility (RACF) (IBM Corpora-tion 1990), a popular security mechanism for IBM mainframe systems...|$|R

40|$|Cross-site {{scripting}} and injection vulnerabilities {{are among}} the most common and serious security issues for Web applications. Although existing static analysis approaches can detect potential vulnerabilities in source code, they generate many false warnings and source-sink traces with irrelevant information, making their adoption impractical for <b>security</b> <b>auditing.</b> One suitable approach to support <b>security</b> <b>auditing</b> is to compute a program slice for each sink, which contains all the information required for <b>security</b> <b>auditing.</b> However, such slices are likely to contain a large amount of information that is irrelevant to security, thus raising scalability issues for <b>security</b> <b>audits.</b> In this paper, we propose an approach to assist security auditors by defining and experimenting with pruning techniques to reduce original program slices to what we refer to as security slices, which contain sound and precise information. To evaluate the proposed approach, we compared our security slices to the slices generated by a state-of-the-art program slicing tool, based on a number of open-source benchmarks. On average, our security slices are 76 % smaller than the original slices. More importantly, with security slicing, one needs to audit approximately 1 % of the total code to fix all the vulnerabilities, thus suggesting significant reduction in auditing costs...|$|R
