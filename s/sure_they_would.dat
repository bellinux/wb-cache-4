Instead, they set their sights on a British fort at Ninety Six, South Carolina, where they were <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> find Ferguson. However, while en route, Shelby and his men were met with news of General Horatio Gates' defeat at the Battle of Camden. With the backing of General Cornwallis, Ferguson could ride to meet Shelby with his entire force, so Shelby retreated over the Appalachian Mountains into North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|NY214 {{became the}} subject of {{controversy}} for the conditions of the road through Lanesville and Greene County. The members of a committee of parents in Lanesville noted on December 2, 1946 that they would hold their students from going to school starting on January 6, 1947 if the state did not start work on repairing the road for safety. The committee noted that the conditions of NY214 were dangerous, with the road's pavement not being maintained for use of the school bus and guard rails were not installed to keep cars from going into waterways. The parents remained committed and held about 55 students out of school starting January 2, stating that nothing still had been done to maintain NY214. Burton Belknap, part of the State Education Department, stated that they intended to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> work with the local parents {{in order to get the}} students back in school. The student strike was lifted on January 13 on conditions that the town of Hunter made for repairing the road.|$|E
25|$|With the semi {{final week}} {{just around the}} corner, Week 13 saw some close matches {{including}} the opener between the Highlanders and the Hurricanes at the cake tin. The score was 22 – 16 to the Hurricanes at 80 minutes but a final minute try to Toby Morland in the corner turned things around. Nick Evans {{needed to get the}} kick over to win the game but was unsuccessful allowing the Hurricanes to win the game lucky to not have the same situation when the Hurricanes lost to the Force in week 6. The force continued their up and down season by comfortably beating the cheetahs. The Waratahs narrowly lost going down to the chiefs. The Brumbies pulled an upset win over the Crusaders to keep their semi final hopes alive. The Sharks dominated the lions to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> at least get a home semi final. The Blues lost their third game in a row going down to the Bulls which slimmed the chances of the Blues securing a semi final spot and helped the Bulls secure a semi final spot. The last game of the week saw the stormers easily put away the Reds.|$|E
500|$|Athletic {{authorities}} {{argued that}} Ward should not play {{because it would}} be discourteous to Georgia Tech, and he might be injured. [...] There was fear that if Ward played, he would be injured by malicious blows after the play had ended. [...] Playwright Arthur Miller, then a writer for Michigan’s student newspaper, learned first-hand about the strong resistance among the Georgia Tech team to playing on the same field with an African-American athlete. In his biography of Miller, Enoch Brater noted that Miller had friends from Arkansas who knew one of the Georgia Tech players. Brater described Miller’s involvement this way: “Remmel [...] took Miller with them to meet with members of the team, to protest but also to appeal to the athletes' sense of fair play. ‘Miller was {{right in the middle of}} this’, Remmel recalls. Not only did the visiting team rebuff ‘the Yankee’ Miller ‘in salty language’, but they told him they would actually kill Ward if he set one foot on the Michigan gridiron. [...] ‘The Georgia Tech team was wild.’ [...] Miller was furious. He ‘went immediately to the office of the Michigan Daily and wrote an article about it, but it was not published.’ [...] [...] [...] Remmel said that Miller ‘could not believe that the Georgia Tech team would have tried to destroy Willis Ward—but, I am <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have.’” ...|$|E

500|$|The animators {{were told}} to make a {{detailed}} replica of the city. David Silverman was sent to Manhattan to take hundreds of pictures {{of the city and}} areas around the World Trade Center. When he returned, Lance Wilder and his team spent time creating new scenes and backgrounds, incorporating small details such as signs and hundreds of extras that would correctly illustrate the city. Oakley and Weinstein were pleased with the final results, and both noted that the buildings, streets, and even elevator cabins were detailed closely to their real life counterparts. In the final scene, as the family is seen driving away from New York on the George Washington Bridge, the credits roll with the [...] "camera" [...] gradually pulling back from a view of the car, to a view of the side, and then on to a panorama view of the city; as if the whole sequence was being shot from a helicopter. To achieve this effect, a computer model of the bridge pulling out was made and then printed out. With the print outs, photocopies were made traced onto the animation cels. The process took a long time and was expensive, as the use of computer animation was not widespread when the episode was produced. Director Jim Reardon wanted to replicate films that ended in a similar way, and commented, [...] "I remembered that every movie located in New York would pull back if you were leaving town on a bridge." [...] Shortly before the episode aired, the production staff contacted Fox to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not run commercials during the credits.|$|E

2500|$|On September 12, 2012, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest {{granted the}} plaintiffs' motion for a {{permanent}} injunction of § 1021(b)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 in a 112-page opinion. The permanent injunction issued by Judge Forrest barred the government from relying on the defense authorization law to hold people in indefinite military detention on suspicion that they [...] "substantially supported" [...] Al Qaeda or its allies — at least if they had no connection to the September 11 attacks. Forrest held that the law's definitions of [...] "substantially supported" [...] and [...] "associated forces" [...] were unconstitutionally vague in that a reporter or activist could not be <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not be covered under the provision if they worked with a group deemed {{to be associated with}} terrorists, or perhaps circulated the message of an associated individual by printing an interview. Forrest acknowledged the importance of the government's efforts to safeguard the country from terrorism, but ruled that the law's broad language violated First Amendment right to free speech, as well as the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right to due process that holds that a person must be able to understand what actions would subject them to penalties.|$|E

2500|$|By 1941, {{after an}} {{increase}} in aluminium prices of forty percent, an internal report at Citroën showed that producing the TPV post-war would not be economically viable, given the projected further increasing cost of aluminium. Boulanger decided to redesign the car to use mostly steel with flat panels, instead of aluminium. The Nazis had attempted to loot Citroën's press tools; this was frustrated after Boulanger got the French Resistance to re-label the rail cars containing them in the Paris marshalling yard. They ended up all over Europe, and Citroën {{was by no means}} <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> all be returned after the war. In early 1944 Boulanger made the decision to abandon the water-cooled two-cylinder engine developed for the car and installed in the 1939 versions. Walter Becchia was now briefed to design an air-cooled unit, still of two cylinders, and still of 375cc. Becchia was also supposed to design a three-speed gearbox, but managed to design a four-speed for the same space at little extra cost. At this time small French cars like the Renault Juvaquatre and Peugeot 202 usually featured three-speed transmissions, as did Citroën's own mid-size Traction Avant - but the 1936 Italian Fiat 500 [...] "Topolino" [...] "people's car" [...] did have a four-speed gearbox. Becchia persuaded Boulanger that the fourth gear was an overdrive. The increased number of gear ratios also helped to pull the extra weight of changing from light alloys to steel for the body and chassis. Other changes included seats with tubular steel frames with rubber band springing and a restyling of the body by the Italian Flaminio Bertoni. Also, in 1944 the first studies of the Citroën hydro-pneumatic suspension were conducted using the TPV/2CV.|$|E
2500|$|Lyle Masaki of AfterElton.com commends the manga for {{illustrating}} [...] "the challenges gay men face in Japanese society", and for {{not following}} the traditional mode of student-teacher romantic relationships in [...] "Boys Love" [...] titles, opting instead for a friendship where both characters discover {{more about what}} it is to be a gay man. Holly Ellingwood at Active Anime commended the first volume its unique artwork, and praised the plot for its [...] "bittersweet" [...] poignancy, and for showing unrequited love rather than being a simplistic story about [...] "winning the guy". She felt the second volume had [...] "unusual pacing" [...] and came off as [...] "abrupt" [...] peeks into the lives of many different couples. Mania.com's Danielle Van Gorder praised the manga for its characterization and ability to reflect reality. Erin Finnegan of Pop Culture Shock criticized the story for Ida and Hachizume adopting each other, essentially getting married, before having sex, which she regarded as unrealistic. Comic World News's David Welsh says that Yoshinaga's characters, even in this early work, have layers, and that it is enjoyable to see how the frank student inspires the adult characters to communicate better. Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux criticizes the manga for its inability to focus on one couple. Robin Brenner described the plot as being [...] "an engaging meditation on how crushes are wonderful, but oh, how they can hurt." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the story as having been [...] "padded out", but enjoyed the theme of [...] "love and loss" [...] in the manga. [...] Johanna Draper Carlson felt it was novel for the treatment of sex in the first volume to consist of a character making <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be able to satisfy their partner. [...] She felt the second volume was strange for being largely sex scenes.|$|E
