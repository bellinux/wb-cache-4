25|$|The final {{victim to}} be murdered at Melrose Avenue was a 23-year-old named Malcolm Barlow, whom Nilsen {{discovered}} <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> a wall outside {{his home on}} 17 September 1981. When Nilsen enquired as to Barlow's welfare, he was informed the medication Barlow was prescribed for his epilepsy had caused his legs to weaken. Nilsen informed Barlow he should be in hospital and, supporting him, walked the youth into his residence before phoning an ambulance. The following day, Barlow was released from hospital and returned to Nilsen's home, apparently to thank him. He was invited into Nilsen's residence and, after eating a meal, began drinking rum and coke before falling asleep on Nilsen's sofa. Nilsen manually strangled Barlow as he slept, before stowing his body beneath his kitchen sink the following morning.|$|E
25|$|On 22 March 2001, {{tensions}} soared {{further in}} Tetovo, when two Albanian men, {{a father and}} a son, were shot dead during a routine search at a police checkpoint. The incident began when the car was stopped and a police officer saw the younger Albanian move something in his pocket. Fearing it was a grenade the officer panicked and ran. The Albanian exited the car, dropped to his knees, and threw the grenade {{in the direction of the}} running policeman. It landed at his feet but failed to explode. At the moment the grenade was thrown, a cordon of Macedonian troops, positioned behind sandbags, unleashed a volley of gunfire at the Albanian. At first he <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> the car, then fell on the curb, dead. Moments later the father was also shot as he tried to run from the car. Witnesses later interviewed insisted the father and son died with mobile phones in their hands, claiming that the pair were victims of revenge by police.|$|E
25|$|At 11:15 that morning, Fred {{formally}} {{admitted to}} police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit {{in an act}} of manslaughter. He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage before dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy serrated knife he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat. Her remains had been stored in a dustbin as he waited for an opportunity to dig her grave. Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden. He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body. Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and his appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder. In response, Stephen <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered a state of shock, before stammering that her father had not killed her sister.|$|E
50|$|Sloane {{joined the}} Nine Network in 1997 as a {{lifestyle}} series reporter for both A Current Affair and Money. She moved from A Current Affair in 2005, during a revamp of the programme to combat a ratings <b>slump</b> <b>against</b> rival Seven Network's Today Tonight.|$|R
25|$|Bryant {{was near}} the exit, {{preventing}} others from attempting to run past him and escape. Bryant moved across the café towards the gift shop area. There was an exit door through the display area to the outside balcony, but it was locked and could only be opened with a key. As Bryant moved, Robert Elliott stood up. He {{was shot in the}} arm and head, left <b>slumping</b> <b>against</b> the fireplace but alive.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Towson’s 30th {{season of}} football, the Tigers {{showed signs of}} improvement. The Tigers {{got off to a}} 2-0 start, beating rival Morgan State in the opener. They also claimed their first Patriot League win, beating Fordham in overtime. After a midseason <b>slump</b> <b>against</b> the league’s heavyweights, the Tigers beat St. Mary’s and Drake. Garrett was a first team All-Patriot League pick at {{defensive}} back for a second straight year. Jason Corle led the league in rushing, scoring and all-purpose yards, earning second team all-league honors.|$|R
2500|$|While {{an unarmed}} Kennaway {{physically}} restrained the driver, Glennon, {{armed with the}} Derringer, gave cover beside the van as [...] McWilliams opened the side door on the left at the rear, and shouted the words: [...] "Armed INLA volunteers". With {{a smile on his}} face, he then took up a firing stance and aimed his PA63 pistol inside the van at Wright, who was sitting sideways facing the side door beside Norman Green, with Prison Officer Stephen Sterritt seated behind the driver. Wright had been {{in the middle of a}} conversation, discussing the [...] "cost of Christmas", with both men. After McWilliams ordered Sterritt to [...] "fuck up and sit in his seat" [...] and Green to get out of the way, the two men instantly dropped to the floor to protect themselves; however, Wright stood up and kicked out at his assailant who began firing at point blank range. Green pleaded with Wright to [...] "get down", but McWilliams climbed into the van and continued shooting at Wright, hitting him a total of seven times. Wright, despite being shot, continued to defend himself by moving forward, kicking and lashing out at McWilliams. Wright was fatally wounded by the last shot, the bullet having lacerated his aorta. He <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> the legs of Green. After screaming [...] "they shot Billy", Green made an attempt to resuscitate Wright, but to no avail; he was brought to the prison hospital, where a doctor pronounced him dead at 10.53 a.m. None of the others inside the van were hurt. Immediately following the shooting attack, the three gunmen returned the way they had come and surrendered to prison guards. They handed over a statement:Billy Wright was executed for one reason and one reason only, and that was for directing and waging his campaign of terror against the nationalist people from his prison cell in Long Kesh [...]|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 31, 1901, while off Cavite in Manila Bay, a fire started aboard the Petrel {{originating}} in the sail room. The sail room was a small compartment {{in the bottom of}} the ship, adjacent to the magazine and was accessible only by a hatchway from the berth deck above. Several members of the ship's crew, led by the ship's captain, Lieutenant Commander Jesse M. Roper took turns entering the compartment and fighting the blaze. The fire produced no visible flames but thick, acrid smoke and fumes filled the area. The sail room was also pitch black; the ship's electric generator had been turned off at dawn, and no other lamps would work in the harsh atmosphere of the compartment. A number of men, including Roper, were overcome by the bad air and were pulled out of the sail room semi-conscious. As the fumes grew thicker and more noxious, Roper ordered everyone out of the compartment, but one sailor, Seaman Patrick Toner, did not emerge from the room. When a sound was heard from below, believed to be Toner fighting for breath, four men descended to rescue him, including Roper (not fully recovered from his first trip below). When the four men did not return, Seaman Alphonse Girandy tied a rope around his waist and climbed down the ladder, finding Kessler and Flaherty, both semi-conscious, and passing them up to be hauled through the hatchway. He found Toner at the bottom of the ladder and, although losing consciousness himself, held on to him as the sailors above pulled both men out of the compartment. Lieutenant J.S. McKean, with a rope around his waist, was next into the sail room, followed by Private Louis F. Thies (Pfiefer) and Seaman Thomas Cahey. As McKean searched in the darkness for the two men still missing, Lieutenant Commander Roper and Cadet Lewis, the ship's generator finally came back online. With the help of a lamp lowered through the hatchway, McKean could see Roper and Lewis <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> the walls of the compartment. McKean dragged Roper to the ladder to be hauled out and then, with the help of Theis and Cahey, rescued Lewis, just before losing consciousness himself. The fire was extinguished later that day; Roper was killed by the fumes, but the other men all eventually recovered. For their actions during the incident, Cahey, Girandy, and Thies were each awarded the Medal of Honor. Pfeifer received his medal on March 22, 1902, while still going by the name of Louis Fred Theis. His complete citation states: ...|$|E

50|$|Maxwell {{figures out}} who Derek is and tells Brandon {{he will give}} Derek a talking to. Jamie gets naked again and has sex with Brandon in the hot tub, but as Brandon is coming he cries out a little too loudly, and <b>slumps</b> <b>against</b> Jamie's naked body in the hot tub—Derek has sneaked {{into the house and}} stabbed Brandon in the back as they are making love, killing him. Derek then, inexplicably, drags Brandon's body into the woods and buries him, then goes home.|$|R
5000|$|Back at {{the boxing}} ring, Starbuck and Apollo have battled {{each other to}} a stand-still. They <b>slump</b> <b>against</b> {{each other in the}} middle of the ring with their arms around each other. An awkward silence follows, and the spectators shuffle out of the hall. Anders leaves too, while Dee lowers her head. Starbuck whispers to Apollo that she has [...] "missed him". Apollo replies that he missed her, too. As the scene fades out, there is the trace of a smile upon Starbuck's face.|$|R
5000|$|Lindsey {{destroys the}} Sahrvin demon clan with Lorne's {{assistance}} as planned. However, Angel knows Lindsey {{can never be}} trusted. Consequently, Angel secretly instructs Lorne to assassinate Lindsey once the Sahrvin are eliminated. Lindsey insists to Lorne he has changed. But Lorne, no longer Lindsey's friend, remarks that he can't change, shooting Lindsey twice in the chest with a silenced pistol. A stunned Lindsey <b>slumps</b> <b>against</b> a wall, both outraged and humiliated {{he was killed by}} one of Angel's [...] "flunkies" [...] instead of the vampire himself.|$|R

50|$|Bertie Tyrer {{came down}} stairs at 8:45 and found Charles Selfs' body {{lying in a}} pool of blood partly <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> the front door.

Tyler tried to use the phone, but couldn't get a dial tone, so he rang Dún Laoghaire Garda station from the neighbouring Mews.|$|E
5000|$|Isaac {{works on}} another {{painting}}. The painting shows Peter <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> a broken taxi, his leg becoming invisible. He then tells Mr. Bennet {{on the phone}} that he has found Peter and a way to stop him. Isaac says that Peter is invisible and asks him what it means. [...] "It means an old friend isn't quite as dead as we thought he was," [...] Mr. Bennet responds.|$|E
5000|$|Constable Krempkau {{went to a}} saloon {{next door}} to {{retrieve}} his rifle and pistol. A confrontation erupted with ex-City Marshal George Campbell over comments allegedly made by Campbell about Krempkau’s interpretations and his friendship with the Mexicans. John Hale, who was allegedly unarmed, was heavily intoxicated and upset with Constable Krempkau’s involvement in the investigation. Hale pulled one of Campbell's two pistols and yelled, [...] "George, I've got you covered!". He shot Krempkau, who then reeled backward. <b>Slumping</b> <b>against</b> a saloon door, Krempkau pulled out his own pistol.|$|R
2500|$|Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire, a noted gunfighter who {{had only}} started as town marshal on April 11, was present in the court room. After the court adjourned, he walked across the street for dinner. Constable Krempkau went to a saloon next door to {{retrieve}} his rifle and pistol. There, a confrontation took place with George Campbell over remarks allegedly made by Campbell about Krempkau’s translations and his apparent friendship with the Mexicans. John Hale, who was reportedly unarmed, was heavily intoxicated and was also upset with Krempkau’s involvement in the matter. Hale grabbed one of Campbell's two pistols and yelled, [...] "George, I've got you covered!" [...] He then shot Krempkau, who reeled backward. <b>Slumping</b> <b>against</b> a saloon door, Krempkau drew his own pistol.|$|R
2500|$|At {{approximately}} 4:10p.m., a Mexican couple, Astolfo and Maricela Felix, drove {{toward one}} of the service areas of the restaurant. Noting the shattered glass, Astolfo initially thought renovation work was in progress and that Huberty—striding toward the car—was a repairman. Huberty fired his shotgun and Uzi at the couple and their 4-month-old daughter, Karlita, striking Maricela in the face, arms and chest, blinding her in one eye and permanently rendering one hand unusable. Her baby was critically wounded in the neck, chest and abdomen. Astolfo was wounded in the chest and head. As Astolfo and Maricela staggered away from Huberty's line of fire, Maricela put her shrieking child into the arms of a fleeing woman and shouted in Spanish, [...] "Please save my baby", before <b>slumping</b> <b>against</b> a parked car. The woman rushed the baby to a nearby hospital as her husband assisted Astolfo and Maricela into a nearby building. All three members of the Felix family survived.|$|R
50|$|Thrust was {{recruited}} as a Decepticon {{under the leadership}} of Megatron in his war against the Autobots on the planet Cybertron. Thrust {{became a member of the}} elite Seekers under Aerospace Commander Starscream. He often worked with fellow Seekers Ramjet and Dirge. He appeared defending Cybertron's planetary engines from Grimlock's group, but was later seen <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> the wall. Staying with the Decepticons during the chaos following Megatron's disappearance, Thrust was one of those who defeated the Chaos Trinity.|$|E
50|$|In the Long Beach {{parking lot}} where Crotwell and May had last been seen, two {{friends of the}} youths {{observed}} a distinctive black and white Ford Mustang rapidly enter and draw to a halt before the driver leaned across, opened the passenger door, and pushed the unconscious (but otherwise unharmed) Kent May from the rear seat onto the ground of the parking lot. The driver then sped away from the scene. As he did so, the friends of Crotwell and May noted Crotwell <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> the unknown driver's shoulder.|$|E
50|$|On April 24, 1980, two {{teenagers}} stumbled across a body, {{early in the}} morning. <b>Slumped</b> <b>against</b> a trash can, and carrying no identification, the body bore no clear indicators of foul play. Cause of death {{was determined to be}} asphyxiation, as a large chunk of flesh was extracted from the victim's throat. Every potential clue leads to small revelations, but bigger mysteries. Though the investigation is lightly bungled, everything seems inexplicable, from how the fish-dinner stomach contents could line up with his ferry boat crossing, to the single Russian coin in his pocket.|$|E
5000|$|Louise pleads with Donati not to {{go through}} with the duel; André has been seen to be an {{excellent}} shot and will surely kill him. Donati is pensive, but refuses to back out and arrives at the dueling field with his and André's seconds. Meanwhile, Louise goes to the Church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont to pray fervently at the shrine of St. Geneviève that Donati be spared - the same place where she was seen earlier praying frivolously that the jeweler will be willing to buy back her earrings. She then races with her servant to the duel just as the agents inform the duelists that the [...] "offended party," [...] André, is allowed to fire first. He takes aim at Donati, who stands unflinching. As Louise hastens up the hill toward the duel, a single shot is heard, but no second shot, implying that one duelist may be dead. She <b>slumps</b> <b>against</b> a tree as the servant runs off for help.|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of February 7, 1968, his lawyer and friend, ex-LAPD officer Ervin Roeder, drove to the actor's house at 2126 El Roble Lane in Beverly Hills to check on him after a missed dinner appointment. Seeing a light on and his car in the garage, Roeder broke through a window and {{discovered}} Adams in his upstairs bedroom, <b>slumped</b> dead <b>against</b> a wall.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, a Nurofen {{advertisement}} featured Ned Kelly {{in his last}} stand at Glenrowan, engaging in a firefight against police officers besieging the Glenrowan Hotel, which he is occupying. Midway through the fight, Ned suffers a headache, and withdraws into the hotel. Removing his helmet and placing it on a nearby table, Ned <b>slumps</b> <b>against</b> a fireplace, pulls a box of Nurofen tablets out of his coat pocket and consumes a tablet, giving him immediate relief from his headache. After {{a few seconds of}} relief, Ned is snapped back to reality when police officers fire at the hotel, destroying a clock sitting on the mantelpiece above him. Remembering that his helmet is sitting on a table near him, he pushes {{it in front of the}} window. Seeing the helmet in the window, the police mistake it for being Ned and fire at it. This distraction allows Ned to escape the hotel via the back door, and by the time the police realise the ruse, Ned is galloping away on a horse.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{immediately}} thereafter, Carlson {{arrives with}} a search team, telling Linden they have until dawn before the tribe's lawyers show up. Officers sweep the grounds and find Holder's Pez dispenser. While searching a nearby dump {{in the morning}} light, Linden notices a young girl, who points towards the woods (in the opposite direction from where the Pez dispenser was found). The search team is redirected, and the K-9 units pick up a scent as Wapi tribal chief Nicole Jackson (Claudia Ferri) and her lawyers meet Carlson at his car. In the woods, Holder's unconscious, battered body is found <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> a tree.|$|E
5000|$|On August 1, 1952, Roe {{was told}} by doctors that he had stomach cancer {{and that it was}} inoperable. As a result, Roe stopped hiding and {{dismissed}} his bodyguards. On August 4, 1952, he dressed in a three-piece suit and hat and strolled down South Michigan Avenue. At around 10:00 p.m., as he was unlocking his car on the street outside his apartment, a voice called, [...] "Roe!" [...] He turned and was cut down by several shotgun blasts. He died <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> a tree which still stands outside his former apartment at 5239 S. Michigan Ave.|$|E
5000|$|Tyson quickly had Frazier on the defensive, {{using his}} left jab to back Frazier into the ropes. Frazier then {{retreated to the}} corner where Tyson {{continue}} to use his left jab before unleashing two consecutive uppercuts, the second of which knocked Frazier unconscious. Tyson then landed several more blows before Frazier fell to the canvas, <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> the ropes. Referee Joe Cortez began to count to ten, but as Frazier was clearly unresponsive, stopped the count at five and ended the fight. The fight would last only 30 seconds, becoming the quickest victory of Tyson's professional career.|$|E
25|$|Spurrier next had an {{opportunity}} to start in the fifth game of the 1973 season, when he replaced a <b>slumping</b> Brodie <b>against</b> the Minnesota Vikings. He set team records with 31 completions and 320 passing yards, but he also tossed two interceptions, and the 49ers lost 17-14. With Spurrier suffering from a lingering knee injury, 49ers Coach Nolan decided to start fellow backup Joe Reed the following week, and Spurrier's playing time was again limited.|$|R
5000|$|World War I {{brought more}} women into {{newspaper}} jobs as their male colleagues went to battle. Theta Sigma Phi member Alice Rohe was a United Press reporter in Rome; Bessie Beatty of the San Francisco Bulletin and Sigrid Schulz of the Chicago Tribune reported from Germany {{as the war}} ended. But in the postwar economic <b>slump,</b> hostility <b>against</b> [...] "women in mens jobs" [...] ran high. Many editors relegated women to society pages instead of [...] "hard news." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Bulgaria made {{a strong}} start to its Europe/Africa Zone Group I {{campaign}} with a 3-0 victory over Portugal, but struggled to maintain its early form and <b>slumped</b> to defeat <b>against</b> Belarus, Georgia and Ukraine to finish in 10th place in Budapest.|$|R
50|$|Morrison {{got off to}} a great start, outboxing a {{sluggish}} Mercer through the first three rounds en route to taking all three rounds on all three of the judge's scorecards. Morrison was able to limit Mercer's offense, landed several combinations and opened up a cut on Mercer's lower lip. However, Mercer rebounded with a strong round four, landing several hard rights to Morrison's head. Mercer would end the fight only 28 seconds into the fifth round. With Morrison backed up into the corner, Mercer was able to land a 15-punch combination. Clearly hurt from the exchange, Morrison <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> the ropes, but the referee allowed Mercer to land several more punishing blows to a now defenseless Morrison before finally ending the fight.|$|E

25|$|Liston {{was found}} dead by his wife, Geraldine, in their Las Vegas home on January 5, 1971. On {{returning}} home from a two-week trip, Geraldine had smelled a foul odor emanating from the main bedroom and on entering saw Sonny <b>slumped</b> up <b>against</b> the bed, a broken foot bench on the floor. Authorities theorized that he was undressing for bed when he fell over backward {{with such force that}} he broke the rail of the bench. Geraldine called Sonny's attorney and his doctor, but did not notify the police until two to three hours later.|$|R
50|$|Later, Emily convinces the old dragon to fly after {{watching}} {{one of the}} other dragons flying, with him taking her for a fun ride in the sky despite having not flown for 100 years. With storm clouds approaching, the pair head for home. However, the dragon is shot in the wing by the hunters and crashes outside the railway tunnel, knocking Emily unconscious. Putting her out of harm's way, the Dragon scares off the hunters and their dogs before <b>slumping</b> down <b>against</b> the tunnel wall and seemingly disappearing.|$|R
5000|$|A {{woman in}} the lower right panel taps the Hero on the hat with her parasol. He pulls her close and kisses her. She draws a knife but, mesmerized by his kiss, turns away and <b>slumps</b> <b>against</b> {{the side of the}} frame. He tips his hat and walks away {{with his back to the}} camera. There were two {{versions}} of this vignette; this one appears during the first season. When the show switched to color, the Hero knocked the woman down with a right cross to the jaw. This variant also appears in the original pilot episode (included on the DVD release) when the series was titled The Wild West. Despite this, James West never hit a woman in any episode, although he grappled with many. The closest he came was when he slammed a door against the shotgun holding evil Countess Zorana in [...] "The Night of the Iron Fist". In [...] "The Night of the Running Death" [...] he slugged a woman named Miss Tyler, but [...] "she" [...] was a man in drag (actor T. C. Jones). The original animation, with the Hero winning the woman over with a kiss, was a more accurate representation of West's methods than the right cross. Ironically, it is another example of the emphasis on violence of the show.|$|R
