25|$|That you say as {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe that Jesus was sent {{into the world}} to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality {{of the world and}} that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E

[...] Despite the conflicts, Lohan spoke very fondly of her family. However, in 2007, 2008, and 2009 she admitted that she had cut off contact with her father, describing his behavior as unpredictable and hard to deal with.|$|E
500|$|More diverse {{than their}} first two studio albums, musically more melodic and lyrically more direct, Beautiful Garbage {{featured}} electronica fused with contemporary hip hop, with influences coming from 1980s new wave to 1960s girl groups. Garbage acknowledged the broad span of sounds and styles, which included Prince, The Rolling Stones, Blondie, and Phil Spector. Regarding the melancholic lyrics, Manson stated they happened because after two years touring [...] "we were very isolated and removed from our lives", so when writing the lyrics, [...] "I felt an overwhelming <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> need to reinvest in my 'relations'".|$|E

500|$|Creators Murphy and Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Affleck acted professionally {{throughout}} his childhood but, {{in his own}} words, [...] "not in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a mom that wanted {{to take me to}} Hollywood or a family that wanted to make money from me ... I kind of chanced into something." [...] He first appeared, at the age of seven, in a local independent film called Dark Side of the Street (1981), directed by a family friend. His biggest success as a child actor was as the star of the PBS children's series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988), produced for sixth-grade science classes. Affleck worked [...] "sporadically" [...] on Mimi from the age of eight to fifteen in both Massachusetts and Mexico. As a teenager, he appeared in the ABC after school special Wanted: A Perfect Man (1986), the television film Hands of a Stranger (1987), and a 1989 Burger King commercial.|$|E
500|$|Miss Rosa {{undertakes}} chemotherapy {{to treat}} her cancer which leaves her bald. Rosenblat did not shave her head for the role because she worried about other roles. She had to wear a silicone [...] "appliance" [...] {{on her head and}} neck. Each morning on set makeup artist Josh Turri made up the appliance onto her. The process would take approximately three hours and Turri added false beauty marks, eyebrows and small veins to complete Miss Rosa's look. Rosenblat described him as [...] "utterly brilliant and a perfectionist ... so you got this entirely organic <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was utterly bald and suffering [...] cancer." [...] While on set fellow actors and crew members incorrectly assumed she had shaved her head. The weather during filming also affected Miss Rosa's costumer. During warm weather crew shielded Rosenblat from the sun with umbrellas because the heat would cause the make up to crack. Other breaches were caused by perspiration and Turri would drain water from underneath the prosthetics prior to repairing it. At the end of each shoot it took Rosenblat 45 minutes to remove the appliance.|$|E

500|$|Pundits {{and coaches}} {{sometimes}} characterized Turner as a quarterback {{who did not}} excel during practices, but executed well on game-day. Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "He's pretty go-with-the-flow. And that's his greatest strength and maybe his greatest weakness. The bottom line is, he plays well in games." [...] The Baltimore Sun wrote that he [...] "seems to play his best when it counts—and his worst when it doesn't." [...] Regarding the 2008 summer practices, offensive coordinator James Franklin said Turner ranked in the middle compared with Jordan Steffy and Josh Portis in terms of completion percentage, fewest interceptions, and [...] "explosive" [...] plays that gained 16 yards or more. Turner conceded that Steffy was a better game-planner during practices. Head coach Ralph Friedgen who had offered critical or subdued assessments of Turners' practice, said his intensity grew after losing the starting position to Steffy prior to the 2008 season. Turner said, [...] "It lit a fire in me in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to be ready." ...|$|E

40|$|Keeley has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} philosophical issue of how to analyse {{the concept of a}} sense can usefully be addressed by considering how scientists, and more specifically neuroethologists, classify the senses. After briefly outlining his proposal, which is based on the application of an ordered set of individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for modality differentiation, I argue, by way of two complementary counterexamples, that it fails to account fully for the way the senses are in fact individuated in neuroethology and other relevant sciences. I suggest substantial modifications to Keeley’s account which would both solve the problem cases and make better sense of the actual classifications made by scientists. I conclude by noting some limits to the way of classifying the <b>senses</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> suggest. I conclude by suggesting <b>that</b> the problem <b>I</b> identify in Keeley’s account has arisen from a confusion that sometimes arises in the philosophical literature between how we individuate the senses and what constitutes a sense...|$|R

These include methods based on spherical harmonics, tensorproduct spaces on a rectangular map of the sphere, functions defined over spherical triangulations, spherical splines, spherical radial basis functions, and some associated multi-resolution methods.

[...] On relating to the character, Bell said, [...] "You know, I come from a very working-class background myself.

After completing her degree in voice and piano at the New England Conservatory, she moved with her husband to Montgomery, Alabama, in September 1954. Mrs. King recalled: [...] "After we married, we moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where my husband had accepted an invitation to be the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.

Though all of the main line of Ultima games are arranged into trilogies, Richard Garriot later revealed that Ultima VII was the first game where he did any sort of planning ahead for future games in the series. He elaborated that [...] "the first three didn't {{have much to do}} with each other, they were 'Richard Garriott learns to program'; IV through VI were a backwards-designed trilogy, in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> tied them together as I wrote them; but VII-IX, the story of the Guardian, were a preplanned trilogy, and we had a definite idea of where we wanted to go." [...] An expansion pack was released named Forge of Virtue that added a newly arisen volcanic island to the map that the Avatar was invited to investigate. The tie-in storyline was limited to this island, where a piece of Exodus (his data storage unit) had resurfaced. To leave the island again, the Avatar had to destroy this remnant of Exodus. In the process of doing so, he also created The Black Sword, an immensely powerful weapon possessed by a demon.|$|E
