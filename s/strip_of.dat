Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Saxon immigration, the Székelys –Hungarian-speaking free warriors {{cultivating}} communal lands– were transferred to the southeast of the province. From the 13thcentury they were governed independently from the voivode by a royal official, the count of the Székelys. Besides the Saxons, the Cistercians became the agents of expansion in Transylvania. When their abbey at Cârţa was established in the early 13thcentury, Andrew II ordered that the <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> land running up to the mountains between the rivers Olt, Cârţişoara and Arpaş be transferred from the Romanians to the new monastery.|$|E

Further north are the Calm Lands, a series of plains that have been the site of numerous battles in Spira's history; the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth, an equally historical area; and Mt. Gagazet, home of the Ronsos. Lastly, the sacred city of Zanarkand is on the northern tip of the Spiran mainland, reduced to ruins by Sin one thousand years before the events of Final Fantasy X.|$|E
5|$|Blissymbols {{were first}} used in Canada in 1971 to provide {{communication}} to those {{not able to}} use traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries. With improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a screen or <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> paper. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, communication devices were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.|$|E

The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the show was {{operating}} on a strict budget, shots of the Chinese freighter were almost entirely created by digital technology or other special effects. For the opening scene of the ship at sea, a matte painting of a boat based on a toy model was superimposed onto a film <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> an empty ocean. Several scenes featuring the boat in port were created by filming an empty harbor and then superimposing a ship via digital technology. Special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich created a latex appliance that enabled the veterinarian to have his throat bitten out.|$|E

5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} {{have one thing in}} common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long narrow <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, after {{receiving}} {{approval from the}} government, the Parks Commission began to expropriate land {{along the length of}} the river. The broadened <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> land was used to construct a new paved parkway, which was opened in segments. The new parkway was ornamental and designed to be aesthetically pleasing, a prime consideration of road construction at that time. The section south of the falls was completed first, opening in 1912. It was extended north to the Whirlpool Rapids, incorporating the existing River Road, by 1915. The section between the rapids and Queenston was opened between 1921 and 1923. Finally, the remaining section between Queenston and Niagara-on-the-Lake opened in 1931, completing the present parkway.|$|E
