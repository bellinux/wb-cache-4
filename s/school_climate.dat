We {{examined}} whether {{sexual minority}} students living in {{states and cities}} with more protective <b>school</b> <b>climates</b> were at lower risk of suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts. Methods. Data on sexual orientation and past-year suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts were from the pooled 2005 and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Surveys from 8 states and cities. We derived data on <b>school</b> <b>climates</b> that protected sexual minority students (e. g., percentage of schools with safe spaces and Gay–Straight Alliances) from the 2010 School Health Profile Survey, compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual students living in states and cities with more protective <b>school</b> <b>climates</b> reported fewer past-year suicidal thoughts than those living in states and cities with less protective climates (lesbians and gays: odds ratio [OR][*]=[*] 0. 68; 95 % confidence interval [CI][*]=[*] 0. 47, 0. 99; bisexuals: OR[*]=[*] 0. 81; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 66, 0. 99). Results were robust to adjustment for potential state-level confounders. Sexual orientation disparities in suicidal thoughts were nearly eliminated in states and cities with the most protective <b>school</b> <b>climates.</b> Conclusions. <b>School</b> <b>climates</b> that protect sexual minority students may reduce their risk of suicidal thoughts...|$|R

According to the group FairTest, when standardized tests are the primary factor in accountability, schools use the tests to narrowly define curriculum and focus instruction. Accountability creates an immense pressure to perform and {{this can lead to}} the misuse and misinterpretation of standardized tests. FairTest says that negative consequences of test misuse include narrowing the curriculum, teaching to the test, pushing students out of school, driving teachers out of the profession, and undermining student engagement and <b>school</b> <b>climate.</b> Critics say that [...] "teaching to the test" [...] disfavors higher-order learning.

2500|$|School {{psychologists are}} {{becoming}} increasingly involved {{in the implementation of}} academic, behavioral, and social/emotional interventions within a school, often across a continuum of tiered supports. Schoolwide positive behavior supports (SWPBS) is a systematic approach that proactively promotes constructive behaviors in a school. These programs are designed to improve and support students’ social, behavioral, and learning outcomes by promoting a positive <b>school</b> <b>climate</b> and providing targeted training to students and educators within a school. [...] School psychologists are commonly involved in the implementation and monitoring of such programs. Teams are generally formed to address and evaluate existing policies, structures, and leadership roles. Commonly, teams will develop a set of goals to be adopted by the entire school community. To do so, teams are tasked with designing systems that address the needs of all students, including those who have repeated offenses. These systems and polices should convey clear behavior expectations and promote consistency among educators. [...] Students should be continuously reinforced for positive behaviors. SWPBS systems set parameters for collecting data, evaluating the efficiency of systems, and establishing these practices within a school. School psychologists are commonly involved in the implementation and data collection processes. Data should be collected consistently to assess implementation effectiveness, screen and monitor student behavior, and develop or modify action plans.|$|E
50|$|When {{gathering}} information about <b>school</b> <b>climate,</b> {{it is recommended}} to gather information from multiple perspectives (e.g., teachers, administrators, students, etc.). For instance, a study comparing parents’, teachers’, and students’ perceptions of <b>school</b> <b>climate</b> found that students reported worse ratings of safety and connectedness than the adults. In addition, some student characteristics also affect their perception of <b>school</b> <b>climate.</b> Therefore, having behavior problems, being held back a grade, coming from a single-parent family, or having a different ethnic background can all influence a student’s perception of <b>school</b> <b>climate.</b> This {{emphasizes the importance of}} {{gathering information}} from different informants when assessing <b>school</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E

A negative <b>school</b> <b>climate</b> can also make existing social-emotional difficulties worse, and these effects can be long-term. For example, the severity of a student’s mental health problems can increase over time if classroom conditions do not improve. In a study of middle school adolescents’ perceptions of <b>school</b> <b>climate</b> and its impact on psychological health, researchers found that dimensions of <b>school</b> <b>climate</b> (safety, relationships, connectedness, sense of belonging, etc.) and psychological and emotional health declined over three years.
