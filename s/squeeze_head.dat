40|$|Objectives: To compare paramedics’ {{ability to}} {{minimize}} cervical spine motion during patient transfer onto a vacuum mattress with two stabilization techniques (<b>Head</b> <b>Squeeze</b> vs. Trap Squeeze) and two transfer methods (log roll with one assistant (LR 2) vs. 3 assistants (LR 4)). Methods: We used a cross-over design to minimize bias. Each lead paramedic performed 10 LR 2 transfers and 10 LR 4 transfers. For {{each of the}} 10 LR 2 and 10 LR 4 transfers, the lead paramedic stabilized the cervical spine using the <b>Head</b> <b>Squeeze</b> technique five times and the Trap Squeeze technique five times. We randomized {{the order of the}} stabilization techniques and LR 2 / LR 4 across lead paramedics to avoid a practice or fatigue effect with repeated trials. We measured relative cervical spine motion between the head and trunk using Inertial Measurement Units placed on the forehead and sternum. Results: On average, total motion was 3. 9 ° less with three assistants compared to one assistant (p= 0. 0002), and 2. 8 ° less with the Trap Squeeze compared to the <b>Head</b> <b>Squeeze</b> (p= 0. 002). There was no interaction between the transfer method and stabilization technique. When examining specific motions in the six directions, the Trap Squeeze generally produced less lateral flexion and rotation motion but allowed more extension. Examining within paramedic differences, some paramedics were clearly more proficient with the Trap Squeeze technique and others were clearly more proficient with the <b>Head</b> <b>Squeeze</b> technique. Conclusion: Paramedics performing a log roll with three assistants created less motion compared to a log roll with only one assistant, and using the Trap Squeeze stabilization technique resulted in less motion than the <b>Head</b> <b>Squeeze</b> technique. However, the clinical relevance of the magnitude remains unclear. However, large individual differences suggest future paramedic training should incorporate both best evidence practice as well as recognition that there may be individual differences between paramedics...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{other species}} of bees, B. affinis queens harvest nectar by [...] "nectar spur perforation" [...] or [...] "nectar robbing". [...] This unique {{harvesting}} behavior is accomplished {{through a number of}} maneuvers. A B. affinis queen must first hang inverted from the edges of the inner petals (occasionally using a neighboring flower to steady herself). [...] After <b>squeezing</b> her <b>head</b> in the space between the inner and outer petals, and using her front legs to push the inner petal forward, she perforates the inner petal to gain easy access to the spur. [...] Because B. affinis has a relatively short tongue, this enables them to have easy access to the spurs, where nectar is abundant ({{other species of}} bees, such as B. fervidus, have much longer tongues, which allows them to gather nectar via the flower's primary opening). [...] After gathering the nectar, the queen then rotates her head, sweeps pollen from her legs, and leaves. [...] This behavior does not affect plant fertility, nor does it prevent cross pollination from taking place (as evidenced by the presence of fruit on plants with perforated spurs).|$|R
40|$|At {{the time}} of its {{suppression}} in 1539, Syon Abbey {{was one of the most}} generously endowed monasteries in England, with an income of nearly £ 2, 000 per annum. In spite of this great wealth, however, the abbess felt compelled to take the extraordinary step of selling one of her most valuable manors to Sir Richard Riche in 1538. So unusual was the transaction that Riche deemed it necessary to secure a private act of parliament in 1539 to confirm the validity of his purchase. What was the reason for this unprecedented sale of a manor that was part of Syon’s original endowment, and why was the crown prepared to endorse it? Was this just another example of well-placed government officials benefiting from the coming dissolution by <b>squeezing</b> monastic <b>heads</b> for spoils, or was it a financial necessity for Syon? This paper will argue that a closer examination of Syon’s household accounts from the 1520 s and 1530 s reveals that the abbey was facing a financial crisis of disturbing proportions on the eve of its suppression.

5000|$|To treat {{premature}} ejaculation, Masters and Johnson {{developed the}} [...] "squeeze technique". Men {{were instructed to}} pay close attention to their arousal pattern and learn to recognize how they felt shortly before their [...] "point of no return", the moment ejaculation felt imminent and inevitable. Sensing it, they were to signal their partner, who <b>squeezed</b> the <b>head</b> of the penis between thumb and index finger, suppressing the ejaculatory reflex and allowing the man to last longer. [...] The squeeze technique worked, but many couples found it cumbersome. From the 1970s to the 1990s, sex therapists refined the Masters and Johnson approach, largely abandoning the squeeze technique and focused on a simpler and more effective technique called the [...] "stop-start" [...] technique. During intercourse, as the man senses he is approaching climax, both partners stop moving and remain still until the man's feelings of ejaculatory inevitability subside, at which point, they are free to resume active intercourse. To help the man increase awareness of his sexual experience, he is encouraged to create an excitement scale of 1-100. Successful completion of this scale will include paying attention to his heart rate, when (and if) he squeezes his inner thighs, and sensations in all parts of his body. By creating this scale, he will be more able to pace himself as he uses the [...] "stop-start" [...] technique. [...] In addition to the stop-start technique, other sexual adjustments help men develop and maintain ejaculatory control, among them: focus exercises, mind/body coordination exercises, masturbation exercises, deep breathing, and whole-body massage.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to characterise and {{quantify}} the emissions of volatile organic compounds that can be released into the air from stink blasters (a toy in human shape that releases malodorous substances after <b>squeezing</b> the <b>head)</b> and to evaluate possible health risks, particularly for children. Although the stink blasters are intended for outdoor use, a hypothetical indoor use (e. g. a child¿s room) has been considered relevant for exposure assessment studies. The emissions of the items were investigated in environmental chambers and their content was assessed by chemical extraction. In addition to these preliminary experiments and in order to evaluate airborne exposure to cyclohexanone, the stink blasters were placed in the Indoortron facility, a 30 m 3 volume walk-in type environmental chamber, and tested for emissions after squeezing several times under ¿real world setting¿ conditions (23 C, 50 % relative humidity, 0. 5 air changes per hour). The amount of chemicals released was determined by applying two different techniques and time series analysis of the air inside the chamber sampled on Tenax TA tubes and DNPH cartridges, followed by thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry and HPLC¿UV, respectively. The main resulting compounds emitted were cyclohexanone and toluene, with concentrations reaching values of 25 and 32 mgm 3, respectively. These levels are much lower than established permissible exposure limits. Measured toluene levels are also below the chronic inhalation reference limit value (300 mgm 3) set for this compound by the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA).
