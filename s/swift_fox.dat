5|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} (Mustela nigripes) became extirpated in Canada in 1937. Between the 1950s and 1981, it was {{suspected}} {{to be entirely}} extinct until a wild population was discovered in 1981 in Wyoming.

25|$|The {{burrowing}} owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) is an endangered species. They inhabit holes created by other {{animals such as}} Richardson's ground squirrel (gopher), prairie dog, fox, coyote, and badger. Their decline is due to habitat loss due to agricultural, residential and highway lands, and pesticide spraying. Another endangered species, the <b>swift</b> <b>fox</b> (Vulpes velox), has been bred in captivity and re-introduced into protected habitat areas. Lake sturgeon is a Species at Risk in the prairie provinces.|$|E
25|$|Ecologists {{consider}} this rodent to be a keystone species. They {{are an important}} prey species, being the primary diet in prairie species such as the black-footed ferret, <b>swift</b> <b>fox,</b> golden eagle, American badger, and ferruginous hawk. Other species, such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl, also rely on prairie dog burrows for nesting areas. Even grazing species, such as plains bison, pronghorn, and mule deer have shown a proclivity for grazing on the same land used by prairie dogs.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} 1800s, large herds of bison grazed the area {{until they were}} extirpated by human hunting, and cattle have — to a degree — taken their place as grazers, {{maintaining}} the grassland ecosystem in a mix of grazed and ungrazed patches. Pronghorn (Antilocapra Americana) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are also present on the grasslands along with deer mice, voles, and Richardson's ground squirrel, an important food source for the ferruginous hawk and occasional burrow host to the burrowing owl. The formerly extirpated and subsequently reintroduced <b>swift</b> <b>fox</b> (Vulpes velox), currently listed as endangered provincially and downgraded to threatened nationally in 2009, is resident as well. Swift foxes were originally abundant across the prairies, but population declines caused by land use conversion, trapping, hunting, predation by domestic dogs, competition with coyotes, and rodent control programs led to their elimination from Alberta in 1938 and declared extirpated in 1978. The <b>swift</b> <b>fox</b> was reintroduced to Canada in 1983 from the progeny of a captive breeding program using Colorado and South Dakota stock, a controversial but relatively successful initiative. The current population is estimated at 647 foxes in Canada as of 2006, but predation by coyotes and golden eagles {{continues to be a}} limiting factor, with golden eagles causing 75% of the deaths of swift foxes in 1997. In addition, due to their small size and inability to see above tall vegetation, and their avoidance of agricultural lands and the associated chemical spraying which reduces their insect prey, swift foxes appear to be habitat specialists preferring shortgrass native prairie and land use conversion to agriculture is a continued threat. The area's woodland habitat is home to a herd of elk, along with porcupines, cottontail rabbits, and white-tailed deer.|$|E
25|$|Reintroduction of extirpated native species, {{such as the}} <b>swift</b> <b>fox,</b> {{is another}} issue that must be {{balanced}} with the needs and tolerances of existing species. Other extirpated species that formerly occupied the grasslands were the bison (Bison bison), wolf (Canis lupus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), {{which may not be}} feasible to reintroduce due to cost and potential conflict with humans. Educational and scientific pursuits require guidelines and permits to protect the landscape from inadvertent damage such as collection of rare species or archaeological samples. Extraction of natural resources such as minerals, gas, oil, and coal are incompatible with the management intent of the protected area, as are linear developments such as roads, pipelines and power lines. As such, only freehold areas may be explored for resource extraction, and no new linear developments are planned; however, construction of a viewing area is being considered to limit and concentrate public access to an approved and controlled area. Fencing and signage, used for public safety and resource protection, are also kept to a minimum.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need to develop field immobilization techniques that allow researchers to handle safely <b>swift</b> <b>foxes</b> (Vulpes velox) with minimal risk of stress or injury. We immobilized captive <b>swift</b> <b>foxes</b> to determine the safety and effectiveness of ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine hydrochloride at different dosages. We attempted to determine appropriate dosages to immobilize <b>swift</b> <b>foxes</b> for an adequate field-handling period based on three anesthesia intervals (induction period, immobilization period, and recovery period) and physiologic responses (rectal temperature, respiration rate, and heart rate). Between October 1998 –July 1999, we conducted four trials, evaluating three different dosage ratios of ketamine and xylazine (2. 27 : 1. 2, 5. 68 : 1. 2, and 11. 4 : 1. 2 mg/kg ketamine:mg/kg xylazine, respectively), followed by a fourth trial with a higher dosage at the median ratio (11. 4 mg/kg ketamine: 2. 4 mg/kg xylazine). We found little difference in induction and recovery periods among trials 1 – 3, but immobilization time increased with increasing dosage (P 3 ̆c 0. 08). Both the immobilization period and recovery period increased in trial 4 compared with trials 1 – 3 (P≤ 0. 03). There was a high variation in responses of individual foxes across trials, {{making it difficult to}} identify an appropriate dosage for field handling. Heart rate and respiration rates were depressed but all physiologic measures remained within normal parameters established for domestic canids. We recommend a dosage ratio of 10 mg/kg ketamine to 1 mg/kg xylazine to immobilize <b>swift</b> <b>foxes</b> for field handling...|$|R

40|$|From 1997 to 2001, we {{monitored}} {{movements of}} 109 adult and 114 juvenile <b>swift</b> <b>foxes,</b> Vulpes velox (Say, 1823), at study sites in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas to determine patterns of dispersal. Significantly more male (93 %) than female (58 %) juveniles dispersed, and both sexes had similar bimodal dispersal patterns with peaks in September–October and January–February. Adult dispersal occurred more evenly throughout the year, and significantly more male (32 %) than female (5 %) adults dispersed. Adult males tended to disperse {{after the death}} of their mate. Of dispersing foxes with known fates, settlement percentages in new territories were similar between juvenile males and females (40 % overall), but they were significantly lower than for adults (89 %). All other dispersing foxes with known fates died. Among juvenile females with known fates, similar percentages of philopatric and dispersing foxes reproduced as yearlings (50 % overall), so the benefits of dispersal versus philopatry were not clear. Although rarely reported for other species, adult males were an important dispersal cohort in <b>swift</b> <b>foxes</b> (43 % of male dispersals and 25 % of all dispersals). Because of the female-biased philopatry among <b>swift</b> <b>foxes,</b> dispersal of adult males likely decreased the chances for inbreeding (e. g., father–daughter breeding) ...|$|R
25|$|Mammalian {{carnivores}} {{can compete}} {{for some of}} the same prey as golden eagles but can also themselves become prey, the main prey family of carnivores being the canids (dog family). 12 species of canid are known to have been hunted by golden eagles and they collectively make up about 2.8% of the diet from all surveyed golden eagle nests. For the most part, foxes are the preferred prey, usually as juveniles though foxes of any age or condition, including adult male red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) heavier than the eagles themselves, may be hunted. Across much of both species' ranges, red fox co-exist with golden eagles and eagles hunt them in small numbers. Red foxes make up 13.5% of nest remains in Sicily and 5.9% in the Republic of Macedonia. In a nest in Mongolia, Corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) were surprisingly the main prey species, making up 38% of sampled remains. Kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), <b>swift</b> <b>fox</b> (Vulpes velox), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and island fox (Urocyon littoralis) are readily predated in North America. The other family of carnivores that turns up with some regularity in the golden eagle's diet are the mustelids, at about 2.3% of the diet. Everything in this diverse family from least weasels (Mustela nivalis), the smallest mammalian carnivore, to wolverines (Gulo gulo), the largest terrestrial mustelid, have turned up as prey in golden eagle nests. The members of this family which are most regularly hunted are probably the martens, such as the American marten (Martes americanus), pine marten (Martes martes) and beech marten. The young of larger species are also occasionally hunted in Scotland and Ireland, including Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badgers (Meles meles). Similarly, amongst wolverines, “young and inexperienced” specimens are usually targeted as prey by golden eagles. In North America, full-grown large mustelids, including American badgers (Taxidea taxus) and fishers (Martes pennanti), have also turned up as prey. The largest percentage of mustelids was 13.2% in a nest in central Alaska. Mustelids, mainly martens, turned up in large numbers in the French Alps where they made up 10.1% of nest remains.|$|E

50|$|The <b>swift</b> <b>fox</b> {{is closely}} related genetically to the kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), but {{occupies}} a different geographical range. The two have historically been regarded as different species for reasons basically related to size: the kit fox is slightly smaller than the <b>swift</b> <b>fox,</b> and the former has a narrower snout. However, hybrids between the two occur naturally where their ranges overlap, and some mammalogists classify the two as subspecies of a single species, usually treated as Vulpes velox (with the <b>swift</b> <b>fox</b> being described as V. velox velox and the kit fox as V. velox macrotis).

500|$|Red foxes {{typically}} dominate other fox species. Arctic foxes generally escape {{competition from}} red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce {{to support the}} larger-bodied red species. Although the red species' northern limit {{is linked to the}} availability of food, the Arctic species' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the Aleutian Islands to the Alexander Archipelago during the 1830s–1930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866. Where they are sympatric, Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on lemmings and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes. Both species will kill each other's kits, given the opportunity. Red foxes are serious competitors of corsac foxes, as they hunt the same prey all year. The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than [...] and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents. Corsac foxes seem to only outcompete red foxes in semi-desert and steppe areas. In Israel, Blanford's foxes escape competition with red foxes by restricting themselves to rocky cliffs and actively avoiding the open plains inhabited by red foxes. Red foxes dominate kit and <b>swift</b> <b>foxes.</b> Kit foxes usually avoid competition with their larger cousins by living in more arid environments, though red foxes have been increasing in ranges formerly occupied by kit foxes due to human-induced environmental changes. Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites. Grey foxes are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes. However, interactions have become more frequent due to deforestation allowing red foxes to colonise grey fox-inhabited areas.|$|R
