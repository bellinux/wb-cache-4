30|$|The OLS method {{produces}} a regression equation for the existing data, which minimises {{the sum of}} the squared errors (i.e., the error between each data point in the model and the equation). By default, the number of estimated future workload measurements is equal to the number of data points in the model. For example, a workload model covering the previous six months with one measurement per month will be used to produce estimates for the next six months. The state of the InHouseDB migration component (from Fig.  3) is {{the same as it was}} at the last measurement in the workload model. The NetDatacenterBroker component generates load for the InHouseDB, which matches workload values estimated with the regression equation. As the simulation runs, the MiddlewareApp component migrates the data from the InHouseDB to the CloudDB using <b>slack</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E

Intermediaries {{are one of the}} main players in the telecom network market and they may acquire network capacity from market of telecommunication backbone providers who offer different pricing and quality of service schemes and sell purchased capacity to end-users in order to earn some profit. Unfortunately, customers’ bandwidth demands are not known in advance. Therefore, intermediaries may end up having either <b>slack</b> <b>capacity</b> or unsatisfied customer demands. In this paper, to overcome aforementioned problems two-stage stochastic integer programming approach is proposed. Performance of suggested method is tested on several randomly generated scenarios. Moreover, effects of different bandwidth demand distributions are analyzed by using well known measures such as Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and Value of Stochastic Solution (VSS). Finally, robustness of methodology is evaluated via sensitivity analysis on different problem parameters...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{interest}} in designing systems with <b>capacity</b> <b>slack</b> as {{one form of}} flexibility raises many questions about its use and its usefulness. In {{the framework of the}} economic lot scheduling problem with stochastic demand, we develop on optimization-based model that considers <b>capacity</b> <b>slack,</b> safety stock, and overtime explicitly, and has the objective of minimizing the expected cost per unit time of inventory, overtime, and, where applicable, setup costs. The solution is a continuous-time production plan that consists of a time-dependent inventory trajectory for each of the parts, including the placement of planned idle time in the schedule. We consider schedule stability to be desirable because of potential effects on upstream and downstream operations in multistage production settings. Thus, the plan also has certain characteristics that contribute to achieving stability. Our results on the relative merits of <b>capacity</b> <b>slack</b> and safety stock indicate that <b>capacity</b> <b>slack</b> in the form of planned idle time is not a cost-effective hedge against demand uncertainty in this context. Thus, it is essential that management carefully identify and evaluate other reasons for including idle time in a plan, and use the idle time effectively. For managers who face situations not fully represented by our model, this paper provides analytic results that will guide them in the placement of planned idle time and the choice of safety stock levels. inventory: multi-item, inventory: stochastic, production/scheduling: stochastic...|$|R

Given a-stage temporal partition, the min-area min-cut replication problem is defined and we present an optimal algorithm to solve it. We also present a flow-based replication heuristic which is applicable when there is a tight area bound that limits the amount of possible replication. In addition, we show a correct network flow model for partitioning sequential circuits temporally and propose a new hierarchical flow-based performance-driven partitioner for computing initial partitions without replication...|$|R
40|$|Working time {{accounts}} (WTAs) are employer-oriented flexibility {{systems that}} have been applied in industry but could be used far more. Their use {{is limited by the}} complexity of planning them, assessing their financial benefits and establishing suitable compensation for workers. To overcome these drawbacks we define a planning model that takes into account work performance per task per worker, individual annual leave, the use of WTAs and the use of overtime. A four-stage process is proposed: Stage 1 deals with annual leave and the linear consideration {{of the cost of the}} lack of capacity; Stage 2 with annual leave and the non-linear consideration of the lack of capacity (but only for the periods during which holidays can be established); Stage 3 with minimising costs (once the holidays selected in Stage 2 are fixed, i. e. the holidays are considered as data) and Stage 4 with minimising <b>capacity</b> <b>slack</b> and excess <b>capacity</b> by minimising costs.

In many such cases, it is important to provide a steady, pre-arranged level of service rather than service that may fluctuate wildly from one moment to the next. This work uses a hybrid approach to providing both a hard guarantee for the basic level of service, and a probabilistic assurance of a particular service level for enhanced QoS. The main idea is to size a system to handle the worst case number of sessions of applications at the lowest acceptable service level, {{but at the same time}} support higher QoS using any available <b>slack</b> <b>capacity.</b> An admission process provides a probabilistic assurance that any session allocated more than the minimum required resources would run to completion without having to be degraded.

Some of these applications have real-time requirements, while other non-real-time applications only require good average performance. For cost-efficient design, contemporary platforms feature an increasing number of cores that share resources, such as memories and interconnects. However, resource sharing causes contention that must be resolved by a resource arbiter, such as Time-Division Multiplexing. A key challenge is to configure this arbiter to satisfy the bandwidth and latency requirements of the real-time applications, while maximizing the <b>slack</b> <b>capacity</b> to improve performance of their non-real-time counterparts. As this configuration problem is NP-hard, a sophisticated automated configuration method is required to avoid negatively impacting design time.

The goal {{of the study is}} to address targeted cycle time objectives in a start up Recording Head Wafer manufacturing facility at Seagate Technology, Minneapolis, MN. The short product cycle time, coupled with the competitive nature of the disc drive industry, has made cycle time reduction {{one of the most important}} objectives of production capacity planning. This paper describes an equipment procurement strategy in which static capacity analysis is used to identify an initial equipment set with a low <b>slack</b> <b>capacity</b> variable on each tool group. Simulation analysis is then used to identify the critical tool groups that contribute to cycle time delays. The Seagate Industrial Engineering team used the simulation analysis tool Factory Explorer ® from Wright, Williams & Kelly to perform the cycle time reduction analysis. This targeted approach is compared to the traditional static capacity planning approach of globally applying reserve capacity buffers of 20 % or more to achieve the same cycle time reduction goal. Overall, the targeted approach has proven to be efficient in terms of minimizing capital equipment expenditures and also effective on the factory floor. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{the freight}} {{logistics}} business, supply chains are under strong pressure to provide customized goods and services. Individualized product deliveries, modifications in product specification, late orders and volume changes {{need to be}} accommodated within strict delivery time frames. This uncertainty in demand can only be accommodated by allowing for <b>slack</b> <b>capacity</b> and time in trip planning. As this overbooking creates substantial costs, however, firms will attempt to minimize these costs by further optimizing and re-organizing their distribution channels. In this paper {{we look at the}} feasibility of one such solution, a hybrid system of contracting freight carrying services. Here, part of the services are provided by various carriers using contracts for a fixed base volume of freight, which results in planned delivery tours. Additional to these volumes, peaks resulting from additional shipments are accommodated by {{one or more of these}} carriers within an auction setting based on price and quality of service. The additional freight is won by the carrier that has the most flexible trip planning in terms of capacity, service quality and costs. We test the effectiveness and efficiency of this contracting system by means of a simultaneous, real time simulation of the execution of planned tours, the auctioning process and the re-scheduling of tours. The model provides us with new insights on the dynamics of bidding behaviour on the side of carriers and shippers. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a system with}} two heterogeneous traffic classes, one having light-tailed characteristics, the other one exhibiting heavy-tailed properties. When both classes are backlogged, the two corresponding queues are each served at a certain nominal rate. However, when one queue empties, the service rate for the other class increases. This dynamic sharing of surplus service capacity {{is reminiscent of the}} Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) discipline. GPS-based scheduling algorithms, such as Weighted Fair Queueing, provide a candidate implementation mechanism for achieving differentiated Quality-of-Service in a DiffServ architecture. We characterize the asymptotic workload behavior of both traffic classes. The tail of the workload distribution of the heavy-tailed class is asymptotically equivalent to that of the heavy-tailed class in isolation [...] but with its nominal service rate inflated by the <b>slack</b> <b>capacity</b> of the light-tailed class. For the light-tailed class, we show a sharp dichotomy in the qualitative behavior, depending on whether its load exceeds its nominal service rate or not. In underload scenarios, the tail of its workload distribution is equivalent to that of the light-tailed class in isolation, multiplied with a certain pre-factor. The pre-factor represents the probability that the heavy-tailed class is backlogged long enough for the light-tailed class to build up a large workload. This provides a measure for {{the extent to which the}} light-tailed class benefits from sharing surplus capacity with the heavy-tailed class. In contrast, in overload situations, the light-tailed class is adversely affected by the heavy-tailed class, and inherits its traffic characteristics...|$|E
40|$|While the {{cyclical}} downturn {{has come}} to a halt since mid- 2009, the recovery is set to remain subdued. Goods exports and manufacturing output benefit from the rebound of world trade and the upswing in Asia {{as well as from the}} strengthening activity in trading partner countries in western Europe. However, these impulses have so far failed to trigger a new investment cycle, given the uncertain outlook and the substantial <b>slack</b> in productive <b>capacities.</b> Private consumption is on a steady but slow upward trend. In such an environment, the Austrian economy will grow by 1. 3 percent in volume in 2010 and by 1. 4 percent in 2011.

The latest budgetary decisions of the federal government suggest that the general government deficit will be taken down from its peak to around 4 percent of GDP.

40|$|Three {{years ago}} the {{physical}} capacity, supply of labor, and financial resources of the U. S. economy were insufficient to satisfy demands. Symptoms of these capital shortages included sharply rising prices, peaks in factory operating rates, increased unfilled orders, long delivery delays, higher wages, low unemployment rates, rapidly accelerating interest rates, widening yield differentials between risky and “safe ” financial assets, surging loan demands, decumulation of financial assets, and credit rationing. 1 Indeed, the unprecedented inflation of prices, wages and interest rates was the principal cause of the deep recession that followed. A by-product of the 1973 — 75 slump has been a shift from capital “shortages ” to surplus with great <b>slack</b> in productive <b>capacity,</b> labor, and financial markets. 2 However, the recession also induced a low rate 1 As used here, the term “capital ” refers to physical capital, human capital and financial capital. 2 Utilization rates, whether measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis or as newly revised by the Federal Reserve Board, are far below peak 1973 - 74 levels and in a majority of cases are less than the average over 1960 to 1975. Excess supply {{in the labor market}} is indicated by a national unemployment rate of 7. 5 %, compared to the less than 5 % of three years ago.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{virtualization}} and cloud computing technologies necessitates {{the development of}} effective mechanisms for the estimation and reservation of resources needed by content providers to deliver large numbers of video-on-demand (VOD) streams through the cloud. Unfortunately, capacity planning for the QoS-constrained delivery {{of a large number}} of VOD streams is inherently difficult as VBR encoding schemes exhibit significant bandwidth variability. In this paper, we present a novel resource management scheme to make such allocation decisions using a mixture of per-stream reservations and an aggregate reservation, shared across all streams to accommodate peak demands. The shared reservation provides <b>capacity</b> <b>slack</b> that enables statistical multiplexing of peak rates, while assuring analytically bounded frame-drop probabilities, which can be adjusted by trading off buffer space (and consequently delay) and bandwidth. Our two-tiered bandwidth allocation scheme enables the delivery of any set of streams with less bandwidth (or equivalently with higher link utilization) than state-of-the-art deterministic smoothing approaches. The algorithm underlying our proposed frame-work uses three per-stream parameters and is linear in the number of servers, making it particularly well suited for use in an on-line setting. We present results from extensive trace-driven simulations, which confirm the efficiency of our scheme especially for small buffer sizes and delay bounds, and which underscore the significant realizable bandwidth savings, typically yielding losses that are an order of magnitude or more below our analytically derived bounds.

40|$|For {{a commercially}} {{operating}} railway company, providing {{a high level}} of service for the passengers is of utmost importance. The latter requires a high punctuality of the trains and an adequate rolling stock capacity. Unfortunately, the latter is currently (2002) one of the bottlenecks in the service provision by the main Dutch railway operator NS Reizigers. Especially during the morning rush hours, many passengers cannot be transported according to the usual service standards due to a shortage of the rolling stock capacity. On the other hand, a more effective allocation of the available rolling stock capacity seems to be feasible, since there are also a few trains with some <b>slack</b> <b>capacity.</b> The effectiveness of the rolling stock capacity is determined mainly by the allocation of the train types and subtypes to the lines. Therefore, we describe in this paper a model {{that can be used to}} find an optimal allocation of train types and subtypes to train series. This optimal allocation is more effective than the manually planned one, which is accomplished by minimizing the shortages of capacity during the rush hours. The model is implemented in the modeling language OPL Studio 3. 1, solved by CPLEX 7. 0, and tested on several scenarios based on the 2001 - 2002 timetable of NS Reizigers. The results of the model were received positively, both by the planners and by the management in practice, since these results showed that a significant service improvement over the manually planned allocation can be achieved within a shorter throughput time of the involved part of the planning process. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{questions concerning}} slack's nature and its {{relationships with the}} environment and performance. The research investigates which view of slack (the operations or behavioral approach) best predicts performance. It examines the relationship of environment and slack using both interaction and mediation models. The PIMS database was used for 610 assembly manufacturing firms. The results support both the behavioral and the operations perspectives. This combined view suggests that <b>slack</b> <b>capacity</b> is optimized to improve sales while being minimized to improve profits. Excess inventory is minimized to improve sales but optimized to improve average ROS. In all cases, excess cash is minimized. In all equations, the slack variables entered the equations as costs. These results also support the argument that slack interacts with the environment rather than being in a functional relationship with it. Interaction terms of the slack types and the environment were significant in predicting sales. A mediation model was also tested but had a poorer fit with the data. Slack {{was found to be}} a multi-dimensional concept. The slack variables did not all intercorrelate positively. The negative relationships suggest that management makes decisions as when to use each slack resource. The slack variables (when lagged) had significant effects on each other, but not on performance. This indicates that the time horizon for slack may be shorter than was investigated in this research. The research demonstrated that slack inventory and non-slack supply buffers were negatively related. The conditions under which the firm trades slack for other buffering mechanisms were not clear. Predicted positive relationships between size and slack were found except that excess capacity and size were negatively related. This suggests that larger firms were holding slack in ways that are more discretionary and less obvious to their control systems. What is not clear from this research are the conditions under which management will choose a specific type of slack. In one case (excess working capital), technology predicts the level of this variable. Additional research is suggested to determine how, when and where these decisions are made...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to suggest ways to {{effectively}} utilise Activity-Based Costing and Activity-Based Managment within Eskom Transmission Southern Grid to improve decision making towards improved business and financial performance. The ultimate purpose was to assist managers and staff to implement ABC and ABM effectively for improved business and financial performance. The focus was on the following objective: To suggest ways to effectively utilise ABC & ABM within Eskom Transmission Southern Grid as to improve decision making and business financial performance. Given the selection of management tools available, instruments such as ABC and ABM are usually not implemented alone, but may be supported by one or more approaches. For this reason ABC and ABM are contrasted with several other popular instruments mentioned in the literature. The instruments are: • The value chain; • Continuous improvement; • The theory of constraints; and • Total quality management. Insight will be given to provide managers with more accurate information regarding maintenance for the Grid and tools in identifying critical bottlenecks. By applying the TOC, TQM and continuous improvement strategies, managers will be able to make improved decisions, leading to improved financial performance in the Eskom Transmission Southern Grid. iii The literature study revealed that ABC and ABM prove to be the cornerstone for informed decision making. Since organisations are highly dependent on quality information to make these informed decisions, ABC and ABM reorientate the organisation towards understanding and managing work processes thus impacting financial performance positively. ABC and ABM trace the cost of activities such as engineering and procurement to how maintenance benefits from these activities. The empirical study consisted of a structured questionnaire distributed to a sample population of engineers and managers in Eskom Transmission Southern Grid in Port Elizabeth. It was aimed at gathering information about the use of ABC and ABM within the Grid. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with financial staff in the Grid and a focus group interview with engineering staff was done. The main findings of the empirical investigation revealed that management and staff lack insight into the use of ABC and ABM and how it can be integrated with existing improvement systems within the organisation. This study is concluded with a number of recommendations. These recommendations address the shortcomings and improvements that can be made to improve the utilisation of ABC and ABM within the organisation. The recommendations address the following: • Ensuring full commitment towards organisational goals and broadening the endorsement of ABC within the organisation; • Highlighting the importance of financial performance throughout the Grid; • Training of Managers, finance staff and engineers is required for proper execution of the ABC system; • Implementers need skills and know-how of the ABC and ABM system ensuring full utilisation; • The main cost drivers are identified, prioritised and efforts channelled into these activities; • Tools such as the Theory Of Constraints and Total Quality Management from the proposed model would assist the Grid in identifying the bottlenecks of a system correctly, thus know explicitly the amount of <b>slack</b> <b>capacity</b> of each activity available during a specific time perio...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Çalışmada, 10 adet 900 kW rüzgar türbinlerine sahip 9 MW kurulu gücü olan rüzgar santralinin üreteceği enerjinin tahmini yapılmıştır. Üretileceği tahmin edilen enerjiden şebekeye dahil olamayan  enerji miktarı elde edilmiştir. Bu miktar ise kullanılması gereken ve yenilenebilir enerji ile uyumlu çalışan, markette ulaşılabilen  enerji depolama sistemlerini belirlemek amacıyla kullanılmıştır. Depolama sistemleri rüzgar santrali ile uyumlu çalışacak çeşitlerinin belirlenmesi, boyutunun ve maliyetinin yıllık bazda ne olacağının hesaplanması ile bulunmuştur. Bu amaç doğrultusunda rüzgar enerjisi tahmini yapmak için adaptif ağ tabanlı bulanık çıkarım sistemi kullanılmıştır. MATLAB programı içerisinde bulunan ve anfisedit komutu ile kullanılan bu modelin girdileri ve çıktıları belirlenmiştir. Rüzgar santralinden üretilecek enerjinin hesaplanabilmesi için rüzgar hızı, hava yoğunluğu, türbin kanatlarının süpürdüğü alan ve bölgeye göre değişen kapasite faktörü göz önünde bulundurulmuştur. Rüzgar hızı Urla’da 2008 ile 2011 yılları arasında on dakikada bir alınan kayıtlar aracılığı ile sağlanmıştır. Rüzgar hızı modellemenin ilk girdisidir. Diğer bir girdi olan hava yoğunluğu ise yine aynı tarihler arasında Çeşme, Seferihisar ve İzmir bölgeerine ait  Meteoroloji Genel Müdürlüğü’nden alınan hava sıcaklığı ve nem değerleri ile bulunmuştur. Modelin çıktısı ise elimizde bulunan veriler ile teorik olarak hesaplanan rüzgar gücüdür. Bu değerler modellemede test ve eğitim için kullanılmıştır. Hat kapasiteleri, gerilim limitleri gibi şebeke fiziksel kısıtlamaları sebebi ile üretilen rüzgar enerjisinin tamamı sisteme verilememektedir. Bu nedenle sisteme katılabilecek enerji miktarı Power System Analysis Toolbox ile hesaplanmıştır.  Şebekenin teknik limitleri Power System Analysis Toolbox’ta gömülü bulunan IEEE 14 baralı sisteme entegre edilmiştir. Türkiye Elektrik Dağıtım Anonim Şirketi’nin belirlediği elektrik tarifeleri ve Türkiye Elektrik İletim Anonim Şirketi’nden elde edilen birim enerji üretim maliyetleri de sistemde göz önünde bulundurulmuştur.  Rüzgar enerjisi kullanıldığında üretilen birim enerji maliyeti düşmektedir. Karşılaştırma yaparken birim enerji maliyeti de modele dahil edilmiştir. Şebekeye dahil edilemeyen enerji başlı başına bir maliyettir ve bu yöntemle bu maliyet belirlenmiştir. Dahil edilemeyen enerjinin depolanması bu maliyet, düşürmekle beraber depolama sisteminin maliyeti de düşünülmedir. Bu nedenle çalışmada yenilenebilir enerji kaynaklarında kullanılan depolama sistemleri belirlenmiştir. Paranın bugünkü değeri, gelecek değeri ve yıl bazında hesaplanmış değerleri finansal analizle hesaplanarak enerji depolama sistemlerinin yıllık kurulum ve kullanım maliyetleri hesaplanmıştır. Hesaplamalarda ilk yatırım, işletme, bakım maliyeti ve yenileme maliyetleri de eklenmiştir. Enerji depolama sistemlerinin kurulumdan kaynaklanan hat kayıplarında azalma ve sisteme verilemeyen rüzgar enerjisinin depolanmasıyla birlikte ortaya çıkan yıllık kazanç, enerji depolama sisteminin kurulumunun yıllık maliyeti ile karşılaştırılmıştır. Çalışma sonucunda 9 MW sistem de maliyeti yüksek olduğu için depolama sisteminin  uygun olmadığı görülmüştür.  Ancak rüzgar türbinin gücü arttıkça depolama maliyeti azaldığı için  sistem uygun olduğu tespit edilmiştir. In this study, {{expected}} {{wind energy}} of 9 MW installed power is determined.  The proper {{energy storage system}} (ESS) is find out by considering  power rate, capacity and cost. As a result, annual cost of energy storage systems and spilled wind energy are compared. Wind energy is a renewable energy source but intermittence is a drawback. Energy storage systems are a solution to provide stability both on grid and off grid. ESS {{is an important issue}} and nowadays studies on ESS are increasing. By modeling renewable energy sources, capacity of storage systems is calculated in some studies. In another studies, in aspect of power electronics, storage systems are compared for different kinds of distributed energy systems. Comparing storage systems according to their advantages and disadvantages is another subject for the studies. Another important issue is reliability of storage systems. So reliability of a grid by adding ESS and wind energy are mentioned. Not only for wind energy but also for other renewable energy sources, types of ESS and capacity calculations are common. But in these studies, missing subject is cost of ESS, benefit analysis for customers and system owners. The study also improves conditions for customers and prompt potential investors to invest on renewable energy projects. So in this study, some tools are used to estimate wind energy production, calculate spilled energy and also financial analysis is performed for both customers and producers. For the study, different methods are used in each steps. First step is to predict amount of wind energy. In literature, there are many methods that are used such as Weibull distribution, neural networks, classic linear models. In the study, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System is used for estimation wind energy because it has advantages of both artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic. The program includes nodes which have different functions. In this program, there are inputs and outputs, these are used to train and determine rules. Two inputs, one output and two rules Sugeno model is commonly used in literature. According to the data, the proper wind turbine was selected and power related with wind speed was specified in the wind turbine datasheet. In the study, program is prepared by considering air density, wind speed, swept area and capacity factor as inputs and wind power calculated by wind power equation is used as outputs in program and all data are normalized. Wind speed is provided from a study in Urla, İzmir between 2008 – 2011. Other inputs are provided from Turkish State Meteorological Service for same time interval but for Çeşme, İzmir and Seferhisar since meterological station is broken in Urla. ANFIS is used for wind energy prediction. In the program, 66 % of wind speed data (5187) were used for training and 34 % of data (3573) were used for testing. Subtractive clustering was selected in the tool. This selection is effective when clustering of data is not accurately known. In the process, the epoch number was three and the margin of error 3. 74 %. In the model, there are three rules. As a result of the program, prediction of wind energy by ANFIS for each hour in typical season day and theoretical results of wind power are compared. The coefficient of determination R 2 shows that the difference between measurement of fit prediction and statistical analysis was 98. 84 %, which is acceptable. After prediction of wind energy production, the electrical network and loads were specified. Next step is determine amount of accomated wind energy to the network. Because of physical limits such as line capacities, voltage limits, all amount of expected energy cannot penetrate grid. Spilled wind energy is determined by Power System Analysis Toolbox. PSAT is a power analysis and control program and used for power flow analysis and control. It can perform continuous power flow, optimal power flow, small signal stability analysis, and time domain simulation. There are embedded test networks of IEEE in PSAT. In network analysis, optimal power flow is performed on IEEE 14 bus system. In this analysis, control equations can be generator active powers except for slack bus, voltage magnitude of generator bus, reactive powers of reactive generators, tap changers and angle of phase transformations. Constraints are active and reactive power flow in branches, voltage limits of branches except for <b>slack,</b> and feeder <b>capacity</b> limit. Objective function is determine maximum wind energy by considering technical limits and maximize cost of using wind energy in network. Wind power plant is connected to bus 12. Since unit price of electricity generation by wind energy is known, cost of the spilled wind energy is calculated. Electricity tariffs in distribution system is provided from Turkish Electricity Distribution Company  and electricity prices for day, night and peak hours and the cost of energy production methods were considered. In the study, data which is hour by hour wind energy prediction for typical days of each season is entered into the program and also for same hours, electricity prices with regard to wind energy penetration are added. Unit cost of energy generation for different sources is provided from Turkish Electricity Transmission Company since common energy sources are coal, natural gas and hydropower, in the study, these sources are considered. Then, energy storage systems are researched. There are many energy storage systems such as supercapacitors, fuel cells, lithium-ion, flywheels but not all them are suitable for renewable energy systems. Energy storage systems which can be used for renewable energy and common in markets are lead acid, valve-regulated lead acid, sodium sulphur and vanadium redox. In specific hour, maximum spilled power specifies power rating of ESS and maximum spilled energy during a day specifies capacity of ESS. To calculate annual cost of ESS, all possible investments such as unit costs of ESS, power electronics, balance of plant and fixed operation and maintenance cost are considered and annual costs of installation of each ESS are calculated by using financial equations related with net present, future and annual values. Also, it is figured out that ESS leads to decrease in line losses so profits of line losses and spilled energy are compared with cost of installed ESS. Since the production cost of wind energy is lower than that of the energy sources already installed, the production cost of energy decreases. This provides benefits to customers because electricity prices decrease. For the producer, it is also beneficial because of lower production costs. There is also another benefit for the producer because spilled energy will be stored and then penetrate the system. Profits of producers and consumers for each year are compared with annual cost of installing different kind of ESS technologies. Results of the study showed that for 9 MW wind energy system, ESS is not feasible but it is obviously seen that ESS will be feasible for penetration of bigger power ratings wind energy. In today’s technology, annual cost of ESS is extremely expensive. Also, as growing technology, the cost of energy storage systems will decrease and investments in storage systems will become more feasible and for smart grids, energy storage systems will be necessary. The study can be improved by exploring more wind energy operations and by finding the optimum point for installing energy storage systems by using more than one wind power plant and ESS.
