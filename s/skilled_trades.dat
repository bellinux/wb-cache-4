5|$|After the war, {{federal highway}} {{subsidies}} and postwar development encouraged outward migration as residents moved to gain newer housing; this suburbanization significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made {{efforts to create}} new attractions, such as the Gateway Arch, which construction became a focus {{of the civil rights}} movement to gain non-segregated jobs in the <b>skilled</b> <b>trades.</b> The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace substandard housing by new public housing projects such as PruittIgoe. A combination of factors resulted in this being notoriously unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and gentrification have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly downtown. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle with crime and perceptions of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the 2010 U.S. Census.|$|E

The importance that these resources have for <b>skilled</b> <b>trade</b> companies {{and the manner in which}} they are manifested in them were ascertained in a survey of 250 companies from the building services sector. Four of the five most important influencing factors stem from the area of human capital. The wage-intensive industries, in particular, to which most <b>skilled</b> <b>trade</b> categories belong, regard employees as a key competitive factor.

Many Brazilians worked in <b>skilled</b> <b>trades</b> such as tile and flooring, although fewer worked as day laborers than did Latinos. Many had moved from Brazilian communities in the Northeastern United States, Florida and Georgia. Brazilians settled throughout the metropolitan area. Most were undocumented. In January 2008 the New Orleans Brazilian population had a mid-range estimate of 3,000. By 2008 Brazilians had opened many small churches, shops and restaurants catering to their community.|$|E
25|$|Surrey is {{also the}} home of Kwantlen Polytechnic University, a polytechnic {{university}} that opened its doors in the Newton Town Centre of Surrey in 1981 {{as a response to}} the growing need for expanded vocational training across the Fraser Valley.

25|$|With its society {{disrupted}} by slave losses during the Revolution, South Carolina did not embrace manumission as readily as {{states of the}} Upper South. Most of its small number of free blacks were of mixed race, often the children of major planters or their sons and slave mothers. Their wealthy fathers sometimes passed on social capital to such mixed-race children, arranging for their manumission even if officially denying them as legal heirs. Fathers sometimes arranged to have their slave children educated, arranged apprenticeships in <b>skilled</b> <b>trades,</b> and other preparation for independent adulthood. Some planters sent their mixed-race slave children to schools and colleges in the North for education.|$|E

25|$|When possible, the AFL forced {{industrial}} {{unions to}} break up into craft unions, dividing their memberships into exclusive groups with individual contracts. One example was the Amalgamated Association of Street Car Employees (AASCE) in 1912 which, {{with the aid of}} Cyrus S. Ching as company negotiator for Boston's public transit system, reached a system-wide agreement for all transit workers. But the AFL and its building trades affiliates were not happy with such an arrangement. Ching, AFL President Samuel Gompers, and International President William D. Mahon of the AASCE, held conferences in which the AASCE ceded jurisdiction over carpenters, painters, electricians, and other <b>skilled</b> <b>trades.</b> The union's membership was divided into 34 distinct labor units, each with a separate agreement.|$|E
25|$|UE also {{stood out}} in that period for its {{advocacy}} of equality for African American workers. In July 1950 UE leaders appointed Ernest Thompson, a black international representative and former rank-and-file factory worker, {{as secretary of the}} UE Fair Practices Committee. In essence the union's affirmative action officer, Thompson met with the leadership of UE locals around the country to develop and implement action plans to force employers to hire more black workers, and to give African Americans opportunities to advance into <b>skilled</b> <b>trades</b> jobs. In the midst of the Cold War assaults on UE, the union's newspaper reported such success stories as the promotion of a black worker at Johnson Machine to lathe operator. The company had insisted that this worker was unqualified and refused to train him, so white union members had taught him the job during their lunch breaks.|$|E
25|$|The city's older {{southern}} neighbourhoods tend to {{be considerably}} less affluent than its more suburban northern sections, which are rapidly expanding as Toronto commuters move in. The southern half of the city consists of industrial zones and compact housing designed for early 20th century industrial workers, while the northern half has a suburban feel more typical of later decades. High wages paid to unionized GM employees have meant that these workers could enjoy a relatively high standard of living, although such jobs are much scarcer today than they once were. During its heyday after World War II, General Motors offered {{some of the best}} manufacturing jobs available in Canada and attracted thousands of workers from economically depressed areas of the country, particularly the Maritimes, Newfoundland, rural Quebec and northern Ontario. The city was also a magnet for European immigrants in the <b>skilled</b> <b>trades,</b> and boasts substantial Polish, Ukrainian, Hungarian, Croatian, German, Slovak and Russian ethnic communities.|$|E
5000|$|In fact, Evans {{suggests}} that interstate slave traders received a wage {{greater than that}} of an alternative profession in <b>skilled</b> mechanical <b>trades.</b> [...] If <b>skilled</b> mechanical <b>trades</b> can be considered a reasonable alternative occupation for slave traders, then it appears that interregional slave traders are made better off, at least in monetary terms.|$|R
50|$|In October 1996, {{a merger}} {{agreement}} {{was made with}} the Metal Polishers, Buffers, Platers and Allied Workers International Union.

25|$|Young {{women were}} eager {{to serve in the}} {{military}} during WWII, and the Marine Corps wanted only the best. The overall qualifications for women who wished to volunteer for the WR were fairly stringent. The age requirement for officer candidates was between 20 and 49, and a candidate had to be a college graduate or have a combination of two years of college and two years of work experience. The age requirement for those who wished to enlist was between 20 and 35, and candidates had to have completed at least two years of high school. The WR did not accept African American or Japanese American women during World WarII but did accept Native American women. The officer candidates first trained at the Navy's Midshipmen School for women officers located at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. The initial training for enlisted women was held at the Naval Training School at Hunter College in the Bronx, New York City. Soon, the Marine Corps saw the advantage of having its own training schools. Effective 1July 1943, all WR training was to be held at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Members served at shore and air stations across the continental United States, including New York, Chicago, Paris Island, South Carolina, and El Centro and San Diego, California. The territory of Hawaii was the only overseas duty station where members were assigned. They served in occupations classified as professional, semi-professional, clerical, <b>skilled</b> <b>trades,</b> services, and sales. Although the Marine Corps listed more than 200 available job categories, over half of the WR members labored in the clerical field.|$|E
500|$|A {{medium-sized}} {{market town}} in the medieval period, Birmingham grew to international prominence in the 18th century {{at the heart of}} the Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution, which saw the town at the forefront of worldwide advances in science, technology, and economic development, producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society. By 1791 it was being hailed as [...] "the first manufacturing {{town in the}} world". Birmingham's distinctive economic profile, with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly <b>skilled</b> <b>trades,</b> encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century. Perhaps the most important invention in British history, the industrial steam engine, was invented in Birmingham. Its resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of broad-based political radicalism, that under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London, and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy. From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943, Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz. The damage done to the city's infrastructure, in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners, led to extensive demolition and redevelopment in subsequent decades.|$|E

50|$|In Canada, a {{compulsory}} <b>trade</b> is a <b>skilled</b> <b>trade</b> {{that requires}} government certification of those {{engaged in the}} trade.
