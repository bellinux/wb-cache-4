5000|$|Large-scale {{production}} of phosphorus uses the Wöhler process. [...] In this process, apatites (nearly always fluorapatite) are reduced {{in the presence}} of carbon (coke) and silica (gravel). This is performed in a <b>submerged-arc</b> furnace at temperatures of between 1150 and 1400C. The main internal reaction is described below: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Submerged-arc</b> furnace for {{phosphorus}} {{production is}} a particular sub-type of electric arc furnace used to produce phosphorus and other products. Submerged arc furnaces are mainly used {{for the production of}} ferroalloys. The nomenclature submerged means that the furnace's electrodes are buried deep in the furnace burden. A reduction reaction takes place near the tip of the electrodes to facilitate the furnace's process.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{advances}} in welding technology {{have resulted from}} {{the introduction of new}} sources of the thermal energy required for localized melting. These {{advances in}}clude the introduction of modern techniques such as gas tungsten arc, [...] gas-metal arc, <b>submerged-arc,</b> electron beam,and laser beam welding processes. However, whilst these processes were able to improve stability, reproducibility, and accuracy of welding, they share a common limitation - the energy does not fully penetrate the material to be welded, resulting in the formation of a melt pool {{on the surface of the}} material.|$|E
5000|$|Butt welds are welds {{where two}} pieces of metal are to be joined {{are in the same}} plane. These types of welds require only some {{preparation}} and are used with thin sheet metals that can be welded with a single pass. Common issues that can weaken a butt weld are the entrapment of slag, excessive porosity, or cracking. For strong welds, the goal is to use the least amount of welding material possible. Butt welds are prevalent in automated welding processes, such as <b>submerged-arc</b> welding, due to their relative ease of preparation. [...] When metals are welded without human guidance, there is no operator to make adjustments for non-ideal joint preparation. Because of this necessity, butt welds can be utilized for their simplistic design to be fed through automated welding machines efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Electric arc {{furnaces}} {{are also}} used for production of calcium carbide, ferroalloys and other non-ferrous alloys, and for production of phosphorus. Furnaces for these services are physically different from steel-making furnaces and may operate on a continuous, rather than batch, basis. Continuous process furnaces may also use paste-type, Søderberg electrodes to prevent interruptions due to electrode changes. Such a furnace {{is known as a}} submerged arc furnace because the electrode tips are buried in the slag/charge, and arcing occurs through the slag, between the matte and the electrode. A steelmaking arc furnace, by comparison, arcs in the open. The key is the electrical resistance, which is what generates the heat required: the resistance in a steelmaking furnace is the atmosphere, while in a <b>submerged-arc</b> furnace the slag or charge forms the resistance. The liquid metal formed in either furnace is too conductive to form an effective heat-generating resistance.|$|E

5000|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) {{is a common}} arc welding process. The first patent on the <b>submerged-arc</b> welding (SAW) process was taken out in 1935 and covered an {{electric}} arc beneath a bed of granulated flux. Originally developed and patented by Jones, Kennedy and Rothermund, the process requires a continuously fed consumable solid or tubular (metal cored) electrode. The molten weld and the arc zone are protected from atmospheric contamination by being [...] "submerged" [...] under a blanket of granular fusible flux consisting of lime, silica, manganese oxide, calcium fluoride, and other compounds. When molten, the flux becomes conductive, and provides a current path between the electrode and the work. This thick layer of flux completely covers the molten metal thus preventing spatter and sparks as well as suppressing the intense ultraviolet radiation and fumes that {{are a part of}} the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process.|$|E
50|$|Gravity {{delivers}} the apatite ore, carbon (coke) and silica (gravel) to the <b>submerged-arc</b> furnace through feed chutes {{situated in the}} roof of the furnace. This ensures a constant packed bed volume. The gaseous product, a mixture of carbon monoxide and phosphorus gas, leaves the furnace through two symmetrically placed outlet vents situated above the ferrophosphorus tap hole in {{the roof of the}} furnace. The ferrophosphorus is tapped off, usually once per day. Slag, however, is continuously tapped through two alternating, water-cooled tap holes located 400 mm above the furnace floor. The feed material forms the major electrical and flow resistance of the smelting furnace circuit. As the feed materials descend towards the hot zone in the furnace, they start to soften and melt, significantly lowering the electrical resistance. A conductive path is thus provided between the electrodes where the Joule heating is released to attain the high temperatures and energy levels needed to effect the essential endothermic reactions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1934 Bleloch had {{outlined}} {{a method for}} the extraction of vanadium and pig iron from vanadiferous magnetite. In the years after WWII he once again became involved in metallurgical and electro-metallurgical projects. In 1948 he took 100 tons of Bushveld Igneous Complex magnetite to Norway where vanadium was extracted, and pig iron was converted to steel. His visionary concept was set out in a March 1949 paper entitled [...] "The electric smelting of iron ores for production of alloy irons and steels and the recovery of chromium and vanadium" [...] which was published by the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. During this period he was Technical Adviser to Rand Mines Limited on a project to construct a commercial plant to produce chromium steel from Bushveld ore. The Evraz Highveld Steel & Vanadium (EHSV) process flowsheet {{was developed in the}} early 1960s, based on Bleloch's 1949 work.

40|$|Ferrochrome alloy is {{predominantly}} produced in AC <b>submerged-arc</b> furnaces where the electrodes are {{buried in the}} burden of lumpy materials comprised of chromite ores or pellets, reductants and fluxes. Mintek has developed and patented the smelting of chromite ores in DC electric open-arc furnaces; principally for the processing of ore fines of sizes less than 1 mm {{without the need for}} agglomeration. Since the inception of this process, the DC arc furnace test facilities at Mintek have been employed to test varying composition, grade and mineralogy of chromite ores using different slag and metal chemistries, resulting in the production of ferrochrome alloys of varying composition and grade. The results of these campaigns primarily demonstrated the robustness and flexibility of the DC arc furnace for the processing of chromite ores and secondly provided a useful database pertaining to the smelting of chromite ores. Using the data collected over a series of DC arc furnace campaigns, the metallurgical control of the alloy composition is discussed. In particular, the reporting of Si and C to the alloy is evaluated based on the smelting conditions and thermodynamic principles. This article attempts to evaluate the results of DC arc smelting of chromite ores, and compare these results with the guidelines proposed in the literature for <b>submerged-arc</b> furnaces. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{contains}} an overview on automated ultrasonic weld inspection for various pipe types. Some inspection steps might by {{carried out with}} portable test equipment (e. g. pipe end test), but the weld inspection in all internationally relevant specifications must be automated. The pipe geometry, the production process, and the further pipe usage determine if NDT is required and thus, the number of required ultrasonic probes. Recent updates for some test specifications enforce {{a large number of}} ultrasonic probes, e. g. the SHELL standard. To save production cost, seamless pipes are sometimes replaced by ERW (electric-resistance welded) pipes and LSAW (<b>submerged-arc</b> welded pipes with longitudinal seam) pipes by SSAW (<b>submerged-arc</b> welded pipes with spiral seam) pipes, the inspection methods change gradually between the various pipe types. Each testing system is optimized for the specific application and its properties have to be discussed by the system manufacturer, the system user and the final customer of the pipe.

40|$|Mintek {{together}} with Middelburg Steel & Alloys, developed the DC arc furnace {{process for the}} production of ferroalloys with the expressed objective of smelting ore fines (< 1 mm) without the need for agglomeration. In the case of ferrochrome production, the DC arc furnace, being a semi-open bath operation, loses radiant energy directly from the bath to the furnace roof and sidewalls above the melt. This energy loss is reflected in a higher electrical energy usage per ton of alloy than for a <b>submerged-arc</b> operation smelting lumpy ores or sintered pellets. The difference increases still further when pre-heated sintered pellet feed is used in a <b>submerged-arc</b> operation. This shortcoming of the DC arc furnace can however be overcome by preheating the feed to the furnace in a fluidized bed or flash reactor fuelled by cold furnace off-gas. In addition to fluidization and preheating testwork, various preheating flowsheets with associated mass and energy balances have been developed and compared from a techno-economic viewpoint. The three major advantages identified were: a) fluidized beds can preheat ores and fluxes up to 950 °C without sticking and defluidizing, b) the open bath DC arc furnace does not require expensive coke or char to maintain the burden porosity and, c) the capital cost associated with the milling, pelletising and sintering plant falls away since ore fines are used directly...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermal state}} in <b>submerged-arc</b> {{furnaces}} (S. A. F.) producing ferro alloys {{is important for}} the conditions of both the grade of alloy produced as well as specific energy consumption. The temperature profile in the S. A.

A first-principle-based 2 -D model has been developed to predict the temperature profile in the furnace. In this study, four ores of different grades have been considered in order to simulate the thermal profile in the S. A. F. The influence of the composition of the ore on the thermal profile and its significance in rationalisation of charge distribution to optimise the process are discussed. 1.

40|$|This effort {{evaluated}} the fracture toughness of austenitic steel <b>submerged-arc</b> weld (SAW) fusion lines. The incentive was {{to explain why}} cracks grow into the fusion line in many pipe tests conducted with cracks initially centered in SAWS. The concern was that the fusion line may have a lower toughness than the SAW. It {{was found that the}} fusion line, Ji. was greater than the SAW toughness but much less than the base metal. Of greater importance may be that the crack growth resistance (JD-R) of the fusion line appeared to reach a steady-state value, while the SAW had a continually increasing JD-R curve. This explains why the cracks eventually turn to the fusion line in the pipe experiments. A method of incorporating these results would be to use the weld metal J-R curve up to the fusion-line steady-state J value. These results may be more important to LBB analyses than the ASME flaw evaluation procedures, since there is more crack growth with through-wall cracks in LBB analyses than for surface cracks in pipe flaw evaluations...|$|E
