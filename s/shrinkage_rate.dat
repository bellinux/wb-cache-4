2500|$|Such clay {{has a high}} [...] "shrink-swell" [...] ratio {{depending}} upon {{the amount of water}} present. As it dries from a saturated to a dry state it shrinks greatly – as seen in the cracked clay deposits of drying flooded areas – and this characteristic presents a serious problem to the potter. As the vessel is fired, any water left in the clay will tend to quickly turn to steam and explode the vessel wall in a spawl. It takes care and time to dry these vessels before they can be fired safely. Moreover, as even a well-tempered vessel dries shrinkage rates vary around the contours of the form and will create strains which will crack an air drying vessel if the drying is not slowed and controlled. A high <b>shrinkage</b> <b>rate</b> probably meant lots of effort lost to broken pots in both the drying and firing stages for inexperienced potters and ineffective technologies. Woodland potters attempted to remedy the high shrinkage by using large amounts (up to 33%) of coarse sand and/or grog temper in their efforts to render the clay usable for vessel construction. Moreover, their vessel shapes were necessarily confined to either a flat or conical-bottomed vessel and a thick walled construction were required in order for the vessel to stand, in an unfired state, without collapsing during the air-drying process in preparation for firing.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, archeologists working in Northeast Arkansas for the Arkansas Archeological Survey began {{research}} into causes of Mississippi Valley potters' relatively sudden shift to shell temper. The team conducted {{research at the}} AAS Station Lab at Arkansas State University involving macroscopic, microscopic, petrographic thin-sections, atomic absorption and x-ray diffraction analyses. A member of the team, Michael G. Million, also conducted replicative experiments, perhaps the first to do so with the exact clays, tempers and tools used by prehistoric Mississippian potters. Pastes were created {{using a variety of}} temper-to-clay percentages so that vessels as well as test-tiles could be produced for examination. Test tiles gave information about the shrinkage rates of various clay/temper combinations to the 'green' state and then further information upon firing. Simple, round bottom cooking jars were built using coil construction and the Mississippian pottery tool set including a pottery anvil, wooden paddle, mussel shell scrapers and polishing stones. The research discovered that there were very good reasons for using shell tempering for Mississippi Valley clays. The nature of clays formed by such a large meandering river system are distinctive. The huge annually flooded backswamp areas create a clay which is composed of very minute clay particles (primarily silica) and a high proportion of organic content. This is caused by the slow settling or deposition of the alluvial materials after floods. The clay particles tend to measure just a few micrometres in size and in plate-like form. Large amounts of water can be tightly held in the interspace between the clay particles. Add to this the organic ooze, and one has what is known colloquially as [...] "gumbo" [...] clay. [...] Such clay has a high [...] "shrink-swell" [...] ratio depending upon the amount of water present. As it dries from a saturated to a dry state it shrinks greatly - as seen in the cracked clay deposits of drying flooded areas - and this characteristic presents a serious problem to the potter. As the vessel is fired, any water left in the clay will tend to quickly turn to steam and explode the vessel wall in a spawl.

Extensive research {{has been carried out}} to develop new formulations of composite resins in order to provide good handling characteristics and some dimensional stability during polymerization. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze, in vitro, the magnitude of the volumetric polymerization shrinkage of 7 contemporary composite resins (Definite, Suprafill, SureFil, Filtek Z 250, Fill Magic, Alert, and Solitaire) to determine whether there are differences among these materials. The tests were conducted with precision of 0. 1 mg. The volumetric shrinkage was measured by hydrostatic weighing before and after polymerization and calculated by known mathematical equations. One-way ANOVA (a or = 0. 05) was used to determine statistically significant differences in volumetric shrinkage among the tested composite resins. Suprafill (1. 87 ± 0. 01) and Definite (1. 89 ± 0. 01) shrank significantly less than the other composite resins.
