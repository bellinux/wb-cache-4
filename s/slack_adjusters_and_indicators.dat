40|$|NIOSH {{recommends}} that all fire departments operating fire apparatus equipped with automatic <b>slack</b> <b>adjusters</b> (ASAs) immediately take the following actions {{to reduce the}} risk of fire fighters being injured in an apparatus crash due to brake failure: 1. Ensure that ASAs are not manually adjusted. 2. Establish procedures to ensure maintenance on fire apparatus is conducted as recommended in NFPA 1911 Standard for the Inspection, Maintenance, Testing, and Retirement of In-Service Automotive Fire Apparatus. 3. Ensure maintenance is only performed by qualified technicians who meet NFPA 1071 Standard for Emergency Vehicle Technician Professional Qualifications. An automatic slack adjuster is a mechanical component of the air brake system that adjust brakes as necessary when the vehicle is in operation to compensate for wear in the brake shoes (drum brakes) or pads (disc brakes). When an ASA is found to be out of adjustment, it signifies the existence of a larger braking system problem that needs correction. Manual adjustment of ASAs should only be done by qualified technicians during installation or when absolutely necessary to move the apparatus to a repair facility (NTSB 2006, 2007; IAFC 2006). In 2006, the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) warned the fire service of this potential problem (IAFC 2006) following an investigative report released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB 2006). While conducting an investigation of a recent apparatus crash-related fire fighter fatality, NIOSH learned that fire departments may not fully appreciate the hazards related to manual adjustment of ASAs. NIOSH would like to renew efforts to bring this to the attention of all U. S. fire departments, fire fighters, and fleet maintenance departments who are tasked with preventive maintenance or operation of apparatus equipped with ASAs. The manual adjustment of ASAs may contribute to unexpected brake failure on fire apparatus. When an ASA is found to be out of adjustment it signifies the existence of a larger problem with the braking system that needs to be corrected immediately. Vehicles found to have ASAs that are out of adjustment should be taken out-of-service immediately until corrective brake service is completed. Fire Departments should ensure that all technicians conducting brake service on fire department apparatus: (1) are certified in air brake repair to the level (T- 4) required by the Automotive Service Excellence Medium/Heavy Duty Truck Technician Certification and (2) have, at a minimum, Level 1 Fire Apparatus Technician Certification as certified by the Emergency Vehicle Technician Certification Commission. Additionally, fire departments should adhere to manufacturer guidelines and recommendations and applicable federal, state or provincial, and local laws regarding apparatus inspection and maintenance [NFPA 1911]. Further, the NTSB has recommended, and NIOSH agrees, that all drivers of fire apparatus equipped with air brakes must undergo training and testing to demonstrate proficiency in the inspection and operation of air-braked vehicles. Such training should emphasize that manual adjustment of automatic <b>slack</b> <b>adjusters</b> is dangerous <b>and</b> should not be done, except during installation, or in an emergency situation when it is absolutely necessary to move the vehicle to a repair facility.

40|$|National health {{expenditures}} {{will continue}} to grow faster than nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in the early 21 st century (Heffler et al., 2002; Heffler et al., 2005). Increased Medicaid costs have spurred research to find reliable cost-saving methodologies (Kronick et al., 1996). The Medicaid administrations of some states have chosen risk adjustment as a methodology for savings (Tollen et al., 1998; Weiner et al., 1998), since it can reduce the financial burden of health care providers and distribute medical resources more efficiently. This dissertation presents a risk-adjustment model based on two types of health condition adjusters: diagnosis-based HCC <b>adjusters</b> <b>and</b> pharmacy-based RxRisk <b>adjusters.</b> HCC adjusters were developed from different diagnostic categories from inpatient, outpatient and long-term care data. RxRisk adjusters included diseases inferable from prescription drug usage. The underlying assumption is that using both types of health condition adjusters, rather than relying on either diagnosis-based adjusters or pharmacy-based adjusters alone can help increase predictive power and lower Medicaid 2 ̆ 7 s risk of reimbursing inflated medical costs for its beneficiaries. The population in this study consisted of all disabled and aged Florida adults who were eligible for Florida 2 ̆ 7 s Medicaid program in state fiscal year (SFY) 2002 - 03 and state fiscal year 2003 - 04. The population was broken down into two subpopulations: disabled Medicaid beneficiaries aged 64 and under and beneficiaries aged 65 or over. The proposed regression model includes diagnostic <b>and</b> pharmacy-based <b>adjusters,</b> <b>and</b> this dissertation compares the proposed model with models based solely on pharmacy- or diagnosis-based adjusters. The results presented in this dissertation demonstrate the proposed model has higher predictive power than the diagnosis-based HCC model and the pharmacy-based RxRisk model for the overall population and the subpopulations in this study. Risk-adjustment models using diagnostic and prescription drug information have higher predictive power and decrease the possibility of inappropriate gaming of the Medicaid capitation payment system...|$|R

40|$|Most {{competitive}} social {{health insurance}} markets include risk equalization to compensate insurers for predictable variation in healthcare expenses. Empirical literature shows {{that even the}} most sophisticated risk equalization models—with advanced morbidity adjusters—substantially undercompensate insurers for selected groups of high-risk individuals. In the presence of premium regulation, these undercompensations confront consumers and insurers with incentives for risk selection. An important reason for the undercompensations is that not all information with predictive value regarding healthcare expenses is appropriate for use as a morbidity adjuster. To reduce incentives for selection regarding specific groups we propose overpaying morbidity adjusters that are already included in the risk equalization model. This paper illustrates the idea of overpaying by merging data on morbidity <b>adjusters</b> <b>and</b> healthcare expenses with health survey information, and derives three preconditions for meaningful application. Given these preconditions, we think overpaying may be particularly useful for pharmacy-based cost groups...|$|R
