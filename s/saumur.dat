5|$|As prime minister, Sihanouk revoked {{a decree}} {{issued by the}} last {{resident}} superior of Cambodia, Georges Gautier, to romanise the Khmer alphabet. Following the Surrender of Japan in August 1945, nationalist forces loyal to Son Ngoc Thanh launched a coup, which led to Thanh becoming prime minister. When the French returned to Cambodia in October 1945, Thanh was dismissed and replaced by Sihanouk's uncle Sisowath Monireth. Monireth negotiated for greater autonomy in managing Cambodia's internal affairs. A Modus Vivendi was signed in January 1946 whereby Cambodia was granted full autonomy within the French Union. A joint French-Cambodian commission was set up after that to draft Cambodia's constitution, and in April 1946, Sihanouk introduced clauses which provided for an elected parliament {{on the basis of}} universal male suffrage as well as press freedom. The first constitution was signed into effect by Sihanouk in May 1947. Around this time, Sihanouk made two trips to <b>Saumur,</b> France where he attended military training at the Armoured Cavalry Branch Training School in 1946, and again in 1948. He was made a reserve captain for the French army.|$|E

The third stage left Manche in Granville and headed south to the finish in Angers. Stage four took the race further south, between <b>Saumur</b> and Limoges, with the fifth stage crossing the elevated region of Massif Central to the finish at the Le Lioran mountain resort. Stage six headed to Montauban before {{the entrance to the}} Pyrenees in stage seven. This mountain range also hosted two further stages: a roller-coaster stage eight and the finish in Andorra in stage nine. The following three stages, 10 to 12, crossed the south of the country eastwards to Mont Ventoux. After an individual time trial, stage 14 took the race northwards through the Rhône Valley, which was followed by a stage that took the race into the Jura Mountains. Stage 16 ended with a finish in Bern, Switzerland. The next four stages took place in and around the Alps, before a long transfer took the Tour to the finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The {{area around}} <b>Saumur</b> {{is the third}} largest {{sparkling}} wine appellation in France after the Champagne region and the Crémant d'Alsace AOC with more than 12 million bottles of <b>Saumur</b> Mousseux produced each year. Unlike Champagne which is made with Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier, <b>Saumur</b> sparkling wine {{is based on the}} Chenin blanc grape. The area around Saumur-Champigny produces red wine based on the Cabernet franc grape that is similar in profile to the wines produced in St-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil.|$|E

25|$|Chenin blanc is an {{authorized}} planting in many Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regions but is mostly {{planted in the}} Middle Loire AOCs of Anjou, Bonnezeaux, Crémant de Loire, Coteaux de l'Aubance, Coteaux du Layon, Jasnières, Montlouis, Quarts de Chaume, <b>Saumur,</b> Savennières, and Vouvray. The wines of the Coteaux du Layon, Bonnezeaux, and Quarts de Chaume are produced as sweet dessert wines, while Savennières produce predominately dry wines. The wines of Anjou, Crémant de Loire, Coteaux de l'Aubance, Jasnières, Montlouis, <b>Saumur,</b> and Vouvray have {{a wide range of}} sweetness levels, from dry to semi-sweet to sweet.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} motley force {{gathered at}} <b>Saumur</b> {{together with their}} own representatives on mission. Santerre's Paris battalions were in a perpetual state of disorder, while recently promoted officers strolled the streets with prostitutes. On 7 June 1793 the Vendeans defeated Leigonyer at Doué-la-Fontaine and chased the Blues right into <b>Saumur.</b> Deeming the Republican position too strong, the White army temporarily pulled back while their leaders planned an attack. Hearing that Salomon was marching north from Thouars, a column of Vendeans fell on his division at Montreuil-Bellay and wiped out half the Republican force, sending the survivors fleeing south to Niort. On 11 June the Whites defeated the Blues in the Battle of <b>Saumur.</b> The Vendeans numbered about 20,000 with 100 cannon while the Republicans counted 16,000 soldiers plus some reinforcements. Guy Coustard de Saint-Lo directed the right flank, Santerre the center and Berthier the left, while Jacques-François Menou commanded troops in the town. Recently appointed the army chief of staff, Berthier repulsed the first assault, but Coustard was threatened by his own men and Santerre's troops threw down their muskets and ran away. Menou and Berthier, who were both wounded, tried to lead a cavalry charge, but the horsemen joined the rout. The Blues lost 8,000 men and 46 artillery pieces. After reorganizing the beaten division at Tours, Berthier soon reoccupied <b>Saumur.</b>|$|E

25|$|Anjou Mousseux AOC Sparkling wine AOC {{produced}} {{according to}} the traditional method. Most vineyards in the appellation overlap with those of <b>Saumur,</b> making {{the appearance of the}} Anjou Mousseux AOC on wine labels rare as producers favor using the more recognizable and marketable <b>Saumur</b> AOC designation. Both white and rosé sparkling wines are produced in this region with sweetness levels ranging from brut to demi-sec. The white sparkling wines must be composed of a minimum 60% Chenin blanc with Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Grolleau, Malbec and Pineau d'Aunis permitted to fill out the remaining 40%. Rosé sparklers are made from a blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Grolleau, Malbec and Pineau d'Aunis.|$|E
25|$|The white wines of the Coteaux du Layon, Montlouis-sur-Loire, Savennières, and Vouvray {{are based}} on Chenin blanc and {{are known for their}} high acidity when young and ability to develop and age well. The villages of Sancerre and Pouilly-sur-Loire are known for their crisp and {{herbaceous}} Sauvignon blancs. Some producers in the area are experimenting with oak aging their Sauvignon blanc to give them more rounder and softer appeal. The villages of Bourgueil, Chinon and <b>Saumur</b> are known for their Cabernet franc based wines that range from light and fruity in <b>Saumur</b> to rich and velvety in Chinon. The Muscadet wines from the Pays de la Loire are made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape and are known for their citrus and mineral notes.|$|E

25|$|The Republican generals {{disagreed}} {{over how}} to deal with the rebellion. Biron and Canclaux wanted to mount a concentric attack while the generals and representatives on mission at <b>Saumur,</b> which had been reoccupied, desired to attack from the east and drive the rebels against the seacoast. Ignoring Biron's wishes, 12,000 men of the <b>Saumur</b> division under Jacques-Marie Pilote La Barolière moved west. On 18 July, the Vendeans attacked and routed the Republicans in the Battle of Vihiers. Biron was recalled to Paris and sent to the guillotine on 31 December 1793. Biron was replaced by Jean Antoine Rossignol, a political demagogue. Facing Royrand in the south were the Luçon division under Augustin Tuncq and the Fontenay Division under Chalbos. On 25 July Tuncq occupied Chantonnay, burning the town and destroying food and weapons before returning to Luçon. Provoked by this raid, Royrand and Elbée with 12,000–15,000 rebels attacked Luçon but were repulsed on 30 July.|$|E
25|$|The {{generals and}} representatives at <b>Saumur,</b> {{including}} Berthier, planned {{to drive the}} rebels west against the seacoast and crush them there. From his headquarters at Niort, Biron argued that this action might cause the rebels to overrun a port and open communications with the Royal Navy. He and Canclaux wanted to mount a concentric offensive instead. Finding the independent-minded group at <b>Saumur</b> persisting with their plan and being supported by the Committee of Public Safety, Biron sent in his resignation. He was soon recalled to Paris and executed by guillotine on 31 December 1793. Meanwhile, Jacques-Marie Pilotte La Barolière set out from <b>Saumur</b> with a major expedition. On 15 and 17 July they repulsed rebel attacks but the unfitness of their soldiers shook the resolve of the commanders. La Barolière complained that his troops were drunk and insubordinate while Berthier advised retreat after witnessing two units firing at one another. Led by a body of German and Swiss deserters, the Whites attacked on 18 July at Vihiers. The advance guard under Menou held its ground {{for a long time}} but many of the Blues ran away after only catching a glimpse of the enemy. Louis-Nicolas Davout covered the rout that followed with some cavalry and Santerre escaped by jumping his horse over a wall. In the Battle of Vihiers the Royalists lost 1,000 killed and wounded out of 12,000. The Republicans suffered losses of 2,000 killed and wounded and 3,000 men captured out of 14,000; they lost 25 out of 30 guns.|$|E

25|$|Apart from competition, {{there is}} the {{tradition}} of classical dressage, in which the traditional training of dressage is pursued as an art form. The traditions of the masters who originated Dressage are kept alive by the Spanish Riding School in Vienna, Austria, Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre in Lisbon, Portugal, and the Cadre Noir in <b>Saumur,</b> France. This type of schooling is {{also a part of}} Portuguese and Spanish bullfighting exhibitions.|$|E
25|$|At this time, the {{principal}} cavalry schools of Europe at Pinerolo and Tor-di-Quinto in Italy, the French school in <b>Saumur,</b> and the Spanish school in Vienna all preferred {{to use a}} very deep seat with long stirrups when jumping.

25|$|Amyraldism (or {{sometimes}} Amyraldianism, {{also known}} as the School of <b>Saumur,</b> hypothetical universalism, post redemptionism, moderate Calvinism, or four-point Calvinism) is the belief that God, prior to his decree of election, decreed Christ's atonement for all alike if they believe, but seeing that none would believe on their own, he then elected those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election. The efficacy of the atonement remains limited to those who believe.|$|E
25|$|Like Muscat of Hamburg, Muscat Ottonel is a {{relatively}} recent addition to the Muscat family, being bred in the Loire Valley wine region of France in the 1850s. The grape is a cross of the Swiss wine grape Chasselas and Muscat d'Eisenstadt (also known as Muscat de <b>Saumur).</b> Of {{all of the major}} Muscat varieties, Muscat Ottonel has the most pale skin color, and tends to produce the most neutral wines and is also the grape variety that ripens the earliest.|$|E

25|$|On 9 June 1793, Vendean insurgents {{commanded}} by Jacques Cathelineau captured {{the town of}} <b>Saumur</b> from Louis-Alexandre Berthier. The victory gave the insurgents a massive supply of arms, including 50 cannons. This was {{the high point of}} the insurgency. The Vendeans had never before attempted to take such a large town, and they captured it in a single day, inflicting heavy losses on its Republican defenders. Many prisoners were taken, some of whom went over to the Vendean cause, while many of the citizens fled to Tours.|$|E
25|$|A larger Rosé de Loire {{appellation}} {{exist that}} includes wines made from Anjou, <b>Saumur</b> and Touraine.

25|$|The {{rebels were}} {{opposed by the}} Republican Army of the Coasts of Cherbourg, Army of the Coasts of Brest under Jean Baptiste Camille Canclaux and Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle under Armand Louis de Gontaut, Duke of Biron. While Canclaux held Angers, Nantes and the west coast {{department}} of Loire-Inférieure, Biron was responsible for Les Sables-d'Olonne, Luçon, Fontenay-le-Comte, Niort and <b>Saumur.</b> In March the Republicans deployed 34 volunteer and two regular infantry battalions plus two regiments of cavalry. The National Convention rushed reinforcements to the scene including 12 poorly-disciplined volunteer battalions from Paris under Antoine Joseph Santerre.|$|E
25|$|In 1957 to 1961, the {{regiment}} {{fought in the}} Algerian War, losing 84 men. From 1961 to 1984, {{the regiment}} was garrisoned at Haguenau in Alsace.

25|$|Anjou AOC - The {{boundaries}} of this AOC extend into nearby <b>Saumur,</b> allowing {{some of the}} wine produced in that region to be sold under the Anjou AOC label. The basic Anjou Rouge can be produced from Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pineau d'Aunis and tend to be medium to full bodied. Basic Anjou Blanc can range in style from dry to sweet and light bodied to full. They must be composed of a minimum 80% Chenin blanc with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc permitted {{to fill out the}} remaining 20% of the blend. According to wine expert Tom Stevenson, both the reds and whites wines have the aging potential of only a few years after vintage.|$|E
25|$|Greater Anjou is {{a modern}} term to {{describe}} the area consisting of Anjou, Maine, Touraine, Vendôme, and Saintonge. Here, prévôts, the seneschal of Anjou, and other seneschals governed. They were based at Tours, Chinon, Baugé, Beaufort, Brissac, Angers, <b>Saumur,</b> Loudun, Loches, Langeais and Montbazon. However, the constituent counties, such as Maine, were often administered by the officials of the local lords, rather than their Angevin suzerains. Maine was at first largely self-ruling and lacked administration until the Angevin kings made efforts to improve administration by installing new officials, such as the seneschal of Le Mans. These reforms came {{too late for the}} Angevins however, and only the Capetians saw the beneficial effects of this reform after they annexed the area.|$|E
25|$|Coteaux du Layon AOC This large {{appellation}} overlaps the <b>Saumur</b> AOC to {{the southeast}} and the Anjou Coteaux de la Loire AOC in the northwest. The region {{has a long history}} of winemaking sweet white wines dating back to the 4th century AD. Today the AOC is dedicated to 100% Chenin blanc wines that, in favorable years, are afflicted by noble rot. Yields are restricted to a maximum of 30 hectoliters per hectare and wines must have a minimum 12% alcohol level in order to qualify for AOC designation. In 2003 mandatory harvest sugar levels being increased from 204grams per liter to 221 g/l or 294 g/l for the newly established Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN) designation and minimum residual sugar levels in the finished wines increased from 17 g/l to 34 g/l.|$|E
25|$|The {{departments}} {{included in}} the uprising, called the Vendée Militaire, included the area between the Loire and the Layon rivers: Vendée (Marais, Bocage Vendéen, Collines Vendéennes), part of Maine-et-Loire west of the Layon, and the portion of Deux Sèvres west of the River Thouet. Having secured their pays, the deficiencies of the Vendean army became more apparent. Lacking a unified strategy (or army) and fighting a defensive campaign, from April onwards the army lost cohesion and its special advantages. Successes continued for some time: Thouars was taken in early May and <b>Saumur</b> in June; there were victories at Châtillon and Vihiers. After this string of victories, the Vendeans turned to a protracted siege of Nantes, {{for which they were}} unprepared and which stalled their momentum, giving the government in Paris sufficient time to send more troops and experienced generals.|$|E
25|$|After Dunkirk, the AASF squadrons in France {{had been}} moved to the area between Orléans and Le Mans during the lull before Fall Rot, the German {{offensive}} over the Somme and Aisne rivers. From the new bases, the AASF was able to operate anywhere along the front but after the German breakthrough on 11 June, British Air Forces in France (Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Barratt) was warned by the Air Ministry {{to be ready for}} a quick getaway from France. The British squadrons were moved west to bases around Angers, <b>Saumur,</b> Rennes and Nantes, which were already full of French aircraft and severely congested. Barratt sent the light bomber squadrons back to England on 15 June and kept the five fighter squadrons to cover the evacuation of RAF ground staff and the three British divisions commanded by Brooke.|$|E
