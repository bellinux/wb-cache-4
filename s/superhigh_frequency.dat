The control samples of bacterial suspension in the flasks were kept under the same conditions as the test ones. Irradiated suspensions were used as inoculum for fermentation on molasses wort at t = + 30 ºC with aeration.

40|$|A novel {{wearable}} {{radio frequency}} identification (RFID) tag with sensing, processing, and decision-taking capability is presented for operation in the 2. 45 -GHz RFID <b>superhigh</b> <b>frequency</b> (SHF) band. The tag is powered by an integrated light harvester, with a flexible battery serving as an energy buffer. The proposed active tag features excellent wearability, very high read range, enhanced functionality, flexible interfacing with diverse low-power sensors, and extended system autonomy through an innovative holistic microwave system design paradigm that takes antenna design into consideration from the very early stages. Specifically, a dedicated textile shorted circular patch antenna with monopolar radiation pattern is designed and optimized for highly efficient and stable operation within the frequency band of operation. In this process, the textile antenna's functionality is augmented by reusing its surface as an integration platform for light-energy-harvesting, sensing, processing, and transceiver hardware, without sacrificing antenna performance or the wearer's comfort. The RFID tag is validated by measuring its stand-alone and on-body characteristics in free-space conditions. Moreover, measurements in a real-world scenario demonstrate an indoor read range up to 23 m in nonline-of-sight indoor propagation conditions, enabling interrogation by a reader situated in another room. In addition, the RFID platform only consumes 168. 3 mu W, when sensing and processing are performed every 60 s...|$|E
40|$|In future, more {{devices such}} as {{wearable}} devices will {{be connected to the}} networks. This will increase simultaneous handovers. The coverage of a cell will be small because a <b>superhigh</b> <b>frequency</b> used in 5 G wireless networks does not propagate very far. This trend will increase the number of neighbour cell lists and it will accelerate the change of neighbour cell lists since the coverage of cells can be altered by the environment. Meanwhile, the ANR technology will be essential in 5 G networks. Since the network environment in the future is not similar to the present, the strategy of ANR should also be different from the present. First, since practical neighbour cell lists in each cell are changed frequently and individually, it is necessary to optimize them frequently and individually. Second, since the neighbour cell lists in each cell are not changed similarly, it is necessary to operate ANR flexibly. To respond to these issues, we propose to use network function virtualization (NFV) for ANR. To evaluate the proposed strategies, we measured additional resource consumption and the latency of handover if neighbour cell lists are not optimized when UEs perform handover simultaneously. These experiments are conducted using Amarisoft LTE- 100 Platform...|$|E
40|$|Anisotropic ferromagnetics with spin various {{values are}} {{considered}} in the paper aiming at the dynamic property theoretical investigation of anisotropic magnetics with spins S= 1, S= 3 / 2. The obtaining of new solutions Schroedinger non-linear equation (SNE) is also {{the aim of the}} paper. During the investigation the test function method (where generalized coherent states (GCS) are the test functions) and the variety of algebraic-geometrical methods of the non-linear differential equation integration have been used. As a result the quadrupole interaction influence on the main state of ferromagnetics has been shown. The additional high-frequency modes in the magnetic spectrum of magnetics with spins S= 1, S= 3 / 2 have been found. Equation systems, describing the dynamics of ferromagnetics with various anisotropy and spin have been obtained as well as new two-soliton solution of SNE. The constructed GCS and motion equations may be used for the theoretical investigation of a wide class of magnetics, and the obtained SNE solutions - for the investigation of various non-linear effects in condensed mediums. The possibility of the ferromagnetic behaviour regime determination according to the value and direction of the external magnetic field is being achieved as well as the possibility of the use of the effects, appearing under these conditions, for the investigation of various magnetics. The paper results may find their field of application in microelectronics, <b>superhigh</b> <b>frequency</b> techniques, while delivering of special cources for specialists in the field of non-linear physicsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Solar {{small scale}} {{microwave}} bursts (SMBs), including microwave dot, spike, and narrow band type III bursts, are characterized with very short timescales, narrow frequency bandwidth, and very high brightness temperatures. Based on {{observations of the}} Chinese Solar Broadband Radio Spectrometer at Huairou with superhigh cadence and frequency resolution, this work presents an intensive investigation of SMBs in several flares occurred in active region NOAA 10720 during 2005 Jan 14 - 21. Especially long-duration flares, SMBs occurred not only in early rising and impulsive phase, {{but also in the}} flare decay phase, and even in time of after the flare ending. These SMBs are strong bursts with inferred brightness temperature at least 8. 18 * 10 ^ 11 - 1. 92 * 10 ^ 13 K, very short lifetime of 5 - 18 ms, relative frequency bandwidths of 0. 7 - 3. 5 %, and <b>superhigh</b> <b>frequency</b> drifting rates. Together with their obviously different polarizations from the background emission (the quiet Sun, and the underlying flaring broadband continuum), such SMBs should be individual independent strong coherent bursts which is related to some non-thermal energy releasing and production of energetic particles in small scale source region. These facts show the existence of small scale strong non-thermal energy releasing activities after the flare maxima, which is meaningful to the prediction of space weather. Physical analysis indicates that plasma mechanism may be the most favorable candidate for the formation of SMBs. From plasma mechanism, the velocities and kinetic energy of fast electrons can be deduced, and the region of electron acceleration can also be tracke.
