Container <b>storage</b> <b>yards</b> include yards for inbound containers with cargo and internal movements, yards for outbound containers with cargo, yards for trans-shipment containers and yards for empties. The area requirements are measured in TEU ground slots (the area required for one 20-ft container) plus operating space for equipment that transfers containers to and from the yards and that stack and deliver containers.|$|R

A combination of container demand increase and <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> capacity scarcity create complex operational challenges for <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> managers. This paper presents an in-depth overview of <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> operations, including the material handling equipment used, and highlights current industry trends and developments. A classification scheme for <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> operations is proposed and used to classify scientific journal papers published between 2004 and 2012. The paper also discusses and challenges the current operational paradigms on <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> operations. Lastly, the paper identifies new avenues for academic research based on current trends and developments in the container terminal industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|An efficient, smart, {{energy-saving}} automated {{container terminal}} (ACT) scheme is introduced in this paper, {{in which one}} three-dimensional container distribution system is proposed between crane <b>yard</b> and <b>storage</b> <b>yard.</b> In this scheme, container vehicle-low bridge coupled vibration greatly affects the ACT’s structural safety and handling efficiency. Firstly, the coupled vibration time-domain responses, inspired by self-excitation including track irregularity and hunting movement as well as environmental (wind and seismic) load, were obtained by using free-interface component mode synthesis (CMS) method. The relationship of response and vehicle speed, wind velocity and ground motion intensity was studied as well. Accordingly, the structural safety, running safety and stationarity were assessed by indicators such as deflection-span ratio, vibration acceleration, wheel-rail relative displacement, etc. The container vehicle speed limits of the low bridge rigid supported or lead rubber bearing (LRB) supported under seismic and operational wind load were compared. The results of model test and prototype simulation prove with each other, which validates LRB’s effects on vibration isolation and absorption, thus can increase ground motion intensity and vehicle speed thresholds to structural safety...|$|R

40|$|<b>Yard</b> <b>storage</b> {{space and}} <b>yard</b> crane {{equipment}} are the core {{resources in the}} container terminal yard area. This paper studies the integrated yard space allocation (outbound container space) and yard crane deployment problem in resource-limited container terminals where yard space and yard cranes are extremely scarce. Two corresponding counterstrategies are introduced, respectively, and the integrated problem is solved as mixed integer programming. The model this paper formulated considers the container volume fluctuation of the service line, and the objective is a trade-off between yard sharing space and terminal operation cost. In numerical experiments, this paper tries to reveal the management meaning in practical operation of container terminal and provides decision support for terminal managers; therefore a series of scenarios are presented to analyze the relations among the yard sharing space, the number of yard cranes, the size of yard subblock, {{and the cost of}} terminal operation...|$|R
