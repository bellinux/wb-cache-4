40|$|Given {{the current}} number of road accidents, {{the aim of}} many road <b>safety</b> <b>analysts</b> is to {{identify}} the main {{factors that contribute to}} crash severity. To pinpoint those factors, this paper shows an application that applies some of the methods most commonly used to build decision trees (DTs), which have not been applied to the road safety field before. An analysis of accidents on rural highways in the province of Granada (Spain) between 2003 and 2009 (both inclusive) showed that the methods used to build DTs serve our purpose and may even be complementary. Applying these methods has enabled potentially useful decision rules to be extracted that could be used by road <b>safety</b> <b>analysts.</b> For instance, some of the rules may indicate that women, contrary to men, increase their risk of severity under bad lighting conditions. The rules could be used in road safety campaigns to mitigate specific problems.

40|$|Embedded systems, {{which are}} safety critical, are {{frequently}} analyzed {{to find out}} whether they follow the safety standards and to improve their safety. Fault tree analyses enable the <b>safety</b> <b>analysts</b> to find possible causes of a system’s failure or unsafe behavior. From a fault tree, minimal cut sets are computed giving unique combinations of basic events that cause such a failure. Using minimal cut sets, the <b>safety</b> <b>analysts</b> try {{to find out how to}} improve the safety of the system with a restricted amount of resources, e. g., cost and time. The two most important results of minimal cut set analyses are the order (number of basic events) and the failure probability of the minimal cut sets. Small order minimal cut sets having 1 - 3 basic events are the most important ones, because, e. g., a single point of failure is more likely to occur than multiple failures at the same time. However, there is a lack of tools that visualize both failure probability and order of minimal cut sets. Therefore, we presented in our previous paper “Safety-Domino ” the design of a graphical metaphor for visualizing the minimal cut set’s order together with its failure probability.

40|$|International audienceNon-nuclear {{countries}} {{started to}} express their interest in building electronuclear programs in the early 2000 s, with the consequence of creating the “nuclear renaissance” concept. This resulted in rising the number of power reactors under construction up to 65 according to IAEA’s PRIS –Therefore, the development of high-level safety analysts is a burning issue, in particular for “newcomers” who have the wish to set up independent safety authorities and/or technical support organizations’ (TSO) for risk management assessment. Some of emerging nuclear countries have planned to reach this objective by fully integrating the development of research reactors into their strategy of human resources development. For instance, for Jordan, “the research and test reactor would serve {{as an integral part}} of the nuclear technology infrastructure. It will become the focal point for a Nuclear Science and Technology Center and play the primary role in educating and training the upcoming generations of nuclear engineers and scientists”. Thus this paper presents three aspects of this topic. First, it will enlighten the French TSO’s point of view (IRSN) regarding the strategy to be set up to turn a scientific engineer into a <b>safety</b> <b>analyst.</b> It will then introduce the role that can play the construction and the operation of a research reactor in this frame. As a conclusive topic, this paper approaches the role that a nuclear country’s’ TSO can play to sustain the development of “newcomers” safety analysis skills. These three aspects could benefit any country within the step 2 of the IAEA’s Milestone frameworkNuclear reactors involve numerous and highly technical sciences: they cover fields from fundamental neutronics to thermohydraulics, from fuel thermomechanics to radiological gas diffusion… These sciences are in complete interactions with each other and computational tools are often required to simulate their effects on a research reactor safety. As these topics have to be examined together, with interaction between each other and in relation to the specificities of the facility, it is crucial to get a keystone engineer to manage these specialized analyses. Consequently, safety assessment requires also specific skills that are not based only on these sciences and that are not initially held by a nuclear engineer. Thus the first objective program is to define the inherent human, professional, and technical characteristics required by a <b>safety</b> <b>analyst.</b> Formalizing a <b>safety</b> <b>analyst</b> profile imposes to identify a set of applicable knowledge, hard and soft skills requirements in these topics: Level of nuclear sciences background; Risk assessment methodology (defence in depth, implementation of barriers, graded approach…), Human behaviour and capability to interact with operators, scientific experts, safety authority, Construction of comprehensive and justified surveys capabilities. Several routes can be explored to build a <b>safety</b> <b>analyst</b> from a nuclear engineer: Implementing nuclear safety into universities programs; Theoretical training programs tutoring programs; such topics can be dealt with by dedicated instances such as ENSTTI and “Field-based” approaches emerging from case by case analysis,In this context, it is important to notice that research reactors require the same basic sciences and are not as complex as nuclear power plants. Hence holding a comprehensive set of knowledge allowing the global safety assessment of the reactor is more easily achievable by a <b>safety</b> <b>analyst.</b> Research reactors are the first object on which this set of knowledge will be applied. It would then be eventually extrapolated to any nuclear installation, and profitably nuclear power plants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of a road network could be carried out using different techniques, the most advanced of which for the identification of hazardous sites {{are based on a}} statistical tool known as a “Safety Performance Function” (SPF). SPFs are fundamental to procedures in the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) and <b>Safety</b> <b>Analyst,</b> both of which require calibration of the SPFs to local conditions. In the case of infrastructure in which the traffic flow is physically divided, such as motorways, there are two different methods to calibrate an SPF; one is based on a consideration of two directional segments, the other one is based on mono-directional segments with a correction factor that takes into account the presence of two directional traffic, as proposed by <b>Safety</b> <b>Analyst.</b> In the first case, traffic flows are the sum of traffic flows for each direction. The two methods give a different calibration factor for local condition, i. e., different performance in terms of goodness of fit and SPF transferability. This paper seeks to address these differences by investigating the two approaches to estimate crash count using a motorway sample data from Italy and focusing on a comparison in terms of model transferability. Furthermore two different SPFs were calibrated on the same data using the two different functional equation form, to evaluate the goodness of fit of the two different traffic based segmentation. The goodness of fit of the models is investigated using CURE plots and the R 2 values. The four sets of models give good results in terms of goodness of fit but they have different values for the calibration factor. The calibration factor of the calibrated mono-directional model is closer to a value of one, suggesting a better goodness of fit on the contrary the HSM model gives the better performance in terms of transfer ability where crash data are not available...|$|E

Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission, which launched from Japan in March 2014, was a joint mission under {{a partnership between}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). GPM {{was one of the}} first NASA Goddard in-house programs that extensively used software controls. Using this tool during the GPM buildup allowed a thorough review of inhibit and safety critical software design for hazardous subsystems such as the high gain antenna boom, solar array, and instrument deployments, transmitter turn-on, propulsion system release, and instrument radar turn-on. The GPM safety team developed a methodology to document software safety as part of the standard hazard report. As a result of this process, a new tool safety inhibit timeline was created for management of inhibits and their controls during spacecraft buildup and testing during IT at GSFC and at the launch range in Japan. The Safety Inhibit Timeline Tool was a pathfinder approach for reviewing software that controls the electrical inhibits. The Safety Inhibit Timeline Tool strengthens the Safety Analysts understanding of the removal of inhibits during the IT process with safety critical software. With this tool, the <b>Safety</b> <b>Analyst</b> can confirm proper safe configuration of a spacecraft during each IT test, track inhibit and software configuration changes, and assess software criticality.
