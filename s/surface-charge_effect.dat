30|$|Here, we {{demonstrated}} {{a procedure that}} mitigates the degradation of the image quality resulting from low-energy SEs when using deceleration. By removing SEs from the images, using the FEI concentric backscatter detector or a simple SE-blocking aperture in a monolithic detector, beam deceleration becomes a feasible approach to achieve limited penetration depths with sufficient sample and imaging stability to produce large volumes of data. Additional improvements in sample preparation, particularly the use of conductive epoxy resins formulated for SBEM, should improve the technique of beam deceleration by producing uniform electric fields at the sample surface and reducing <b>surface-charging</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{release of}} neurotransmitters at {{classical}} chemical synapses occurs via Ca 2 + influx through voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels, which are opened following depolarization of presynaptic terminals. However, owing to a persistence or {{increase in the}} amount of transmitter released in preparations containing low concentrations of Ca 2 +, it has been proposed that transmitter release could also occur through a Ca(2 +) -independent, carrier-mediated process. On the other hand, lowering extracellular [Ca 2 +] can actually promote Ca 2 + influx through voltage-activated Ca 2 + channels via a modification of the surface potential of plasma membranes. Therefore, the proposed Ca(2 +) -independent transmitter release could be re-accommodated {{within the framework of the}} Ca 2 + hypothesis of synaptic transmission by taking into account the <b>surface-charge</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

40|$|New {{geologic}} concepts {{have been}} developed that illuminate the critical role of bound water in the generation and prediction of overpressures in mudstones. The concept is based on new understanding of the <b>surface-charge</b> <b>effects</b> on water adsorbed on solid surfaces and comes in part from molecular modelling, atomic force measurements, and high-beam neutron diffraction studies reported in the literature. The picture that is emerging is as follows. Bound water on clay surfaces can support a lithostatic load. The bound water fraction increases with compaction, as free water is expelled, with a concomitant decrease in permeability. Overpressures commence at a threshold depth, the retention depth, where the rate of fluid loss {{is not sufficient to}} establish pressure equilibrium with the surface. With deeper burial there is a second threshold depth, a gating depth, where bound water condenses to a high-density phase. Below this gating depth, fluid expansion or other effects are responsible for secondary pressure anomalies. Knowledge of bound water effects accounts for discrepancies observed in laboratory measurements of mudstone properties. For instance, mercury intrusion and surface-area measurements depend strongly on how much (hygroscopic) bound water has-been absorbed or adsorbed on a sample before measurements. Surface charge effects tend to increase with compaction due, in part, to reduction of iron and beidellitization. A large data set for mudstones is used to show that the fraction of bound water tends to reach a maximum of almost 100 percent at a depth of 2 to 3 km. An important part of this research is the development of the empirical equation BW = 0. 734 CEC (1 -Փ) /Փ, where BW is bound water (fraction of total pore volume), Ф is porosity and CEC is cation-exchange capacity (expressed in meq/gm). Porosity and CEC are borehole derived using resistivity and acoustic methods described here. As an adjunct part of this research a software package (called P 3) has been written that puts the concepts and relationships into practice.

40|$|A {{single suction}} {{microelectrode}} voltage-clamp technique {{was used to}} study the actions of lanthanum ions (La 3 +) on ionic currents in single cells isolated from bullfrog right atrium. La 3 +, added as LaCl 3, blocked the "slow" inward Ca 2 + current (ICa) in a dose-dependent fashion; 10 (- 5) M produced complete inhibition. This effect was best fitted by a dose-response curve that was calculated assuming 1 : 1 binding of La 3 + to a site having a dissociation constant of 7. 5 x 10 (- 7) M. La 3 + block was reversed (to 90 % of control ICa) following washout and, {{in the presence of}} 10 (- 5) M La 3 +, was antagonized by raising the Ca 2 + concentration from 2. 5 to 7. 5 mM (ICa recovered to 56 % of the control). However, the latter effect took approximately 1 h to develop. Concentrations of La 3 + that reduced ICa by 12 - 67 %, 0. 1 - 1. 5 x 10 (- 6) M, had no measurable effect upon the voltage dependence of steady state ICa inactivation, which suggest that at these concentrations there are no significant <b>surface-charge</b> <b>effects</b> of La 3 + on this gating mechanism. Three additional findings indicate that doses of La 3 + that blocked ICa failed to produce nonspecific effects: (a) 10 (- 5) M La 3 + had no measurable effect on the time-independent inwardly rectifying current, IK 1; (b) the same concentration had no effect on the kinetics, amplitude, or voltage dependence of a time- and voltage-dependent K+ current, IK; and (c) 10 (- 4) M La 3 + did not alter the size of the tetrodotoxin-sensitive inward Na+ current, INa, or the voltage dependence of its steady state inactivation. Higher concentrations (0. 5 - 1. 0 mM) reduced both IK 1 and IK, and shifted the steady state activation curve for IK toward more positive potentials, presumably by reducing the external surface potential. Our results suggest that at a concentration of {{less than or equal to}} 10 (- 5) M, La 3 + inhibits ICa selectively by direct blockade of Ca channels rather than by altering the external surface potential. At higher concentrations, La 3 + exhibits nonspecific effects, including neutralization of negative external surface charge and inhibition of other time- and voltage-dependent ionic currents...|$|R
40|$|With near normal {{monovalent}} ionic concentrations, {{the rate}} of increase of the potassium conductance after a depolarizing voltage-clamp step is slowed when the external calcium concentration is increased. This trend in the rise-time with changes in calcium is reversed when the axointernal potassium concentration is reduced (150 mM) and the periaxonal concentration is increased (50 mM); that is, the rise-time decrease with increasing calcium concentration. Furthermore, the degree of sigmoidality of the K-conductance time-course always increase when the rise-times increase for a given test potential. In the case of calcium <b>surface-charge</b> screening, these <b>effects</b> may be caused by a shifted distribution of K-ions within the channels following the altered ion gradient, and by a consequent shift in the reciprocal electrostatic interactions between the ionic charges and channel-gate charges...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To provide {{evidence}} that the synaptic transmission increase induced by nominally Ca 2 +• free media in the eyecup of turtle (Pseudemys scripta) or salamander (Ambystoma tigrnum) (see Piccolino er of, PNAS, l 996) {{is the result of}} a paradoxical increase of [Ca 2 +]i in PRs consequent to increased opening of Ca 2 + channels via a <b>surface-charge</b> mediated <b>effect.</b> Methods: changes in [Ca 2 +]o induced by application of nominally Ca 2 +-free media in eyecups were measured using micropipettes filled with a Ca 2 + ionophore (I • Cocktail A by Fluka, # 2 l 048); and changes of [Ca 2 +]i induced in isolated PRs by bath application of Cai 2 +-concentrations comparable to those induced in eyecups by nominally Ca 2 +-free media were measured with Ca 2 +-imaging techniques (utilizing FLUO- 3 AM). Results: In eyecups superfused from the vitreal side with nominally Ca 2 +•free media for periods of 30 minutes or more, [Ca 2 +] near the PH terminals decreased to levels around 0. 7 - 0. 3 mM. During Ca 2 +—free application, clear spatial gradients of [Ca 2 +] were evident along the sclero-vitreal axis with lower [Ca 2 +] near the vitreal surface. Membrane depolarisation induced in isolated PRs by soliitions containing elevated [K+] (15 mM) and normal (3 mM) [Ca 2 +] resulted in an increase of [Ca 2 +],. When the same high K+ solutions were applied in the presence of reduced [Ca 2 +] (0. 7 - 0. 3 mM) the increase of [Ca• 2 +]. signal was enhanced. Conclusions: These results justify our "surface- chargel interpretation of the transmitter release changes induced by low Ca 2 + application in eyecup preparations, and invite caution in interpreting the effects of low Ca 2 + media in intactor semi-intact preparations of the nervous system.
