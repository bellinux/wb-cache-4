In human volunteers, the cumulative excretion of the (S)-enantiomer of styrene glycol and mendelic acid were higher than the R form after exposure to styrene. In human liver microsomes, cytochrome P450-mediated styrene oxidation showed the production of more S enantiomer relative to the R enantiomer.

5000|$|Styrene is {{regarded}} as a [...] "hazardous chemical", especially in case of eye contact, but also in case of skin contact, of ingestion and of inhalation, according to several sources.

On 10 June 2011, the U.S. National Toxicology Program has described styrene as [...] "reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen". However, a STATS author describes a review that was done on scientific literature and concluded that [...] "The available epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal relationship between styrene exposure and any type of human cancer". [...] Despite this claim, work has been done by Danish researchers to investigate the relationship between occupational exposure to styrene and cancer. They concluded, [...] "The findings have to be interpreted with caution, due to the company based exposure assessment, but the possible association between exposures in the reinforced plastics industry, mainly styrene, and degenerative disorders of the nervous system and pancreatic cancer, deserves attention".

40|$|The configurational {{stability}} of some lithiated fluorinated <b>styrene</b> <b>oxides</b> has been investigated. Chemical {{studies have shown}} that in ethereal solvents α-lithiated ortho-, meta-, and para-fluorostyrene oxides (2 -Li, α- 5 -Li, and α- 6 -Li) are all configurationally stable in the reaction time scale, whereas a-lithiated ortho-, meta-, and paratrifluoromethylstyrene oxides (9 -Li, 13 -Li, and 14 -Li) are configurationally unstable. Optically active oxiranyllithiums 2 -Li and 9 -Li, could be stereospecifically generated and quenched with electrophiles. The corresponding derivatives were then successfully subjected to regiospecific ring-opening reactions with amines to give fluorinated ßamino alcohols with a stereodefined quaternary carbinol center, which are useful synthons in medicinal chemistry. The barriers of inversion have been calculated (Eyring equation) for oxiranyllithiums 9 -Li, 13 -Li, and 14 -Li by determining the enantiomeric ratios after electrophilic quenching on aging the enantioenriched organolithium for different times in THF; in the case of 9 -Li, activation parameters have also been determined.

40|$|Styrene {{metabolism}} in styrene-degrading Pseudomonas putida CA- 3 cells {{has been}} shown to proceed via <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> phenylacetaldehyde, and phenylacetic acid. The initial step in styrene degradation by strain CA- 3 is oxygen-dependent epoxidation of styrene to <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> which is subsequently isomerized to phenylacetaldehyde. Phenylacetaldehyde is then oxidized to phenylacetic acid. Styrene, <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> and phenylacetaldehyde induce the enzymes involved in the degradation of styrene to phenylacetic acid by P. putida CA- 3. Phenylacetic acid-induced cells do not oxidize styrene or <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide.</b> Thus, styrene degradation by P. putida CA- 3 can be subdivided further into an upper pathway which consists of styrene, <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> and phenylacetaldehyde and a lower pathway which begins with phenylacetic acid. Studies of the repression of styrene degradation by P. putida CA- 3 show that glucose has no effect on the activity of styrene-degrading enzymes.

40|$|In {{the first}} step of the styrene catabolic and {{detoxification}} pathway styrene is transformed to <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> a biochemical alkylating agent and carcinogen. <b>Styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> isomerase [EC 5. 3. 99. 7] performs the critical role of catalyzing the isomerization of <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> to phenylacetaldehyde.

The enzyme was assayed by SDS-PAGE, and its presence was verified by mass spectrometry. An enzyme-coupled assay with phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase was developed to indirectly monitor the activity and kinetically characterize the enzyme.

40|$|Epoxide hydratase was solubilized {{from human}} liver microsomal {{fractions}} and purified {{to an extent}} where the specific activity was 40 -fold {{greater than that of}} the liver homogenate. Combination of homogenate and purified preparation showed that the increase in activity was not due to the removal of an inhibitor. Monosubstituted oxiranes with a lipophilic substituent larger than an ethyl group (isopropyl, t-butyl, n-hexyl, phenyl) readily interacted as substrates or inhibitors with this purified human epoxide hydratase, whereas those with a small substituent (methyl, ethyl, vinyl) were inactive, probably reflecting greater affinity of the former epoxides owing to lipophilic binding sites near the active site of the enzyme. In a series of oxiranes having a lipophilic substituent of sufficient size (<b>styrene</b> <b>oxides),</b> monosubstituted as well as 1, 1 - and cis- 1, 2 -disubstituted oxiranes readily served as substrates or inhibitors of the enzyme, but not the trans- 1, 2 -disubstituted, tri- or tetra-substituted oxiranes. trans-Substitution at the oxirane ring apparently prevents access of the oxirane ring to the active site by steric hindrance. Epoxide hydratase was also solubilized from microsomal fractions of rat and guinea-pig liver and purified by the same procedure. Structural requirements for effective interaction of substrates, inhibitors and activators were qualitatively identical for epoxide hydratase from the three sources. However, several quantitative differences were observed. Thus human hepatic epoxide hydratase seems to be very similar to, although not identical with, the enzyme from guinea pig or rat. Studies with epoxide hydratase from the latter two species therefore appear to be significant with respect to man. In addition, knowledge of structural requirements for epoxides to serve as substrates for human epoxide hydratase may prove useful for drug design. Compounds which need aromatic or olefinic moieties for their desired effect would not be expected to lead to accumulation of epoxides if their structure was such as to allow for a metabolically produced epoxide to be rapidly consumed by epoxide hydratase...|$|R
