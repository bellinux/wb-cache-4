5|$|Harding had <b>spoken</b> <b>out</b> against lynching in his April 1921 {{speech before}} Congress and {{supported}} Congressman Leonidas Dyer's federal anti-lynching bill, which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922.

Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered.|$|E

5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Khan, along with famed comedy group All India Bakchod, will be heading up a campaign against the recently reinstated ban on gay sex in India through a satirical video highlighting ignorance around gay issues. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Khan said: “I’ve always been involved with gay rights. The scenario in this country is disheartening and depressing. These are basic human rights that people are being denied of; they’re no minority. The idea of this initiative is to show those who do not support homosexuality, how ridiculous their thinking is.” Other Bollywood stars have <b>spoken</b> <b>out</b> to condemn the reintroduction of the law.|$|E

5|$|The union between Norway and Sweden, {{imposed by}} the Great Powers in 1814, had been under {{considerable}} strain through the 1890s, the chief issue in question being Norway's rights to its own consular service. Nansen, although not by inclination a politician, had <b>spoken</b> <b>out</b> on the issue on several occasions in defence of Norway's interests. It seemed, early in the 20th century that agreement {{between the two countries}} might be possible, but hopes were dashed when negotiations broke down in February 1905. The Norwegian government fell, and was replaced by one led by Christian Michelsen, whose programme was one of separation from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Allen captained England in the {{remaining}} two Tests against India. The second game was drawn but England won the third and Allen took seven for 80, his best figures in Test matches. In the Tests, Allen scored 27 runs in three innings, and took 20 wickets at 16.50. His good form for Middlesex continued throughout the season and he performed well {{against some of the}} strongest opposition; he topped the county's batting averages and came second in bowling. The MCC team for Australia was chosen in several stages with input from Allen. Larwood was not considered; he had <b>spoken</b> <b>out</b> in the press against Australia and opponents of Bodyline, and like Voce, had not played a Test since the 1932–33 series. The selectors wished to include Voce but Allen at first threatened to resign were he to be included. He met Voce to discuss matters and the latter agreed to sign a statement in which he apologised for the past and in effect promised not to bowl Bodyline. He was therefore named in the touring team.|$|E
5|$|Between 1964 and 1970, Weizsäcker {{served as}} President of the German Evangelical Church Assembly. He {{was also a}} member of the Synod and the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany from 1967–1984.

While this was met by negative reactions from politicians, especially in Weizsäcker's own party, he nevertheless led the Evangelical Church on a way to promoting reconciliation with Poland, leading to a memorandum by the Church in both West and East Germany. The paper was widely discussed and met with a significantly more positive response.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of McKinley's {{election}} in 1896, African Americans were hopeful of progress towards equality. McKinley had <b>spoken</b> <b>out</b> against lynching while governor, and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896. McKinley's priority, however, was in ending sectionalism, and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments. Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low-level government posts, and received some praise for that, the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations. Blanche K. Bruce, an African American who during Reconstruction had served as senator from Mississippi, received the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents. McKinley appointed several black postmasters; however, when Democrats protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of Augusta, Georgia, McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw (he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's death in 1898). The President did appoint George B. Jackson, a former slave, to the post of customs collector in Presidio, Texas. However, African Americans in northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley's victory were overlooked; few were appointed to office.|$|E
5|$|The LCL had governed, {{primarily}} {{under the}} stead of Sir Thomas Playford, for 32 years, and finally lost to Labor in 1965. A {{year and a}} half later, when Playford retired, Steele Hall was elected to replace him. A young farmer from a rural constituency, Hall had never conflicted with the party line, and was expected to uphold the existing LCL principles, having <b>spoken</b> <b>out</b> in support of the Playmander and the restrictive Legislative Council before. However, when the LCL was returned to office in 1968 under his leadership, with the help of malapportionment, Hall was under pressure. Labor had led the LCL 52.0 to 43.8% on primary votes, but owing to the Playmander, both ended with 19 seats and an independent supported the LCL and returned them to power. Large protests against the Playmander broke out, and there were strong calls for reform.|$|E
