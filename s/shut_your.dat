25|$|I {{afterwards}} travelled {{much with}} him, and have now only {{to speak of}} him with great respect, or, I ought to say, with admiration... No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only <b>shut</b> <b>your</b> eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E

6000|$|... 1. Take heed of over-looking, or of <b>shutting</b> <b>your</b> eyes {{upon your}} own guilt: 'He that covereth his sins, shall not prosper.' It is {{incident}} to some men, {{when they find}} repentance is far from them, to shut their eyes upon their own guilt, and to please themselves with such notions of deliverance from present troubles, as will stand with that course of sin which is got into their families, persons, and professions, and with a state of impenitence: But I advise you to take heed of this.|$|R

60|$|When {{this man}} {{began to talk}} I {{perceived}} in him a certain power. His voice was a persuasive instrument, upon which he played with a somewhat specious but effective art.
