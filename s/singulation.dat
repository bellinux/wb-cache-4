50|$|In the {{manufacturing}} of micro-electronic devices, die cutting, dicing or <b>singulation</b> {{is a process}} of reducing a wafer containing multiple identical integrated circuits to individual dies each containing one of those circuits.|$|E
50|$|When all {{the tags}} {{cooperate}} with the tag reader and follow the same anti-collision protocol, also called <b>singulation</b> protocol,then the tag reader can read data from each and every tag without interference from the other tags.|$|E
50|$|<b>Singulation</b> is {{a method}} by which an RFID reader {{identifies}} a tag with a specific serial number {{from a number of}} tags in its field. This is necessary because if multiple tags respond simultaneously to a query, they will jam each other. In a typical commercial application, such as scanning a bag of groceries, potentially hundreds of tags might be within range of the reader.|$|E
50|$|The {{size of the}} die left on {{the tape}} may range from 35 mm (very large) to 0.1 mm square (very small). The die created may be any shape {{generated}} by straight lines, but they are typically rectangular or square-shaped.

50|$|The 1-wire bus {{enumeration}} protocol (described later), {{like other}} <b>singulation</b> protocols, is an algorithm the master uses {{to read the}} address of every device on the bus. Since the address includes the device type and a CRC, recovering the address roster also produces a reliable inventory of the devices on the bus. The 64-bit address space is searched as a binary tree, allowing up to 75 devices to be found per second.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{method is}} laser re-balling. Here the stencil is {{programmed}} into the re-balling unit. A bondhead (looks like a tube/needle) is automatically loaded with one tin ball from a solder ball <b>singulation</b> tank. The ball is then heated by a laser, {{such that the}} tin-solder ball becomes fluid and flows onto the cleaned chip. Instantly after melting the ball the laser turns off and a new ball falls into the bondhead. While reloading the bondhead of the re-balling unit changes the position to the next pin.|$|E
50|$|This simple {{protocol}} leaks considerable information, because anyone able {{to eavesdrop}} on the tag reader alone can determine {{all but the}} last bit of a tag's serial number. Thus a tag can be (largely) identified so long as the reader's signal is receivable, which is usually possible at much greater distance than simply reading a tag directly. Because of privacy and security concerns related to this, the Auto-ID Labs have developed two more advanced <b>singulation</b> protocols, called Class 0 UHF and Class 1 UHF, which are intended to be resistant to these sorts of attacks. These protocols, which are based on tree-walking but include other elements, have a performance of up to 1000 tags per second.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{different}} methods of <b>singulation,</b> {{but the most}} common is [...] "tree walking", which involves asking all tags with a serial number that starts with either a 1 or 0 to respond. If more than one responds, the reader might ask for all tags with a serial number that starts with 01 to respond, and then 010. It keeps doing this until it finds the tag it is looking for. Note that if the reader has {{some idea of what}} tags it wishes to interrogate, it can considerably optimise the search order. For example with some designs of tags, if a reader already suspects certain tags to be present then those tags can be instructed to remain silent, then tree walked without interference from them, and then finally they can be queried individually.|$|E
50|$|Multiple-tag {{identification}} {{is performed using}} a combination of frequency-division multiple access and time-division multiple access (FTDMA). There are eight reply channels available for tags to use. In response to a valid command each tag randomly selects a channel on which to transmit its reply. The reply is transmitted once using the selected channel. Upon receiving the next valid command each tag randomly selects a new channel and transmits the reply using the newly selected channel. This method of reply frequency hopping using random channel selection is repeated for each subsequent valid command. The interrogator can selectively mute identified tags to remove them from the identification process. When a tag is muted, the tag will not transmit any replies. In addition to random channel selection the tags can randomly mute individual replies. When a reply is muted, the tag will not transmit that reply. Random muting is necessary when identifying very large populations of tags during <b>singulation.</b> All FTDMA frequency and time parameters are defined by the command.|$|E
50|$|The first offered <b>singulation</b> {{protocol}} is the ALOHA protocol, originally used {{decades ago}} in ALOHAnet and {{very similar to}} CSMA/CD used by Ethernet. These protocols are mainly used in HF tags. In ALOHA, tags detect when a collision has occurred, and attempt to resend after waiting a random interval. The performance of such collide-and-resend protocols is approximately doubled if transmissions are synchronised to particular time-slots, and in this application time-slots for the tags are readily provided for by the reader. ALOHA does not leak information like the tree-walking protocol, and is much less vulnerable to blocker tags, which {{would need to be}} active devices with much higher power handling capabilities in order to work. However when the reader field is densely populated, ALOHA may make much less efficient use of available bandwidth than optimised versions of tree-walking. In the worst case, an ALOHA protocol network can reach a state of congestion collapse. The Auto-ID consortium is attempting to standardise a version of an ALOHA protocol which it calls Class 0 HF. This has a performance of up to 200 tags per second.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — RFID {{has been}} the subject of much {{research}} recently, which yielded very efficient <b>singulation</b> algorithms, such as Tree Walking Algorithms [4], [5] or framed slotted Aloha [6]. However, there is still room for improvement in the case of multiple readers, and also in the power efficiency of <b>singulation</b> algorithms. This paper addresses two schemes that might improve energy consumption and <b>singulation</b> time in RFID systems. First, we consider expanding horizon, a form of power control at the reader introduced in [3], and see how it impacts the energy consumption and <b>singulation</b> time in the case of a single reader. Then, we study the importance of the capture effect in the multiple readers case, and present an alternative to TDMA scheme, which greatly reduces the <b>singulation</b> time in our simulations...|$|E

We present a framework for interactive <b>singulation</b> of individual items from a pile. The proposed framework provides an overall approach for tasks involving operation on multiple objects, such as counting, arranging, or sorting items in a pile. A perception module combined with pushing actions accumulates evidence of singulated items over multiple pile interactions. A decision module scores {{the likelihood of a}} single-item pile to a multiple-item pile based on the magnitude of motion and matching determined from the perception module. Three variations of the <b>singulation</b> framework were evaluated on a physical robot for an arrangement task.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} novel method for a robot to {{separate}} and segment objects in a cluttered tabletop environment. The method leverages {{the fact that}} external object boundaries produce visible edges within an object cluster. We achieve this <b>singulation</b> of objects by using the robot arm to perform pushing actions specifically selected to test whether particular visible edges correspond to object boundaries. We verify the separation of objects after a push by examining the clusters formed by geometric segmentation of regions residing on the table surface. To avoid explicitly representing and tracking edges across push behaviors we aggregate over all edges in a given orientation by representing the push-history as an orientation histogram. By tracking the history of directions pushed for each object cluster we can build evidence that a cluster cannot be further separated. We present quantitative and qualitative experimental results performed in a real home environment by a mobile manipulator using input from an RGB-D camera mounted on the robot’s head. We show that our pushing strategy can more reliably obtain <b>singulation</b> in fewer pushes than an approach, that does not explicitly reason about boundary information. I...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{is a field}} devoted to the design and creation of replacement tissues with {{the ultimate goal of}} one day providing replacement organs. Traditional strategies to accomplish this through the bulk seeding of cells onto a single monolithic porous bio-scaffold are unable to realise a precise architecture, thus the inability to mimic the cells natural micro-environment found within the body. Bio-printing approaches are {{the current state of the}} art with the ability to accurately mimic the complex 3 D hierarchical structure of tissue. However, a functional construct also requires high strength to provide adequate support in load bearing applications such as bone and cartilage tissue engineering, and to maintain the open geometry of a large intricate channel network, which is crucial for the transport of nutrients and wastes. Typical approaches utilise materials which have processing parameters more amendable for cell incorporation, thus they can be simultaneously deposited with scaffolding material. However, the resulting construct is typically of low strength. This thesis explores the automation of a printing and “tissue assembly” process with the ability to incorporate delicate cell aggregates or spheroids within a high strength bio-scaffold requiring harsh processing parameters, at precise locations. The 3 D printed bio-scaffold has a lattice architecture which enables a frictional fit to be formed between the particle and scaffold, thus preventing egress. To achieve this the pore must be expanded before the delivery of a single 1 mm particle. Novel subsystems were developed to automate this process and provide the ability to achieve scalable, flexible, complex constructs with accurate architecture. A system architecture employing the benefits of modularity was devised. The main subsystems developed were the <b>singulation</b> device, to ensure the separation of a single particle; the injection device, to deliver and seed particles into the scaffold, and the control system, to facilitate the operation of the devices. Three generations of <b>singulation</b> devices have been developed ranging from mechanical to fluid manipulation methods alone. The first prototype utilised mechanical methods, with simple control methods. However the inability to correctly position the lead particle within the <b>singulation</b> chamber, resulted in damage to the test alginate particles. In the second prototype a fully fluidics based device utilised two trapping sites to capture the leading particles. <b>Singulation</b> success rates of up to 88 % was achieved. Higher rates were limited by the trapped particle’s interaction with the lagging particles during capture. In a similar concept to the second prototype, the third prototype utilised only a single trapped particle, and achieved much higher throughput, and 100 % <b>singulation</b> accuracy. The injection device, utilised a conical expanding rod within a thin outer sheath. It was able to expand the pore, with minimal damage to the scaffold, providing an unobstructed path for the delivery of the particle into the pore. A decentralised control system was devised to integrate the process operation for the electro-mechanical devices. Separate microcontrollers were able to sense, interact and communicate with one another, and the master control PC, to execute specific tasks to automate the process. The development of systems to automate the process has addressed the ability to accurately incorporate delicate cells with a high strength bio-scaffold, and will enable the realisation and investigation of intricate complex constructs, unachievable with current manual processes. Thus features found within the body may be more closely mimicked and functionalised, which may provide the necessary signals, micro-environment and infrastructure to correctly regulate the formation of complex functional tissue, supported by the adequate mass transport of nutrients and wastes. This may one day lead to 3 D printing or assembly of viable replacement tissue, accurate in vitro model systems for laboratory testing, or even whole organs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of singu-lation in the context of robotic bin-picking applications, which {{involves}} grasping and tangle-free extraction of only one part at a time from a bin of randomized parts.

40|$|Abstract – We {{describe}} a new control method for vibrationsbased planar manipulation. We’ve developed a device – the Universal Planar Manipulator (UPM) – {{based on a}} single, horizontally-vibrating plate. Though minimalist in construction (one moving part), the UPM can manipulate several parts on its surface in parallel, simply using friction. Previously, we’ve shown that a sequence of rigid plate rotations can be computed which produces pre-specified part displacements. Here we present a new method based on a special motion primitive – the “jet ” – which displaces a chosen part in a desired direction while keeping all others still. A jet allows one to say: “c’mon part, do a local motion”. Parallel manipulation then reduces to a round-robin application of jets. This technique is both faster and more robust than the old rotations-based method. Experiments on parallel trajectory following and part sorting are presented.
