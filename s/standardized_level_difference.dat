40|$|AbstractWorking in {{an office}} {{environment}} entails various activities. Communication on the phone, social interaction and meetings produce not only sound, but are also {{in need of a}} good speech intelligibility and therefore in need of good room acoustics. Difficult performance tasks are in need of different acoustic conditions. Areas with a more silent environment are needed with a minimised level of distraction from surrounding activities. Areas {{with a high level of}} interaction provide workspace for the purpose of teamwork. Different activities require unique acoustic conditions. Before creating a new activity based design in retrofit buildings, the existing acoustic environment is carefully measured. The acoustic qualities of the existing facilities as well as the actual behaviour of the existing population of the building are both measured. The sound insulation of the existing walls is defined as A-weighted <b>standardized</b> <b>level</b> <b>difference</b> DnT,A, measured according to the Dutch norm NEN 5077 (similar to ISO 140 - 4). The room acoustic parameters are defined by the reverberation time T, measured according to ISO 3382, and the spatial decay rate of A-weighted SPL of speech D 2,S measured according to the norm ISO 3382 - 3 for room acoustics in open plan offices. The level of speech privacy is interpreted out of the combination of A- weighted sound pressure levels of speech Lp,A,S and the average A-weighted background noise level Lp,A,B per position. During a representative week of working hours the sound levels are being measured on different locations in the open plan office. The sound levels are measured in equivalent sound levels Leq, 5 min and maximum sound levels Lmax, 5 min. To gather information about the character of the sound, sound fragments are also recorded based on a trigger level. Defining the acoustic environment of (semi-) open plan offices based on building measurements and noise level measurements produces a solid foundation for designing a more sustainable office environment. Often the new design leads to activity based office plans where diverse activities are projected in a (semi-) open plan office. This is illustrated with a practical example of an engineering project...|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} {{defining a}} common acoustic classification scheme for dwellings is under development by ISO TC 42 /SC 2 /WG 29 {{based on the}} outcomes of European project COST Action TU 0901. The proposal stands {{on the assumption that}} in the long term many countries will establish building acoustic requirements using a harmonized set of descriptors, and the hypothesis of an extended low frequency range for airborne sound insulation evaluation is considered. In this scenario most countries will need to estimate the influence on their current airborne sound insulation requirements due to the new descriptor. This can better be evaluated if translation equations between existing and new proposed descriptors can be used. This paper initially evaluates the adequacy of performing such translations based on the geometrical relation between the sound reduction index R and the <b>standardized</b> <b>level</b> <b>difference</b> DnT. This procedure is shown to be acceptable when both descriptors (original and translated) use the same assessment frequency range. For the cases where a different assessment frequency range is considered, a different approach is studied. The paper investigates a statistical method to obtain translation equations between existing and proposed descriptors, based on the analysis of a significant set of in-situ measurements. Several translation equations are proposed, and the effect of the frequency range extension on such translations is studied for two typical building systems such as heavy and lightweight walls. Results show that, although it is possible to propose a single translation equation for each existent descriptor, in some cases the spread around the proposed translation line is significant. It is also observed that the effect of building system is more noticeable if different frequency range descriptors are involved in the translation. This points out the difficulty of obtaining a unique translation equation independent of the building type when the descriptors’ assessment frequency range is not the same. For some existent descriptors, the obtained translation is compared with the theoretical method proposed within the findings of COST TU 0901. When considering only lightweight walls or the full data set, there is no good agreement between both methods, but for heavyweight walls they converge. Existing requirements in thirty-two countries have been translated into the proposed descriptor DnT, 50 ≈ DnT,w + C 50 – 3150 using the obtained equations. This provides valuable information and an insight for government and building regulation policy makers when updating their legislation...|$|E

Significant acoustic objective parameters are used and logically weighted (after analysis of questionnaires and interviews for subjective responses of visitors) to find a representative unique index of evaluation of a room, the IAQM (Index of Acoustic Quality in Museums) rated on a scale from 0 (worst) to 20 (best).

40|$|<b>Level</b> <b>differences</b> at equal {{loudness}} between band-pass {{noise and}} pure tones with a frequency {{equal to the}} center frequency of the noise were measured in normal-hearing listeners using a loudness matching procedure. The center frequencies were 750, 1500, and 3000 Hz and noise bandwidths from 5 to 1620 Hz were used. The level of the reference pure tone was 30, 50, or 70 dB. For all center frequencies and reference levels, the level at equal loudness was close to 0 dB for the narrowest bandwidth, increased with bandwidth for bandwidths smaller than the critical bandwidth, and decreased for bandwidths larger than the critical bandwidth. For bandwidths considerably larger than the critical bandwidth, the <b>level</b> <b>difference</b> was negative. The maximum positive <b>level</b> <b>difference</b> was measured for a bandwidth close to the critical bandwidth.
