2500|$|Generally, a rudder is [...] "part of the <b>steering</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{of a boat}} or {{ship that}} is {{fastened}} outside the hull", that is denoting all different types of oars, paddles, and rudders. More specifically, the steering gear of ancient vessels can be classified into side-rudders and stern-mounted rudders, depending on their location on the ship. A third term, steering oar, can denote both types. In a Mediterranean context, side-rudders are more specifically called quarter-rudders as the later term designates more exactly {{the place where the}} rudder was mounted. Stern-mounted rudders are uniformly suspended {{at the back of the}} ship in a central position.|$|E

The Louisiana Democrat newspaper of Alexandria, Louisiana, reported on July 11, 1885, that Myers had obtained several patents pertaining to passenger balloons. Some in particular described were guiding and <b>steering</b> <b>apparatuses</b> for passenger balloons. These were rudder and steering devices consisting of collapsical parts {{that could be}} opened and exposed to the air currents for navigation. Myers had used her inventions in over 150 flights she did.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, Shelburne Museum {{purchased}} the fifty-ton jail {{from the town}} of Castleton for one dollar per ton. Only the roof and gable ends were removed for the journey of 64 mi to Shelburne. Special dollies with twenty-four rubber-tired wheels were built to carry the basic structure and demanded additional <b>steering</b> <b>apparatuses</b> and four sets of brakes to maintain control on steep hills. The move, aided by the Vermont State Police, required three days at speeds varying from up to 7 mph. The most difficult obstacle was the Vergennes underpass of the Rutland Railroad, where the clearance was only five inches.|$|R
40|$|The {{submitted}} paper investigates {{possibilities of}} applying work methods of project management in marketing and in corporate logistics. All three disciplines {{can be considered}} fundamental methodological tools and managerial techniques. Their proper and well-considered incorporation and application both {{in the sense of}} institutionalization into the <b>steering</b> structure and <b>apparatus</b> and in instrumental terms, i. e. in the processes of direct management and in the processes of strategic, medium-term and operative planning consequently find their place and application in more generally comprehended corporate management. Each of these disciplines has naturally a different specialization, a different internal structure of partial tools and techniques and hence also different objectives and principles of application. A unifying element is only their utility application value consisting in possibilities of reaching the economic (in partial effects financial, turnover, time) effect. The effect is then derived from well-considered and very well organized preparation processes of implementation and capitalization, partial operations and related measures. Goal of the work was to describe and characterize philosophy of these management tools, functional structure and principles of applications, to find, define and describe their marginal and/or binding points or positions and to reveal possibilities when the Project Management can be applied with the remaining two disciplines as a supporting element or at least a descriptive analytical method within the framework of initial preparations for implementation of marketing or logistic objectives. Project Management is in this descriptive evaluation given first of all a supporting role of superstructure...|$|R

60|$|Most {{persons who}} have crossed from Dover to Calais, or vice versa, by the Calais-Douvre mail packet, will bear witness both to the comfort and speed of that vessel. Up to this she has proved the most perfect form of steam-ship yet {{constructed}} for the purpose required. The Calais-Douvre is built somewhat upon the same principle as the Castalia, but differs from that vessel in that whereas the latter was two half-ships joined together, each twin-portion of the Calais-Douvre is a perfect ship in itself. The result has been, that while the Castalia was a failure, the Calais-Douvre has proved a distinct success. She is three hundred feet in length and sixty feet in breadth; her tonnage is two thousand, and her water-draught only six feet, {{so that she can}} enter Calais Harbour at even a low tide. Two transverse iron girder bulk-heads unite the two hulls of the vessel; and her <b>steering</b> <b>apparatus</b> is so simple, {{and at the same time}} so effective in construction, that one wheel is usually sufficient to work it. She makes the passage from Dover to Calais usually in an hour and a half; but in very fine weather we ourselves have crossed in less than that time. With the maximum rate of speed, the Calais-Douvre has attained the minimum amount of pitching and rolling yet secured by any Channel boat. Her saloons, cabins, and decks are spacious and handsomely appointed, so that the Channel passage in this vessel is made under as favourable conditions for bad sailors as any sea-passage can be.|$|E
40|$|The present {{volume on}} the Fauna of the USSR deals with birds of the {{suborder}} Alcae and has appeared after a considerable interval. Like the four preceding parts (published between 1937 and 1947 and devoted {{to the study of}} birds) it is based mainly on investigations of collected material kept at the Zoological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR* (referred to in the text both as ZIN AN or the Zoological Institute). The various chapters of the book are written in the same order as are the previous parts. With respect to individual features, considerably more attention is paid to functional- morphological analysis as well as to a more elaborate characterization of species; the plumage is also described in greater detail with regard to seasonal changes and age differences. The attached bibliography, though not complete, nevertheless contains the most important works on the subject. The photographs were provided by K. A. Yudin and the drawings prepared by N. N. Kondakov and V. S. Rozhdestvenskaya. To the suborder Alcae belong sea birds which are closely related to gulls but are adapted to aquatic conditions to a much greater extent and are less associated with terrestrial and aerial life. Alcae, which feed exclusively on pelagic animals and predominantly on fish, have become highly specialized in swimming, diving and moving swiftly under water by means of their wings. This is extremely useful for catching prey. Adaptation to underwater swimming brought about some essential structural modifications in the Alcae during the formative period of the group, particularly in the structure and distribution of the feather cover, the morphology of almost every skeletal part, and in certain muscular systems and internal organs. Alcae have streamlined bodies [...] narrow and elongated; the wings are short and generally narrow. These features greatly facilitate underwater movement in a relatively dense medium. The tail is short (Figure 1). In flight and diving the legs are stretched backward and function as <b>steering</b> and brake <b>apparatus,</b> thus compensating to some extent for the shortness of the tail feathers. The three front toes (especially the middle one) are comparatively long and are united by swimming membranes, which reach the front edges of the distal phalanges or half of the toe length; the hind toe is either absent or rudimentary.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{feasibility}} study of a special electric traction wheel-set for a micro-car for disabled customers. In our university department some solutions on the topic had already been developed in the past. The design has not been carried out in a sequential way, {{but it has been}} lead in “concurrent-engineering” style and it has been speeded up thanks to the employment of solid modelling. The 3 D design technology has helped in a very efficient way {{to take into account the}} impact of any modification on any component to the neighbouring items. The following topics have been considered: design for disabled customers, maximum ease of use and low cost technology. This job therefore has coped the main problems related to designing a new car. Some innovative solutions have been proposed and an overall design procedure has been experienced. This paper in particular describes the results of a research activity connected with the study of the general lay-out of such a wheel set. Some different configurations were explored, each showing its strong and weak points. It is to point out that, while the traditional arrangements connected with gasoline or diesel engines were hugely studied, with the electric traction all the wheel sets must be reshaped. In fact too many car designers tend to use the same lay-out used before, wasting much of the potential advantages offered by electric motors. During this study some radically new designs were explored, for example not using any live axle for transmission or trying to use thrust ball bearing for steering axles. In the following a gallery of proposed and studied solutions will be exposed, showing the most characteristic points. We developed the study and design phases starting from some specifications: the group must be composed by electric motor (geared or not), brake, wheel hub, front or rear traction, in case of front traction the group must have steering pivots (attachments for <b>steering</b> rods). This <b>apparatus</b> has been designed to be used in a light car (which is under development in our faculty). However the proposed design may fit even standard city cars. Design goals were: 1) Keeping very low steering radius (intended use in city environment) 2) Absence of traditional suspension system (our light car has some innovative design in this) 3) Respect of Ackermann geometry. Some different design solution have been developed and are exposed in the paper. The most relevant feature is that every wheel has its own motor, so achieving a dramatic reduction in encumbrance...|$|R
60|$|The sea {{was running}} {{high and the}} storm increasing. It was growing late, too--three or four in the afternoon. Whether to venture toward the {{mainland}} or not, {{was a question of}} some moment. But we were so distressed by thirst that we decide to try it, and so Higbie fell to work and I took the steering-oar. When we had pulled a mile, laboriously, we were evidently in serious peril, for the storm had greatly augmented; the billows ran very high and were capped with foaming crests, the heavens were hung with black, and the wind blew with great fury. We would have gone back, now, but we did not dare to turn the boat around, because as soon as she got in the trough of the sea she would upset, of course. Our only hope lay in keeping her head-on to the seas. It was hard work to do this, she plunged so, and so beat and belabored the billows with her rising and falling bows. Now and then one of Higbie's oars would trip {{on the top of a}} wave, and the other one would snatch the boat half around in spite of my cumbersome <b>steering</b> <b>apparatus.</b> We were drenched by the sprays constantly, and the boat occasionally shipped water. By and by, powerful as my comrade was, his great exertions began to tell on him, and he was anxious that I should change places with him till he could rest a little. But I told him this was impossible; for if the steering oar were dropped a moment while we changed, the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea, capsize, and in less than five minutes we would have a hundred gallons of soap-suds in us and be eaten up so quickly that we could not even be present at our own inquest.|$|E

The main deck, on which the guns are fought, is thus protected throughout the entire length, but the extremities 'between wind and water' are quite as unprotected as those on the Warrior".|$|E
50|$|The General Butler was {{a hybrid}} vessel, capable of {{navigating}} both {{the waters of}} Lake Champlain and the Champlain Canal. She was 88 ft long, with a beam of 14 ft and a hold depth of 6 ft. She was built using chine log construction from maple and oak. Since she was used in relatively calm waters, she had a shortened keel, and was fitted with a two-mast schooner sailing rig. She was built in 1862 by the Hoskins and Ross Shipyard of Essex, New York, {{and was one of}} the first ships built after the locks of the Champlain Canal were enlarged. In her 15-year career she had three owners. William Montgomery, the final owner, was a known risk-taker, and was carrying a load of marble from Isle La Motte to Burlington on December 9, 1876. During bad weather, her <b>steering</b> <b>apparatus</b> failed, and she struck the Burlington Breakwater while trying to round its southern end.
