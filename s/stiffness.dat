5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively.

25|$|The {{finite element}} method approximates a {{structure}} as an assembly of elements or components with various forms of connection between them and each element of which has an associated <b>stiffness.</b> Thus, a continuous system such as a plate or shell is modeled as a discrete system with {{a finite number of}} elements interconnected at finite number of nodes and the overall <b>stiffness</b> {{is the result of the}} addition of the <b>stiffness</b> of the various elements. The behaviour of individual elements is characterized by the element's <b>stiffness</b> (or flexibility) relation. The assemblage of the various stiffness's into a master <b>stiffness</b> matrix that represents the entire structure leads to the system's <b>stiffness</b> or flexibility relation.

40|$|Thirty-six, four-point flexure {{tests on}} simply {{supported}} pultruded glass fibre reinforced polymer composite (GFRP) Wide Flange (WF) beams with mid-span bolted splice joints are described. The joints were fabricated with two and six pultruded GFRP splice plates. Three splice plate lengths were investigated and two bolt torques {{were used to}} tighten the bolts. Each of the twelve splice joint combinations was subjected to three repeat tests up to the serviceability deflection limit. Their load versus deformation responses were shown to be linear and repeatable. During each test loads, support rotations, splice joint end rotations and mid-span surface strains were recorded for each mid-span deflection increment. The beams’ transverse <b>stiffnesses</b> and splice joints’ rotational <b>stiffnesses</b> were derived from the test data. The variation of the <b>stiffnesses</b> with splice plate length, number of splice plates and bolt torque was also quantified.
