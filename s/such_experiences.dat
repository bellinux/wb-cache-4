According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency).

5|$|Dr. Caligari is not {{the only}} symbol of arrogant {{authority}} in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare {{can be seen as a}} rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to <b>such</b> <b>experiences</b> as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.|$|E

25|$|Ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{have been in}} {{dialogue}} for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting {{with the natural world}} may be, and as much as <b>such</b> <b>experiences</b> should be encouraged, some have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to the dominant culture than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan. Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture. The resulting attempt to rethink our relationship to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and scientism, and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike. Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity. It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate ways of knowing the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem to be talking about experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a long-standing}} notion that {{epilepsy}} and religion are linked, {{and it has}} been speculated that many religious figures had temporal lobe epilepsy.

500|$|Despite a {{demonstrated}} {{appearance of}} blunted affect, recent {{findings indicate that}} many individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia are emotionally responsive, particularly to stressful or negative stimuli, and that such sensitivity may cause vulnerability to symptoms or to the disorder.

The use of [...] "safety behaviors" [...] (acts such as gestures or the use of words in specific contexts) to avoid or neutralize imagined threats may actually contribute to the chronicity of delusions.

40|$|Objectives: To {{comprehensively}} {{examine the}} relationship between current sleep duration and past suicidal idea or attempt among Korean adolescents. Methods: Data came from the 2009 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey with 75 066 participants (with the participation rate of 97. 6 %) in 800 middle and high schools. Binary logistic regression was conducted by gender and depressed mood to identify signifi-cant factors for suicidal ideation/attempt. The dependent variable was the log odds of suicidal ideation/attempt, while the indepen-dent/control variables were sleep duration and other demographic, socio-economic and health-related factors. Results: A negative association between sleep duration and suicidal ideation or attempt was weaker for those with depressed mood than for those without <b>such</b> <b>experience</b> in Korea for Year 2009. The odds ratio of suicidal ideation/attempt regarding less than 4 hours of sleep compared to 6 to 7 hours of sleep, was smaller in a group with depressed mood than in a group without <b>such</b> <b>experience,</b> for example, 1. 64 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 29 to 2. 08) vs. 2. 06 (95 % CI, 1. 34 to 3. 17) for men’s suicidal ideation, 2. 50 (95 % CI, 1. 69 to 3. 69) vs. 3. 89 (95 % CI, 1. 74 to 8. 66) for men’s suicidal attempt.
