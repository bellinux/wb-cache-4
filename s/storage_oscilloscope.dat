50|$|In late 2008, HAMEG {{introduced}} the first purely digital oscilloscope with TFT monitor at the electronica electronics trade fair in Munich, Germany.

For instruments with TFT monitors, HAMEG skipped the entire generation of the classical, purely digital <b>storage</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> (DSO) without MSO functions. By 2012, HAMEG had developed a product range of 11 MSO instruments and one analog oscilloscope. In autumn of 2012, HAMEG announced intentions to soon discontinue production of analog oscilloscopes. Allegedly, this decision was partly due to obstacles in sourcing cathode ray tubes. In February 2013, HAMEG introduced {{a new series of}} mixed-signal oscilloscopes with up to 500 MHz bandwidth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€“In this paper, {{the effects}} of {{sampling}} upon rise time measurements with a digital oscilloscope are considered. In particular, the use of linear interpolation for estimating signal rise times is discussed, and its effects are analyzed for various step signals. A simple expression is derived, which accurately models the sampling and linear interpolation contributions to the overall rise time measurement error. Using these results, a correction formula is proposed, and its applicability is discussed. Digital <b>Storage</b> <b>Oscilloscopes</b> (DSOs) are nowadays widely used in many measurement processes, often replacing analog ones. Such devices, after conditioning and A/D converting the input signal, perform most measuring processing into the digital domain, thus offering high and reproducible performances.

5000|$|The {{storage is}} {{accomplished}} using {{the principle of}} secondary emission. When the ordinary writing electron beam passes a point on the phosphor surface, {{not only does it}} momentarily cause the phosphor to illuminate, but the kinetic energy of the electron beam knocks other electrons loose from the phosphor surface. This can leave a net positive charge. <b>Storage</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> then provide one or more secondary electron guns (called the [...] "flood guns") that provide a steady flood of low-energy electrons traveling towards the phosphor screen. Flood guns cover the entire screen, ideally uniformly. The electrons from the flood guns are more strongly drawn to the areas of the phosphor screen where the writing gun has left a net positive charge; in this way, the electrons from the flood guns re-illuminate the phosphor in these positively charged areas of the phosphor screen.|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{information}} security risks in networkable Windows-based operating system (NWOS) devices. While these devices {{face the same}} {{information security}} risks as any other windows platform, NWOS devices present additional challenges to vendors and buyers throughout the product lifecycle.

Based on evidence collected from a manufacturer of Digital <b>Storage</b> <b>Oscilloscopes,</b> the paper offers a set of challenges faced and solution applied by this vendor in its interactions with buyers. In {{order to reduce the}} vulnerability of NWOS devices, the paper considers several information security measures for the production, sales and after-sales phases.

Digital <b>Storage</b> <b>Oscilloscopes</b> (DSO) is used these days for acquisition and display of routine signals. This instrument, found in every measurement laboratory, though potent in displaying simple periodic waveforms like sinusoids fails when frequency-varying time signals are applied. This problem surfaces because the underlying technique of oscilloscope used to trigger the waveform does not acquiesce with complex signals like chirp. Ready {{solution to this problem}} is the mixed signal oscilloscope. This is a costly solution and small laboratories cannot afford to have the costly instruments. In this paper, a cost effective DAQ card based mixed signal virtual oscilloscope is proposed to study the complex signals. An intelligent technique, Weighted Hamming Distance (WHD) algorithm was used to accurately trigger the complex waveforms. Also for frequency domain analysis, Joint Time Frequency Analysis (JTFA) techniques were used. A LabVIEWTM based virtual instrument was designed and developed with a capability to acquire, display and analyze the triggered signal. The integrated programming language LabVIEWTM was chosen as it offers many simple ready to use functions. In a way the proposal offers a cost effective, fast and flexible solution to treat the complex signals. The need to create such solutions is the consequence of costly hardware systems.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Abstract: Various {{applications}} like wireless UWB communication, fast {{data acquisition}} systems and digital <b>storage</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> needs ADCs with instantaneous input signal bandwidth from 0. 1 - 40 GigaHertz range with 6 - 10 bits of resolution [...] a challenging task and an impressive goal to achieve. Flash ADCs have been conventionally employed {{to achieve these}} goals but have been proved to be power hungry and ineffective for higher resolution. Time-interleaved converters are another option that relax the device speed and circuit complexity. Current research shows that at high input frequencies in the MultiGigaHertz range, the performance of these time-interleaved high speed ADCs is limited mainly by the sampling clock jitter. In this work, the effect of clock jitter on the data acquisition for a sampled data system is analyzed and discussed. Under the premise that, for a given jitter specification, it {{is relatively easy to}} generate a clean high frequency sinusoidal signal than a high frequency squarewave signal, this proposed work makes use of a clean sinusoid as the sampling clock. This high frequency sinusoidal clock, embedded with low frequency squarewave clocks, is employed in a proposed bottom plate sampling Track-and-Hold (T/H) architecture with the aim of improving the SNR at multi-GigaHertz frequencies. A comparative study on the performance of this T/H circuit (SNDR,ENOB) for sinusoidal sampling and conventional squarewave sampling is presented. The work concludes that for high frequency sampled data acquisition system, where sampling clock with sub- 1 ps jitter values are needed, the presented scheme of sinusoidal sampling is advantageous for reducing sampling clock uncertainty when compared against the conventional squarewave sampling technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the nanotechnology zener diode quantum detector effect for gravitational waves is reported, based upon the quantum to classical transition being induced by dynamical 3 -space fluctuations. Gravitational waves were detected by way of waveform correlations between time measurement in two Digital <b>Storage</b> <b>Oscilloscopes,</b> revealing time delays of 13 to 20 seconds over 24 hrs for Adelaide to London travel, varying as the earth rotates. The speed and direction were found, for January 1, 2013, to be 512 km/s, RA = 4. 8 hrs, Dec = 83 deg S. This velocity agrees with previous detections using different techniques, such as the NASA spacecraft Earth-flyby Doppler shifts, which found 491 km/s, RA = 5. 2 hrs, Dec = 80 deg S, for December 8, 1992. Consequently it was realised that nanotechnology zener diode quantum detectors have been operating, for different reasons, for some 15 years, and are known as RNGs (Random Number Generators) or REGs (Random Event Generators). The discovery herein reveals {{that they are not}} random. Correlations between data from a REG in Perth and a REG in London gave the speed and direction, for January 1, 2013, to be 528 km/s, RA = 5. 3 hrs, Dec = 81 deg S. We also report highly correlated current fluctuations from collocated zener diode circuits. The GCP REG network constitutes an international gravitational wave detector network, with currently some 60 REGs operating, and with records going back to 1998. These detectors permit the study of dynamical 3 -space structure, and also apparent anomalous scattering of the waves when passing deeper into the earth, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, earthquakes, and correlations with fluctuations in various rate processes such as nuclear decays. The quantum to classical transition is shown to be caused by 3 -space dynamics, and so challenges the standard interpretation of probabilities in quantum theory...|$|R
