5|$|As Emma {{arrives at}} Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she {{is given a}} key to her room by the elderly {{proprietor}} (Beverley Elliot), who is actually Granny from Little Red Riding Hood. She comes downstairs after yelling at Ruby (Meghan Ory), her granddaughter, followed {{by a man who}} came to collect money: Mr. Gold (Carlyle), Rumpelstiltskin who also helped build and owns the entire town. When Emma mentions her name, Mr. Gold pauses as if he knew <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> Emma's decision to stay in Storybrooke causes the hands of the town clock, previously frozen at 8:15, to begin moving again, indicating that the Dark Curse is beginning to weaken.|$|E

500|$|At school, Ripley enjoyed drama lessons, {{spurred on by}} the {{positive}} remarks she received from her drama teacher Susan Ford. She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and she was really brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change your life. You always remember them. There was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> She basically made me feel very good about myself as a 15-year-old girl." [...] Abandoning her childhood ambition to become a nurse, Ripley decided to go into acting.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{is widely}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the finest actresses of her generation and one of Britain's best-known actresses, accepted in Hollywood. Early in her career, when she was closely associated with her first husband Kenneth Branagh, she was somewhat unpopular and considered a [...] "". The public warmed to her after the separation, and she became one of the key actresses of the 1990s. Her status has continued to grow; in 2008, journalist Sarah Sands stated that Thompson has improved with age and experience, and Mark Kermode said of her performances, [...] "There is <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> which is— you just trust her. You just think 'I'm in proper hands here.' ... She's up there with the great, I mean really great, British female performers".|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} {{thousand}} young actresses were {{considered for the}} part of Max before Jessica Alba was chosen; Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when it had been narrowed down to 20 or 30 applicants. Cameron {{said he was not}} overly impressed with Alba's acting skill or appearance in her audition tape, though he kept coming back and watching it as there was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> attitude that he liked, eventually deciding he needed to see her in person. Alba was hired for the role before the scripts were written. Eglee said [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] In order to train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E

500|$|Cyrus {{believed}} that compared to previous albums, Breakout was [...] "grown-up" [...] and [...] "just {{a little more}} creative." [...] Cyrus aimed to incorporate a sound influenced by rock music, saying [...] "the writing is definitely different...the lyrics mean more than my last couple of records". According to Cyrus, the album documented, in depth, the events that occurred in her life in a year span. Most of the songs were written as Cyrus traveled on the Best of Both Worlds Tour from October 2007 to January 2008. Recording commenced immediately after the tour came to an end, and seized in March 2008, for Cyrus was to film [...] (2009) in Tennessee soon after. She expressed that, through each song, a listener could discover <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> and about themselves. Of connecting with her fans through Breakout, she claimed she wanted [...] "girls to feel {{to be able to}} feel empowered and just feel like they can kind of rock out", going on to say that, [...] "listening to this music, I hope they can feel like a reason to dance and just smile and to have fun. This CD is totally age appropriate, specially for me".|$|E
500|$|NME {{reviewer}} Issy Sampson {{explained that}} the track is so addictive after a few listens that [...] "you’ll find yourself driving to Cheryl’s house, at 4.35am on a Tuesday, crying uncontrollably and muttering <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>HER</b> calling YOUR name." [...] Entertainment Wise reviewer Wil Jones also thought that [...] "Call My Name" [...] wasn't innovative, and compared it to other productions by David Guetta, saying, [...] "a bit of a drop there, the same old floor-to-the-floor beat here, a big synth-y chorus that’s meant to be anthemic but isn’t really, over-produced, bland vocals. 'Call My Name' is isn’t by no means terrible, it’s just very blah." [...] Similarly, Jenn Selby of Glamour noted that [...] "Call My Name" [...] bears resemblance to other productions by Harris, yet admitted that she was surprised with the result of their collaboration, while Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said that the song has everything to become the summer's hottest anthem. The Guardian critic Alexis Petridis gave the song a mixed review, criticizing it for being generic and adding that it lacks [...] "the spark that powered Rihanna's We Found Love." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to London, Mills asked Karmal to marry her. Karmal said yes, but on one condition: [...] "I told her I couldn't marry {{her until she}} did <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> compulsive lying, and she agreed to see a psychiatrist for eight weeks. She admitted she had a problem {{and said it was}} because she'd been forced to lie as a child by her father". Although Mills proposed to Karmal, she later said that every man she has been out with [...] "has asked me to marry him within a week". The couple married on 6 May 1989. While married to Karmal, she suffered two ectopic pregnancies, so Karmal paid for her to go on holiday to Croatia with his children and ex-wife (with whom Mills had become friends) in 1990, but Mills ended up living with her ski instructor, Miloš Pogačar, shortly before the Croatian War began. Mills set up a refugee crisis centre in London, helping over 20 people to escape the war. She drove to deliver donations to Croatia, taking modelling assignments in Austria on the way to pay for the trip, later saying that she [...] "worked on the front line in a war zone in the former Yugoslavia for two years where there were mines everywhere that weren't marked". Karmal and Mills were divorced in 1991 and Mills was later engaged to Raffaele Mincione (a bond dealer for the Industrial Bank of Japan) in 1993.|$|E
6000|$|This {{singular}} attestation of Madame de Cintre's delicacy, {{for all its}} singularity, set Newman's wound aching afresh. [...] "I see," [...] he presently said; [...] "she knew <b>something</b> bad <b>about</b> <b>her</b> mother." ...|$|R
60|$|He obeyed. There was <b>something</b> changed <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> <b>something</b> {{which he}} did not recognise. She thrust her hands into a box of cigarettes, took one out and lit it. She leaned against the table, facing him.|$|R

500|$|... "There's {{a spirit}} there that's just very {{interesting}} to me. She was charming and there was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> so intriguing to watch", stated Rhimes in response to Pomepo's portrayal of her character. Executive producer Betsy Beers stated that the writing staff was {{going to focus on}} the balance between her vulnerability and her courage, also dealing with changes in the relationship with her friends. Pompeo noted that the uncertainty of her character's fate is what helped her evolve into a more adaptable actor. Rhimes also disclosed that an episode with Ellis Grey's unexpected lucidity and eventual death was in plans {{since the beginning of the}} series. Rhimes described how Pompeo got through the challenge of sending Meredith in the afterlife: [...] "It was an exciting place to take her. Exciting to watch her find her way back." [...] In response to Izzie's arc, Shonda Rhimes discussed the impact Denny Duquette's death will have on her, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Katherine Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the third season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people." ...|$|E
500|$|The pair {{discussed}} {{having an}} Act 1 musical scene involving Anna and the King's wives. [...] The lyrics for that scene {{proved to be}} very difficult for Hammerstein to write. [...] He first thought that Anna would simply tell the wives <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> past, and wrote such lyrics as [...] "I was dazzled by the splendor/Of Calcutta and Bombay" [...] and [...] "The celebrities were many/And the parties very gay/(I recall a curry dinner/And a certain Major Grey)." [...] Eventually, Hammerstein decided to write about how Anna felt, a song which would not only explain her past and her motivation for traveling with her son to the court of Siam, but also serve to establish a bond with Tuptim and lay the groundwork for the conflict that devastates Anna's relationship with the King. [...] "Hello, Young Lovers", the resulting song, was the work of five exhausting weeks for Hammerstein. [...] He finally sent the lyrics to Rodgers by messenger and awaited his reaction. [...] Hammerstein considered the song his best work and was anxious to hear what Rodgers thought of it, but no comment came from Rodgers. [...] Pride kept Hammerstein from asking. [...] Finally, after four days, the two happened to be talking on the phone about other matters, {{and at the end of}} the conversation, Rodgers stated, very briefly, that the lyric was fine. [...] Josh Logan, who had worked closely with Hammerstein on South Pacific, listened to the usually unflappable writer pour out his unhappy feelings. [...] It was one of the few times that Hammerstein and Rodgers did not display a united front.|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E
60|$|So much of {{the mystery}} of her had been {{revealed}} that day by the man she had always called father. Vaguely she had always been conscious of some mystery, <b>something</b> strange <b>about</b> <b>her</b> childhood, some relation never explained.|$|R

2500|$|Screenwriter Steve Kloves {{revealed}} in a 2003 interview that Hermione was his favourite character.

2500|$|Along this theme, PBS {{commentator}} Bill Moyers {{noted that}} MSNBC commentator Tucker Carlson had said of Clinton, [...] "There's just <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> that feels castrating, overbearing, and scary," [...] and that top-rated {{radio talk show}} host Rush Limbaugh continued to refer to her as [...] "the woman with the testicle lockbox." [...] During the campaign, Carlson made repeated statements of the form [...] "When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs." [...] Further discussion ensued when the Drudge Report and a few other media outlets ran an unflattering Associated Press photograph of Clinton looking old and tired on the wintry Iowa campaign trail; Limbaugh sympathized with the plight of American women in an appearance-obsessed culture, then asked, [...] "Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?" ...|$|E

50|$|Afterwards, however, Ganthet noted {{immediately}} {{that there was}} <b>something</b> different <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> Boodikka claims this is because Ganthet's newly discovered emotions allowed him to see her as she is (Boodikka's true self, now in control of her body again), not by what she is (an Alpha Lantern).|$|R
