Early fins used rubber straps {{connected}} to the fin by a wire buckle, and were not readily adjustable. Later versions incorporated swivels, buckles, quick release connectors and adjustable tension, but the increased complexity and decreased reliability, and tendency of the loose strap ends to hook on things triggered a return by some manufacturers and aftermarket accessory manufacturers to simpler systems. These include <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> straps and bungee straps, which once set up, are not adjustable, and which reduce the number of potential failure points and places where the fin can snag on obstructions like net, line and seaweed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{elaborate}} design optimization technique of coil spring sets with genetic algorithm. Attention is focused on reducing the weight and stresses keeping into considerations the various critical points. The spring is designed to operate with tension load, so the spring stretches as the load is applied to it. The aim of the present work is to design the extension spring for various material like steel, stainless steel, music wire (High carbon steel), oil Tempered (High carbon steel) for same loading condition, since each material has different compositions and properties. Optimization of spring helps in selecting most appropriate and cost effective material for spring. On applying the GA, the optimum parameter of spring have been obtained, which contribute towards achieving the minimum weight. A reduction of 7 % weight is achieved when <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> is replaced with other spring stated here, under identical condition of design parameters and optimization.

These contactors {{can be used}} as replacement for vertical wafer probes as well as test sockets used in the final test. The contactor pin consists of a plunger section made of beryllium copper and a plated helical <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> wire. It is 5 mm in uncompressed total length, including the plunger and the spring. The overall diameter of the spring wire section was 0. 51 mm. The design of the contactor is much simpler and more scalable than that of traditional spring pins called Pogo pins used in package tests. A test socket containing 36 contactor pins was constructed for tests and measurements. The experimental characterization shows $-$ 1 -dB bandwidth of 3. 73 GHz for 0. 8 -mm pitch, measured by the direct contact method. This experimental result correlates well with the simulated results. The rise time was 82 ps as measured by TDR, and the propagation delay was 23 ps. The electrical conduction path is through the pin and the spring, making it a reliable contact. However, the electrical path is known to be through the barrel, not the spring for the regular spring pins...|$|E

40|$|AbstractStudy Design: This {{study was}} a {{prospective}} monocentric study to assess the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous embolization with coils of postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysm (PCFP). Patients and Methods: Seventeen PCFPs of 32 -mm mean diameter in 16 patients were embolized while anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy was maintained. Ultrasound scan-guided compression repair failed at least one time in 13 cases and was contraindicated in the four remaining cases. With ultrasound-Doppler scan guidance, the PCFPs were percutaneously punctured with a 16 -gauge intravenous catheter. An angiogram was performed through the catheter to ensure its location within the sac. <b>Stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> coils with synthetic fibers were introduced within the PCFP with fluoroscopic control. Successful thrombosis was checked with ultrasound-Doppler scan and was repeated at days 1, 30, and 180 when possible. Results: All PCFPs of 32 -mm mean diameter were successfully treated with two to nine coils. After embolization, gentle additional compression was necessary for complete occlusion, with a mean duration of 6. 3 minutes (range, 0 to 15 minutes), except in one case with treatment with abciximab {{in which it was}} 45 minutes. All procedures were uneventful and painless. The mean follow-up period was 9. 5 months (range, 1 to 21 months). Two recurrences (11. 7 %) were observed, and one was successfully treated with a second embolization. Conclusion: Percutaneous embolization with coils appears to be a safe and effective method for treatment of PCFP. It may be performed in patients undergoing anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and must be attempted when ultrasound scan-guided compression repair has failed or is contraindicated.

40|$|Hinge-based Ankle Foot Orthosis (HAFO) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common non-surgical {{solutions}} for the foot drop. In conventional HAFOs, the ankle joint is almost locked, and plantar flexion is restricted due to the high stiffness of the hinge mechanism. This often leads to a rigid walking gate cycle, poor muscle activity, and muscle atrophy. Since the ankle torque-angle loop has a non-linear profile, the use of a superelastic NiTi spring within the hinge, due to its nonlinear behavior, could recreate a close-to-normal stiffness of the normal ankle joint, which, in turn, could create a more natural walk. The focus of this study is to evaluate the performance of a superelastic NiTi spring versus a conventional <b>Stainless</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>spring</b> in a hinge mechanism of a custom-fit HAFO. To this aim, a custom-fit HAFO was fabricated via the fast casting technique. Then, motion analysis was performed for two healthy subjects (Case I and Case II) : (i) subjects with bare foot; (ii) subjects wearing a conventional HAFO with no spring; (iii) subjects wearing a conventional Stainless Steel-based HAFO; and (iv) subjects wearing a NiTi spring-based HAFO. The data related to the ankle angle and the amount of moment applied to the ankle during walking were recorded using Cortex software and used for the evaluations. Finally, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed to evaluate the safety of the designed HAFO. The NiTi spring offers a higher range of motion (7. 9 versus 4. 14 degree) and an increased level of moment (0. 55 versus 0. 36 N·m/kg). Furthermore, a NiTi spring offers an ankle torque-angle loop closer to that of the healthy subjects...|$|E

40|$|Flexible {{endoscopes}} (long, slender, flexible instruments with {{a camera}} and light at the distal end, having working channels to introduce flexible instruments) are used for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions inside the human digestive system and inside the abdomen. Though used for their flexibility, the flexibility of these instruments causes several difficulties during insertion and use. During insertion, flexible endoscopes can buckle and loop, which may hamper full insertion into the patient’s body. During therapeutic interventions, the flexible endoscope fails to provide stability for surgical instruments that are introduced through the flexible endoscope. In this thesis, firstly, the fundamental mechanical causes of the difficulties that accompany the use of flexible endoscopes are analysed. Next, an extensive, categorizing review explores the available and potentially suitable solutions to causes of the flexibility-induced difficulties in flexible endoscopy. The review suggests that passive guiding of the flexible endoscope shaft using guides with rigidity control is the most feasible solution. Three potentially suitable rigidity control concepts are selected and further investigated to quantitatively and qualitatively predict the maximally achievable flexural rigidity of these rigidity control mechanisms. The first investigated rigidity control mechanism (“Vacu-SL” mechanism) utilizes the flexural rigidity increase that is achieved by vacuuming foil tubes filled with small particles. The thesis proceeds with experiments {{on the influence of}} particle hardness, size, and shape on the flexural rigidity of vacuumed foil tubes filled with these particles. The experiments showed that the flexural rigidity increases with the hardness and irregularity of the particles and that there may be an optimal particle size in the low particle diameter region. Next, a mechanism using friction between a rubber tube, stainless steel cables, and a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> (“FORGUIDE mechanism”) is presented, as well as a mathematical model predicting the maximally achievable flexural rigidity of that mechanism. The results of that chapter suggest that there is great potential for improvement of the FORGUIDE mechanism and that this mechanism may very well provide sufficient support for flexible endoscopes. A chapter on the static friction between several kinds of rubber and several types of stainless steel cables aids to advise on how the flexural rigidity of the friction-based FORGUIDE mechanism can be increased by properly choosing the materials of the tube, cables, and spring. The third rigidity control mechanism (“PlastoLock” mechanism) changes rigidity by heating and cooling a lactide-based polymer through its glass-transition. A feasibility study shows the great potential of this concept in terms of achievable flexural rigidity, miniaturization, and simplicity. Finally, the thesis presents a force analysis and a number of functional design considerations that should guide the further design {{of a new generation of}} flexible endoscopes with passively guided shafts. The discussion of the thesis advises on what rigidity control mechanisms are most likely to provide a proper solution for what application areas, and on what steps should be taken next to finally obtain a good solution to the current flexibility-induced difficulties in flexible endoscopy. It is concluded that the FORGUIDE mechanism and the PlastoLock mechanism are most suitable for application in flexible endoscopes for the gastrointestinal tract. These mechanisms are simple, provide high flexural rigidity (especially when considering their size), and may be applied in a very broad range of applications. Many improvements in existing applications and a broadening of the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities in gastrointestinal health care may be achieved by further developing the investigated rigidity control mechanisms into fully functional guided instruments.

The low mass of 3 kg was achieved by using the same actuator for three functions: rotation, percussions, and core break-off.

Furthermore, {{a significant percentage of}} SOPRV which are found to FPT are also found to &#x 27;&#x 27;fail to open&#x 27;&#x 27; (FTO) meaning they would not relief excess pressure {{in the event of an}} overpressure event. The cases where adhesions result in FTO or FPT appear to be confined to SOPRV with diameters < 1 in and set pressures < 150 psig and the FTO are estimated to occur in 0. 31 % to 2. 00 % of this subpopulation of SS trim SOPRV. The reliability and safety implications of these finding for end-users who do not perform pre-installation testing of SOPRV are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the forces applied by coil springs used to open spaces for blocked out lateral incisors, and {{to compare the}} actual forces used with clinicans’ concepts of an ‘ideal’ force. Methods: Twelve postgraduate orthodontic students (7 M, 5 F) and 12 orthodontic tutors (9 M, 3 F) participated in this study. They were asked to state what they considered was an ideal orthodontic force, and then to cut appropriate lengths of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and nickel titanium open coil springs to open spaces for blocked out maxillary and mandibular permanent lateral incisors on a typodont set-up. The forces generated by the open coil springs were measured and compared to the stated ideal forces. Results: The mean ideal force was 76. 75 g (Range: 25 – 200 g). The mean applied force was 314 g (Range: 21 – 519 g). There {{were no significant differences}} in the forces used by the male and female postgraduates, but the male tutors used a significantly higher force than the male postgraduate students (p = 0. 007) and the female tutors (p < 0. 001). The female tutors used a significantly lower force than the female postgraduates (p = 0. 024) and the male postgraduates (p = 0. 003). Higher forces were produced by the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> coil <b>springs</b> in both arches (Maxillary arch: p = 0. 007; Mandibular arch: p < 0. 005). Conclusions: The clinicians could not agree on an ideal force to open spaces for blocked out lateral incisors. There were substantial differences between the forces applied by the coil springs and the forces considered by the clinicians to be ideal. There were large differences in the forces used by the different groups of orthodontists. 6 page(s...|$|R
