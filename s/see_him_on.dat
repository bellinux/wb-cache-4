A life-sized waxwork of Lambert was displayed in London, where it became extremely popular. Daniel Lambert soon became a popular subject with cartoonists, who often depicted him as John Bull. He mixed well with the upper classes, and on one occasion met King GeorgeIII. The King's and Lambert's reactions to this meeting are not recorded.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} scene in which Eminem stands on the rooftop of the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York, saying the {{introductory}} lyrics. The video cuts between scenes where he raps on the rooftop and another scene where Eminem is trapped inside a dark basement. Eminem moves closer towards the edge of the building until he leaves to go downstairs as the chorus begins. He starts walking down Market Street in Newark and jaywalks across the street, avoiding vehicles that pass by. Eminem sees distorted reflections of himself on the window of a car; he continues on, only to be surrounded by a series of mirrors. Confused, Eminem tries to escape, and {{towards the end of the}} second chorus, he breaks through a mirror to find himself in the middle of the street. Interspersing scenes show Eminem as he tries to break out of the basement. As the camera zooms out, the viewers <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the edge of a destroyed street while a subway tunnel can be seen below the road.|$|E

Phelps' three timberclad gunboats were vulnerable to cannon fire {{and took up}} positions some distance behind Foote's ironclads for protection and began their bombardment of Fort Henry from long range. One of Foote's ships, the Essex took a direct hit to the boiler, which exploded, killing and wounding thirty-two crewmen. After about 75 minutes of bombardment, Tilghman finally struck the fort's flag and surrendered. Soon a gunboat with the adjutant-general and a captain came alongside reporting that General Tilghma wished {{to communicate with the}} flag-officer. Foote dispatched Commanders Phelps and Roger N.

Richard Guilliatt, writing for The Monthly, later described Kelly from a 1979 performance at Richmond's Kingston Hotel, the singer was [...] "a skinny guy with a head of black curls framing a pale face and a bent nose... singing with his eyes closed, one arm outstretched and the other resting on the body of the Fender Telecaster". Kelly was introduced to Hilary Brown at one of the Dots' gigs and they later married – the relationship is described in [...] "When I First Met Your Ma" [...] (1992).

During filming, Presley was constantly moved to avoid the crowds of fans who came to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> location, which delayed the film-making. [...] Wallis had rented a house for Presley's privacy, and a second one after one of his assistants noticed that the back of the houses in the block led {{to the back of the}} houses on the adjacent street. To escape from the crowds, Presley would climb to the roof of one house and cross over onto the roof of the other.

500|$|Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross {{had long}} been an admirer of Benjamin Franklin, and wished to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a coin. In 1933, Sinnock had {{designed}} a medal featuring Franklin, which may have given her the idea. [...] Franklin had opposed putting portraits on coins; he advocated proverbs about which the holder could profit through reflection. In a 1948 interview, Ross noted that Franklin only knew of living royalty on coins, and presumably would feel differently about a republic honoring a deceased founder. [...] Indeed, Franklin {{might have been more}} upset at the reverse design: as numismatic writer Jonathan Tepper noted, [...] "Had Benjamin Franklin known that he would be appearing on a half dollar with an eagle, he most likely would have been quite upset. [...] He detested the eagle, and numismatic lore has it that he often referred to it as a scavenger. Given the practical man that he was, Franklin proposed the wild turkey as our national bird." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1947, Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross asked Engraver Sinnock {{to produce}} a design for a half dollar {{featuring}} Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. Ross had long been an admirer of Franklin, and wanted to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a coin. [...] Mint officials had considered putting Franklin on the dime in 1941, but the project was shelved owing to heavy demands on the Mint for coins as the United States entered World War II. [...] During the war, the Mint contemplated adding one or more new denominations of coinage; Sinnock prepared a Franklin design {{in anticipation of a}} new issue, which did not occur. [...] In 1946, the Treasury replaced the Mercury dime with a piece depicting the recently deceased president, Franklin Roosevelt, who had been closely associated with the March of Dimes. [...] With the Lincoln cent popular and politically inexpedient to replace, the half dollar was the only piece being struck which was available for redesign without congressional permission. [...] The Treasury approved the new design. [...] Although Sinnock died before the coin was issued, the Franklin half dollar went into production at the start of 1948, ending the Walking Liberty series. [...] A total of 485,320,340 Walking Liberty half dollars were struck.|$|E

Before meeting Martin, Coretta had been in relationships her entire time in school, but never had any she cared to develop.

Edythe was able to tell her sister had legitimate feelings for him, and she also became impressed with his overall demeanor.|$|E

For its part, the Red Hand Defenders issued a statement which blamed the killing on the UVF and threatened retaliation, although Gusty Spence, by then a leading figure in the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), quickly denied the claims that it was a UVF attack, a sentiment echoed by PUP leader David Ervine. The killing was also condemned by Ulster Democratic Party activist John White who said [...] "it's disgraceful that a man who dedicated his life to the loyalist cause should be cut down like this by people who call themselves loyalists".
