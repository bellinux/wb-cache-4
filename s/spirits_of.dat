5|$|Buddhism {{long held}} that the tengu were {{disruptive}} demons and s of war. Their image gradually softened, however, into one of protective, if still dangerous, <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> the mountains and forests. Tengu {{are associated with the}} ascetic practice of Shugendō, and they are usually depicted in the garb of its followers, the yamabushi.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named płanetnik, chmurnik, or obłocznik: they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron flails into hailstones. They {{were considered to}} be the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> infants who had died without baptism, or the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds; they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village. According to other notions, płanetniks were persons who flew into the sky during storms. They could fly in spirit, while they were in deep sleep, or they could fly in body and soul. The płanetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning them about the approach of a storm or hail. They could direct the movement of clouds.|$|E

5|$|Taoist temples may fly square or {{triangular}} flags.

5|$|The Octagon is also {{believed}} {{by some to}} be haunted by the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> African American slaves who once lived there. When the house held bells to summon servants, the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> the dead slaves would announce their presence by ringing these bells loudly. The ghostly bell ringing first occurred in the 1870s. General George D. Ramsay, Chief of Ordnance for the United States Army and commander of the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all the bells in the house began ringing. As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American consul in Foo Chow, China), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop the bells from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop ringing. Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious ringing of the bells had been reported in 1874 and again in 1889, each time attributed to the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> dead slaves.|$|E
60|$|But {{the text}} {{describes}} this Spirit in different words. According to Isaiah, the <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Lord is the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> wisdom and understanding, the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> Counsel and might, the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> knowledge {{and of the}} fear of the Lord--in one word, that I may put it as simply as I can--the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> wisdom.|$|R

60|$|If the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> {{love is the}} <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> God, and the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> {{wisdom is}} the <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> God, then they must be the same spirit.

5|$|Almost {{every nation}} has {{associated}} blood drinking {{with some kind}} of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. Piśāca, the returned <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the concept}} of {{liberating}} the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> the soldiers and civilians who were sacrificed during the Japanese invasion in World War II, the temple of Poh Ern Shih was constructed {{on the site of the}} bloodshed on Chwee Chian Hill. It was established in 1954 as a modest single storey temple by philanthropist Lee Choon Seng (1888—1966), as one of the few Chinese Mahayana temples in Singapore dedicated to the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.|$|E
5|$|Breton {{folklore}} {{holds that}} storm petrels are the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> sea-captains who mistreated their crew, doomed to spend eternity {{flying over the}} sea, and they are also held to be the souls of drowned sailors.

5|$|Hydrochloric acid was {{historically}} called acidum salis, muriatic acid, and <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> salt {{because it}} was produced from rock salt and green vitriol (by Basilius Valentinus in the 15th century) and later from the chemically similar common salt and sulfuric acid (by Johann Rudolph Glauber in the 17th century). Free hydrochloric acid was first formally described in the 16th century by Libavius. Later, it was used by chemists such as Glauber, Priestley, and Davy in their scientific research.|$|E

5|$|The Changi Murals are {{a set of}} five {{paintings}} of biblical theme painted by Stanley Warren, a British bombardier and prisoner-of-war (POW) interned at the Changi Prison, during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II (WWII).

5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, {{which he}} calls the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, which most probably contained remains {{taken out of the}} royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> his ancestors.|$|E
5|$|After {{scouring}} the Great Sea, Link learns {{that he must}} use maps and clues hidden in the Temple of the Ocean King to find the <b>Spirits</b> <b>of</b> Courage, Wisdom, and Power, which in turn will help him locate the Ghost Ship. With {{the help of the}} Phantom Hourglass, Link finds the <b>Spirits</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom and Power. When Link asks Oshus where to find the Spirit of Courage, Oshus explains that it is in fact Ciela, after which she transforms into her true form. Now in possession of the three Spirits, Link, along with Ciela and Oshus, locate the Ghost Ship and find Tetra on board, who has been turned to stone. While Link determines how to save Tetra, Oshus reveals that he is the Ocean King and that he and Ciela had to change their appearances to hide from Bellum, a life-eating monster that Link must destroy to save Tetra. Oshus also mentions that Bellum was the one who created the Ghost Ship and turned Tetra into a statue, and that he has taken residence deep in the Temple of the Ocean King. Linebeck quickly readies to abandon their quest; outraged at the lack of treasure to be found. However, his loyalties instantly return when Oshus promises the captain one wish in return for his continued aid.|$|E

25|$|Christians {{believe that}} the Holy Spirit gives 'gifts' to Christians. These gifts consist of {{specific}} abilities granted to the individual Christian. They are frequently known by the Greek word for gift, Charisma, from which the term charismatic derives. The New Testament provides three different lists of such gifts which range from the supernatural (healing, prophecy, tongues) through those associated with specific callings (teaching) to those expected of all Christians in some degree (faith). Most consider these lists not to be exhaustive, and other have compiled their own lists. Saint Ambrose wrote of the Seven Gifts <b>of</b> the Holy <b>Spirit</b> poured out on a believer at baptism: 1. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom; 2. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Understanding; 3. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Counsel; 4. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Strength; 5. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Knowledge; 6. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Godliness; 7. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Holy Fear.|$|R
