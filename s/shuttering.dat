5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and domes {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated {{by the use of}} concrete and brick. By varying the weight of the aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called <b>shuttering,</b> to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E
50|$|Interchangeable-lens cameras with {{a central}} <b>shutter</b> within the lens body require that each lens has a <b>shutter</b> built into it. In {{practice}} most cameras with interchangeable lenses use a single focal plane <b>shutter</b> in the camera body for all lenses, while cameras with a fixed lens use a central <b>shutter.</b> Many medium-format and most large-format cameras, however, have interchangeable lenses each fitted {{with a central}} <b>shutter.</b> A few interchangeable-lens cameras have a behind-the-lens leaf <b>shutter.</b> Large-format press cameras often had a focal-plane <b>shutter.</b> Some had both a focal-plane <b>shutter</b> (for lens interchangeability) and a lens with central <b>shutter</b> (for flash synchronisation); one <b>shutter</b> would be locked open.|$|R
50|$|Other {{interior}} <b>shutters</b> use stationary louvers {{that do not}} rotate (fixed louvers); solid raised or flat panels; fabric inserts; or tinted glass. <b>Shutters</b> can be configured in {{a single}} tier unit that has one <b>shutter</b> top to bottom of a window opening as well as multiple tiers. Multiple tier units feature separate <b>shutters</b> on each tier which allows the top <b>shutters</b> to be opened independently from the bottom <b>shutters.</b> Café-type <b>shutters</b> refer to <b>shutters</b> that only cover the lower portion of a window.|$|R

25|$|Where possible, {{the tunnel}} routes avoided granite and instead they were routed through looser shale rock formations; this speeded up {{construction}} and was less labour-intensive, {{but it could}} also be dangerous due to an increased risk of rockfalls. The tunnels were dug by the traditional method of drilling and blasting. When the tunnels were bored out, they were lined with concrete. First, the floor was lined, followed by the walls, and, finally, the roof. The walls were concreted using wooden <b>shuttering,</b> the space between the <b>shuttering</b> and the rock face was filled with concrete, and the <b>shuttering</b> subsequently removed. The roof was made in the same way, but using curved <b>shuttering</b> balancing on the concrete walls. Concrete was poured down the escape shafts rather than through the tunnel entrances to avoid contamination with the rock leaving the tunnel; these chutes can still be seen in many of the tunnels.|$|E

50|$|Almost all {{contemporary}} SLRs use a focal-plane <b>shutter</b> {{located in}} front of the film plane, which prevents the light from reaching the film even if the lens is removed, except when the <b>shutter</b> is actually released during the exposure. There are various designs for focal plane <b>shutters.</b> Early focal-plane <b>shutters</b> designed from the 1930s onwards usually consisted of two curtains that travelled horizontally across the film gate: an opening <b>shutter</b> curtain followed by a closing <b>shutter</b> curtain. During fast <b>shutter</b> speeds, the focal-plane <b>shutter</b> would form a 'slit' whereby the second <b>shutter</b> curtain was closely following the first opening <b>shutter</b> curtain to produce a narrow, vertical opening, with the <b>shutter</b> slit moving horizontally. The slit would get narrower as <b>shutter</b> speeds were increased. Initially these <b>shutters</b> were made from a cloth material (which was in later years often rubberised), but some manufacturers used other materials instead. Nippon Kōgaku (now Nikon Corporation), for example, used titanium foil <b>shutters</b> for several of their flagship SLR cameras, including the Nikon F, F2, and F3.|$|R

25|$|Appearance also varied {{due to the}} {{building}} materials used, although all the FW3 designs are formed from reinforced concrete. Where brick {{was used as a}} <b>shuttering,</b> the bricks essentially formed a mould into which concrete was poured, the bricks being left in place. Otherwise, the pillbox was formed using <b>shuttering</b> of wood (usually planks, but sometimes plywood) and/or corrugated iron. Wood <b>shuttering</b> was removed, whereas corrugated iron was sometimes left in place. Construction often took advantage of whatever materials were available locally (for example, at the coast, beach sand and pebbles would be used) and this expedient use of local materials had the added advantage of aiding camouflage. The reinforced concrete used in construction was generally conventional making use of thin steel rebars with floor, walls and roof all mutually bonded. However, several instances are known where scrap metal had been used such as parts of an old bed or park railings.|$|E

50|$|A central <b>shutter</b> {{is not a}} type of <b>shutter</b> as such, but {{describes}} {{the position of the}} shutter: it is typically a leaf <b>shutter</b> (or simple leaf <b>shutter),</b> and located within the lens assembly where a relatively small opening allows light to cover the entire image. Leaf <b>shutters</b> can also be located behind, but near, the lens, allowing lens interchangeability. The alternative to a central or behind-the-lens <b>shutter</b> is a focal-plane <b>shutter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some {{models have}} both a focal plane <b>shutter</b> and an iris lens <b>shutter.</b> The focal plane <b>shutter</b> allows for fast <b>shutter</b> speeds {{and the use}} of lenses which do not have an {{integral}} <b>shutter</b> (known as a barrel lens), while the iris <b>shutter</b> allows for flash synchronization at any speed.

Seagram had purchased Motown's former parent MCA in 1995, and Motown was in effect reunited with many of its MCA corporate siblings (Seagram had hoped to build a media empire around Universal, and started by purchasing PolyGram). Universal briefly considered <b>shuttering</b> the label, but instead decided to restructure it.

The remaining parts of Saint Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, including its nursing homes, home health agency, St. Vincent's Hospital Westchester, and US Family Health Plan, were to continue to operate without interruption, but these entities were sold to other providers' systems.|$|E
25|$|In January 2016, the BMT Canarsie Line between Bedford and Eighth Avenues was {{proposed}} for a partial or full shutdown {{so that the}} MTA could repair tunnels damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The MTA considered either <b>shuttering</b> the entire segment for eighteen months, or operating two segments for three years: a one-track segment between Bedford and Eighth Avenues with a 5 trains per hour capacity in either direction, and regular service between Lorimer Street and Rockaway Parkway. For both options, the Third Avenue station would be closed {{for the duration of}} the renovation, which would fix the 14th Street Tunnels and add new exits and elevators to the First Avenue and Bedford Avenue stations. The renovations would cost between $800 million and $1 billion.|$|E

25|$|The {{main issue}} {{in dealing with}} the fossil fuel {{phase-out}} has been job loss. Companies in the fossil fuel industry have begun to experience the effects of the phasing-out of fossil fuels like coal. For example, Consol Energy, originally a coal-producing company, has begun the transition to becoming a natural gas producer. Not only does this shift affect its current role in the coal industry but it also has led to employment cuts. With the <b>shuttering</b> of coal plants, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association estimates that over one million jobs will be lost. With the coal industry aging, many coal mines are deteriorating and becoming costly to keep running. As a result, coal plants are no longer a reliable, go-to energy source for the United States.|$|E
25|$|One such {{influence}} was Robert Stevenson, himself a seminal {{figure in the}} development of lighthouse design and construction. His greatest achievement was the construction of the Bell Rock Lighthouse in 1810, one of the most impressive feats of engineering of the age. This structure was based upon Smeaton's design, but with several improved features, such as the incorporation of rotating lights, alternating between red and white. Stevenson worked for the Northern Lighthouse Board for nearly fifty years during which time he designed and oversaw the construction and later improvement of numerous lighthouses. He innovated in the choice of light sources, mountings, reflector design, the use of Fresnel lenses, and in rotation and <b>shuttering</b> systems providing lighthouses with individual signatures allowing them to be identified by seafarers. He also invented the movable jib and the balance crane as a necessary part for lighthouse construction.|$|E
25|$|Western {{fiction is}} a genre of {{literature}} {{set in the}} American Old West, most commonly between the years of 1860 and 1900. The first critically recognized Western was The Virginian (1902) by Owen Wister. Other well-known writers of Western fiction include Zane Grey, from the early 1900s, Ernest Haycox, Luke Short, and Louis L'Amour, from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as Leigh Brackett, Elmore Leonard, and Larry McMurtry, have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, {{due in part to}} the <b>shuttering</b> of many pulp magazines, the popularity of televised Westerns, and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.|$|E

25|$|At {{the heart}} of {{scholarly}} text production, preservation, and dissemination lies the university. In a time of unfavorable economic conditions, Fitzpatrick suggests that the university may continue to fulfill its role in these endeavors only by rethinking its mission and repurposing its operational units. While the university press may have originally functioned to disseminate {{the work of an}} institution’s faculty to the larger community, in recent years, the university press has become a market-driven entity that is separate from the academic core of the university. Though university presses typically do not turn a profit and must depend on university subsidies to operate, they are often expected to be financially self-sustaining and, driven by this expectation, function to fulfill a mission much {{different from that of the}} university. Fitzpatrick attributes the recent trend of <b>shuttering</b> university presses to shrinking university budgets and the unsustainable business models in which many presses are forced to operate.|$|E
