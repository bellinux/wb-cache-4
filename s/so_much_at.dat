5|$|On November 30, at a Draffenville, Kentucky tournament {{game against}} Oak Hill Academy, Alexander scored 26 of his teams 39 points on 12–14 field goal {{shooting}} in a 72–39 defeat. On December 29, Curie again faced Parker and Simeon in the Pontiac Holiday Tournament (this {{time in the}} semifinals). Alexander posted 21 points on 9–10 field goal shooting, but Simeon still prevailed 62–57. Notably, Parker assumed Alexander as a defensive assignment after Alexander gave Curie a 48–47 lead with 4:58 time remaining and Alexander went scoreless {{the rest of the}} game. Despite 11 points, 9 rebounds and 8 blocked shots from Alexander, Curie was eliminated from the CPL playoffs in a February 11 quarterfinals 60–58 loss to the Billy Garrett, Jr.-led Morgan Park High School that went on to become 2013 IHSA Class 3A state champion. On February 26, the Associated Press Illinois Class 4A basketball rankings showed Whitney Young at number 1, and it was also expected that Young's road to the sectional finals would include a March 6 meeting with Curie. According to Henricksen, the March 6 state playoff meeting between Young and Curie was anticipated because it would pit Okafor against Alexander, making it the most highly touted IHSA playoff matchup of centers since 1988 when LaPhonso Ellis led East Saint Louis' Lincoln High School against Eric Anderson's St. Francis de Sales High School. Mike Helfgot of the Chicago Tribune said that there have not been many matchups between big men this good with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> stake. On March 2, Alexander attended Senior night at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Assembly Hall. The February 2013 Great Plains blizzard caused controversial postponements of several IHSA games including the March 6 Young-Curie game, which was delayed one day. Young defeated Curie 62–58 as the supporting cast made up for Alexander's 14–13 scoring edge over Okafor.|$|E

25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, modernismo emerged, a poetic {{movement}} whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío's Azul (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> issue. José Martí, for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.|$|E

I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E

This institution celebrates activities during all the year, mainly baseball, and years later added basketball, with the time various clubs were incorporated; the Gustavo Behall, the Hugo Kunhard, and Juan Luis Plá, among others.

25|$|His latter {{campaigns in}} the Balkans were aimed not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> conquest and subjugation as at drawing the Serbs, Bosnians, Wallachians and Bulgarians {{into the fold}} of the Roman Catholic faith and at forming a united front against the Turks. It was {{relatively}} easy to subdue the Balkan Orthodox countries by arms, but to convert them was a different matter. Despite Louis' efforts, {{the peoples of the}} Balkans remained faithful to the Eastern Orthodox Church and their attitude toward Hungary remained ambiguous. Louis annexed Moldavia in 1352 and established a vassal principality there, before conquering Vidin in 1365. The rulers of Serbia, Walachia, Moldavia, and Bulgaria became his vassals. They regarded powerful Hungary as a potential menace to their national identity. For this reason, Hungary could never regard the Serbs and Wallachians as reliable allies in subsequent wars against the Turks.|$|E

25|$|SSRIs prevent 5-HT from binding to SERT which {{prevents}} absorption of 5-HT {{back into the}} presynapse terminal, where it is metabolized by monoamine oxidase or stored in secretory vesicles. As a result, the 5-HT concentration increases at the somatodendritic area of the 5-HT neuron but not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the axon terminal area (demonstrated in figure 2). This increase in 5-HT concentration causes desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. When these 5-HT1A autoreceptors have been downregulated, they will no longer restrict the impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. The impulse flow is turned on {{and as a result}} 5-HT is released at the axon terminal. However, this increase of 5-HT does not happen quickly compared to the increase of 5-HT at the somatodendretic area of the 5-HT neuron. This delay is caused by the time it takes 5-HT to downregulate 5-HT1A autoreceptors and turn on the neuro impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. This delay can explain the reason why antidepressants do not have effect on depression immediately. This can also be the reason why the antidepressant mechanisms can be connected to the increasing neuro impulse flow from 5-HT neurons, where as the concentration of 5-HT increases at the axon terminal before SSRIs start to work properly. When SSRIs have (1) inhibited the re-uptake pump, (2) increased somatodendritic 5-HT, (3) desensitized somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, (4) turned on the impulse flow and (5) increased the release of 5-HT from axon terminal, the last step might be desensitization of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. This desensitization could be the reason for reduction of adverse effects of SSRIs as tolerance develops.|$|E
500|$|After Buller [...] {{received}} a letter from Wontners confirming that civil action was taking place, he consulted the Judge Advocate General, who informed him that no military enquiry should take place while such a case was proceeding. Lewis then tried to persuade the Guards' Club, of which Gordon-Cumming was a member, to carry out an enquiry into the events, which would have negated much of the need for a trial. A vote of the members rejected the possibility, and the civil trial remained the outcome. The prince was furious with the Guards, and wrote to Ponsonby that [...] "The decision of the Guards Club is a terrible blow to the Scots Guards; and I feel most deeply for the officers who have the honour of their regiment <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> heart." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of the site's true purpose produced some recriminations in London, as – unlike the V-1 and V-2 projects – the V-3 had not been uncovered by Allied intelligence [...] before the war's end. The British scientist and military intelligence expert Reginald Victor Jones later commented that [...] "techniques {{that had been used}} against the flying bomb and the rocket appeared to have failed against HDP , and {{there had to be a}} reason. Basically it was that with our limited effort we had to concentrate on the most urgent problem, and thus on catching weapons not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the research stage (although we sometimes achieved this) as in the development stage – which usually meant when trials were showing promise." [...] He concluded at the time, in April 1945, that the intelligence failure had not made much practical difference given the fact that the Germans had failed to develop the HDP into an effective weapon: [...] "there was little warning; [...] there was little danger." ...|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} season a 7.9 out of 10, feeling it [...] "had its up and downs, mixing in {{elements}} that worked (Daisy getting her Quake on, the Fitz and Simmons drama), elements {{we could have}} used more of (Secret Warriors!) and elements that just never felt right (Lincoln and his relationship with Daisy)." [...] Goldman also felt that {{the first half of}} the season was [...] "the stronger, more cohesive of the two halves" [...] as it aired the episode [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] which Goldman called [...] "the best hour of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to date." [...] He criticized the pacing of the season, saying [...] "some episodes felt a bit jumbled and could have benefited from slowing down a bit—or simply not trying to do <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> once. Sometimes it was just a question of including too many characters or storylines in single episodes, causing some scenarios to not have time to breathe or get the proper build up they might have with more character-focused episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles and again rented {{a house in}} Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne [...] "was on a totally different level altogether". The band {{would come up with}} new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them. Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. [...] "At that time, Ozzy had come to an end", Iommi said. [...] "We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out." [...] Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979. [...] "I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid", Ward said. [...] "Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic." ...|$|E
500|$|Nuclear {{physicists}} {{knew about}} fission, {{but not the}} hydrodynamics of conventional explosions. As a result, there were two additions to the team that made significant contributions {{in this area of}} physics. First was James Tuck whose field of expertise was in shaped charges used in anti tank weapons for armour piercing. In terms of the plutonium bomb the scientists at Los Alamos were trying to wrestle with the idea of the implosion issue. Tuck was sent to Los Alamos in April 1944 and used a radical concept of explosive lensing which was then put into place. Tuck also designed the Urchin initiator for the bomb working closely with Seth Neddermeyer. This work was crucial {{to the success of the}} plutonium atomic bomb: Italian-American scientist Bruno Rossi later stated that without Tuck's work the plutonium bomb could not have exploded in August 1945. The other was Sir Geoffrey Taylor, an important consultant who arrived a month later to also work on the issue. Taylor's presence was desired <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> Los Alamos, Chadwick informed London, [...] "that anything short of kidnapping would be justified". He was sent, and provided crucial insights into the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The acute need for scientists with an understanding of explosives also led Chadwick to obtain the release of William Penney from the Admiralty, and William Marley from the Road Research Laboratory. Peierls and Fuchs worked on the hydrodynamics of the explosive lenses. Bethe considered Fuchs [...] "one of the most valuable men in my division" [...] and [...] "one of the best theoretical physicists we had." ...|$|E
