5|$|Dusky woodswallows {{adhere to}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> and movements. The birds are a nomadic species, {{and tend to}} move quite spontaneously. However, one certain change of habitat occurs for the {{south-eastern}} birds, who migrate northward for Autumn.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat roosts {{in caves}} in {{limestone}} hills, {{far from the}} entrance. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other. Bats also undertake <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> between caves.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E
50|$|Valliculture is {{an ancient}} fish culture {{practice}} originated in the Mediterranean region namely the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian coasts. People exploit the <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrations</b> of some fish species from the sea into the lagoons by preventing the fish returning to the sea. The term now applies to fish culture in coastal lagoons or brackish water bodies based on <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrations</b> of fish.|$|R
50|$|Migratory birds such as stints and {{sandpipers}} spend {{summer in}} the national park {{as part of their}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrations</b> from places as distant as the Arctic Circle and Siberia. Southern right whales are visible in the water surrounding the national park during their <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrations</b> between July and November and Australian sea lions can be seen on rocks and small islands off the coast.|$|R

5|$|The great {{northern}} tilefish has {{a unique}} burrowing behavior and habitat preference. In addition to their unique habitat choice, golden tilefish display sexually dimorphic growth with males growing to larger sizes and are behaviorally dominant over their female counterparts. The {{great northern tilefish}} is not a migratory fish; it stays in one local area that fits its needs all year round. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> may occur with changes in the water temperatures around the Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank during the winter or spring, but this theory has no definitive evidence. A competing theory suggests that tilefish may instead reduce their activity or hibernate within their burrows during times of cold temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens or Cheval de Mérens, still {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} by the older name of Ariégeois pony, is a small, rustic horse native to the Pyrenees and Ariégeois mountains of southern France, where the Ariège River flows, and northern Spain, near Andorra. Two general types, a small, light traditional mountain horse and a taller, sportier modern type, are found. Always black in color, Mérens must meet strict physical standards {{in order to be}} registered in the stud book. The breed is known for its sure-footedness on mountain terrain, as well as for its endurance, hardiness and docility. The French breed registry organizes regional offices, and partners with other national organizations in Europe to preserve and promote the breed. The organization enforces rigorous selection of breeding stock, with a goal of increasing quality in the breed. In the past, the Mérens was used for farm work, draft work and as pack horses. Today it is mainly used as a saddle horse, although some members of the breed have been successful in carriage driving. Many Mérens are taken on an annual transhumance (<b>seasonal</b> <b>migration),</b> in which they are moved higher in the mountains during the summer and into the valleys for the winter. An old practice, it fell into disfavor, but has recently re-emerged.|$|E
25|$|The {{circular}} {{patterns of}} migration {{can be divided}} into several categories: <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration,</b> non-seasonal low-wage labor, and the movement of professionals, academics, and transnational entrepreneurs. Of these, <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> is the most familiar between high-income and low-income countries. Although it is mostly related to the agricultural sector, in can also apply to other industries that vary by season, such as tourism, landscaping, and construction.|$|E

25|$|Pastoralist {{strategies}} typify effective {{adaptation to}} the environment. Precipitation differences are evaluated by pastoralists. In East Africa, different animals are taken to specific regions throughout the year that correspond to the seasonal patterns of precipitation. Transhumance is the <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> of livestock and pastoralists between higher and lower pastures.|$|E
25|$|Tanzania has {{two major}} {{rainfall}} regimes: one is uni-modal (October–April) {{and the other}} is bi-modal (October–December and March–May). The former is experienced in southern, central, and western parts of the country, and the latter is found in the north from Lake Victoria extending east to the coast. The bi-modal regime is caused by the <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> of the Intertropical Convergence Zone.|$|E

25|$|For {{species of}} which {{only part of}} the {{population}} migrates, <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> is hard to determine. They can maintain themselves in part of their habitat but also reach areas where they cannot establish a permanent population. They only live there in the season that is most favorable for the species. Some of the species have the habit of returning to their permanent residence {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|By 1914, {{there were}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> (especially by masons) into the German-speaking Switzerland.

During the winter months, the villagers make timber vessels, spin linen, hemp and wool, and {{embroider}} handkerchiefs. Tourism is {{an important source of}} income, especially during the winter. The village center is home to many historic buildings. The local museum was opened in 1936.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{economy of}} the Basotho in Lesotho is based on rearing cattle. They practise a <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> between valley and high plateaus of the Maloti (basalt mountains of Lesotho). Pressure on pasture land has increased due to increases in population, as well as construction of large storage dams in these mountains to provide water to South Africa's arid industrial heartland. Growing pressure on pastures is contributing to degradation of sensitive grasslands and could contribute to sedimentation in man-made lakes.|$|E

40|$|Conservation and {{management}} for Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa), which inhabits steppes in Mongolia, northern China, and southern Russia, are urgently required. The Mongolian gazelle migrates {{hundreds or thousands}} of kilometers seasonally, however details of the migration routes are still unknown, because of difficulty in continuous tracking. The objectives in the present study are to describe the migration routes of Mongolian gazelles using satellite tracking, and to examine whether their <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrations</b> are influenced by change in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in their habitat. We captured four gazelles in Omnogobi Province and Dornogobi Province in Mongolia and tracked their location from October 2002 to October 2003. Satellite tracking provided details of their migration routes, and their cumulative moving distances were more than 1000 km. Sift of NDVI values derived from moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) satellite image between summer and winter ranges corresponded with <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrations</b> of gazelles in Omnogobi. In Dornogobi, NDVI values of the summer ranges were higher in summer and lower in winter than those of overall average, although NDVI values of the winter ranges were higher than those of the summer ranges almost throughout the year. The gazelles seem to migrate seasonally, depending on the seasonal change of habitat quality between summer and winter ranges. NDVI was an effective indicator for evaluating the gazelle habitat. Therefore, it could explain <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrations</b> of the gazelles. However, the <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrations</b> in some areas were not explained by the NDVI sift...|$|R

Terjem leaders accused the Mahria of kidnapping a Terjem boy, while Mahria leaders said the Terjem had been stealing their animals. Ali Mahamoud Mohammed, the wali, or governor, of South Darfur, said the fighting began in December when the Mahria drove their camels south in a <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration,</b> trampling through Terjem territory near the Bulbul River. Fighting resumed in July 2007.|$|E
25|$|Absent the use {{of trade}} to access resources, {{economic}} transactions were essentially intra-lineage obligations of labor. These lineages required a base level of self-sufficiency to achieve autarky. In the Andes, a long mountain range with {{a great variety of}} ecozones and resources, the need to access the proper lands for specific crops or animals meant lineages created miniature colonies or sent <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> (such as transhumance) in different ecoregions. As the Andes are a relatively young mountain range, there is an especially great variation in waterfall and temperature, which has great importance for agriculture. This is all the more important as only about 2% of the land in the Andes is arable.|$|E
25|$|Nomadic pastoralists have {{a global}} food-producing {{strategy}} {{depending on the}} management of herd animals for meat, skin, wool, milk, blood, manure, and transport. Nomadic pastoralism is practiced in different climates and environments with daily movement and <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration.</b> Pastoralists {{are among the most}} flexible populations. Pastoralist societies have had field armed men protect their livestock and their people and then to return into a disorganized pattern of foraging. The products of the herd animals are the most important resources, although the use of other resources, including domesticated and wild plants, hunted animals, and goods accessible in a market economy are not excluded. The boundaries between states impact the viability of subsistence and trade relations with cultivators.|$|E

25|$|Both extant {{species are}} found at heights of between 1500 and 3000m asl in Mexico in {{isolated}} island-like forest habitats in the Sierra Madre, and are sometimes called snow parrots {{because of their}} high-altitude habitat. They show <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> patterns, generally breeding in the northern parts of their range and overwintering in the southern. The thick-billed parrot nests in tree cavities, while the maroon-fronted parrot is a cliff cavity breeder. The parrots roost at night in large flocks, while they forage during the day in smaller flocks over a large area. They feed primarily on pine seeds, which they extract by systematically stripping the cones from the base to the top. They also eat other seeds such as acorns, as well as softer foods such as fruits, bark, nectar, other vegetable matter, and insects.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{reasons are}} one {{motivation}} {{for people to}} illegally immigrate to the United States. United States employers hire illegal immigrants at wages substantially higher than they could earn in their native countries. A study of illegal immigrants from Mexico in the 1978 harvest season in Oregon showed that they earned six times what they could have earned in Mexico, and even after deducting {{the costs of the}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> and the additional expense of living in the United States, their net U.S. earnings were three times their Mexican alternative. In the 1960s and early 70s, Mexico's high fertility rate caused a large increase in population. While Mexican population growth has slowed, the large numbers of people born in the 1960s and 70s are now of working age looking for jobs.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{much of the}} 20th century, a {{great deal}} of {{circular}} migration existed between the United States and Mexico. In general, this movement was <b>seasonal</b> <b>migration</b> spurred by the agricultural sector, and border crossings were frequently undocumented {{due to the lack of}} a border patrol. From 1942 to 1964, the Bracero Program facilitated the temporary migration of more than 4 million workers, often for multiple contracts that allowed for them to return repeatedly to the United States. Following this, the United States shifted towards stricter border control and began to grant fewer visas, disrupting the trend of circular migration. Because of the risks associated with illegal immigration, many former circular migrants began to settle permanently in the United States, though circular migration is still a common phenomenon in U.S.-Mexico immigration relations.|$|E
