40|$|Context. The {{negative}} effects of agricultural intensification and policies, use of pesticides, fertilisers and mechanised harvesting on several populations of pseudo-steppe birds have increasingly required more detailed and effective habitat suitability models. Distribution models of farmland species are prone to incur recordings of false absence data. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) allows identification of environmental predictors of species distribution by using presence data only. Aims. We quantified the diurnal habitat preferences and niche width of one steppe species, the <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> (Burhinus oedicnemus), with unfavourable conservations status in a Mediterranean area and reclassified a map with respect to habitat suitability classes according to the resulting distribution model. Methods. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis was used with GIS cartography customised with habitat and anthropogenic variables recorded during field surveys carried out in four study plots (500 ha) and at different spatial scales. Key results. The <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> selected areas with low vegetation cover, such as fields following artichoke harvesting and tillage, close to rural buildings and unpaved roads. In contrast, the <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> avoided areas with high vegetation cover and areas highly disturbed by human-induced fires. The occurrence of natural vegetation was neither preferred nor avoided. The most robust model {{was based on a}} large-scale analysis (200 mfrom the bird location points), according to which the optimal area for <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> distribution during its breeding season was restricted to 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: Substantial {{new housing}} and {{infrastructure}} development planned within England {{has the potential}} to conflict with the nature conservation interests of protected sites. The Breckland area of eastern England (the Brecks) is designated as a Special Protection Area for a number of bird species, including the <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> (for which it holds more than 60 % of the UK total population). We explore the effect of buildings and roads on the spatial distribution of <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> nests across the Brecks in order to inform strategic development plans to avoid adverse effects on such European protected sites. Methodology: Using data across all years (and subsets of years) over the period 1988 – 2006 but restricted to habitat areas of arable land with suitable soils, we assessed nest density in relation to the distances to nearest settlements and to major roads. Measures of the local density of nearby buildings, roads and traffic levels were assessed using normal kernel distance-weighting functions. Quasi-Poisson generalised linear mixed models allowing for spatial auto-correlation were fitted. Results: Significantly lower densities of <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> nests were found at distances up to 1500 m from settlements, and distances up to 1000 m or more from major (trunk) roads. The best fitting models involved optimally distance-weighted variables for the extent of nearby buildings and the trunk road traffic levels. Significance : The results and predictions from this study of past data suggests there is cause for concern that future housing development and associated road infrastructure within the Breckland area could have negative impacts on the nesting <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> population. Given the strict legal protection afforded to the SPA the planning and conservation bodies have subsequently agreed precautionary restrictions on building development within the distances identified and used the modelling predictions to agree mitigation measures for proposed trunk road developments...|$|R

40|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>Curlew,</b> albeit {{claimed to}} be a wader bird of wetlands, is more biased towards dry or {{semi-dry}} shores of wetlands and open grasslands in Kurukshetra environs. Although, reported to be a nocturnal bird, it was often observed in day time here. The diurnal visibility of nocturnal Stone Curlews in Kurukshetra certainly points towards its distracted, disturbed, fragmented, scarce habitat so as to compel it to take shelter beside walls in a most unsafe state. The present studies hint towards the fact that, they are summer migratory often seen between April to September but certainly not in November, December and January. They shuttle between different spot in a given area indicating its habitat range up to 1 to 3 km or so. They are facing difficult circumstances due to loss of habitat; so much so, their feeding spots are not traceable at all. This study proves that the scattered and isolated groups of a nocturnal bird like <b>Stone</b> <b>Curlew</b> are compelled to retire in full view of one and all during daytime and hence are immensely vulnerable. Their survival is threatened. Given the continuance of present adverse conditions, they will no more be seen in the next 10 - 15 years in Haryana, specially in Kurukshetra...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found {{that a large number of}} bird species avoid nesting near to roads. This is true of the <b>stone</b> <b>curlew,</b> which was {{previously}} found to have a greatly reduced nest density near to major roads in England. The <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> has undergone long-term population declines and is one of the most threatened breeding birds in the UK. It is important to understand if disturbance from roads has an effect on the population size and why they avoid it if the conservation importance of this issue is to be assessed. Using a model of local nest density on arable farmland on suitable soils, in relation to proximity of three road types in the same analysis, nesting stone curlews were found to significantly avoid motorways and trunk A (MT) roads in each year of the period 1985 - 2000, except for 1989. Non-trunk A (A) roads were significantly avoided in most years B (B) roads were significantly avoids in each year from 1996 to 2000. Throughout, MT roads were avoided more strongly than A roads, which were avoided more strongly than B roads. Avoidance of MT roads increased through time but that of the other two road types did not. Traffic on MT roads increased more rapidly through time than that on A roads. During the study period the <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> breeding population size increased. Juvenile, one-year-old and older bird survival decreased neither through time nor with increasing population size. Breeding probability for one-, two- and three-year olds decreased neither through time nor with increasing population size. Productivity decreased neither through time nor with increasing population size. There was no significant effect of road proximity on egg size, nest success, chick growth rate, chick survival or adult survival. There was a higher proportion of less-competitive than strongly-competitive breeding stone curlews near to roads. Natal dispersal of those born near to major roads was not greater than that of those born further away. Those that bred near to MT roads dispersed significantly further to their breeding site in the subsequent year. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean {{region is}} {{considered}} a hotspot of biodiversity and consequently, a priority area for conservation worldwide {{in terms of both}} animal and plant species richness. Due to the uniqueness of habitats and the peculiar features of transitional zone, Mediterranean region's fauna and flora (often endemisms) are highly sensitive to environmental and climate changes. Steppic birds are one of the group mainly suffering from environmental changes and human disturbance. In Europe the mechanization and intensification of agriculture and the change in the land use led to a severe decline of many steppic species. This situation is often worsened by the fact that many steppe bird species have small resident populations isolated in small remnants of suitable habitat, which are often distantly located from each other with limited dispersal opportunities. In order to delineate appropriate conservation plans, understanding of the current population structure of a given species of conservation concern and delineating the exchanges among different populations, as well as their interaction with the habitat, are crucial. In particular for migratory species, the identification of year-round geographical ranges and the quantification of the degree of migratory connectivity are fundamental to exactly define the range where the conservation efforts should be addressed. This PhD project was focused on <b>Stone</b> <b>curlew</b> Burhinus oedicnemus. The <b>Stone</b> <b>curlew</b> is a steppic bird species of conservation concern in Europe whose genetic structure, ecology and spatial behaviour are relatively poorly investigated. The aims of this project were several. Firstly, the level of genetic diversity and rate of exchanges were investigated by means of mitochondrial and nuclear markers among different populations representing the four subspecies inhabiting {{the western part of the}} species' distribution range. In particular continental and insular populations were analysed in order to evaluate the genetic structure and the congruence between morphological subspecies and geographic samples. Furthermore, we tested for sex-biased dispersal, comparing patterns of genetic differentiation estimated separately for the sexes by nuclear markers (microsatellites) and comparing the differently inherited markers. Both markers support significant differentiation of the Canary Island populations from those sampled in the Mediterranean basin. Besides, inside Mediterranean basin a relevant level of nuclear genetic diversity was found, with the distinction of several population groups, in particular insular populations, as well as in the Canary Islands. Consequently the four subspecies were confirmed. Microsatellites resulted more efficient than mtDNA markers to detect the differentiation between populations and subspecies, and although sex biased dispersal was not revealed by the specific tests applied to sexed individuals, the different marker performances suggest a probable low dispersal rate, biased in favour of females. Secondly, the wintering areas and migration strategy of a Stone-curlew population breeding in the Taro River Regional Park (Parma, northern Italy) were studied by integrating the information obtained by geolocation and satellite telemetry. Results indicate that tagged Stone-curlews did not leave the Mediterranean basin throughout the year and passed the winter in Sardinia or in Tunisia. Furthermore, GPS loggers resulted useful tools in order to accurately track the birds movements and describe in details the spatial movements of tagged individuals. Although preliminary, the results obtained by the satellite telemetry represent the first evidences of the migration strategy and wintering behaviour of <b>Stone</b> <b>curlew.</b> Both geolocators and GPS loggers results prove the great potential of the use of tracking devices to provide information about migration and non-breeding sites for an elusive species, such as <b>Stone</b> <b>curlew,</b> for which mark-recapture/re-sighting techniques revealed profound limitations. In conclusion, the results presented in this PhD thesis reveal high intraspecific genetic variability in the Western Palaearctic Stone curlews and enlighten a crucial role of islands, both as reservoir of genetic diversity and favourable sites for the species during the whole year. In fact the recorded wintering sites coincided with areas where breeding, possible resident, populations are reported, further emphasising the importance of these areas for the conservation of the <b>Stone</b> <b>curlew</b> throughout the annual cycle...|$|R

40|$|The Eurasian <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> (Burhinus oedicnemus) is {{classified}} as a species of conservation concern in Europe, mainly due to its population decline which has been caused by the loss and fragmentation of reproductive habitat. Current availability of detailed information on its biology is quite poor and is mostly limited to studies on English populations; these breed on {{the northern edge of}} the European range and use quite different habitats from the Mediterranean populations. The aim of this thesis was to investigate some aspects of the ecology and behaviour of stone curlews breeding in a poorly known habitat, i. e. river, which is an important breeding habitat for Italian populations. In particular, the <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> population nesting in the Parco Regionale Fluviale del Taro (Parma, Italy) was studied; this area hosts one of the largest populations in continental Italy. Hatching success, moult strategies during the breeding season and the spatial behaviour of the species were all investigated. Since the study population primarily breeds in the riverbed, the influence of the river dynamic on hatching success was examined. Nests were monitored periodically, inter alia, using temperature loggers, which limited disturbance by significantly reducing the number of visits. Furthermore, the availability of data on the precise failure date of nests improved the estimates of survival rate and provided some useful insights into the possible causes of failure. Parameters such as mean temperature and the amount of rainfall during the breeding season did not have any effect on hatching success. However, nest survival was lower in years not preceded by significant autumn-winter river flows. This suggests that hatching success could be at least partially related to the river dynamic, which determines the characteristics of nest sites by removing vegetation on the riverbed and by reshaping the river course. The open habitat around nests could limit predation risk, by increasing the detection probability of terrestrial predators and by reducing the number of perches used by corvids to prey on eggs. One of the most interesting aspects regarding moult strategies was the extensive overlap between the moult and breeding season. Primary moult in the study population was very slow, starting {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season (May) and ending in October. Secondary moult was much more irregular and, even though it started when birds were still nesting, most of the secondaries were replaced during the post-reproductive period. Secondary moult was not completed within a single moult cycle: innermost and outermost secondaries were more likely to be shed than those at the centre of this tract and juvenile secondaries were not shed during the first year. On the whole, the observed combination of early commencement of wing moult and extensive overlap between moult and the breeding season is relatively uncommon among waders and, more generally, among other avian species breeding in temperate regions. This could be interpreted as a strategy to maximize hatching success (which was quite low in the study area) through re-nesting potential, i. e. by spreading the cost of moult over a prolonged time period. The results of a comparative analysis performed among wader species of the Palaearctic area were consistent with this hypothesis: species with a prolonged breeding season also showed considerable overlap between moult and the breeding season. In relation to <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> spatial behaviour, attention was focused on the analysis of the environmental features that influence the bird’s feeding choice and on the interaction between birds and human activities (chiefly agricultural) in the study area. During the day birds concentrated their activity almost exclusively in the riverbed, whilst at night they regularly commuted from breeding sites to feeding areas (mostly farmland) a few kilometres away. In these areas, stone curlews showed a clear preference for recently mown crops (mainly forage and wheat) and piles of farmyard manure. Habitat preference is closely linked to the predominant agricultural activity of the study area, namely a high density of farms producing ‘Parmigiano-Reggiano’. This provides a wide range of suitable foraging sites close to nesting territories. The ability of <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> to breed successfully in fairly intensive farmland, could help to explain the high density of breeding pairs recorded in the study area. We propose that the conservation of <b>stone</b> <b>curlew</b> in this habitat could potentially be achieved only by a synergistic management of both natural and agricultural habitats...|$|R
40|$|Niche theory {{predicts that}} coexisting species with similar trophic {{requirements}} should demonstrate resource partitioning, particularly where resources are scarce.

This study analyses the patterns of spatial coexistence and habitat selection, on two spatial scales, of three species of semidesert regions in Morocco: the Black-bellied Sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis), the <b>Stone</b> <b>Curlew</b> (Burhinus oedicnemus) and the Cream-coloured Courser (Cursorius cursor). Co-occurrence analysis results point to between-species segregation on a macrohabitat scale. Hotelling's T test of the species-presence data showed a pattern of macrohabitat selection that diverged from habitat availability for the three species with differences among them. Both the classification tree and the pattern of microhabitat selection obtained by model averaging showed scant overlap between the Sandgrouse and the Courser, suggesting habitat partitioning between them on a fine scale. Our results confirm spatial segregation of the three species, especially between species with different trophic strategies: the Sandgrouse versus the <b>Stone</b> <b>Curlew</b> and the Courser.
