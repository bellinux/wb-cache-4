40|$|We present {{computer}} {{tools to}} help speech-language pathologists (SLP) in counting disfluencies, for both real-time and transcriptbased counts. The latter {{tend to be}} more precise and show which words are involved in each disfluency. Our approach allows real-time counts to be used as the basis for transcript-based counts. We employ automatic speech recognition to generate a word transcript (for read-speech samples), and then automatically merge the disfluency annotations with the word transcript, and have the SLP review parts of the audio file where a disfluency annotation was placed. This approach results in improved disfluency annotations, and can be done in 3 times real-time. Index Terms: <b>stuttering,</b> <b>disfluency</b> counts, user-interface 1...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} experiments where automatic acoustic al-gorithms initially {{intended to}} be used on Czech stuttering speak-ers were applied on recordings of German stuttering speak-ers. Four algorithms based on voice activity and abrupt spectral changes detection are introduced. The database consists of 34 speakers. The measure, the number of abrupt spectral changes in speech segments, reached a correlation with fluency rating of 0. 85. The other measures have also good agreement with subjective evaluation. Results indicate {{that it could be}} basically possible to do language–independent analysis of stuttering, here demonstrated on read recordings of German speakers.

40|$|This paper reviews Bloodstein's (1975) Anticipatory Struggle Hypothesis of stuttering, {{identifies}} its weaknesses, and proposes {{modifications to}} bring it into line with recent advances in psycholinguistic theory. The review concludes that the Anticipatory Struggle Hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the variation in the severity of <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluencies</b> across speaking situations and conversation partners. However, it fails to explain the forms that <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluencies</b> characteristically take or the subjective experience of loss of control that accompanies them. The paper then describes how the forms and subjective experiences of persistent stuttering can {{be accounted for by}} a threshold-based regulatory mechanism of the kind described in Howell's (2003) revision of the EXPLAN hypothesis. It then proposes that shortcomings of both the Anticipatory Struggle and EXPLAN hypotheses can be addressed by combining them together to create a 'Variable Release Threshold' hypothesis whereby the anticipation of upcoming difficulty leads to the setting of an excessively high threshold for the release of speech plans for motor execution. The paper also reconsiders the possibility that two stuttering subtypes exist: one related to formulation difficulty and other to difficulty initiating motor execution. It concludes that research findings that relate to the one may not necessarily apply to the other. Learning outcomes: After reading this article, the reader will be able to: (1) summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of Bloodstein's Anticipatory Struggle Hypothesis; (2) describe two hypothesized mechanisms behind the production of <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluencies</b> (tension and fragmentation & release threshold mechanisms); and (3) discuss why the notion of anticipation is relevant to current hypotheses of stuttering. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{influence}} of phonotactic probability, which is the frequency of different sound segments and segment sequences, on the overall fluency with which words are produced by preschool children who stutter (CWS) as well as to determine whether it has an effect on the type of <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluency</b> produced. Method: A 500 + word language sample was obtained from 19 CWS. Each stuttered word was randomly paired with a fluently produced word that closely matched it in grammatical class, word length, familiarity, word and neighborhood frequency, and neighborhood density. Phonotactic probability values were obtained for the stuttered and fluent words from an online database. Results: Phonotactic probability did not have a significant influence on the overall susceptibility of words to stuttering, but it did impact the type of <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluency</b> produced. In specific, single-syllable word repetitions were significantly lower in phonotactic probability than fluently produced words, part-word repetitions, and sound prolongations. Conclusions: In general, the differential impact of phonotactic probability on the type of stuttering-like disfluency produced by young CWS provides some support for the notion that different disfluency types may originate in the disruption of different levels of processing...|$|R
40|$|Recently, some {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} acquired <b>stuttering,</b> <b>disfluencies</b> that begin in adulthood. The nature of acquired stuttering differs in several respects from developmental stuttering. A case of acquired stuttering following drug overdose is presented and contrasted with previously reported cases. The case is noteworthy in that, while many characteristics of acquired stuttering are evidenced, several symptoms associated with developmental stuttering are also observed. The findings are discussed in terms of a possible link between developmental and acquired forms of stuttering...|$|R
40|$|The {{criterion}} of 3 % of <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluencies</b> – (part-) word repetitions, sound prolongations and blocks – is often suggested to diagnose the stuttering in children (e. g., Boey et al., 2007; Yairi & Ambrose, 2005). There is a long-lasting debate among scholars about {{the relevance of}} considering monosyllabic word repetitions as <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluencies,</b> given their high frequency in typically developing children (e. g., Howell, 2013; Wingate, 2001). Yet, these are the prime characteristics that prompt identification of early stuttering by parents (Yairi & Ambrose, 2013). Nevertheless, very few normative data exist concerning the disfluencies occurring in the speech of normally fluent children (Tumanova et al., 2014), and none exist in French. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the need for reference data in French in order to distinguish typical developmental <b>disfluency</b> from <b>stuttering.</b> We used the CHAT transcription system and the coding conventions of FluencyBank to transcribe and analyse the speech disfluencies of twenty monolingual, French speaking children who do not stutter, aged 4 years. FluencyBank (Bernstein-Ratner & MacWhinney) is a shared database for the study of the development of fluency in both normal and disordered populations. It is a project of Talkbank that seeks to archive and facilitate sharing of data relevant to fluency research. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the speech-gesture relationship of chronic adult stutterers {{in comparison to}} fluent controls based on previous work by McNeill (1979, 1986). Significant {{differences were found in}} the speech and gesture characteristics of the narratives of stutterers as compared to fluent controls on a cartoon retelling task. Stutterers produced fewer cartoon details in their speech and fewer meanings per gesture. As well, stutterers were unable to begin a representational gesture at the same moment as a <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluency</b> resulting in the freezing of gestures or maintaining the hand at rest. A second experiment showed that stutterers were able to maintain and initiate non-communicative hand movements at the same moment as stuttering. Gesture did not replace speech during moments of stuttering even though manual movement during stuttering was possible. The results demonstrate the strength of the speech-gesture relationship and show that stuttering affects both modalities of expression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Automatic {{detection}} of syllable repetition {{is one of}} the important parameter in assessing the stuttered speech objectively. The existing method which uses artificial neural network (ANN) requires high levels of agreement as prerequisite before attempting to train and test ANNs to separate fluent and nonfluent. We propose automatic detection method for syllable repetition in read speech for objective assessment of <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluencies</b> which uses a novel approach and has four stages comprising of segmentation, feature extraction, score matching and decision logic. Feature extraction is implemented using well know Mel frequency Cepstra coefficient (MFCC). Score matching is done using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) between the syllables. The Decision logic is implemented by Perceptron based on the score given by score matching. Although many methods are available for segmentation, in this paper it is done manually. Here the assessment by human judges on the read speech of 10 adults who stutter are described using corresponding method and the result was 83 %...|$|R
40|$|Williams {{syndrome}} (WS) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder, {{often referred}} as being characterized by dissociation between verbal and non-verbal abilities, {{although the number}} of studies disputing this proposal is emerging. Indeed, although they have been traditionally reported as displaying increased speech fluency, this topic has not been fully addressed in research. In previous studies carried out {{with a small group of}} individuals with WS, we reported speech breakdowns during conversational and autobiographical narratives suggestive of language difficulties. In the current study, we characterized the speech fluency profile using an ecologically based measure – a narrative task (story generation) was collected from a group of individuals with WS (n = 30) and typically developing group (n = 39) matched in mental age. Oral narratives were elicited using a picture stimulus – the cookie theft picture from Boston Diagnosis Aphasia Test. All narratives were analyzed according to typology and frequency of fluency breakdowns (non-stuttered and <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluencies).</b> Oral narratives in WS group differed from typically developing group, mainly due to a significant increase in the frequency of disfluencies, particularly in terms of hesitations, repetitions and pauses. This is the first evidence of disfluencies in WS using an ecologically based task (oral narrative task), suggesting that these speech disfluencies may represent a significant marker of language problems in WS.

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} {{experience}} of stuttering can result from the speaker's anticipation of his words being misrecognized. Twelve adults who stutter (AWS) repeated single words into {{what appeared to be}} an automatic speech-recognition system. Following each iteration of each word, participants provided a self-rating of whether they stuttered on it and the computer then provided feedback implying its correct or incorrect recognition of it. Each word was repeated four times. Unbeknown to participants, 'Correct' and 'Incorrect' recognition of words by the system was pre-determined and bore no relation to the actual quality of participants' iterations of those words. For words uttered in the 'Correct recognition' condition, the likelihood of AWS self-reporting stuttering on a word diminished across iterations, whereas for words in the 'Incorrect recognition' condition it remained static. On the basis of the findings it is argued that: (a) in AWS, the anticipation that a word will be misrecognized increases the relative likelihood of stuttering on that word in the future; and (b) this effect is independent of the degree of difficulty inherent in the formulation and motor execution of the word itself, although it may interact with it. Mechanisms that can account for these findings and yet are also congruent with the wider range of evidence from psycholinguistic and speech motor control domains are discussed. It is concluded that <b>stuttered</b> <b>disfluencies</b> may best be explained as resulting from the inappropriate functioning of covert repair and/or variable release threshold mechanisms in response to the anticipation of communication failure. Learning outcomes: This article informs readers about two different theoretical approaches to explaining developmental stuttering: (1) stuttering as an adaptation response to an underlying impairment; and (2) stuttering as an anticipatory struggle response. It describes how these approaches account for different symptoms of the disorder, and proposes that both theoretical approaches are needed in order to fully account for the range of symptoms and experimental findings associated with stuttering. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{annotation}} scheme for disfluencies. Unlike previous schemes, this scheme allows complex disfluencies with multiple backtracking points to be annotated, which {{are common in}} stuttered speech. The scheme specifies each disfluency in terms of word-level annotations, thus making the scheme useful for building sophisticated language models of disfluencies. As determining the annotation codes is quite difficult, we have developed a pen and paper procedure in which the annotator lines up the words into rows and columns, from which it is straight-forward for the annotator to determine the annotation tags.

40|$|AbstractInroductionNeurogenic {{stuttering}} is {{an acquired}} disorder of speech fluency in adults resulting most commonly from {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) and stroke. Neurogenic stuttering frequently co-occurs with aphasia and dysarthria. It {{is important to consider}} what makes the core of neurogenic <b>stuttering</b> and which <b>disfluencies</b> are related to aphasia. MethodsWe examined neurogenic stuttering characteristics in five male patients with TBI. Speech fluency was assessed in three tasks. The new guideline for identifying stuttering and discriminating it from co-occurring speech and language deficiencies was created. ResultsWe found out that a) stuttering frequencies varied between different speech tasks, b) the most common stuttering type was repetition and c) the severity of stuttering increased linearly as the cognitive demands of the task increased and so did the types of stuttering. ConclusionMore {{research in the area of}} neurogenic stuttering is needed, especially for developing valid and reliable methods that take into account co-occurring speech and language deficiencies and communicative demands in various discourses...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE:There {{have been}} few studies on the risk factors for subgroups of stuttering. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{characterize}} the risk factors for developmental familial stuttering among boys who stutter and who do not <b>stutter,</b> such as <b>disfluency</b> types, associated quality and communication factors, emotional and physical stress, familial attitudes and personal reactions. DESIGN AND SETTING:Analytical cross-sectional study with a control group, performed at the Fluency Studies Laboratory of the Department of Speech and Hearing Disorders of a public university. METHODS: The parents of 40 age-matched stuttering and non-stuttering boys took part in this study. The participants were divided into two groups: stuttering children (SC) and non-stuttering children (NSC), with ages between 6 years 0 months and 11 years 11 months. Initially, all of the participants underwent a fluency assessment and then data were gathered using the Protocol for the Risk of Developmental Stuttering. RESULTS:There were no differences in the physical stress distribution factors and personal reactions between the groups. Inappropriate familial attitudes were presented by 95 % of the SC and 30 % of the NSC. Four risk factors analyzed were not shown by the NSC, namely stuttering-like disfluency, quality factors, physical stress and emotional stresses. CONCLUSIONS:The findings suggest that the presence of stuttering-like disfluency, associated quality and communication factors, emotional stress and inappropriate family attitudes are important risk factors for familial developmental stuttering among boys...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: to {{evaluate}} and compare the fluency between the familial and the sporadic persistent developmental stuttering, characterizing the typology {{and the frequency of}} the disfluencies, the speech rate and the severity of the stuttering. METHOD: 40 participants aged from 6 to 42 years old, divided in two groups with twenty participants in each one: Familial Persistent Developmental Stuttering and Sporadic Persistent Developmental Stuttering. The procedures used were: clinical and familial history, assessment of fluency and Stuttering Severity Instrument. RESULTS: there were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding the frequency of <b>stuttering</b> like <b>disfluencies,</b> the flow of syllables and words per minute and the severity of stuttering. It was noted a tendency of the group with familial stuttering to show a bigger variability of the severity of stuttering, going from mild to very severe, whereas in the group with sporadic stuttering, the severity varied from mild to severe. CONCLUSION: this study represents the first effort to the characterization of the speech fluency profile of the subgroups of people who stutter, namely familial persistent developmental stuttering and sporadic persistent developmental stuttering. It is possible to conclude that the speech fluency profile of people who stutter, independently of the familial history, is similar. It is noteworthy that the occurrence of some stuttering-like disfluencies, monosyllabic word repetition, block and intrusion were different between groups. OBJETIVO: avaliar e comparar a fluência de indivíduos com Gagueira Desenvolvimental Persistente Familial e de indivíduos com Gagueira Desenvolvimental Persistente Isolada, caracterizando a tipologia das disfluências, a porcentagem de disfluências, a taxa de elocução e a gravidade da gagueira. MÉTODO: participaram 40 indivíduos, entre 6 e 42 anos de idade, divididos em dois grupos de 20 participantes cada um: Gagueira Desenvolvimental Persistente Familial e Gagueira Desenvolvimental Persistente Isolada. Os procedimentos utilizados nos grupos foram: histórias clínica e familial, avaliação da fluência e Instrumento de Gravidade da Gagueira. RESULTADOS: não houve diferenças estatisticamente significantes entre os grupos quanto à porcentagem de disfluências gagas, ao fluxo de sílabas e palavras por minuto, e a gravidade da gagueira. Nota-se uma tendência do grupo de pessoa com gagueira familial apresentar uma maior variabilidade da gravidade da gagueira, que foi de leve a muito grave, enquanto que, no grupo de pessoas com gagueira isolada, a gravidade variou de leve a grave. CONCLUSÃO: este estudo representa um primeiro esforço para a caracterização do perfil da fluência de subgrupos de pessoas que gaguejam, a saber, gagueira desenvolvimental persistente familial e gagueira desenvolvimental persistente isolada. Pode-se concluir que o perfil da fluência de pessoas com gagueira, independente do histórico familial, é semelhante. Vale ressaltar que a ocorrência de algumas tipologias gagas, repetição de palavra monossilábica, bloqueio e intrusão foram distintas entre os grupos...|$|R
