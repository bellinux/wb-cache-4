5|$|After {{evaluating}} the imagery sent {{down from the}} late inspection, the ground team officially cleared the orbiter's thermal protection system for re-entry. Initially, NASA had planned on releasing Endeavour from its <b>stand-by</b> status following the late inspection, but managers on the ground decided to wait until Atlantis had performed the de-orbit burn before standing down the STS-400 rescue mission officially.|$|E
5|$|Star Alliance Silver {{status is}} given to {{customers}} who have reached a premium level of a member carrier's frequent-flyer program.

5|$|The {{project is}} funded through an equity {{contribution}} of about USD 200m from Diwaco, a USD 300m grant and a USD 100m <b>stand-by</b> facility from the Jordanian government, {{as well as}} USD 475m in foreign loans to Diwaco. The project's total cost {{is expected to be}} $1.1 billion USD. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation has lent USD 250m to Diwaco to support U.S. foreign investment on the basis that General Electric partially owns GAMA Energy. The state-owned French bank PROPARCO, which is the part of the French Development Agency (AFD) that supports private sector development, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) each lent about USD 100m to Diwaco. The loan package has been put together by the Arab Banking Corporation. Much of the government grant supporting the project comes from sovereign soft loans that the government of Jordan has borrowed from the EIB and AFD and passes on as a grant to the project. AFD provided USD 50m for the state grant and USD 48m for the <b>stand-by</b> facility.|$|E

5|$|Despite the block, Salmaniya Medical Complex's {{disaster}} {{plan was}} activated {{on the morning}} of the attack. It called for more than a dozen ambulances to search nearby areas and Pearl Roundabout. Another dozen ambulances were put on <b>stand-by,</b> according to a member of the medical staff. The staff said that ambulances were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered all but two ambulances to head back to the SMC. However, this order was ignored and more ambulances were sent to search for the injured in the areas surrounding the roundabout.|$|E
5|$|In its time, Dunston B Power Station ranked {{consistently}} in England's leading stations, both {{in terms}} of thermal efficiency and cost per unit of electricity. However, the station eventually became outdated, and notification of its partial closure was given in October 1975, with some units being closed the following October. It was then only used as a <b>stand-by</b> station, operating only at peak electrical demand times. Finally, after some units having been in operation for about 40years, the station ceased to generate electricity on 26 October 1981. At the time of closure, only 98MW of the station's capacity was in use.|$|E

5|$|By mid-afternoon {{of the day}} of the programme, protesters {{had begun}} {{gathering}} outside Television Centre and there were also protesters outside regional BBC offices. By 4.30pm (BST) police estimated there were 500 chanting protesters; around 25 people who reached the main entrance of Television Centre after breaking through a cordon were expelled. They were {{part of a group of}} about 40 people that had made a dash for an iron gate that had been left open. After this breach, <b>stand-by</b> officers reinforced the police cordon and protesters moved to block Wood Lane, hoping to prevent Griffin entering the studios. Griffin arrived at 5.17pm unnoticed and entered on foot through a rear entrance on Frithville Road. It was reported that around 600 people had turned up to protest against Griffin.|$|E
5|$|News {{stations}} were stationed with crews along the Jersey shore {{several days in}} advance of Isabel to provide breaking news and live conditions. Many residents prepared their houses by boarding windows and purchasing emergency supplies. The Sussex County chapter of the American Red Cross advised local high schools to be on <b>stand-by</b> as potential shelters in the event evacuation occurred. Emergency coordinators in several counties were on alert, though none issued evacuations. In preparation for anticipated power outages, the Jersey Central Power and Light company arranged to receive more electrical crews from its parent company, FirstEnergy. Other utility workers from various locations as far as Canada left for {{the state in the}} event of power outages.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 was {{the only}} planned shuttle mission after the Columbia {{accident}} to be launched into a low-inclination orbit that did not allow rendezvous with the International Space Station. Due to the inclination and other orbit parameters of Hubble, Atlantis would {{have been unable to}} use the International Space Station as a safe haven in the event of structural or mechanical failure. To preserve NASA's post-Columbia requirement of having shuttle Launch On Need (LON) rescue capability, STS-400 was the flight designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) mission which would have been flown by Endeavour in the event Atlantis became disabled during STS-125. After Atlantis performed the late inspection and was cleared for re-entry, Endeavour was officially released from <b>stand-by</b> status on Thursday, 21 May.|$|E

5|$|The cost of {{constructing}} {{the network has}} been covered by the ministry. The costs of operating and maintaining the network are covered by the users, who also purchase their own terminals. Payment to the directorate is by an annual subscription fee per terminal, based on the terminal's use. For a terminal only used for <b>stand-by,</b> the annual subscription cost is NOK1,700 per year (2016), while that for a terminal in a control room is NOK45,000 (2016). As the cost of running the network is fixed independently {{of the amount of}} traffic, there is no cost for using the network. As additional users start implementing the system, the costs per subscriber will be reduced.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, President Fernando de la Rúa took office, seeking {{assistance}} from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion <b>stand-by</b> arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to {{the complete loss of}} market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} war ended in August 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur V. Peterson, the Manhattan District officer with overall {{responsibility}} for the production of fissile material, recommended that the S-50 plant be placed on <b>stand-by.</b> The Manhattan District ordered the plant shut down on 4 September 1945. It was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built, but its efficiency could not compete with that of a gaseous diffusion plant. The columns were drained and cleaned, and all employees were given two weeks' notice of impending termination of employment. All production had ceased by 9 September, and the last uranium hexafluoride feed was shipped to K-25 for processing. Layoffs began on 18 September. By this time, voluntary resignations had reduced the Fercleve payroll from its wartime peak of 1,600 workers to around 900. Only 241 remained at the end of September. Fercleve's contract was terminated on 31 October, and responsibility for the S-50 plant buildings was transferred to the K-25 office. Fercleve laid off the last employees on 16 February 1946.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC) {{served as}} the primary {{administrative}} body for coordinating preparatory and relief work during the 1999Odisha cyclone. Upon the storm's formation, the DAC requested the chief secretaries and relief commissioners of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal to begin storm preparations and initiate evacuations if necessary. Evacuations in Odisha involved nearly 150,000people living within 10km (6mi) of the coastline in five Odishan districts. Six districts maintained 23permanent cyclone shelters operated by the Indian Red Cross Society, eventually serving to house 30,000evacuees. At Paradip Port, twelve docked ships were evacuated out to sea to avoid the cyclone. In neighboring West Bengal, 200,000people were evacuated from the state's vulnerable low-lying islands. The Indian Army was placed on <b>stand-by,</b> and food supplies were stocked up in prone regions. Train service was cancelled for the areas expected to be impacted by the cyclone.|$|E
