5|$|In the flash-sideways scenes which {{depict the}} survivors' afterlife, Rousseau {{is still the}} mother of Alex and lives with her. Alex {{introduces}} her mother to Dr. Linus because he's been hurt after being battered by Desmond. Danielle and Alex bring him home for dinner. While Alex is doing her homework, Danielle and Dr. Linus talk about her.

5|$|Julia Martha Thomas was {{a former}} schoolteacher who had been twice widowed. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of her second husband in 1873, she had lived on her own at 2 Mayfield Cottages (also known as 2 Vine Cottages) in Park Road in Richmond. The house was a two-storey semi-detached villa built in grey stone with a garden at the front and back. The area was not heavily {{populated}} at the time, although her house was close to a public house called The Hole in the Wall.|$|E
5|$|Taylor gave up {{appealing}} {{his sentence}} after his request for retrial {{was rejected by}} the Utah Supreme Court. He became the second person to be executed by firing squad in the United States (after Gary Gilmore) <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty was reinstated in 1976. Taylor said he chose this method of execution to embarrass the state of Utah. On January 26, 1996, the day of Taylor's execution, legislation was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives to eliminate the firing squad.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 South African general {{election}} {{was held on}} 7 May 2014, to elect a new National Assembly and new provincial legislatures in each province.

5|$|The {{office of}} Prelate {{was held by}} the Lord Archbishop of Armagh, the most senior clergyman in the Church of Ireland. The Prelate was not {{mentioned}} in the original statutes, but created by a warrant shortly afterwards, apparently because the Archbishop at the time had asked to be appointed to the post. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of the last holder in 1885, the office of Prelate has remained vacant.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers and}} {{prestige}} {{of the prime minister}} have varied through the years. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's second prime minister, often lamented that in practice he had little power. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Pham Hung in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked 3rd in the order of precedence of the Communist Party's Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|A grand state funeral—not seen <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of PedroII's sister Paula in 1833—was {{held for}} the Prince Imperial at 7p.m. three days after his death. He {{was buried in the}} Convento da Ajuda (Convent of Aid) in Rio de Janeiro. When the convent was {{demolished}} in 1911 his remains were moved to the mausoleum of the Convento de Santo Antônio (Convent of Saint Anthony) in Rio de Janeiro, where other members of the Brazilian House of Braganza (including his younger brother Pedro, his uncle João and his aunt Paula) are also located.|$|E
50|$|The inquiry was {{hampered}} by {{the period of time}} that had elapsed <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths,</b> and because doctors could not say what effect swabbing with spirits of salts would have. Suspicions were further aroused when it was shown that Rendell had purchased large quantities of spirits of salts during the period of the children's illnesses, but none <b>since</b> <b>the</b> last <b>death.</b> Armed with this information the detectives obtained permission to exhume the bodies and this was done on 3 July 1909. Police exhumed the bodies of the three children; diluted hydrochloric acid was found on the throat tissue.|$|R

50|$|The 2009 Wujek-Śląsk mine blast {{occurred}} at the Wujek-Śląsk bituminous coal mine in Ruda Śląska, Poland on 18 September 2009. At least 20 miners were killed (12 died in coal mine, 8 in hospitals) and at least 37 more were hospitalised. It is the country's deadliest mining accident <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of 23 miners from methane at the Silesia's Halemba mine in November 2006. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> toll is expected to increase.|$|R
5|$|Betances' remains {{arrived in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then {{estimated}} at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near {{the port of}} San Juan as early as 4:00a.m. (AST) that morning, was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were surprised {{by the size of}} the crowd, given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the open) for the 31 years before his death, and had been dead over 21 years afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E
5|$|Later, new officer Ruth Evershed, {{transferred}} from Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), informs {{the team that}} Metropolitan Police have arrested Muhammed Ibhn Khaldun, an Algerian secret service agent. After his release Khaldun reveals that <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of his family, he desired to leave Algeria to work for British intelligence, so he fooled his agency into believing he was killed while stopping a jihadist group in France, before smuggling himself into England via a Channel Tunnel freight train. The team allow him to work undercover in Parkmount, posing as a labourer at the local university, where he quickly gains Rachid's trust. Beforehand however, Khaldun removes all the surveillance equipment on him. Furthermore, news of Khaldun's arrival also gains {{the interest of the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who also wish to use him.|$|E

50|$|According to some sources, in {{his early}} years Clinton was a death penalty {{opponent}} who switched positions. During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions <b>since</b> 1964 (<b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection.

5|$|On 18 December 1283, a {{few days}} after Ludgarda's funeral, Greater Poland {{witnessed}} an extremely important event for later history of Poland: the consecration of Jakub Świnka as Archbishop of Gniezno. The event took place in the Franciscan church in Kalisz and was extremely important because after twelve years (<b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> in 1271 of Archbishop Janusz Tarnowa) Poland wasn't a full-recognized prelate. Jakub Świnka received the papal nomination on 30 July 1283, however, because he was only a deacon, it was necessary to ordain him. This ceremony took place on 18 December and a day later Jakub received the episcopal consecration. The ceremony, according to sources, was assisted by five Polish bishops and Przemysł II, who gave the new Archbishop an expensive ring as a gift.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of {{his young}} {{daughter}} from leukaemia in 1992, Gunn has been extensively involved in fundraising to combat the disease and its effects. As of 2011 he {{has raised more than}} £1 million for research into childhood leukaemia. The money has been used to fund projects {{to improve the lives of}} children with leukaemia and their families, notably a national telephone support line. The city of Norwich recognised Gunn's charity work and his long association with the city's football club by naming him Sheriff for 2002. Published in 2006, his autobiography, In Where it Hurts: My Autobiography, includes a foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Still {{opposed to}} the return of Constantine I and Crown Prince George, the {{government}} of Eleftherios Venizelos offered the throne to Constantine's third son, Prince Paul, who refused to ascend the throne before his father and older brother unless a referendum named him head of state. Only days after Alexander's death, however, Venizelos was defeated in a general election. On 17 November, Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, regent <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Alexander, retired and the new prime minister, Dimitrios Rallis, asked Olga to assume the regency. She served as regent {{for about a month}} until her son Constantine returned to the throne on 19 December after a referendum in his favor.|$|E

5|$|The {{people were}} allowed to enter to the Congress on April 1, 10:00. Initially, it was {{intended}} to keep the Congress open until 20:00, but the number of people attending it forced to delay it for the morning of April 2. The event was attended by the former presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando de la Rúa, Eduardo Duhalde and Néstor Kirchner, {{all the members of the}} Supreme Court of Argentina, mayor Mauricio Macri, governor Daniel Scioli, the president of Uruguay Tabaré Vázquez and several other politicians. The Congress was visited by almost 40,000 people. It was the largest state funeral in Argentina <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Juan Perón in 1974.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the decade, major changes were made to the conductorship of the orchestra. In 2006 Daniel Harding joined Michael Tilson Thomas as {{principal}} guest, and the following year Davis retired as chief conductor and was appointed president of the orchestra, its first <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Bernstein in 1990. Davis was succeeded as chief conductor by Valery Gergiev. In Gergiev's first season in charge, a complete cycle of Mahler Symphonies was given, with the Barbican Hall sold out for every concert. In 2009 Davis and the LSO celebrated 50 years of working together. In the same year the LSO took over from the Berlin Philharmonic as the resident orchestra at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, adding to a roster of international residences at venues including the Lincoln Center in New York, the Salle Pleyel in Paris and the Daytona Beach International Festival in Florida. In 2010 the LSO visited Poland and Abu Dhabi for the first time and made its first return to India since the 1964 world tour. The orchestra played at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{was elected}} to the see of Hereford in late April 1173 and consecrated on 6 October 1174 at Canterbury by Archbishop Richard of Dover. Hereford had been vacant <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Robert of Melun in 1167, due to the Becket's exile and then death. Foliot was either elected by the cathedral chapter without {{guidance}} from the king, or was nominated to the cathedral chapter by King Henry at the urging of his relative Gilbert Foliot. Robert Foliot later attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. While bishop, he became involved in a disupte with Hugh Parvus, a local baron, over the power of appointment to two churches. He also served as a judge-delegate for the papacy, serving with Roger, the Bishop of Worcester on cases including one between a Norman monastery and an English priory. He judged a number of other cases for the papacy during his time as bishop. He received over 40 surviving papal commissions and communications, some of which dealt with the problems of married clergy in his diocese. From his ecclesiastical documents, almost 40 survive.|$|E
