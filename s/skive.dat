50|$|In {{deep hole}} machining, a roller {{burnishing}} tool is often combined with <b>skiving</b> knives {{on the same}} tool. The <b>skiving</b> knives pass first, scraping the inside layer of metal, followed by the burnishing rollers, which cold work the tube to create a mirror surface finish. Skive-burnishing is often used in hydraulic cylinder applications. This process can happen on a deep hole drilling machine or a dedicated <b>skiving</b> machine.|$|R
2500|$|David Yates {{was born}} in 1963 in Lancashire, England. His parents {{died when he was}} young. Raised in the village of Rainhill, Yates was {{inspired}} to pursue a career in filmmaking after watching Steven Spielberg's 1975 movie Jaws. Before her death, Yates' mother bought him a Super 8mm camera. He used this to shoot various films [...] in which his friends and family featured. One such film, The Ghost Ship, was shot on board the vessel where his uncle worked as a cook. He attended St Helens College where he completed the courses of sociology, politics, and literature before moving on to the University of Essex. Yates said that he [...] "used to <b>skive</b> off college all the time" [...] and never expected to join university before being surprised by his A-Level exam results. While at the University of Essex, Yates formed the Film and Video Production Society. He graduated with a BA Government in 1987.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>skiving</b> process, meaning [...] "to slice", can {{be applied}} to a variety of {{applications}} and materials. In leather, <b>skiving</b> knives trim the thickness of the leather, often around the edges, to thin the material and make it easier to work with. In metal working, <b>skiving</b> can be used to remove a thin dimension of material or to create thin slices in an existing material, such as heat sinks where a large amount of surface area is required relative to the volume of the piece of metal.|$|R

50|$|<b>Skiving</b> is {{also used}} for the {{manufacturing}} of heat sinks for PC cooling products. A PC cooler created {{with the use of}} <b>skiving</b> has the benefit that the heat sink base and the heat sink fins are created from one piece of material (copper or aluminum). This provides optimal dissipation and transfer of the heat from the base to the fins. Additionally, the <b>skiving</b> process also increases the roughness of the heat-sink's fins. Unlike the underside of a heat-sink which needs to be smooth for maximum surface area contact with the heat-source that it cools, the fins benefit from this roughness because it increases the fins' surface area which serves to provide more area on which to release heat into the ambient environment.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Skiving</b> is {{the process}} used in leather {{crafting}} to reduce the thickness of leather, especially {{in areas that are}} to be bent or folded and which must be pliable without becoming weakened.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a successful attempt to identify angular movement of leather components, when transported from one operation to another, by a conveyor system. The automated manufacturing process of <b>skiving</b> leather components was utilised for this research. <b>Skiving</b> is the localised thinning of the leather components {{to enable the}} joining of these without forming thick and unsightly joints. This process had been automated, but its performance could be enhanced by combining an additional sensing system. The research work was directed towards integrating a relatively small and low-cost form of sensing system onto a dynamic matrix <b>skiving</b> machine. Two key areas of the research were the identification of suitable sensor technology and {{the investigation of the}} environment within which they operate. The sensors form a vital and necessary part of any type of identification process and are used to acquire relevant data. The thesis {{describes a}} variety of sensor technologies and their suitability for use in restrictive environments. These environmental restrictions of the <b>skiving</b> process and the component material influence the choice of sensor. Following the study of sensor technologies, the second phase was aimed at implementing an automatic position sensing system. Therefore the main specification of the system was to detect the leather components, and their orientation prior to, and following transportation through the process. The final part of this work presents the results obtained from the introduction of the sensing arrays. It also identifies areas that may be investigated further to improve the system, concerning the particular restricted environment utilised in this research...|$|R
