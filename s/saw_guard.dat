50|$|The bombings {{happened}} nearly simultaneously {{at around}} 5 p.m. Two Uzbeks guarding the Israeli embassy {{were killed when}} the bomber got near entrance and <b>saw</b> the <b>guards.</b> One of the guards killed was a personal guard for the Israeli ambassador.

60|$|As {{long as it}} {{continued}} the boys stood motionless, and were turning to go, when there was the crack of a rifle, and a ball whizzed between them. Leaping round, they <b>saw</b> the <b>guard,</b> whom they had supposed to be insensible, had risen to his feet. Throwing down the rifle which he had just discharged, and drawing his long knife, he rushed at them.|$|R

6000|$|... "Now!" [...] Bayley {{slid his}} arm through mine {{and led me}} across a riding road towards a stretch of rough common (singularly {{out of place in}} a park) perhaps three-quarters of a mile long and half as wide. On the {{encircling}} rails leaned an almost unbroken line of men and women--the women outnumbering the men.

60|$|The repulsive creature, {{squatting}} {{there in}} terror, attempted to escape me and leap {{into a trap}} behind her. But this time I {{was not to be}} outwitted by any such petty subterfuge.

5000|$|In 719, Li Xian's {{title was}} changed to Prince of Ning.

He said that Berlin was not large enough for two reigning monarchs; the King of Prussia and the King of Conjurers.|$|R
60|$|Through half-blind eyes Helen <b>saw</b> them <b>guarding</b> the gateway, {{ready to}} prevent her entrance. She {{staggered}} {{down the road to}} the village. It seemed she made her way through a red dimness--that there was a congestion in her brain--that the distance to Mrs. Cass's cottage was insurmountable. But she got there, to stagger up the path, to hear the old woman's cry. Dizzy, faint, sick, with a blackness enveloping all she looked at, Helen felt herself led into the sitting-room and placed in the big chair.|$|R
50|$|While at bay, {{the port}} <b>guard</b> <b>saw</b> smoke {{rising from the}} {{mountain}} Eli.

60|$|Across the {{courtyard}} below men were running with drawn swords, shouting as they ran, and hurled themselves {{through the doorway}} leading to the quarters where the Swiss were at table.

40|$|The {{demand for}} sawn timber and wood-based {{products}} is rising steadily with new developments {{and the growing}} domestic consumption in Sri Lanka. Therefore, {{it is important to}} strike a balance between the increasing demand and consumption of forest resources. Thus, the key objective of this study was to investigate the effects of sawmill management and technological parameters on loss in conversion from logs to sawn timber and to compare the sawmill efficiency in private sawmills with the state timber corporation sawmill. Sawmill management and technological parameters were studied in 21 private sawmills and State Timber Corporation sawmill in Kaldemulla to evaluate the effects on loss in conversion. The selected sawmills represent all types available in Sri Lanka, i. e., frame saw, circular saw and band saw mills. Based on the results, mean percentage loss in conversion of teak and mahogany timber for all sawmills (private and State Timber Corporation) in Moratuwa found to be 53. 10 %. Significant differences were observed in loss in conversion values between the three categories of private sawmills as well as within sawmills of the same category. It was shown that loss in conversion values also varied with sawmill management and technological parameters such as type of machinery employed, sharpening frequency and sawyer’s experience, saw setting, availability of log alignment equipment and <b>saw</b> <b>guards,</b> oversizing and <b>sawn</b> timber sizes...|$|R
60|$|Trot then <b>saw</b> {{that the}} <b>guards</b> {{were the two}} patched men, Jimfred Jonesjinks and Fredjim Jinksjones, who had been talking {{together}} quite cheerfully.

5|$|The one {{exception}} to the general rule of concealment and obfuscation was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about the morality of killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees were entitled to use force {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others <b>saw</b> the <b>guard's</b> life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|R
50|$|But the 5-11 point <b>guard</b> <b>saw</b> himself reuniting {{with coach}} Jong Uichico with the Barangay Ginebra Kings in a multi-player {{trade in the}} early part of the season.

50|$|Gibbon <b>saw</b> the Praetorian <b>Guard</b> as {{the primary}} {{catalyst}} of the empire's initial decay and eventual collapse, a seed planted by Augustus when the empire was established.
