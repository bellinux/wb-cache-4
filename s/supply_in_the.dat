5|$|A {{result of}} its reef, the tourist {{industry}} is taking off in Msambweni attracting snorkelers. Holiday cottages and hotels have sprung up. Club Green Oasis caters mainly to German tourists. Although supplied with electricity, in the 1990s the government expressed concerns about access to an ample clean water <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> division.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the demand}} for {{germanium}} for fiber optic communication networks, infrared night vision systems, and polymerization catalysts increased dramatically. These end uses represented 85% of worldwide germanium consumption in 2000. The US government even designated germanium as a strategic and critical material, calling for a 146ton (132t) <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> national defense stockpile in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The Shickshinny Water Company used {{a stream}} in the Shickshinny Creek {{watershed}} as a water <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1900s. Little Shickshinny Creek {{has been used}} as a water supply for Shickshinny, as well as Mocanaqua. Agriculture has been a significant industry in the watershed in the past. The streams of the watershed also power small mills.|$|E

5|$|The {{financing}} of war expenditures by {{the means of}} currency issues (printing money) {{was by far the}} major avenue resorted to by the Confederate government. Between 1862 and 1865, more than 60% of total revenue was created in this way. While the North doubled its money supply during the war, the money <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South increased twenty times over.|$|E
5|$|After {{conferring with}} the chief {{engineers}} of the Second and Third field armies, Shazly became aware that IAF, despite heavy losses, had destroyed so many bridge sections that the Egyptians had lost the equivalent of three heavy bridges, leaving four bridges in reserve along with the five already laid in the canal. This gave rise to concerns about <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coming days and weeks. Shazly then discussed the possibility of constructing three bridges in the canal using earth and sand. This would make causeways impregnable against air strikes and artillery. The chief engineer of the Third Army, with whom he discussed the idea, was confidant that, given enough bulldozers, the causeways could be constructed in one week.|$|E
5|$|At 06:30 the No. 5 Wing {{attacked}} the Ottoman defences, drawing some fire which revealed {{the locations of}} machine guns, trenches and five redoubts. The redoubts were arranged around the village, which protected the only available water <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. During the day, pilots and their observers provided frequent reports; fourteen were received between 07:50 and 15:15, giving estimated positions, strength, and movements of the Ottoman garrison. These were most often given verbally by the observer, after the pilot landed near Chauvel's headquarters, as the aircraft did not at this time have wireless communication.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the kingdom}} was {{largely based on}} agriculture, the {{construction}} of irrigation works was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, ensuring water <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dry zone and helping the country grow mostly self-sufficient. Several kings, most notably Vasabha and Mahasena, built large reservoirs and canals, which created a vast and complex irrigation network in the Rajarata area throughout the Anuradhapura period. These constructions are {{an indication of the}} advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at Sigiriya; the Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavana stupas, and other large stupas; large buildings like the Lovamahapaya; and religious works (like the numerous Buddha statues) are landmarks demonstrating the Anuradhapura period's advancement in sculpting.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of a tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen can be {{generated}} from energy <b>supplied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of heat and electricity through high-temperature electrolysis (HTE). Because some of <b>the</b> energy <b>in</b> HTE is <b>supplied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of heat, less of the energy must be converted twice (from heat to electricity, and then to chemical form), and so potentially far less energy is required per kilogram of hydrogen produced.|$|R
5|$|Equipping the Salt Wells Pilot Plant {{involved}} its own challenges. Some facilities {{had to be}} fabricated for the purpose. Some {{items were}} hard to locate, while others were in short <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them for use by Project Camel. Groves felt that his fears about excessive safety were realized: reinforced concrete, blast proof doors and electrical shielding drove up costs. In the end, after 115 days, the first explosives were melted, mixed and poured on 25 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Food was {{in short}} <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conquered {{areas of the}} Soviet Union and Poland, with rations {{inadequate}} to meet nutritional needs. The retreating armies had burned the crops {{and much of the}} remainder was sent back to the Reich. In Germany itself, food rations had to be cut in 1942. In his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, Hermann GÃ¶ring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway. The 1942 harvest was a good one and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} {{sewerage}} was processed at a plant near the town, which also handles sewerage from nearby Hadspen.

5|$|Gray {{was born}} in Sauquoit, New York, on November 18, 1810, to Moses Gray (b.February26, 1786), then a tanner, and Roxanna Howard Gray (b. March 15, 1789). Born {{in the back of}} his father's tannery, Gray was the eldest of their eight children. Gray's {{paternal}} great-grandfather had arrived in Boston from Northern Ireland in 1718; Gray's Scotch-Irish Presbyterian ancestors had moved to New York from Massachusetts and Vermont after Shays' Rebellion. His parents married on July30, 1809. Tanneries needed a lot of wood to burn, and the lumber <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area had been shrinking, so Gray's father used his profits to buy farms in the area, and in about 1823 sold the tannery and became a farmer.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake was accidentally {{discovered}} by Benjamin Harvey in 1781. The first settlers {{arrived at the}} lake in the 1790s and 1800s. Early industries in the area included lumbering and farming, but it became well known as a summer resort {{in the latter part}} of the 1800s and into the 1900s. It was also used as a water <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1900s. However, the lake began to develop significant environmental problems in the 1960s and a total maximum daily load was created for it in 1994. Since 1968, the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, the Chief of Army Service Forces, Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, {{created a}} special India Committee to {{coordinate}} {{activities in the}} China-Burma-India theater with those of Army Service Forces back home. Farrell, now a colonel, {{was appointed to the}} committee to oversee construction. The creation of a line of communications from India to China would be the largest engineer undertaking of the war. A number of new units were trained in the United States specifically for the task. In a reorganization later that year, Farrell became Chief Engineer of the Services of <b>Supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> China-Burma-India theater. In December he also became head of its Construction Division.|$|E

5|$|Issues {{that affect}} water <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States include {{droughts}} in the West, water scarcity, pollution, {{a backlog of}} investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall {{as a result of}} climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April the Joint Chiefs persuaded McNamara and Johnson {{to launch}} a four-week attack on North Vietnam's lines of communications, which would isolate that nation from its {{overland}} sources of <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PRC and the Soviet Union. About one-third of the North's imports came down the northeast railroad from the PRC, while the remaining two-thirds came by sea through Haiphong and other ports. For {{the first time in}} the campaign, targets were to be chosen for their military, rather than their psychological, significance. During the four weeks, 26 bridges and seven ferries were destroyed. Other targets included the extensive North Vietnamese radar system, barracks, and ammunition depots.|$|E
5|$|The Somerset River Authority was {{established}} in the 1960s, and later became part of Wessex Water. Tidal models were used to explore the effects of any improvements to the river, and the likelihood of adverse consequences, i.e. flooding and subsequent silting. Engineering works were undertaken at the Parrett, King's Sedgemoor Drain, and River Brue systems, to try to ensure that the agricultural land benefited from a potable water <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> groundwaters from the Quantock Hills to the coastline.|$|E
