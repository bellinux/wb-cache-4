Therefore, the feasibility of two LIDAR-sensors and different ways of data-processing for the on-line measurement of crop density in front of a combine harvester has been investigated in this study. Good crop density estimation (R 2 0. 80 - 0. 96) was obtained under different conditions of driving speed and machine vibrations with both sensors when using the variation on the measured laser penetration depth. For the high frequency laser scanner also very good results were obtained based on the histogram peak ratio and based on a 3 D field reconstruction. Since the amount of incoming biomass is function of both crop stand density and crop volume, a new method for the estimation of crop volume has been proposed which calculates the volume between the ground profile and the crop profile both estimated by thin plate spline fitting through the ground level and ear level points. This method was shown to have potential for better crop volume estimation. status: publishe...|$|E

Therefore, the feasibility of using two types of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensor, and different methods of online data-processing for estimating crop density in front of a combine harvester, has been investigated. Using either of both sensor types to measure the variation in laser penetration depth, good crop density estimations were obtained for different driving speeds and machine vibrations with coefficients of determination (R- 2) in the range 0. 80 - 0. 96. The high-frequency laser scanner gave very good results based on the histogram peak ratio and on a 3 -dimensional field reconstruction. Since the amount of incoming biomass is function of both crop stand density and crop volume, a new method for the estimation of crop volume has been proposed which calculates the volume between the ground profile and the crop profile using thin plate spline fitting through the ground level and ear level points.
