40|$|Abstract — In {{the coastal}} environment, {{mangroves}} are {{various kinds of}} trees up to medium height and shrubs that grow in saline coastal sediment habitats in the tropics and subtropical tidal areas, including estuaries and shorelines. Mangroves form {{an essential part of}} the coastal environment as they act as a barrier against cyclonic storms, floods; they help avoid coastal erosion; mangroves prevent the extinction of distinct and vital species of flora and fauna thriving in their ecosystems; they improve the production of coastal fisheries; they balance the coral reef and <b>sea</b> <b>grass</b> <b>bed</b> ecosystems; they enable the recharge of ground water; they retain nutrients and filter sediments. The World's mangroves span over 30 countries with a total area of 99, 300 sq. km. World-wide mangroves are disappearing at an alarming rate.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of the {{underwater}} light field on heat-budget calculations of general ocean circulation models for shallow waters. The presence of a bottom significantly alters the estimated heat budget in shallow waters, which affects the corresponding thermal stratification and hence modifies the circulation. Based on the data collected during the COBOP field experiment near the Bahamas, we have used a one-dimensional turbulence closure model to show the influence of the bottom reflection and absorption on the sea surface temperature field. The water depth has an almost one-to-one correlation with the temperature rise. Effects of varying the bottom albedo by replacing the <b>sea</b> <b>grass</b> <b>bed</b> with a coral sand bottom, also has an appreciable effect on the heat budget of the shallow regions. We believe that the differences in the heat budget for the shallow areas will have an influence on the local circulation processes and especially on the evaporative and long-wave heat losses for these areas. The ultimate effects on humidity and cloudiness of the region are expected to be significant as well...|$|E

In addition all dominant species show an abundance peak shortly after sunset, with numbers gradually declining throughout the night. It is therefore suggested that nocturnal samples are not only incorporated into any sampling regime, but that nocturnal samples are taken within two hours after sunset. Tropical sea grass beds and their associated epiphytes form a habitat for a diverse assemblage of organisms, ranging from micro£ora and fauna through to manatees (Nakaoka, 2005). Although numerous studies have described the structural elements of the sea grass habitat, the basic functional relationships of {{the community as a}} whole remain only partly understood (Nakaoka, 2005). In part this is due to a plethora of temporal sampling regimes and di¡ering sampling techniques (e. g. beam trawl, drop net, sweep nets) being employed. This is particularly evident for the epifaunal assemblage, where caridean and dendrobranchiate shrimps dominate (e. g. Greening & Livingston, 1982; Barba et al., 2005; Garc|¤a Raso et al., 2006). In view of this numerical dominance, sea grass dwelling shrimps constitute an important trophic link between primary production and higher trophic levels.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{estimating}} denitrification and nitrogen fixation simultaneously in coastal sediments was developed. An isotope-pairing technique {{was applied to}} dissolved gas measurements with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS). The relative fluxes of three N 2 gas species (28 N 2, 29 N 2, and 30 N 2) were monitored during incubation experiments after the addition of 15 NO 3 −. Formulas were developed to estimate the production (denitrification) and consumption (N 2 fixation) of N 2 gas from the fluxes of the different isotopic forms of N 2. Proportions of the three isotopic forms produced from 15 NO 3 − and 14 NO 3 − agreed with expectations in a sediment slurry incubation experiment designed to optimize conditions for denitrification. Nitrogen fixation rates from an algal mat measured with intact sediment cores ranged from 32 to 390 μg-atoms of N m− 2 h− 1. They were enhanced by light and organic matter enrichment. In this environment of high nitrogen fixation, low N 2 production rates due to denitrification could be separated from high N 2 consumption rates due to nitrogen fixation. Denitrification and nitrogen fixation rates were estimated in April 2000 on sediments from a Texas <b>sea</b> <b>grass</b> <b>bed</b> (Laguna Madre). Denitrification rates (average, 20 μg-atoms of N m− 2 h− 1) were lower than nitrogen fixation rates (average, 60 μg-atoms of N m− 2 h− 1). The developed method benefits from simple and accurate dissolved-gas measurement by the MIMS system.

Two stations were selected : station I in Northern region (consist of three substations) and station II in Southern region (consist of two substations). Sampling method with quadrant transect of 2 X 2 m 2 was applied in the field. The result showed that all stations Bivalve has twenty five species, Echinoidea five species and Asteroidea three species. The highest relative density of macrozoobenthos population were found in Pinna muricata (Bivalve). The value of the biodiversity index (H???) is range between 2. 2 75 - 2. 406, the Eveness index (E) is range between 0. 688 - 0. 707,and the domination index (C) is range between 0. 150 - 0. 160.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in the sea {{adjacent}} to a major MSF plant where a new 24 MGD SWRO plant is being commissioned. Data were collected on the topographical feature of the marine basin, water quality and plankton of the intake zone. The incidents of planktonic bloom, influx of invasive organisms like jellyfish and macrofouling organisms and ingress of marine algae were monitored regularly. The Intake Bay of the plant is a well designed man-made structure studded to the coast. The marine basin in Al-Jubail, is for geological reasons, a shallow gently sloping shelf while the bay proper is a dredged, deeper basin. The area outside the bay is a vast <b>sea</b> <b>grass</b> <b>bed</b> and the seafloor sediment is sandy. The drag of sea water maintained by the intake pumps facilitates the transport of sediment particles, uprooted algae and floating objects creating fouling problems inside the plant. Seawater temperatures, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen and trace metals were found to be very much benign to the trouble free operation of the plant. Influx of jellyfish, noticed during the summer, was not found to be very severe. Data on plankton showed the presence of many phyto and zooplankton organism of biofouling potential in the plant. Total suspended solids indicated the possibility of the intake bay becoming a source of elevated Silt Density Index (SDI) for the new SWRO plant.

40|$|The {{coastal zone}} {{represents}} varied and highly productive ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, sea grasses and sand dunes. These ecosystems {{are under pressure}} on account of increased anthropogenic activity on the coast, {{as a result of}} globalisation. It is necessary to protect these coastal ecosystems to ensure sustainable development. This requires information on habitats, landforms, coastal processes, water quality, natural hazards on a repetitive basis. In India, remote sensing data, especially Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) data, having moderate (23 - 36 m) to high spatial resolution (6 m), have been used to generate database on various components of coastal environment of the entire country. However, the moderate resolution data provide macro-level information on 1 : 250, 000 and 1 : 50, 000 scale about the condition of habitats, type of landforms and areas under erosion and deposition. The major advantage of remote sensing data is monitoring of change periodically. The combination of moderate and high-resolution data provided detailed coastal land use maps on the 1 : 25, 000 -scale for implementing coastal regulation measures. The classification accuracy have been achieved is 85 per cent or better at 90 per cent confidence level. Mangrove areas were classified up to community level through contextual editing.
