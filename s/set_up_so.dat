5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E
5|$|Discovery then sailed south, {{arriving}} at Cape Adare on 9 January 1902. After a brief landing and {{examination of the}} remains of Borchgrevink's camp, the ship continued southwards along the Victoria Land coast. At McMurdo Sound Discovery turned eastward, touching land again at Cape Crozier where a pre-arranged message point was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> that relief ships {{would be able to}} locate the expedition. She then followed the Barrier to its eastern extremity where, on 30 January, the land predicted by Ross was confirmed, and named King Edward VII Land.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It {{took a long}} time to <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> <b>so</b> it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which made it hard to warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Australian {{government}} {{announced that the}} national service scheme would be implemented once again, however, instead of focusing upon expanding the CMF, the scheme was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> that national servicemen would serve limited terms of service in Australian Regular Army (ARA) units {{with a view to}} service overseas in Vietnam and Malaysia. This highlighted the changing focus of Australia's military planning towards Regular forces, however, it had a negative impact upon the division as essentially it was forced to compete with the ARA for manpower and although some gains were made from men that chose to serve longer national service terms in the CMF in order to defer their service in ARA units, these were negligible and arguably of limited quality. The government's decision not to deploy CMF units to these conflicts meant that many of the division's experienced personnel chose to transfer to ARA units in order to gain operational experience, although some attempts were made to rectify this situation by offering CMF officers the opportunity to undertake a short attachment to an ARA unit serving in Vietnam and a number of 3rd Division officers took up this opportunity, a few even saw combat.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} annual festival for Japanese Americans is the Obon Festival, {{which happens}} in July or August of each year. Across the country, Japanese Americans gather on fair grounds, churches and large civic {{parking lots and}} commemorate the memory of their ancestors and their families through folk dances and food. Carnival booths are usually <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> Japanese American children {{have the opportunity to}} play together.|$|E

25|$|QOTW Off Topic {{was invented}} for those users of QOTW who found they had {{things in common}} and liked {{to talk to each}} other using the reply system. Over several weeks it became clear that more and more people were preferring to chat to each other through the replies instead of the /talk board which was already <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> <b>so</b> Off Topic was created.|$|E

At noon on the winter solstice (21 December), the ray of light touches the brass line on the obelisk. At noon on the equinoxes (21 March and 21 September), the ray touches an oval plate of copper in the floor near the altar.|$|E
25|$|Institutional money {{funds are}} high minimum investment, low expense share classes that are marketed to corporations, governments, or fiduciaries. They are often <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> {{that money is}} swept to them {{overnight}} from a company's main operating accounts. Large national chains often have many accounts with banks all across the country, but electronically pull a majority of funds on deposit with them to a concentrated money market fund.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of Christian IV's {{coronation}} in 1596, Copenhagen had become rich and powerful. The new king {{decided to make the}} town the economic, military, religious, and cultural centre for the whole of the Nordic region. The king established the first trading companies with sole rights to trade with lands overseas. In order to restrict imports, factories were <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> that as many goods as possible could be manufactured at home.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, the rat {{is placed}} {{in the center of the}} maze and needs to explore each arm {{individually}} to retrieve food while simultaneously remembering which arms it has already pursued. The maze is <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> the rat is forced to return to the center of the maze before pursuing another arm. Measures are usually taken to prevent the rat from using its olfactory senses to navigate such as placing extra food throughout the bottom of the maze.|$|E
25|$|Between the Powell Avenue and Broadway/ Plainview Road {{interchanges}} {{along the}} expressway, the highway is divided {{with a large}} median. The lane alignment was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> that the proposed extension of the Bethpage State Parkway would have run within the median of NY135. The parkway would have followed the highway for a short distance before turning to the southeast and away from NY135. By making this possible, the Bethpage Parkway would likely have to have been upgraded from its current super-two configuration into a four-lane highway.|$|E

25|$|Automixers balance {{multiple}} sound sources {{based on}} each source's level, quickly and dramatically adjusting the various signal levels automatically. Automixers {{are used in}} live sound reinforcement to maintain a steady limit on the overall signal level of the microphones; if a public address system is <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> that one microphone will not feed back, then, in general, multiple microphones will not feed back if they are automixed. The equivalent number of open mics (NOM) present at {{the output of the}} automixer is kept low, regardless of the actual number of open mics.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergency}} telephone number is a special case in the country's telephone number plan. In the past, calls to the {{emergency telephone}} number were often routed over special dedicated circuits. Though {{with the advent of}} electronic exchanges these calls are now often mixed with ordinary telephone traffic, they still may be able to access circuits that other traffic cannot. Often the system is <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> that once a call is made to an {{emergency telephone number}}, it must be answered. Should the caller abandon the call, the line may still be held until the emergency service answers and releases the call.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the mat {{took about}} 50 men four weeks to complete. By {{the end of}} January 1941 only 10 sites had been upgraded, {{and all the while}} new AA emplacements were being <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> that the number of {{prospective}} sites was increasing more rapidly than they could be completed. By April, Pile had concluded that 95% of the AA sites would need the mats, and they expected 600 sites to be operational by March 1942. The program ultimately ran on for years, petering out as new systems were introduced that did not require the mats. The mat program formally ended in March 1943.|$|E
50|$|Dinah, {{despite being}} warned {{to forget about}} Cassie and go on with her life, decided to take from Cassie what was taken from her. So, {{deciding}} to steal Edmund away from Cassie, Dinah <b>set</b> it <b>up</b> <b>so</b> he would spot her drunkenly attempting to strip in a bar. Trying to avoid her making a scene, Edmund found her and dragged her out. Confronted by Edmund, Dinah turned on the tears and bemoaned to Edmund that she didn't know how to change. As she'd hoped, Edmund softened toward her and let her {{spend the night in}} his hotel suite. Meanwhile, Dinah continued to fuel Edmund's jealousy of Jeffrey by <b>setting</b> it <b>up</b> <b>so</b> he'd see a picture of Jeffrey (as Richard) with Cassie in Jeffrey's apartment. Dinah gained the trust of Cassie's daughter, Tammy. She then gave Tammy her car keys and suggested that she go away to think. With Tammy gone, Dinah decided to play with Cassie's head and, disguising her voice, informed Cassie that Tammy was trying to get a job as a stripper in Chicago. She then informed Jeffrey that she told Tammy to go to Chicago, <b>setting</b> it <b>up</b> <b>so</b> the two could leave together. Although the pair failed to find Tammy, Dinah's machinations further drove a wedge between Cassie and Edmund because Cassie continually relied on Edmund.|$|R

25|$|A closed timelike curve can {{be created}} if a series of such light cones are <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> as to loop back on themselves, {{so it would be}} {{possible}} for an object to move around this loop and return to the same place and time that it started. An object in such an orbit would repeatedly return to the same point in spacetime if it stays in free fall. Returning to the original spacetime location would be only one possibility; the object's future light cone would include spacetime points both forwards and backwards in time, and so it should be possible for the object to engage in time travel under these conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{ticketing}} system uses RFID contactless technology with round tokens issued for single trips and a contactless stored value card, the MRT Plus card, for frequent travellers. It is planned that a joint {{ticketing system}} will be <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> that passengers can use a single ticket on the MRT {{as well as on}} the Skytrain. Multi-storey park & ride facilities are provided at Lat Phrao and Thailand Cultural Centre. Motorists who park their cars at these premises will be issued with additional contactless smartcards and they need to have them electronically stamped at their destination station. The turnstiles accept cards or tokens, both available from a manned booth or automated ticket machines.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} {{influence from}} the East is strangely {{shown in the}} fashion of decorating external brick walls of churches built about the 12th century, in which bricks roughly carved into form are <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>so</b> as to make bands of ornamentation which it is quite clear are imitated from Cufic writing. This fashion {{was associated with the}} disposition of the exterior brick and stone work generally into many varieties of pattern, zig-zags, key-patterns etc.; and, as similar decoration is found in many Persian buildings, it is probable that this custom also was derived from the East. The domes and vaults to the exterior were covered with lead or with tiling of the Roman variety. The window and door frames were of marble. The interior surfaces were adorned all over by mosaics or frescoes in the higher parts of the edifice, and below with incrustations of marble slabs, which were frequently of very beautiful varieties, and disposed so that, although in one surface, the coloring formed a series of large panels. The better marbles were opened out so that the two surfaces produced by the division formed a symmetrical pattern resembling somewhat the marking of skins of beasts.|$|E
