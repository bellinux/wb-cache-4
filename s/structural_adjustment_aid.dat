40|$|Summaries The paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the historical evolution of BOP support aid in Japan, including changes in its policies and modalities. Organizational set?up and evaluation methodologies of official donor agencies such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, OECF and EXIM are explained. The methodologies are analyzed in the following two ways: items covered in the evaluations and analytical methods. Lessons and suggestions from their evaluations are as follows: objectives of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> programmes should be clearly defined; direct indicators for impact should be selected in correspondence with policy measures categorized; and the impact of other factors than <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> especially project <b>aid,</b> should be separated...|$|R
50|$|External influences, such as {{from the}} World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), often play a role, {{as it was the}} case in Bolivia and in several African countries. This may take the form of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> programs. Other <b>aid</b> {{agencies}} have also supported water privatization. These include the Inter-American Development Bank (e.g., in Ecuador, Colombia and Honduras), the Asian Development Bank (e.g., in China), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Eastern Europe, German development cooperation through KfW (e.g., in Albania, Armenia, Jordan and Peru), French development cooperation (e.g., in Senegal) and British development cooperation (e.g., in Tanzania and Guyana). In the UK, the World Development Movement campaigned against the support of water privatization through aid from the UK.|$|R
40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} {{has always been}} an important concern for international organizations and for governments as well. Despite the failure of various <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> and development <b>aid</b> programs, foreign capital is still a key element in the success of several development programs. Unfortunately, during the last decade, the level of foreign {{direct investment}}s has not increased that much in several developing countries due to, among others, country risks. The concept of country risk has itself changed. Unfortunately, the tools used in general to evaluate and to manage this risk have not followed the same pace. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the management tools of country risk in developing countries in order to suggest a more realistic model. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to provide {{empirical}} evidence on the growth rates of maize production in three sub - periods in Nigeria namely pre - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period, <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Program period and post - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period. Secondary data on maize production in Nigeria during the Pre - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period (1970 to 1985), <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> period (1986 to 1994) and post - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period (1995 to 2007) were employed in this study. A growth rate model was used to estimate the growth rates of maize in the three sub - periods. The results of the analysis showed that the instantaneous growth rates of maize production are - 0. 1 %, 5. 7 % and 2. 4 % and the compound rates of growth of maize production are - 0. 001 %, 0. 059 % and 0. 024 % for the pre - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme, <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme and post - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme periods respectively. The higher compound growth rate of maize production in the <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period implies that the policy reforms in the period was more effective in ensuring increased growth of maize production over that of other periods in Nigeria. Therefore, despite the myriads of {{problems associated with the}} programme in Nigeria, it was beneficial to maize production in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|This article {{critically}} {{assesses the}} success of market-led <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> in Fiji. After reviewing the rationale behind <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> programs it examines the economic policies of Fijiâ€™s Interim Government between 1987 and 1992, demonstrating that such policies were both consistent with <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> and represented confirmation {{of a change in}} economic policy. The economic performance of Fiji under <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> is examined. However, in delving behind the data the article uncovers both supply and demand constraints that together suggest an inability to resolve major structural issues facing the economy. As a consequence, the capacity of the economy to respond to the changed framework of incentives brought about by <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> is inhibited.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the interconnection {{between social}} achievement, <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> governance and economic performance. It does this by developing indices to measure social progress, measured by {{achievement of the}} Millennium Development Goals, and <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> measured by achieving the goals specified in the Washington consensus. These indices are constructed using the technique pioneered by Nagar & Basu, which uses {{the information contained in}} the correlation among the different indicators. Governance is measured by an index developed by the World Bank, and economic performance by growth of per capital income. Economic growth is not correlated with social progress, <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> or governance. However, <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> is not inimical to social progress. Furthermore, while the governance index is not correlated with growth of per capita income it is very highly correlated with social progress.

40|$|The Government of Zimbabwe {{has neither}} fully {{implemented}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> nor has it clearly stated its position {{regarding the use}} of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> in its management of the economy. However, Government has, while strongly criticizing the IMF/World Bank approach to <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> sought to effect <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the economy and to apply its own brand as well as conventional IMF instruments of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The Government's brand of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> seeks to satisfy the stated objective of strengthening the productive sectors of the economy. This is done in the contradictory context of a programme for transition to socialism and standing recognition of the need for meaningful social spending. In applying <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> Government does not appear to consider in "package form" the impacts of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> on women nor does it consider any immediate compensatory cushioning. The removal of consumer, however, has been tied to minimum wage enactments. The activities of Government in general do seek to guarantee the security of women under a national macro-economic programme which seeks to generally elevate women into a position of equality and self-reliance in the economy. This programme, if successful, would make it unnecessary to treat women as a special and disadvantaged group needing cushioning from the impacts of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The programme has, so far, only made notable progress in expanding social, public, health and educational facilities for women. These facilities have a direct bearing on the economic advancement of women. The one area where Government's approach has failed is in effecting a transition by women to meaningful management or ownership positions in the productive sectors. Generally, the impact of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> on women is hard to determine. Only a few of the instruments analysed in this paper had a direct determinable bearing on women. These are, the removal of consumer subsidies, credit facilitation for agricultural production, tax adjustment and producer subsidies.,Canadian Agency for International Development...|$|R
40|$|Does the {{implementation}} of a <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> agreement increase or decrease government respect for democratic rights? Neo-liberal theory implies that the economic liberalization required by <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> agreements improve economic performance, generating better human rights practices including stronger protections of democratic rights. Critics contend that {{the implementation}} of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> conditions causes governments to lower democratic rights as a means to maintain control as populations protest the economic policy changes that take place. We conduct a global, comparative analysis for the 1981 - 2003 period, and use a two-stage model to account for World Bank and IMF loan selection criteria when estimating the democratic rights consequences of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The findings show that implementation of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> agreements actually improves government respect for democratic rights, and they suggest that more attention should be paid to international forces, especially the effects of international regimes, on governments democratic rights practices...|$|R
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{international}} organizations began {{to admit that}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises. In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> loans. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted {{as an extension of}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities. Neither approach has addressed the inherent flaws within the global economy that contribute to economic and social inequities within developing countries.|$|R

One aspect of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> programs is the potential for expanded product ion of agricultural tradables in SubSaharan Africa. Much of this expansion is expected to increase the volume of agricultural exports. Although the expanded production of importables, particularly food, could be significant, the situation in African countries deserves particular attention because their production is highly concentrated on a few export commodities. If most African countries promoted and expanded their exports at the same time, world prices would. decrease. Is there a risk that, at least in the short or medium term, the <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> programs could worsen the economic situation in Sub-Saharan Africa?

This study is part of a comprehensive study evaluating the impact of the economic <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> programme (ESAP) on the rural economy in Zimbabwe. This empirical study reviews micro level changes occurring in the rural marketing systems as a result of macro economic policy, by specifically investigating the changes of agricultural produce marketing within a rural economy resulting from the introduction of the economic <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> programme. Efficient supply of agricultural inputs and easy market access are important components of the economic development process.
