5|$|In {{an effort}} to recoup diminished family fortunes, Joseph Chamberlain sent his younger son to {{establish}} a <b>sisal</b> plantation on Andros Island in the Bahamas. Neville Chamberlain spent six years there but the plantation was a failure, and Joseph Chamberlain lost £50,000.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{was born}} in 1869; his father was the {{politician}} and future Cabinet minister, Joseph Chamberlain. He was educated at Rugby School and Mason College (now Birmingham University); at neither institution was he particularly successful. After a period in a firm of chartered accountants, the younger Chamberlain spent {{six years in the}} Bahamas managing a <b>sisal</b> plantation in a failed attempt to recoup the family fortunes.|$|E
5|$|Laden with copper, <b>sisal</b> {{and general}} cargo, Fort Stikine {{departed}} from Gibraltar on 11 January 1944 {{as a member}} of Convoy MKS36G. The convoy, of twenty merchant ships and five escorting warships, made a rendezvous at sea with Convoy SL145 the next day. The combined convoy arrived at Liverpool on 24 January.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala. The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild <b>sisal,</b> Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E
5|$|Jatropha is {{native to}} Mexico and Central America and was likely transported to India and Africa in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors {{convinced}} it had medicinal uses. In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce jatropha. The Yucatán Peninsula, for instance, {{in addition to being}} a corn producing region, also contains abandoned <b>sisal</b> plantations, where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food.|$|E
25|$|Ranopiso <b>sisal</b> {{plantation}} {{had grown}} to 1,000ha in size, stretching south almost to the coast, but only lasted from 1933 to 1938 due to soils and labor being inadequate for this, resulting in only 67 tons of <b>sisal</b> being harvested in 1935. It was shut down with all <b>sisal</b> efforts moved to the Mandrare valley.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sisal</b> is {{the main}} leaf fibre used; others are: abacá and henequen.|$|E
25|$|Sisal: In 1928, the Societe Fonciere du Sud de Madagascar began {{testing the}} {{viability}} of growing <b>Sisal</b> near Ranopiso. While about 1,000 hectares were planted, by 1935 exports were only 65 tons. In 1932, this company obtained a 4,000 hectare concession in the Mandrare river valley where <b>sisal</b> was found to flourish. By 1947, five <b>sisal</b> companies had a total of 3,075 hectares planted and employed 1,470 people. In 1951, a station of the applied research institute IRCT - Centre de Recherches Sisalières du Mandrare - is set up {{in order to enhance}} <b>sisal</b> intensive farming and productivity. Production grew from 2,500 tons in 1950 to almost 29,000 tons produced in 1964. By 1959, due to the steel bridge erection easing the Mandrare right bank development, six companies had expanded the area, cultivated to 14,528 hectares and employed 4,502 people. Between 1953 and 1958, in part due to additional fees paid by France, these exports were worth 500 millions CFA. In 1962, there were 7,500 people (men and women) producing <b>sisal</b> and the value of <b>sisal</b> exports was just over 1 billion FMG (a year when 99 ships docked in Fort Dauphin) and while it was just over two billion FMG in 1964, by 1966 the value of exports was just under one billion FMG and the number of employees had dropped to 4,500 by 1967. By 1969, there were about 20,000 hectares planted producing about 25,000 tons per year (half of which went to France) which was the limit established for Madagascar by the FAO. However, in three years in the mid-1960s, the value of <b>sisal</b> decreased by more than 50 percent due to synthetic fibers which took sisal's place. In spite of this, production was almost 25,000 tons as late as 1970. Current production is appx. 3,000 tons per year from the Mandrare Valley.|$|E
25|$|While Mica was mined {{in western}} Anosy {{continued}} to be exported from Fort Dauphin to both sides of conflict, <b>sisal</b> production fell {{due to a lack}} of imports.|$|E
25|$|The {{three major}} cash crops in the Anosy region are coffee (primarily from Ranomafana area), Periwinkle (southwestern coast of Anosy and coast of Androy) and <b>sisal</b> (Amboasary area).|$|E
25|$|Henry de Heaulme, 29 years old, {{arrived in}} Fort Dauphin, having driven down from Tananarive in a Harley Davidson {{motorcycle}} {{with his wife}} and son in the side car. His intent was to export mica and <b>sisal</b> from Androy and western Anosy through Fort Dauphin.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{the three}} Texan ships reunited {{and stopped in}} Carmen for water and repairs, where they {{remained}} until 28 March 1842. Upon departure, the flotilla under command of Austin made for Veracruz and instituted a blockade of the port. While conducting the blockade, Austin captured the Mexican ships Dolorita and Dos Amigos, sending prize crews with them to Galveston. After sending Dos Amigos to Galveston accompanied by San Bernard, Austin headed for <b>Sisal,</b> arriving on 18 April. The following day, San Bernard arrived off <b>Sisal</b> with orders for Commodore Moore to return to Texas to confer with President Houston. The Texas squadron departed the Yucatán coast on 26 April and set a direct course for Galveston, arriving {{at the beginning of}} May 1842.|$|E
25|$|Brazil's diversified economy {{includes}} agriculture, industry, and a {{wide range}} of services. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted for 5.1% {{of the gross domestic product}} in 2007. Brazil is one of the largest producer of oranges, coffee, sugar cane, cassava and <b>sisal,</b> soybeans and papayas.|$|E
25|$|Around Kenya's Kisumi at the Equator, P. africana {{lives on}} level ground about 1,400metres {{above sea level}} {{where there is no}} dry season, and inhabits open savanna {{containing}} clumps <b>sisal</b> and euphorbia.. There, P. africana appears in large, dense but localised populations of three species of jumping spider, all with bodies less than 5.0millimetres long.|$|E
25|$|The bay itself {{contains}} around 360 {{islands in}} total. This includes the populated Russell, Macleay, Lamb and Karragarra Islands collectively {{known as the}} Southern Moreton Bay Islands. Residential development has also occurred on Coochiemudlo Island and Bribie Island. In the past Peel Island {{has been used as}} a <b>sisal</b> plantation, quarantine station, asylum and a leper colony.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sisal</b> was {{introduced}} to Haiti, and sugarcane and cotton became significant exports. Haitian traditionalists, based in rural areas, were highly resistant to American-backed changes, while the urban elites wanted more control. Together they helped secure {{an end to the}} occupation in 1934. The debts were still outstanding and the American financial advisor-general receiver handled the budget until 1941.|$|E
25|$|Yucatecan troops {{held the}} road from Mérida to the port of <b>Sisal.</b> The Yucatecan {{governor}} Miguel Barbachano had prepared a decree for the evacuation of Mérida, but was apparently delayed in publishing it {{by the lack of}} suitable paper in the besieged capital. The decree became unnecessary when the republican troops suddenly broke the siege and took the offensive with major advances.|$|E
25|$|On Lukulesi {{estate of}} 7,449 acres, the A.L. Bruce Trust first experimented with cotton, coffee, rubber and <b>sisal</b> and chillies. Coffee was as {{unsuitable}} for the cool, wet uplands of Mulanje, but tea was planted and from 1904 its tea bushes were producing tea for export. The quality was generally poor, as the estate had no expertise {{in preparing the}} tea.|$|E
25|$|Its exports have {{included}} human slaves (shipped to Mascarene Islands and the United States in the 1700s), live cattle (exported to Réunion for almost 300 years), <b>sisal,</b> natural rubber, Rosy Periwinkle, graphite, uranothorite, lobster, sapphires, and, {{in the last}} five years, ilmenite. Due to its biodiversity and natural beauty, efforts commenced in the 1980s to promote environmental conservation and tourism in the region.|$|E
25|$|The {{agricultural}} products are mainly bananas, allspice/pimento, sugar, coconuts, coffee, limes, corn, ginger, sweet potatoes, sensimilia yam, and annatto. The soil is also suitable for citrus and, <b>sisal</b> is cultivated in the drier areas. The parish is also noted for cattle rearing, horses and hogs (swine). Recently, however, agriculture {{has been on}} the decline as farmland is being used for housing and other developments and the cultivated area has decreased.|$|E
25|$|Cortisone {{was first}} {{produced}} commercially by Merck & Co. in 1948 or 1949. On September 30, 1949, Percy Julian announced {{an improvement in}} the process of producing cortisone from bile acids. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, a rare, expensive, and dangerous chemical. In the UK in the early 1950s, John Cornforth and Kenneth Callow at the National Institute for Medical Research collaborated with Glaxo to produce cortisone from hecogenin from <b>sisal</b> plants.|$|E
25|$|Leaving Galveston in January, Wharton reached Commodore Moore's {{squadron}} off the Yucatan port of <b>Sisal</b> on April 18, 1842. The Wharton brought word to Commodore Moore {{that the}} Republic of Texas had declared a blockade of the Mexican coast and Wharton remained in Mexican waters to help enforce it until May 1842. Returning to Galveston, the Wharton saw almost her crew quit the {{service as a}} result of expiring enlistments and desertions.|$|E
25|$|Before {{independence}} in 1975, Angola was a breadbasket of southern Africa {{and a major}} exporter of bananas, coffee and <b>sisal,</b> but three decades of civil war (1975–2002) destroyed fertile countryside, left it littered with landmines and drove millions into the cities. The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from South Africa and Portugal, while more than 90% of farming is done at the family and subsistence level. Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty.|$|E
25|$|Joining the {{flagship}} Austin and San Antonio, San Bernard set sail {{again for the}} Yucatan on 13 December 1841. The flotilla reached <b>Sisal</b> on 6 January 1842, For {{the next couple of}} months, she participated in the capture of the Mexican merchant vessels Progreso, Dolorita and the Dos Amigos in April 1842. Off Tampico, Lt. Crisp and San Bernard were ordered back to Galveston to deliver dispatches and reports. San Bernard did not return to Commodore Moore {{and the rest of the}} Texas fleet until 24 April 1842.|$|E
25|$|Besides that, the {{overseas}} territories were also displaying impressive {{economic growth and}} development rates from the 1920s onwards. Even during the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974), a counterinsurgency war against independentist guerrilla and terrorism, {{the overseas}} territories of Angola and Mozambique (Portuguese Overseas Provinces at the time) had continuous economic growth rates and several sectors of its local economies were booming. They were internationally notable centres of production of oil, coffee, cotton, cashew, coconut, timber, minerals (like diamonds), metals (like iron and aluminium), banana, citrus, tea, <b>sisal,</b> beer, cement, fish and other sea products, beef and textiles.|$|E
25|$|The Comoros {{served as}} a way station for merchants sailing to the Far East and India until {{the opening of the}} Suez Canal {{significantly}} reduced traffic passing through the Mozambique Channel. The native commodities exported by the Comoros were coconuts, cattle and tortoiseshell. French settlers, French-owned companies, and wealthy Arab merchants established a plantation-based economy that used about one-third of the land for export crops. After its annexation, France converted Mayotte into a sugar plantation colony. The other islands were soon transformed as well, and the major crops of ylang-ylang, vanilla, coffee, cocoa beans, and <b>sisal</b> were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Owing to Hainan's {{tropical}} climate, {{paddy rice}} is cultivated {{extensively in the}} northeastern lowlands and in the southern mountain valleys. Leading crops other than rice include coconuts, palm oil, <b>sisal,</b> tropical fruits (including pineapples, of which Hainan is China's leading producer), black pepper, coffee, tea, cashews, and sugarcane. In the early 20th century Chinese emigrants returning from then British Malaya, introduced rubber trees to the island; after 1950, state farms were developed, and Hainan now produces {{a substantial amount of}} China's rubber. The hot Hainan yellow lantern chili, a variety unique to the island, is grown in the southeast and southwest.|$|E
25|$|Maize was {{the largest}} food crop on the Tanzania {{mainland}} in 2013 (5.17 million tonnes), followed by cassava (1.94 million tonnes), sweet potatoes (1.88 million tonnes), beans (1.64 million tonnes), bananas (1.31 million tonnes), rice (1.31 million tonnes), and millet (1.04 million tonnes). Sugar {{was the largest}} cash crop on the mainland in 2013 (296,679 tonnes), followed by cotton (241,198 tonnes), cashew nuts (126,000 tonnes), tobacco (86,877 tonnes), coffee (48,000 tonnes), <b>sisal</b> (37,368 tonnes), and tea (32,422 tonnes). Beef was the largest meat product on the mainland in 2013 (299,581 tonnes), followed by lamb/mutton (115,652 tonnes), chicken (87,408 tonnes), and pork (50,814 tonnes).|$|E
25|$|In 1902, Sharrer's landholdings in Cholo {{district}} {{were sold}} to the British Central Africa Company Ltd. For the first two decades of the 20th century, the area remained undeveloped and relatively under-populated. Small amounts of cotton, <b>sisal</b> and tobacco were grown but the tobacco was hit by disease, the value of <b>sisal</b> was low and the cool weather was unsuitable for cotton. With {{the construction of the}} Shire Highlands Railway from Port Herald to Blantyre, which opened in 1908, the estates began to grow Flue-cured tobacco, and The British Central Africa Company Ltd was able to interest the Imperial Tobacco Company in Nyasaland tobacco. The company imported good quality seed and brought in experts, at first aiming to produce cigar leaf, but later concentrating on flue-cured leaf for cigarettes. By 1907, the British Central Africa Company had 14 barns for flue-curing tobacco, {{out of a total of}} 119 such barns in the protectorate. At the end of the First World War, the company started a scheme for settling ex-servicemen on its undeveloped land as tobacco growers. About 50 men took up farms, usually of 1,000 acres. Many failed in the period from 1920 to 1924, as none had a farming background or any farming training. Some survived until a drastic fall in prices for flue-cured tobacco after 1927, but then took up whatever employment they could find. After 1927, the production of dark-fired tobacco by African farmers, either estate tenants or on Crown lands, overtook that of flue-cured tobacco, and the British Central Africa Company, which already had a scheme for its tenants to grow tobacco under supervision, became mostly a broker for the tobacco those tenants produced.|$|E
25|$|Cecilio Chi, {{the native}} leader of Tepich, along with Jacinto Pat {{attacked}} Tepich on 30 July 1847, {{in reaction to}} the indiscriminate massacre of Mayas, ordered that all the non-Maya population be killed. By spring of 1848, the Maya forces had taken over most of the Yucatán, {{with the exception of the}} walled cities of Campeche and Mérida and the south-west coast, with Yucatecan troops holding the road from Mérida to the port of <b>Sisal.</b> The Yucatecan governor Miguel Barbachano had prepared a decree for the evacuation of Mérida, but was apparently delayed in publishing it by the lack of suitable paper in the besieged capital. The decree became unnecessary when the republican troops suddenly broke the siege and took the offensive with major advances.|$|E
25|$|As civilizations {{began to}} develop, thong sandals (the {{precursors}} {{of the modern}} flip-flop) were worn. This practice dates back to pictures of them in ancient Egyptian murals from 4000 BC. One pair found in Europe was made of papyrus leaves and dated to be approximately 1,500 years old. They were also worn in Jerusalem during the first century of the Common Era. Thong sandals were worn by many civilizations and made {{from a wide variety}} of materials. Ancient Egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm leaves. The Masai of Africa made them out of rawhide. In India they were made from wood. In China and Japan, rice straw was used. The leaves of the <b>sisal</b> plant were used to make twine for sandals in South America while the natives of Mexico used the Yucca plant.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of its}} mission, {{they carried}} the Colonel Manuel Dorrego to the United States, by order of Pueyrredón, but being found sick and at his request they moved him to the {{captured}} schooner San Antonio {{in the vicinity of}} Cuba. In just ten days, Almeida made 16 captures and while he continued at the rate of the four-month campaign, those waters gave huge profits. Among the prizes were the brig San Antonio de Padua, captured on January 28, 1817 with a cargo of sugar, snuff, and silk scarves (burned); the schooner New Catalina; the brig San Antonio Abad (February 19), of Veracruz and in ballast, that was burned; the brig Paz on February 24 on a trip from <b>Sisal</b> to Havana; the brig San Jose from Campeche to Havana with cargo of brandy and wine; and the schooners Mary and Squirrel (with load of sarsaparilla and $2,000, burned).|$|E
25|$|After a re-provisioning stop in New Orleans, Austin {{arrived at}} <b>Sisal</b> on 6 January 1842 {{where she met}} up with San Bernard and the San Antonio. From there the flotilla, {{under the command of}} Commodore Moore, again cruised the Mexican coast in search of prizes. After a stop at the port of Campeche, they {{continued}} on to Veracruz where they took up station as close to shore as conditions permitted. On 6 February, Austin and San Bernard sighted, pursued, and captured the 180-ton Mexican brig Progreso which was sent to Galveston with a small prize crew. Throughout the month of February, bad weather plagued the two Texas ships and they captured no more ships. On 17 February, Austin hoisted the United States flag and sailed into Veracruz harbor to get a first-hand look at the Mexican situation. In Veracruz, Moore saw with alarm an old commercial steamer undergoing naval conversion and a new schooner readying as well. Austin released her captives in Progreso's boats, exited the harbor, and set sail for Cayo Arcos and rendezvous with the San Antonio.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} the Cayos Arcas, where {{the rest of}} his flotilla had remained, Moore found that the San Jacinto had run aground on a sand bar {{and the rest of the}} ships were not to be seen. Austin set out to find the rest of the ships, Zavala and San Bernard, touching at the port of Campeche on 8 November and <b>Sisal</b> on 10 November. The flagship finally caught up with the rest of the ships at Frontera on 14 November. In order to salvage the San Jacinto and provide fuel for the lone steamship, Zavala, Moore hatched a plan to gain money. The Zavala towed the other two ships 60 miles up the San Juan Bautista River to the capital of the Mexican state of Tabasco, Villahermosa. There the small flotilla pointed their guns at the city and then sent troops into the seemingly deserted capital. Commodore Moore encountered a man bearing a white flag on a tree branch, and when he ascertained that this was the Mayor, the Texas commodore demanded $25,000 or he would level the town. The Mayor asked if silver would be acceptable, and upon receiving an affirmative reply, delivered the ransom. The commodore set sail with the silver and used the money to repair and outfit his ships.|$|E
25|$|Magloire {{restored}} the elite to prominence. The {{business community and}} the government benefited from favorable economic conditions until Hurricane Hazel hit the island in 1954. Haiti made some improvements on its infrastructure, {{but most of these}} were financed largely by foreign loans. By Haitian standards, Magloire's rule was firm, but not harsh: he jailed political opponents, including Fignolé, and shut down their presses when their protests grew too strident, but he allowed labor unions to function, although they were not permitted to strike. It was in the arena of corruption, however, that Magloire overstepped traditional bounds. The president controlled the <b>sisal,</b> cement, and soap monopolies. He and other officials built imposing mansions. The injection of international hurricane relief funds into an already corrupt system boosted graft to levels that disillusioned all Haitians. To make matters worse, Magloire followed in the footsteps of many previous presidents by disputing the termination date of his stay in office. Politicians, labor leaders, and their followers flocked to the streets in May 1956 to protest Magloire's failure to step down. Although Magloire declared martial law, a general strike essentially shut down Port-au-Prince. Again like many before him, Magloire fled to Jamaica, leaving the army with the task of restoring order.|$|E
25|$|Bevin was unsentimental {{about the}} British Empire {{in places where}} the growth of {{nationalism}} had made direct rule no longer practicable, and {{was part of the}} Cabinet which approved a speedy British withdrawal from India in 1947, and from neighbouring colonies. Yet at this stage Britain still maintained a network of client states in the Middle East (Egypt until 1952, Iraq and Jordan until 1959), major bases in such places as Cyprus and Suez (until 1956) and expected to remain in control of parts of Africa for many more years, Bevin approving the construction of a huge new base in East Africa. Bevin wrote “we have the material resources in the Colonial Empire, if we develop them … which will show clearly that we are not subservient to the United States … or to the Soviet Union”. In this era colonial exports earned $150m a year, mostly Malaysian rubber, West African cocoa, and sugar and <b>sisal</b> from the West Indies. By the end of 1948 colonial exports were 50% higher than before the war, whilst {{in the first half of}} 1948 colonial exports accounted for 10.4% of Britain’s imports. After the war Britain helped France and the Netherlands recover their Far Eastern empires, hopeful that this could lead towards the formation of a third superpower bloc. Bevin agreed with Duff Cooper (British Ambassador in Paris) that the Dunkirk Treaty would be a step in this direction and thought that Eden's objection – in 1944 when Cooper first proposed it – that such moves might alienate the Soviets no longer applied.|$|E
