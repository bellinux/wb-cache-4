5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated <b>sub-population</b> away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Ernst Mayr {{was influenced}} by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch showing the influence of local environmental factors on the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book Systematics and the Origin of Species, which emphasized the importance of allopatric speciation in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when the geographical isolation of a <b>sub-population</b> is followed by the development of mechanisms for reproductive isolation. Mayr also formulated the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.|$|E

40|$|The {{multilevel}} {{model of}} change and the latent growth model are flexible means to describe all sorts of population heterogeneity with respect to growth and development, including the presence of <b>sub-populations.</b> The growth mixture model is {{a natural extension of}} these models. It comes at hand when information about <b>sub-populations</b> is missing and researchers nevertheless want to retrieve developmental trajectories from <b>sub-populations.</b> We argue that researchers have to make rather strong assumptions about the <b>sub-populations</b> or latent trajectory classes in order to retrieve existing population differences. A simulated example is discussed, showing that a sample of repeated measures drawn from two <b>sub-populations</b> easily leads to the mistaken inference of three <b>sub-populations,</b> when assumptions are not met. The merits of methodological advises on this issue are discussed. It is concluded that growth mixture models should be used with understanding, and offer no free way to growth patterns in unknown <b>sub-populations.</b> Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
50|$|In this equation, HT {{represents}} the expected heterozygosity {{of the total}} population and HS is the expected heterozygosity of a <b>sub-populations.</b> Both measures of heterozygosity are measured at one loci. In the equation, heterozygosity values expected from the total population are compared to observed heterozygosity values of the <b>sub-populations</b> within this total population. Larger FST values imply that the level of genetic differentiation between <b>sub-populations</b> within a total population is more significant. The level of differentiation {{is the result of a}} balance between gene flow amongst <b>sub-populations</b> (decreasing differentiation) and genetic drift within these <b>sub-populations</b> (increasing differentiation); however, some molecular ecologists note that it cannot be assumed that these factors are at equilibrium. FST can also be viewed as a way of comparing the amount of inbreeding within <b>sub-populations</b> to the amount of inbreeding for the total population and is sometimes referred to as an inbreeding coefficient. In these cases, higher FST values typically imply higher amounts of inbreeding within the <b>sub-populations.</b> Other factors such as selection pressures may also have an impact on FST values.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} a hierarchical coevolutionary genetic algorithm under different partnering strategies. Cascading clusters of <b>sub-populations</b> are built from the bottom up, with higher-level <b>sub-populations</b> optimising larger parts of the problem. Hence higher-level <b>sub-populations</b> potentially search a larger search space with a lower resolution whilst lower-level <b>sub-populations</b> search a smaller search space with a higher resolution. The effects of different partner selection schemes amongst the <b>sub-populations</b> on solution quality are examined for two constrained optimisation problems. We examine a number of recombination partnering strategies in the construction of higher-level individuals and a number of related schemes for evaluating sub-solutions. It is shown that partnering strategies that exploit problemspecific knowledge are superior and can counter inappropriate (sub-) fitness measurements.

25|$|A broad genetic {{sampling}} of 95 wild Russian tigers found markedly low genetic diversity, with the effective population size extraordinarily low {{in comparison to}} the census population size, with the population behaving as if it were just 27–35 individuals. Further exacerbating the problem is that more than 90% of the population occurs in the Sikhote Alin mountain region, and there is little movement of tigers across the development corridor, which separates this <b>sub-population</b> from the much smaller <b>sub-population</b> found in southwest Primorye province.|$|E

30|$|The {{population}} {{structure of a}} diverse panel can affect the analysis of genotype-phenotype associations (Zhao et al. 2011). Population structure results in divergence of allele frequencies of the <b>sub-populations.</b> Loci which vary in allele frequencies between <b>sub-populations</b> {{can be associated with}} the phenotype when the means of the <b>sub-populations</b> diverge for a particular trait of interest (Zhang et al. 2009 b).

25|$|The genetic {{distance}} between populations is often measured by Fixation index (Fst), based on genetic polymorphism data, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or microsatellites. Fst {{is a special}} case of F-statistics, the concept developed in the 1920s by Sewall Wright. Fst is simply the correlation of randomly chosen alleles within the same <b>sub-population</b> relative to that found in the entire population. It is often expressed as the proportion of genetic diversity due to allele frequency differences among populations.|$|E

40|$|Breeding {{efficiency}} {{was compared}} among three population schemes; a single population, a population with two <b>sub-populations</b> and a population with three <b>sub-populations</b> when sets of realistics genetic parameters were assumed, and when breeding objectives were {{changed in the}} middle of selection program. A simulation experiment of selection was carried out for 10 generations with 20 replications each by comparing average breeding values and inbreeding coefficients among the three population schemes. Genetic gain of growth trait was the largest, then that of meat quality trait was the second largest, and that of reproductive trait was the smallest. The amount of the genetic gain was dependent on their genetic variance. Among the three population schemes, the single population scheme had similar genetic level with the other two schemes under a selection with same economic weights for the traits, however, the multiple <b>sub-populations</b> scheme had the highest genetic level after crossbreeding between <b>sub-populations</b> when inbreeding depression was assumed. The population shceme with three <b>sub-populations</b> can enjoy full advantage of heterosis when different economic weights were applied to the traits. The change of breeding objective made impact on genetic gain of population scheme when different economic weights were applied to the traits, where the population scheme with three <b>sub-populations</b> had higher genetic than the older population schemes...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{estimates}} of larval retention and connectivity {{are essential to}} understand the structure and dynamics of marine metapopulations, and optimize the size and spacing of reserves within networks of marine-protected areas (MPAs). For coral reef fishes, while there are some empirical {{estimates of}} self-recruitment at isolated populations, exchange among <b>sub-populations</b> has been rarely quantified. Here, we used microsatellite DNA markers and a likelihood-based parentage analysis to assess the relative magnitude of self-recruitment and exchange among eight geographically distinct <b>sub-populations</b> of the panda clownfish Amphiprion polymnus along 30 km of coastline near Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. In addition, we used an assignment/exclusion test to identify immigrants arriving from genetically distinct sources. Overall, 82 per cent of the juveniles were immigrants while 18 per cent were progeny of parents genotyped in our focal metapopulation. Of the immigrants, only 6 per cent {{were likely to be}} genetically distinct from the focal metapopulation, suggesting most of the connectivity is among <b>sub-populations</b> from a rather homogeneous genetic pool. Of the 18 per cent that were progeny of known adults, two-thirds dispersed among the eight <b>sub-populations</b> and only one-third settled back into natal <b>sub-populations.</b> Comparison of our data with previous studies suggested that variation in dispersal distances is likely to be influenced by the geographical setting and spacing of <b>sub-populations...</b>|$|R
