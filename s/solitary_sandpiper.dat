5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
50|$|It {{resembles a}} longer-legged and more {{delicate}} green (T. ochropus) or <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (T. solitaria) {{with a short}} fine bill, brown back and longer yellowish legs. It differs from the first of those species in a smaller and less contrasting white rump patch, while the <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper</b> has no white rump patch at all.|$|E
50|$|The <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper</b> {{is not a}} gregarious species, usually seen alone during migration, {{although}} sometimes {{small numbers}} congregate in suitable feeding areas. The <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper</b> {{is very much a}} bird of fresh water, and is often found in sites, such as ditches, too restricted for other waders, which tend to like a clear all-round view.|$|E
50|$|Bird {{watching}} in the reeds along the lakeside is common as {{the park has}} populations of sandhill cranes, boreal owls, northern pygmy-owls, greater yellowlegs, western tangers and <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpipers.</b> Fish species in Twin Lakes include Fathead Minnow, Northern Pike, Pearl Dave, Rainbow Trout, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. In the summer months, Black bears are frequent within the park and nearby areas. Occasionally grizzly bears are sighted as well. Bear safety is important and park conservation officiers are available to share information and safety brochures. Moose and deer are abundant and commonly viewed. The area also has beaver, red squirrel, shrew and occasionally cougers.|$|R
5000|$|Notable {{wildlife}} includes harbor seals, {{which are}} often found on Badgers Rocks in the Merrimack River {{in the fall and}} winter. Birds that can be sighted include black ducks, green-winged teal, and great blue herons, along with pectoral, <b>solitary,</b> and least <b>sandpipers.</b> [...] "White-winged and surf scoters can be seen flying low over open water or bobbing in loose flocks among the offshore waves." ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{conspicuous}} and characteristically patterned in flight, {{with the}} wings dark {{above and below}} and a brilliant white rump. The latter feature reliably distinguishes it from the slightly smaller but otherwise very similar <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (T. solitaria) of North America.|$|E
50|$|The {{green sandpiper}} {{represents}} an ancient lineage {{of the genus}} Tringa; its only close living relative is the <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (T. solitaria). They both have brown wings with little light dots and a delicate but contrasting neck and chest pattern. In addition, both species nest in trees, unlike most other scolopacids.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Tringa solitaria) {{is a small}} shorebird. The genus name Tringa is the New Latin name {{given to}} the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird {{mentioned}} by Aristotle. The specific solitaria is Latin for [...] "solitary" [...] from solus, [...] "alone".|$|E
50|$|The refuge {{is one of}} the few {{scattered}} {{remnants of}} wetland habitats that still exist on Oahu and {{is one of the}} most productive waterbird wetlands for resident and migratory species such as the kioea (bristle-thighed curlew, Numenius tahitiensis) and akekeke (ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres). A total of 119 bird species have been documented on the refuge since its inception. Unusual vagrant birds include the northern harrier, peregrine falcon, black-tailed godwit, Hudsonian godwit, curlew sandpiper, <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> and snowy egret. There are no native mammals, reptiles, or amphibians.|$|E
50|$|The 24 ha wetland of Torca {{is located}} in the Torca River basin. Amphibians {{registered}} in Torca are among others the green dotted treefrog (Hyla labialis) and the cream-backed poison frog (Colostethus subpunctatus). In Torca, 24 bird species have been registered, among others the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), Bogotá rail (Rallus semiplumbeus), common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), noble snipe (Gallinago nobilis), <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Tringa solitaria), grassland yellow finch (Sicalis luteola) and the endemic species to Colombia, yellow-hooded blackbird (Chrysomus icterocephalus). The flora species Carex lanuginosa was a new discovery in the Torca wetland.|$|E
50|$|Temperatures {{range from}} 18 to 32 C {{with an average}} of 26 C.Average annual {{rainfall}} is 2250 mm.There are three dominant vegetation types including at least 285 tree species in 55 botanical families.Most of the area is covered by open rainforest, with smaller areas of dense rainforest and savannah, the last of which have little commercial value.Migratory birds include black-tailed tityra (Tityra cayana), nacunda nighthawk (Chordeiles nacunda), band-rumped swift (Chaetura spinicaudus), fork-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus savana), <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Tringa solitaria), vermilion flycatcher (Pyrocephalus rubinus) and purple martin (Progne subis).|$|E
50|$|Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge is {{along the}} southernmost {{portion of the}} lower Mississippi River, which does not have levees. It {{experiences}} floods most years. The refuge is home to many species, including the federally listed Louisiana black bear. The Mississippi River is a major bird migration corridor; it is located within an area of high importance for neotropical migratory birds, including the swallow-tailed kite, which is a species of special concern. Other wildlife found in the area include white-tailed deer, bobcat, mink, river otter, wild turkey, black-crowned night-heron, wood duck, blue-winged teal, woodcock, <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> greater yellowlegs, prothonotary warbler, northern parula, pileated woodpecker, green tree frog, and red-eared slider.|$|E

50|$|This species {{measures}} 18 - 23 cm long, with a wingspan up to 50 cm and a {{body mass}} of 31 - 65 g. It is a dumpy wader with a dark green back, greyish head and breast and otherwise white underparts. It is obvious in flight, with wings dark above and below, and a dark rump and tail centre. The latter feature distinguishes it from the slightly larger and broader-winged, but otherwise very similar, green sandpiper of Europe and Asia, {{to which it is}} closely related. The latter species has a brilliant white rump. In flight, the <b>solitary</b> <b>sandpiper</b> has a characteristic three-note whistle. They both have brown wings with little light dots, and a delicate but contrasting neck and chest pattern. In addition, both species nest in trees, unlike most other scolopacids.|$|E
