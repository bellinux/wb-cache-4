40|$|DE 10139844 C UPAB: 20030513 NOVELTY - The {{connector}} has a plug (1) fitted into a seating {{provided in}} a <b>socket</b> <b>housing</b> (2), the plug and the <b>socket</b> <b>housing</b> having respective electrode structures (11, 22) brought into electrical contact with one another, with an internal ventilation channel (3) {{provided in the}} plug or the <b>socket</b> <b>housing</b> between an exernal opening (32) and an internal opening (31) facing the electrode structure. One of the latter openings is closed upon insertion of the plug in the <b>socket</b> <b>housing,</b> the ventialtion channel providing a connection with the gas-tight volume containing the electrode structures for ingress of external air upon connector separation. USE - The two-part electrical plug connector is used for automobile applications with operating voltages of 42 Volts. ADVANTAGE - Prevents arcing between cooperating electrode structures...|$|E
40|$|The tegumental glands of Derocheilocaris typica are tricellular. Their {{openings}} {{are formed}} by two transformed epidermal cells, {{each with a}} microvillar crown. These cells form a cuticular <b>socket</b> <b>housing</b> {{the tip of the}} underlying secretory cell. From the outside, the gland openings are seen as,a pit in the cuticle, from the bottom of which a thin cuticular chimney ends with a slit-like pore. The gland openings are distributed in a regular pattern on the body. Cytologically, the secretory cells of the body glands fall into at least two categories, each with a specific distribution on the body. The labral tegumentary glands are morphologically similar, but have two or three secretory cells. The morphology of the mystacocaridean tegumental gland deviates clearly from that of cephalocarid and also from other crustacean tricellular tegumental glands...|$|E
40|$|A {{probe and}} socket {{assembly}} for {{serving as a}} mechanical interface between structures is presented. The assembly comprises a socket having a housing adapted for connection to a first supporting structure and a probe which is readily connectable to a second structure and {{is designed to be}} easily grappled and manipulated by a robotic device for insertion and coupling with the socket. Cooperable automatic locking means are provided on the probe shaft and <b>socket</b> <b>housing</b> for automatically locking the probe in the socket when the probe is inserted a predetermined distance. A second cooperable locking means on the probe shaft and housing are adapted for actuation after the probe has been inserted the predetermined distance. Actuation means mounted on the probe and responsive to the grip of the probe handle by a gripping device, such as a robot for conditioning the probe for insertion and are also responsive to release of the grip of the probe handle to actuate the second locking means to provide a hard lock of the probe in the socket...|$|E

50|$|This socket is a 495 pin CPU <b>socket</b> {{designed}} to <b>house</b> any processor in the Socket 495 package. The socket has a 1.27mm pitch and is {{designed to}} support a heatsink.|$|R
50|$|Wallpaper steamers {{have been}} more popular in countries, such as the UK or Europe, using 230V {{domestic}} electricity. This provides around 3kW of steam generating capacity from all <b>sockets</b> around the <b>house.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Jyashi is {{a serene}} shinobi who carries a katana {{and has a}} {{specialized}} eye <b>socket</b> that <b>houses</b> a hypnosis device that transports his opponents to an illusory world. He can also take an eye from a corpse and place it within his eye socket to see its final images. His left arm is mechanical and has an automatic launcher that fires arrows at a tremendous rate. He is the brother of Rengoku.|$|R
50|$|Constructed by JDA Construction Ltd it was {{completed}} in the late 1970s. The main house Packsaddle House had been left for many years empty, the land was sold and in late 1970s/early 1980s the house burned down. The only remaining part of the grounds is Packsaddle Lodge the original gate house to the estate. The estate was built as a modern executive home standard. This meant that all houses had en suite master bedrooms, double garages and all rooms have TV aerial <b>sockets.</b> Some <b>houses</b> feature swimming pools, and more recently some of the houses have been extended, this falls in-line {{with a lot of}} recent developments in Prestbury and other areas in Cheshire.|$|R
50|$|When {{there is}} only one <b>socket</b> in a <b>house</b> or apartment, the {{incoming}} line is connected to the two lower receptacles and the upper receptacles are left unused. When a subscriber has more than one telephone socket, they typically are connected so that two telephones can not be connected to the telephone exchange at the same time. This is done by connecting the two upper receptacles of a socket to the lower receptacles of the next socket. When a connected telephone's handset is lifted the two twisted pair connections are separated, thus disconnecting any telephones downward in the chain.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, BT Introduced a vDSL {{service to}} the UK known as BT Infinity {{and at the same}} time {{introduced}} the BT vDSL Interstitial Faceplate, which performs two functions: DSL filter and Bell Wire noise suppression. The vDSL modem now plugs directly into the RJ11 socket on the faceplate. The faceplate can be easily fitted by removing the two bottom screws on a NTE5, sliding the bottom section out and fitting this in between. The result is that the entire extension circuit is filtered by the vDSL plate meaning that there is now no need for DSL filters on every Telephone <b>Socket</b> in the <b>house.</b> This product can also be fitted to ADSL lines and has been shown to improve connection speeds for vDSL and aDSL customers alike.|$|R
