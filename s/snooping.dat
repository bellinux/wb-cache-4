5|$|After {{a time of}} {{not seeing}} Tigerstar, Sasha returns to her den one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. Asking him where he was, he {{comments}} on how nice her den was, and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him why he was <b>snooping</b> around in her den, and he tells her that he cannot see her any more if she has the collar. She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E
5|$|Computer systems {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus <b>snooping</b> {{is one of the most}} common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.|$|E
5|$|Drax's henchman Krebs {{is caught}} by Bond <b>snooping</b> through his room. Later, an {{attempted}} assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they swim beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers {{the truth about}} the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory figures with those in a notebook picked from Drax's pocket. She is captured by Krebs, and finds herself captive in a secret radio homing station—intended to serve as a beacon for the missile's guidance system—in the heart of London. While she is being taken back to the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs.|$|E
40|$|As {{multi-core}} processors evolve, coherence traffic between cores {{is becoming}} problematic, {{both in terms}} of performance and power. The negative effects of coherence (<b>snoop)</b> traffic can be significantly mitigated through <b>snoop</b> filtering. Shielding each cache with a device that can squash <b>snoop</b> requests for addresses known not to be in cache improves performance significantly for caches that cannot perform normal load and <b>snoop</b> lookups simultaneously. In addition, reducing <b>snoop</b> lookups yields power savings. This paper describes the design of the Blue Gene/P <b>snoop</b> filters, and presents hardware measurements to demonstrate their effectiveness. The Blue Gene/P <b>snoop</b> filters combine stream registers and <b>snoop</b> caches to capture both the locality of <b>snoop</b> addresses and their streaming behavior. Simulations of SPLASH- 2 benchmarks illustrate tradeoffs and strengths of these two techniques. Their combination is shown to be most effective, eliminating 94 - 99 % of all <b>snoop</b> requests using very few stream registers and <b>snoop</b> cache lines. This translates into an average performance improvement of almost 20 % for the NAS benchmarks running on an actual Blue Gene/P system. 1...|$|R

500|$|Since airing, the {{installment}} {{has received}} mixed to generally positive reviews. In his review for IGN, contributor Colin Moriarty presented mixed feelings toward the episode, saying that, for the show, [...] "perhaps there's {{light at the}} end of the tunnel after all". He considered the episode to have [...] "dropped in posthaste behind Monk", but that it [...] "didn't have its usual negative connotation this week... at least, not in full force". Moriarty stated that the [...] "show seemed to take an interesting and much-desired turn for the better". He considered the show to be moving away from being predictable, but that its [...] "stride is below average". Moriarty considered the episode to be more intriguing, and that the characters were developed quite well, especially that of Gus. He continued to question whether the show would be able to last more than one season, but considered the show to be becoming better developed. Moriarty praised two scenes in the episode, Shawn and Gus' conversation on the way to the graveyard and Shawn <b>snooping</b> in the police file room, as being the funniest of the episode. The installment was given a rating of 7, or [...] "good", making it an improvement over the previous two episodes, [...] "Spellingg Bee" [...] and [...] "Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Piece", as well as tying it for the highest rated episode of the season at the time.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of Lakes' discoveries, the Transcontinental Railroad was being built through a remote area of Wyoming. Marsh's letter was from two men {{identifying}} themselves as Harlow and Edwards (their real names were Carlin and Reed), workers on the Union Pacific Railroad. The two men claimed they had found large numbers of fossils in Como Bluff, and warned that there were others in the area [...] "looking for such things", which Marsh took to mean Cope. Williston, who had just wearily arrived in Kansas {{after the collapse of}} the Morrison mine, was quickly dispatched to Como Bluff by Marsh. His former student sent back a message, confirming the large quantities of bones and that it was Cope's men <b>snooping</b> around the area. Wary of repeating the same mistakes he had made with Lakes, Marsh quickly sent money to the two new bone hunters and urged them to send additional fossils. Williston struck a preliminary bargain with Carlin and Reed (who had been unable to cash Marsh's check due to it being made out to their pseudonyms), but Carlin decided he would head to New Haven to deal with Marsh directly. Marsh drew up a contract calling for a set monthly fee, with additional cash bonuses to Carlin and Reed possible, depending on the importance of the finds. Marsh also reserved the right to send his own [...] "superintendents" [...] to supervise the digging if needed, and advised the men to try to keep Cope out of the region. Despite a face-to-face meeting, Carlin failed to negotiate better terms from Marsh. The paleontologist procured Carlin's and Reed's services, but seeds of resentment were sown as the bone hunters felt Marsh had bullied them into the deal. Marsh's investment in the Como Bluff region soon produced rich results. While Marsh's own collectors headed east for the winter, Reed sent carloads of bones by rail to Marsh throughout 1877. Marsh described and named dinosaurs such as Stegosaurus, Allosaurus, and Apatosaurus in the December 1877 issue of the American Journal of Science.|$|E
