40|$|OBJECTIVE. The primary aim of {{our study}} was to {{determine}} the interobserver agreement of defecography in diagnosing enterocele, anterior rectocele, intussusception, and anismus in fecal-incontinent patients. The subsidiary aim was to evaluate the influence of level of experience on interpreting defecography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Defecography was performed in 105 consecutive fecalincontinent patients. Observers were classified by level of experience and their findings were compared with the findings of an expert radiologist. The quality of the expert radiologist's findings was evaluated by an intraobserver agreement procedure. RESULTS. Intraobserver agreement was good to very good except for anismus: incomplete evacuation after 30 <b>sec</b> (<b>K,</b> 0. 55) and puborectalis impression (K, 0. 54). Interobserver agreement for enterocele and rectocele was good (K, 0. 66 for both) and for intussusception, fair (K, 0. 29). Interobserver agreement for anismus: incomplete evacuation after 30 sec was moderate (K, 0. 47), and for anismus: puborectalis impression was fair (K, 0. 24). Agreement in grading of enterocele and rectocele was good (K, 0. 64 and 0. 72, respectively) and for intussusception, fair (K, 0. 39). Agreement separated by experience level was very good for rectocele (K, 0. 83) and grading of rectoceles (K, 0. 83) and moderate for intussusception (K, 0. 44) at the most experienced level. For enterocele and grading, experience level did not influence the reproducibility. CONCLUSION. Reproducibility for enterocele, anterior rectocele, and severity grading is good, but for intussusception is fair to moderate. For anismus, the diagnosis of incomplete evacuation after 30 sec is more reproducible than puborectalis impression. The level of experience seems to play a role in diagnosing anterior rectocele and its grading and in diagnosing intussusceptio...|$|E

Interestingly, {{the size and}} composition of the E 3 region differs considerably among Ad species, suggesting that distinct sets of immunomodulatory E 3 proteins may influence their interaction with the human host and the disease pattern. However, to date, only common immune evasion functions of species C E 3 proteins have been described. Here {{we report on the}} immunomodulatory activity of a species D-specific E 3 protein, E 3 / 49 K. Unlike all other E 3 proteins that act on infected cells, E 3 / 49 K seems to target uninfected cells. Initially synthesized as an 80 - to 100 -kDa type I transmembrane protein, E 3 / 49 K is subsequently cleaved, with the large ectodomain (<b>sec</b> 49 <b>K)</b> secreted.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} to evaluate the effects of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and mineral surface area on the rate of oxidation of pyrrhotite in seawater. Experiments employed to determine these effects utilized temperature-controlled circulation baths, Teflon reaction vessels, synthetic seawater, and pure, hand-sorted natural pyrrhotite crystals. Both batch and flow-through reactor methods were used and reaction products were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The rate law takes the following form:Rsp (Fe(1 -x) S) = k (MH+) a(MO 2 (aq)) bwhere R is the specific oxidation rate of pyrrhotite (moles/L <b>sec),</b> <b>k</b> is the rate constant (a function of temperature and surface area), and a and b are reaction orders for reactant concentrations (M), determined experimentally. The isolation method was used to obtain the reaction order of each reactant {{on the basis of}} initial rates. The rate law for the oxidation of pyrrhotite in seawater derived in this study is:Rsp(Fe(1 -x) S) = - 5. 38 x 10 - 8 (MH+) 0. 08 ± 0. 03 (MO 2 (aq)) 0. 30 ± 0. 07 The value for k is averaged from runs at 22. 0 oC, which was used at the primary run temperature for convenience. Values for k from all runs are in Appendix A. Data from batch reactor experiments indicated positive influences of oxidant concentration, surface area, temperature, and [H+] on the initial rate. Pyrrhotite oxidizes significantly faster than chalcopyrite, providing an upper limit to the anthropogenic and natural inorganic weathering rates of seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits. Inorganic rates are most relevant to rapid seafloor mining timespans (minutes to days), within which significant bacterial colonization of freshly ground sulfide mineral surfaces is not likely to occur (e. g., McBeth et al., 2011). In the future, microbial studies will be needed in order to quantify the catalyzing or inhibitory effects of bacteria on natural, in situ seafloor pyrrhotite oxidation using this study as a baseline...|$|E

40|$|The E 3 {{transcription}} unit of human species C adenoviruses (Ads) encodes immunomodulatory proteins that mediate direct protection of infected cells. Recently, we described a novel immunomodulatory function for E 3 / 49 K, an E 3 protein uniquely expressed by species D Ads. E 3 / 49 K of Ad 19 a/Ad 64, a serotype that causes epidemic keratokonjunctivitis, is synthesized {{as a highly}} glycosylated type I transmembrane protein that is subsequently cleaved resulting in secretion of its large ectodomain (<b>sec</b> 49 <b>K).</b> <b>Sec</b> 49 <b>K</b> binds to CD 45 on leukocytes, impairing activation and functions of NK cells and T cells. E 3 / 49 K is localized in the Golgi/trans-Golgi-network (TGN), early endosomes and on the plasma membrane, yet the cellular compartment where E 3 / 49 K is cleaved and the protease involved remained elusive. Here we show that TGN-localized E 3 / 49 K comprises both newly-synthesized and recycled molecules. Full-length E 3 / 49 K was not detected in late endosomes/lysosomes but the C-terminal fragment accumulated in this compartment at late times of infection. Inhibitor studies showed that cleavage occurs in a post-TGN compartment and that lysosomotropic agents enhance secretion. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic tail of E 3 / 49 K contains two potential sorting motifs, YxxΦ and LL that are important for binding the clathrin adaptor proteins AP- 1 and AP- 2 in vitro. Surprisingly, mutating the LL motif, either alone or together with YxxΦ, did not prevent proteolytic processing, but increased cell surface expression and secretion. Upon Brefeldin-A treatment cell surface expression was rapidly lost, even for mutants lacking all known endocytosis motifs. Together with immunofluorescence data, we propose a model for intracellular E 3 / 49 K transport whereby cleavage takes place on the cell surface by matrix-metalloproteases. ...|$|R

Parametric design data was obtained at five engine thrusts from 7. 5 K lbf to 50 K lbf. Also, a separate task evaluated engine throttling over a 20 : 1 range and operation at a mixture ratio of 12 plus or minus 1 versus the 6 plus or minus 1 nominal. Cost data was also generated for DDT&E, first unit production, and factors in other life cycle costs. The major limitation of the study was lack of contact with vehicle prime contractors to resolve the issues in vehicle/engine interfaces. The baseline Aerojet dual propellant expander cycle was shown capable of meeting all performance requirements with an expected long operational life due to the high thermal margins. The basic engine design readily accommodated the 20 : 1 throttling requirement and operation up to a mixture ratio of 10 without change. By using platinum for baffled injector construction the increased thermal margin allowed operation up to mixture ratio 13. An initial engine modeling with an Aerojet transient simulation code (named MLETS) indicates stable engine operation with the baseline control system. A throttle ratio of 4 to 5 seconds from 10 percent to 100 percent thrust is also predicted.

Test conditions included a water flow rate of 68. 0 liter per hour and airflow rates (per unit area) of 3. 7 to 25. 7 g per square cm per <b>sec,</b> at 293 <b>K</b> and inlet-air static pressures of 1. 01 x 10 to the 5 th to 1. 98 x 10 to the 5 th N/sq m...|$|R
40|$|The ClO + NO 2 + M {{reaction}} {{has been}} studied with two techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the products, and flash photolysis-ultraviolet absorption to monitor the decay of ClO in excess NO 2. The measured third-order rate constant is 1. 5 x 10 to the - 31 st cm to the 6 th/molecule-squared per <b>sec</b> at 298 <b>K</b> with M = N 2, in good agreement with previous literature values, but the rate constant appears to decrease by up to a factor of three {{in the presence of}} increasing amounts of OClO. For the infrared studies a stoichiometric mixture of ClO and NO 2 was prepared in a flow system by mixing NO with OClO; at least as much NO 2 as ClONO 2 was produced under a variety of experimental conditions. These two sets of results are incompatible with the assumption made in previous kinetic studies that ClONO 2 is the only recombination product; other isomers such as OClONO or ClOONO are likely to be formed three to four times faster. These results imply that potential stratospheric ozone depletion due to chlorofluoromethanes may be even larger than previously thought...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{systematically}} {{investigated the}} effect of chronic mild stress and response to antidepressant treatment in the lateral habenula at the whole genome level. Methods: Rat whole genome expression chips (Affymetrix) were used to detect gene expression regulations in the lateral habenula of rats subjected to chronic mild stress (mild stressors exchanged twice a day for 8 weeks). Some rats received antidepressant treatment during fifth to eights week of CMS. The lateral habenula gene expression profile was studied through the gene ontology and signal pathway analyses using bioinformatics. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the microarray results and determine {{the expression of the}} Fcrla, Eif 3 <b>k,</b> <b>Sec</b> 3 l 1, Ubr 5, Abca 8 a, Ankrd 49, Cyp 2 j 10, Frs 3, Syn 2, and Znf 503 genes in the lateral habenula tissue. Results: In particular we found that stress and antidepressant treatment affected intracellular cascades like growth factor receptor signaling, G-protein-coupled receptor signaling, and Wnt signaling – processes involved in the neuroplastic changes observed during the progression of depression and antidepressant treatment. Conclusion: The present study suggests an important role of the lateral habenula in the development of depression-like conditions and correlates to previous studies demonstrating a significant role of the lateral habenula in depressive-like conditions and antidepressant treatment...|$|R
40|$|Characteristic mean drop diameters were {{determined}} for downstream and upstream injection into nonswirling and swirling airflows. The {{effects of the}} aerodynamic and liquid surface forces on the mean drop size were obtained with a scanning radiometer. Water jet breakup was studied primarily in the acceleration wave regime with values of WeRe 10 to the 6 th power and the following empirical expression was obtained: D(o) /D(m) =C (WeRe) to the 0. 4, power where D(o) and D(m) are the orifice and mean drop diameters, respectively. We and Re are the Weber and Reynolds numbers defined as repectively, We = rho(a) D(o) V(r) /sigma and Re = D(o) V(r) /nu, where V(r) and rho(a) are airstream relative velocity and density, respectively, and sigma and nu are surface tension and kinematic viscosity of the liquid, respectively. The proportionally constant C was evaluated as follows: for downstream injection, C = 0. 023 with nonswirling airflow, and C = 0. 027 with swirling airflow. For upstream injection, the empirical expression D(o) /D(m) = 0. 0045 (WeRe) to the 0. 5 power was obtained with nonswirling airflow. Experimental conditions included a water flow rate of 68 liter per hour and an airflow rate per unit area range of 4. 6 to 25. 2 gm/sq cm <b>sec</b> at 293 <b>K</b> and atmospheric pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of tertiary {{butyl acetate}} in water, in aqueous acetone, and in aqueous dioxan, over {{a range of}} temperature have been studied. The Arrhenius equation is not obeyed. In 40 % water- 60 % acetone the energy of activation varies from 26 - 29 kcal mole for temperatures 48 - 97 °C. This is due presumably to simultaneous hydrolyses via the A 1 and the A 2 mechanisms. By combination of oxygen- 18 tracer results and kinetic results the rate constants for reactions by these mechanisms in water have been separated. The observed percentage of alkyl-oxygen fission in water varies from 85 at 25 °C to 97 at 60 °C. Rate constants for reactions by the A 1 and the A 2 mechanisms are expressed by the equations: K(sec l mole) = 10 exp (- 27500 /RT), and k(sec l mole) = 10 exp (-l 73 OO/RT), respectively. However, {{the parameters of the}} latter equation may contain considerable errors because the extent of reaction by the A 2 mechanism is small. In water and in 80 % water- 20 % acetone, tertiary butyl acetate undergoes an uncatalysed solvolytic reaction, involving presumably the B 1 mechanism. The variation of the rate of this reaction with temperature is expressed by the equation, <b>k</b> (<b>sec)</b> = 10 exp(- 26800 /RT) ...|$|R
