40|$|AbstractThe {{recombination}} {{induced by}} <b>soldering</b> <b>pads,</b> screen printed with a commercially available paste containing primarily silver and an aluminium amount of 1 - 5 %wt, is investigated concerning the open-circuit voltage for aluminium back surface field (Al-BSF) solar cells. The saturation current density Jo,pad due to <b>soldering</b> <b>pads</b> {{is found to}} be in the range of 26. 7 103 to 85. 4 103 fA/cm 2 for different conditions of the rear silicon surface. The recombination under <b>soldering</b> <b>pads</b> leads to a voltage drop of ΔVoc = 6. 7 mV for Al-BSF solar cells with 6. 2 % of the rear side being covered with <b>soldering</b> <b>pads</b> compared to a cell with full-area Al-BSF. Within a microstructural analysis of the interface between the silicon surface and the <b>soldering</b> <b>pads</b> it is found that Al-alloying from the Al share in the <b>soldering</b> <b>pad</b> paste only occurs insularly. Furthermore, Al-BSF cells with and without residual rear side emitter and varying area fraction of <b>soldering</b> <b>pads,</b> using a <b>soldering</b> <b>pad</b> paste with and without an Al-share, are investigated. It is found that the non-overcompensated emitter regions under the <b>soldering</b> <b>pads</b> of Al-BSF solar cells affect cell performance dramatically in case of full area <b>soldering</b> <b>pad,</b> especially for an Al-free pad paste...|$|R

40|$|A submodeling {{technique}} using MSC/PATRAN {{program and}} ABAQUS nonlinear finite element code, {{combined with a}} Taguchi design-of-experiments approach, was used to optimize the shear strength of spherical ball attachment on an aluminum nitride substrate. In the current design, the sphere is brazed onto a gold <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> on the backside of the substrate using a gold-tin solder. In the present study, the finite element model was first calibrated by test. Three design parameters were then chosen to evaluate the impact of variation of these parameters on the attachment shear strength. Analysis {{results indicate that the}} <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> size is the most critical parameter affecting this shear strength, and the misalignment between the sphere and the <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> is the next most critical. Therefore, to effectively improve the attachment shear strength, it is recommended to: (1) Use a larger solder pad; and (2) Minimize the misalignment between the sphere and the mounting <b>solder</b> <b>pad.</b> By implementing only the first recommendation into the current design, i. e., increasing the pad diameter from 0. 02 in. to 0. 03 in., the attachment shear strength could be improved b...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} time-domain reflectometry (TDR) as a nondestructive sensing {{method for}} interconnect failure mechanisms. Two competing interconnect failure mechanisms of electronics were considered: solder joint cracking and <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> cratering. A simple theoretical analysis {{is presented to}} explain the effect of each failure mechanism on the TDR reflection coefficient. Mechanical fatigue tests have been conducted to confirm the theoretical analysis. The test results consistently demonstrated that the TDR reflection coefficient gradually decreased as the <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> separated from the circuit board, whereas it increased during solder joint cracking. Traditional test methods based on electrical resistance monitoring cannot distinguish between failure mechanisms and do not detect degradation until an open circuit has been created.

40|$|Abstract: Solder joint shape {{refers to}} {{geometry}} that molten solder {{can be achieved}} with spreading and wetting along the metal surface in the junction between components solder pins and printed circuit board (PCB) pad, to the metal surface contact angle and solder fillet shape[1]. BLP (Bottom Leaded Plastic) [2] {{which is not a}} type of thin out-line surface mount device(SMD) without the side lead is widely used in manufacturing of new generation memory such as SDRAM RDRAM DDR. For this non-lead SMD, the shape and reliability of solder joint is the focus of the study. In this paper, we select the C-BLP of 28 -pin device as the research object, complete the forming model of solder joint shape based on minimum energy principle and the solder joint shape theory by using Surface Evolver software, and analyze two critical process parameters (solder volume and <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> width) impacting on the solder joint shape. The study results show that the <b>solder</b> volume and <b>pad</b> width {{have a significant impact on}} the three-dimensional shape of BLP solder joint. The law of which is that: in the case of the other fixed parameters, as the increase of the solder volume, solder joint surface gradually changes from the relatively flat to the convex, solder joint gradually changes from the completely soldered to the partly <b>soldered</b> in the <b>pad</b> connections, and <b>solder</b> joint heights are gradually decreased; in the case of the other fixed parameters, as the increase of the pad in width, the solder joint surface gradually changes from the convex to the flat, solder joint gradually changes from the completely soldered to the partly <b>soldered</b> in the <b>pad</b> connections, and <b>solder</b> joint heights are gradually decreased. The actual solder joint shape designs of BLP devices can be instructed based on predicted results...|$|R

The pressure contacts between interconnection ribbon and silver (Ag) show very low contact resistances in contrast to the resistance for pressure contacts to the aluminum (Al) rear side which were found to be at least one magnitude higher. Degradation tests verify that on module level these pressure contacts are not sufficient for reliable cell interconnection, neither to Al nor Ag.
