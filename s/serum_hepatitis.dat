500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} an epidemic caused by [...] virus was made by Lurman in 1885. An outbreak of smallpox occurred in Bremen in 1883 and 1,289 shipyard employees were vaccinated with lymph from other people.

Later, numerous similar outbreaks were reported following the introduction, in 1909, of hypodermic needles that were used, and, more importantly, reused, for administering Salvarsan for the treatment of syphilis. The virus was not discovered until 1966 when Baruch Blumberg, then working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), discovered the Australia antigen (later known to be [...] surface antigen, or HBsAg) in the blood of Australian aboriginal people. Although a virus had been suspected since the research published by Frederick MacCallum in 1947, David Dane and others discovered the virus particle in 1970 by electron microscopy.

Accusations were leveled that the researchers had used mentally disabled children as [...] "human guinea pigs," [...] but the chief critic of the project — New York Senator Seymour R.

50|$|A sensitivie {{and simple}} {{procedure}} {{for the detection}} and quantitation of soluble complement (C)- fixing immune complexes in sera of patients with various disease states has been developed by utilizing C receptors on Raji cells. These cells lack membrane-bound immunoglobulin but have receptors for IgG Fc, C3b, C3d, and possibly with other C proteins. Uptake experiments showed that both aggregated human gamma globulin (AHG) and 7S IgG bound to receptors for IgG Fc; however, AHG reacted with C bound to cells only via receptors for C and this binding was much more efficient than via IgG Fc receptors. AHG {{was used as an}} in vitro model of human immune complexes and its uptake by Raji cells was quantitated by 125I-radiolabeled antihuman IgG. The limit of sensitivity of this test was 6 mug AHG/ml serum. The ability of Raji cells to detect AHG in serum depended on the amount of radioactive antibody used and the size of aggregates. The presence of an excess of C somewhat inhibited binding of AHG containing C to Raji cells. The efficient binding of AHG by receptors for C on Raji cells was used for the detection and quantitation of immune complexes in human sera. Raji cells were incubated with sera to be tested and then reacted with excess radiolabeled antihuman IgG; the amount of radioactivity bound to the washed cells was determined and referred to a standard curve of radioactive antibody uptake by cells previously incubated with increasing amounts of AHG in serum. Thereby immune complexes were detected and quantitated in <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and malignancies.|$|E

Prodremal stage varied from 1 to 20 days, average 6. 1 days, icteric stage 7 to 15 days, average 35. 8 days, and convalescent stage 7 to 200 days, average 30. 0 days. 3) Characteristic initial symptoms were anorexia, malaise and jaundice by which fairly number of the cases noticed the onset of the disease. Few had febrile course but low grade in most of the cases. 4) Laboratory data were obtained from the 20 cases of <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> admitted to our First Mebical Division. Serum bilirubin showed the maximum level on the 10 th day, average 13. 0 mg%. No significant changes were noted in peripheral blood picture but for a slight initial monocytosis. SGO-T and SGP-T presented a elevation earlier than that of serum bilirubin, maximum on or about the 5 th day and then decreased abruptly. Serum colloidal liver function tests; in initial stage, positive Takata's reaction in 51. %, positive CCF 46 % and TTT 58 % were noted, but even after 100 th day Takata's reaction was positive in 25 % of the cases. 5) Follow-up studies were made on 49 <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> cases discharged from our hospital with complete recovery. 69 % of these had subjective symptems in some sort or another. Enlargement of the liver was noted in 20 % of the cases. 33 cases were studied with special reference to liver function tests and liver biopsy. It was revealed that 43 % of the cases still had impairment of liver function and that by means of liver biopsy, postnecrotic cirrhosis was found 9. 1 % of the cases. Therefore, the prognosis of <b>serum</b> <b>hepatitis</b> of this type was considered to be grave. 6) For the purpose of prophylaxis, 300 to 600 mg of gamma globulin was simultaneously administered on blood transfusion in 38 cases.
