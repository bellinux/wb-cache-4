40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of the mustard seed in reducing lipid oxidation in ground beef compared to <b>sodium</b> <b>isoascorbate.</b> The research material were meat samples, prepared in four variants. The differentiating addition was ground white mustard (Sinapis alba), used in the native and autoclaved form. Reference were a control sample and a sample with the addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>isoascorbate.</b> The following were assayed during the study: TBARS value, redox potential, pH and colour parameters CIE L*a*b*. The addition of mustard had no effect on the pH value in comparison to the control sample and <b>sodium</b> <b>isoascorbate.</b> It has been shown that the use of mustard either native and autoclaved, decreased the value of TBARS ratio, and showed a similar effectiveness in preventing the oxidation of lipids as <b>sodium</b> <b>isoascorbate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the technological, textural, colour and sensory {{characteristics}} of model meat products produced with the addition of egg-yolk protein preparation (by-products of phospholipids extraction process at supercritical conditions). Model meat products consisted of pork class I, backfat class I and additives such a NaCl, NaNO 2 and <b>sodium</b> <b>isoascorbate.</b> Functiona...|$|E
40|$|Addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>isoascorbate</b> to the {{formulation}} for perishable canned comminuted cured meat markedly enhanced {{the efficacy of}} nitrite against Clostridium botulinum. This effect was reproducible {{through a series of}} three tests. In one test {{it was found that the}} initial addition of 50 microgram of sodium nitrite per g plus isoascorbate was as effective as 156 microgram of sodium nitrite per g alone...|$|E
40|$|By definition, “cured meat {{products}} ” contain curing salts, usually salt (sodium chloride) and either nitrites or nitrates. The use of nitrites as a curing agent provides the cured meat colour, the cured meat flavour, and, {{in combination with}} other factors, slows or prevents growth of bacterial pathogens. Nitrites exert a concentration-dependent antimicrobial effect in cured {{meat products}}, including inhibition of the outgrowth of spores of putrefactive and pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum. Their antimicrobial effects are pH-dependent, increasing ten-fold for each unit fall in pH. In most cured meat products, the addition of nitrites (or nitrates) is necessary to prevent the growth and toxin production by C. botulinum. The extent of protection provided to cured meats against microbial growth has been attributed by different researchers to many factors including the input concentration of nitrite, the residual nitrite concentration, the salt concentration of the product, the addition of <b>sodium</b> ascorbate (or <b>isoascorbate</b> / erythorbate), the heat treatment applied, the storage temperature, the initial pH of the meat, and the spore load initially present. The extent of protection is due to a combination of factors rather than any single factor...|$|R
