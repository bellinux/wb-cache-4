40|$|From a plant’s perspective, the {{difference}} between a <b>seed</b> predator and a <b>seed</b> disperser should be straightforward: attract animals that will disperse <b>seeds</b> and defend <b>seeds</b> from potential predators. Unlike pulp-eating frugivores, <b>seed</b> predators regularly encounter diverse plant protective mechanisms. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine feeding constraints, morphological adaptations, and the mechanical process of <b>seed</b> predation. While there is evidence that some <b>seed</b> predators cause severe losses to <b>seed</b> crops, there is also evidence that <b>seed</b> predators enhance <b>seed</b> dispersal and germination. We also examine four methods by which neotropical <b>seed</b> predators may contribute to dispersal. 1) <b>Seed</b> predators examined here ingested fruit when <b>seeds</b> were full-sized, but not yet mature (i. e., <b>seeds</b> of mature fruit may be avoided by <b>seed</b> predators and available for dispersal by other frugivores). 2) Sympatric <b>seed</b> predators may ingest <b>seeds</b> from different plants thus reducing overall predator load on any individual plant. 3) <b>Seed</b> predators that manipulate <b>seeds</b> (e. g., remove pericarp and <b>seed</b> coat) may enhance germination if the prepared <b>seeds</b> are dropped, discarded, or buried and not ingested. 4) Small <b>seeds</b> may miss mastication and swallowed intact with a food bolus. The last mechanism is the most likely to contribute to <b>seed</b> dispersal by the widest array of vertebrate <b>seed</b> predators, but primate <b>seed</b> predators may facilitate <b>seed</b> dispersal using all four mechanisms. Therefore, the traditional dichotomy of <b>seed</b> predator vs. <b>seed</b> disperser oversimplifies the interactions between <b>seed</b> predators and plants. Am. J. Primatol...|$|R

Approximately 80 % of the smallholder farmers in Africa depend for their <b>seed</b> on the informal <b>seed</b> system, consisting of farmers involved in selection, production and dissemination of <b>seed.</b> The lack of overhead, distribution and <b>seed</b> testing costs enables seed-producing farmers to offer <b>seed</b> for low prices, but <b>seed</b> quality is not always good. Seed-producing farmers multiply their <b>seed</b> on-farm without frequent <b>seed</b> renewal, referred to as <b>seed</b> recycling, which may lead to low <b>seed</b> quality. This research analysed the effect of <b>seed</b> recycling on physiological quality and <b>seed</b> health of cowpea and maize, and compared <b>seed</b> quality of the formal and informal <b>seed</b> system.   We tested the physical and physiological quality of cowpea <b>seeds</b> produced by the formal and informal <b>seed</b> system. Five out of six foundation <b>seed</b> samples, 79 out of 81 samples of farmers’ <b>seed,</b> and six out of six <b>seed</b> company samples failed to meet standards for foundation and certified <b>seeds</b> of the National Agriculture <b>Seed</b> Council (NASC), the <b>seed</b> industry regulatory agency in Nigeria. No evidence was found for a negative effect of <b>seed</b> recycling on physiological quality of cowpea <b>seeds.</b> We analysed 45, 500 cowpea <b>seeds</b> for seed-borne bacteria and fungi to compare the performance of formal and informal <b>seed</b> systems. All samples were heavily infected with seed-borne pathogens, including  Fusarium oxysporum (69 % of the samples) and Macrophomina phaseolina (76 %). No evidence was found that <b>seed</b> recycling in the informal <b>seed</b> system did lead to increased levels of seed-borne pathogens. We also analysed <b>seed</b> quality of farmer-produced maize <b>seed</b> to compare it with the formal <b>seed</b> system. The <b>seed</b> company samples had significantly higher germination (99. 3 %) than farmer-produced <b>seed</b> (97. 7 %), but not a single sample passed the requirements for certified <b>seed</b> of the NASC. Twelve seed-borne pathogens were identified including Bipolaris maydis (found in 45 % of the farmer-produced samples), Botryodiplodia theobromae (97 %) and Fusarium verticillioides (100 %). <b>Seed</b> recycling had no {{negative effect on the}} physiological quality or <b>seed</b> health of maize <b>seed.</b> We analysed formal and informal <b>seed</b> systems to assess the opportunities to prevent mycotoxigenic fungi infection in maize <b>seeds.</b> A range of control methods to avoid fungal infection and mycotoxin production is discussed in relation to three criteria for sustainable implementation in developing countries. An integrated approach is recommended, with special attention towards the local <b>seed</b> system. As an overall conclusion of the work it can be stated that the informal <b>seed</b> system did not underperform compared to the formal <b>seed</b> system for cowpea, but did underperform in relation to <b>seed</b> company samples of maize. There was no evidence that <b>seed</b> recycling reduces <b>seed</b> quality of cowpea and maize <b>seed</b> samples, so frequent <b>seed</b> renewal will not improve <b>seed</b> quality of the informal <b>seed</b> system. We recommend a new quality assurance system for the informal <b>seed</b> system based on <b>seed</b> quality testing by farmers themselves, without interference by government or external laboratories. Farmers publish their <b>seed</b> testing results on the bag, while buyers can retest the <b>seed</b> to verify the quality. Further research is required to develop and implement this system in different countries, agro-ecologies and crops, and to develop methods that enable farmers to test <b>seed</b> health quality themselves...|$|R

40|$|Many {{tree species}} {{that depend on}} scatter-hoarding animals for <b>seed</b> {{dispersal}} produce massive crops of large <b>seeds</b> at irregular intervals. Mast <b>seeding</b> and large <b>seed</b> size in these species have been explained as adaptations to increase animal dispersal and reduce predation. We studied how <b>seed</b> size and <b>seed</b> abundance simultaneously influenced <b>seed</b> dispersal and predation by scatter-hoarding rodents in the large-seeded rain forest tree Carapa procera (Meliaceae) in French Guiana. We individually tracked the fates of 3000 <b>seeds,</b> using remote video monitoring and thread-marking. <b>Seed</b> size was manipulated by broadly varying intraspecific <b>seed</b> mass, whereas effects of <b>seed</b> abundance were examined by tracking <b>seeds</b> in three seed-rich years and two seed-poor years. The hypotheses, that <b>seed</b> mass and <b>seed</b> abundance both enhance dispersal success and that <b>seed</b> abundance reinforces the effect of <b>seed</b> mass, were supported by the results. Most <b>seeds</b> were removed by the scatter-hoarding rodent red acouchy (Myoprocta acouchy) and subsequently were buried in scattered, single-seeded caches up to distances > 100 m. <b>Seeds</b> that were not removed failed to establish seedlings. <b>Seed</b> removal was slower, pre-removal <b>seed</b> predation was greater, and <b>seed</b> dispersal was less far in seed-rich years than in seed-poor years, suggesting poorer dispersal under <b>seed</b> abundance. However, {{this was more than}} counterbalanced by a disproportionally greater survival of cached <b>seeds</b> in seed-rich years. The per capita probability of <b>seed</b> survival and seedling establishment was at least 4 (1 / 2) times greater under <b>seed</b> abundance. Large <b>seeds</b> were removed faster, {{were more likely to be}} scatter-hoarded, and were dispersed farther away than smaller ones, resulting in a higher probability of seedling establishment for larger <b>seeds.</b> Size discrimination was greater under <b>seed</b> abundance, albeit only during <b>seed</b> removal. Overall, large <b>seeds</b> shed in rich years had the highest probability of seedling establishment. Hence, both larger <b>seed</b> size and greater <b>seed</b> abundance stimulate rodents to act more as dispersers and less as predators of <b>seeds.</b> We conclude that scatter-hoarding rodents can select for both large <b>seed</b> crops and large <b>seeds,</b> which may reinforce mast <b>seeding...</b>|$|R
