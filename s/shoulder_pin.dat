But the Baresark still held Eric's spear in his hand. He whirled it aloft, and it hissed through the air. The aim was good, for, as he crept away, the spear struck Hall between neck and <b>shoulder,</b> <b>pinning</b> him to the doorpost, and there the liar died.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{opponent}} {{is on his}} back, he can attempt to avoid having his <b>shoulders</b> <b>pinned</b> to the mat, and to get off his back, by planting his feet and pushing the mat with them, allowing him to roll his head back so {{the top of his}} head is on the mat, rather than the back of his neck being on the aggressor's arm. From this position he can try to turn over either toward or away from the aggressor.|$|R

6000|$|... "Hold, sir!" [...] Kenneth had cried, as Gregory {{bore down}} upon him. But Gregory's answer {{had been a}} lunge which the boy {{had been forced to}} parry. Taking that {{crossing}} of blades for a sign of opposition, Gregory thrust again more viciously. Kenneth parried narrowly, his blade pointing straight at his aggressor. He saw the opening, and both instinct and the desire to repel Gregory's onslaught drew him into attempting a riposte, which drove Gregory back until his shoulders touched the panels of the wall. Simultaneously the boy's foot struck {{the back of the chair}} which in rising Crispin had overset, and he stumbled. How it happened he scarcely knew, but as he hurtled forward his blade slid along his opponent's, and entering Gregory's right <b>shoulder</b> <b>pinned</b> him to the wainscot.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The coupled thermo-flowing 3 D {{steady-state}} {{model of}} {{friction stir welding}} model is established based on fluid mechanics. With analyzing the impact of <b>pin</b> <b>shoulder</b> and <b>pin</b> on heat producing, the model considers the influence of pin on the heat producing processing. The model applies viscoplastic constitutive equations to describe the material, and turbulence model to simulate the material flowing behavior. With the additional turbulence kinetic energy equations and flow boundary condition equations, the model is established. With Comsol Multiphysics finite analysis software, a process simulation was carried out, and the results reflect that the model can reveal the steady state characteristics of thermo and material flowing behavior of friction stir welding...|$|R

40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} joining process, which {{utilizes}} a cylindrical, <b>shouldered</b> <b>pin</b> tool with a radiused tip that is rotated and plunged into the weld joint. Frictional heating beneath the shoulder, and surrounding the pin tip causes the material to plasticize, intermix and consolidate into a weldment without melting the parent material. FSW in aluminum alloys has many advantages such as low distortion and shrinkage, excellent mechanical properties, and no porosity. However, the propensity of the FSW process to create detrimental defects does exist, and is dependent on FSW parameter limits and controls. Inspection processes for FSW must also be selected and implemented concurrent with the new weld process. This paper describes the efforts by Lockheed Martin and NASA to find proper NDE techniques for detecting and characterizing the anomalies that {{may be caused by}} operating outside the envelope of optimized FSW parameters. Potential defects are identified and the results of the exploration of numerous NDE techniques including visual, liquid penetrant, multiple ultrasonic methods, eddy current and conductivity are discussed...|$|R

Christian {{felt as though he}} {{deserved}} another shot at Randy Orton's title due to poor officiating at the Over the Limit pay-per-view. SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long didn't grant Christian his title match, but he placed Christian in a match as the Special Guest Referee between Sheamus and Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Christian refused to count [...] "three" [...] against Orton while Sheamus had his <b>shoulders</b> <b>pinned</b> to the mat. This angered Sheamus. Orton connected with an RKO on Sheamus and Orton retained the championship. When the match was over, Christian hit Randy in the face with the World Heavyweight Championship instead of giving him the belt. Christian then managed to taunt and mock Orton to the point that Orton agreed to another World Heavyweight Championship match at Capitol Punishment. Sheamus was going {{to be added to the}} match after winning a No Disqualification Match against Orton on SmackDown, thanks to interference from Christian. The match was Sheamus vs. Christian but Christian won the match. Afterwards, Randy Orton stormed to the ring but Christian escaped. Randy then settled on punt kicking Sheamus in the head, putting him out of action indefinitely.|$|R

50|$|On January 3, 1961, {{the reactor}} was being {{prepared}} for restart after a shutdown of eleven days over the holidays. Maintenance procedures were in progress, which required the main central control rod to be manually withdrawn a few inches to reconnect it to its drive mechanism; at 9:01 p.m. this rod was suddenly withdrawn too far, causing SL-1 to go prompt critical instantly. In four milliseconds, the heat generated by the resulting enormous power surge caused water surrounding the core to begin to explosively vaporize. The water vapor caused a pressure wave to strike {{the top of the}} reactor vessel, causing water and steam to spray {{from the top of the}} vessel. This extreme form of water hammer propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upwards. A later investigation concluded that the 26,000 lb vessel had jumped 9 ft and the upper control rod drive mechanisms had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location. The spray of water and steam knocked two operators onto the floor, killing one and severely injuring another. One of the shield plugs on top of the reactor vessel impaled the third man through his groin and exited his <b>shoulder,</b> <b>pinning</b> him to the ceiling. The victims were Army Specialists John A. Byrnes (age 27) and Richard Leroy McKinley (age 22), and Navy Seabee Construction Electrician First Class (CE1) Richard C. Legg (age 26).|$|R

40|$|Contrary to the {{original}} expectation, Na_ 2 IrO_ 3 is not a Kitaev's quantum spin liquid (QSL) but shows a zig-zag-type antiferromagnetic order in experiments. Here we propose experimental clues and criteria to measure how a material in hand {{is close to the}} Kitaev's QSL state. For this purpose, we systematically study thermal and spin excitations of a generalized Kitaev-Heisenberg model studied by Chaloupka et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 097204 (2013) and an effective ab initio Hamiltonian for Na_ 2 IrO_ 3 proposed by Yamaji et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 107201 (2014), by employing a numerical diagonalization method. We reveal that closeness to the Kitaev's QSL is characterized by the following properties, besides trivial criteria such as reduction of magnetic ordered moments and Neel temperatures: (1) Two peaks in the temperature dependence of specific heat at T_ℓ and T_h caused by the fractionalization of spin to two types of Majorana fermions. (2) In between the double peak, prominent plateau or <b>shoulder</b> <b>pinned</b> at (R/ 2) 2 in the temperature dependence of entropy, where R is the gas constant. (3) Failure of the linear spin wave approximation at the low-lying excitations of dynamical structure factors. (4) Small ratio T_ℓ/T_h close to or less than 0. 03. According to the proposed criteria, Na_ 2 IrO_ 3 is categorized to a compound close to the Kitaev's QSL, and is proven to be a promising candidate for the realization of the QSL if the relevant material parameters can further be tuned by making thin film of Na_ 2 IrO_ 3 on various substrates or applying axial pressure perpendicular to the honeycomb networks of iridium ions. Applications of these characterization to (Na_ 1 -xLi_x) _ 2 IrO_ 3 and other related materials are also discussed. Comment: 16 pages, 16 figure...|$|R

She looks out of the canvas in an oblique but self-aware and penetrating manner that some art historians have described as unnerving. Joanna Woods-Marsden remarks that a sitter acknowledging her audience in this way was virtually unprecedented even in Italian portrait painting. Her acknowledgment is accentuated by the painting's crop, which focuses the viewer's gaze in a near-invasive manner that seems to question the relationship between artist, model, patron and viewer.|$|R

The Ionic chiton could also be made from linen or wool and was draped without the fold and held in place from neck to wrist by several small pins. A large belt called a zoster could be worn over the chiton, usually under the breast ("high-girdled") or around the waist ("low-girdled") or a narrower [...] "zone" [...] or girdle could be used.
