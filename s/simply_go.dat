25|$|Up to 2,000 feral cats can in {{some years}} {{be found on the}} island; the {{population}} became established in the 19th century. Their depredations seriously harm the birdlife. Since the late 19th century, they have driven about 60% of the seabird species from the mainland completely, and during particular dry spells they will cross the mudflats and feast upon the birds on the motus. Spectacled tern chicks seem to be a favorite food of the local cat population. There are some measures being taken to ensure the cat population does not grow. That lowering the cat population by some amount would much benefit Christmas and its inhabitants is generally accepted, but the situation is too complex to <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> and eradicate them outright (which is theoretically possible; see Marion Island) – see below for details. A limited population of feral pigs exists. They were once plentiful and wreaked havoc especially on the Onychoprion and noddies. Pig hunting by locals has been encouraged, and was highly successful at limiting the pig population to a sustainable level, while providing a source of cheap protein for the islanders.|$|E
500|$|While the {{artillery}} prepared {{the ground for}} the attack, behind the Australian lines the assault formations moved up towards The Pimple. Smyth sited his brigade headquarters at a position called [...] "Brown's Dip", which was about [...] south of the firing line. Due to the small front along which the attack was to be launched, the initial assault was to be undertaken in three waves by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Battalions while the 1st Battalion was to remain back at Brown's Dip in reserve, ready to be brought up to consolidate any gains or respond {{in the event of}} a counterattack. Once the 1st Battalion had taken up its position, the assault battalions moved through them towards the forward line at The Pimple. Once the attack was launched, half the force would go via tunnels that had been dug out into no man's land, while the other half would <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> [...] "over the top". By 5:00p.m. all the troops had taken up their positions and as the barrage came to a conclusion, the tunnels were opened and final preparations were made.|$|E
500|$|The Cookbook {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 28 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Rich Juzwiak of Stylus Magazine gave the album an A rating, stating [...] "Her adventurous and, yes, massive, persona {{is allowed to}} wander wherever it wants on The Cookbook, be it avant or common." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote, [...] "The Cookbook is a convincing return to form.... Sounding as unique and startling and formidable as ever, Missy Elliott is clearly not a woman to be messed with." [...] John Bush of AllMusic noted that [...] "Elliott forces a few rhymes, plays to type with her themes, and uses those outside producers to follow trends in hip-hop.... What's different here is how relaxed Elliott is, how willing she seems to <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> with what comes naturally and sounds best." [...] Q stated [...] "If not Elliott's most inventive album, The Cookbook is certainly her most colourful and entertaining".|$|E

500|$|The {{structure}} of the book drew mixed reactions, with Toronto Star's Kim Hughs describing it as [...] "the novel's most defining feature and its most exasperating conceit". She believed that Pari {{was meant to be}} the protagonist of the story but that the shifting focus on the numerous other personalities left her [...] "barely [...] through the clutter". The Independent's Arifa Akbar stated, [...] "The changing points of view and leaps in time can confuse and confine, leaving characters clearly defined but lacking depth. Decades gallop by and {{it is as if the}} story of these interconnected, cross -generational lives will <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> on echoing the original crime of Abdullah and Pari's separation." [...] Michiko Kakutani from The New York Times thought the novella-like storytelling was handled well and wrote, [...] "Khaled Hosseini's new novel, And the Mountains Echoed, may have the most awkward title in his body of work, but it's his most assured and emotionally gripping story yet, more fluent and ambitious than The Kite Runner (2003), more narratively complex than A Thousand Splendid Suns (2007)." [...] Kamal agreed, saying that the structure was [...] "exquisitely crafted". Scoop Empires Sherine El Banhawy added that the focus on multiple characters allowed to readers to gain a better understanding of the diversities of Afghan culture.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{not being}} as {{acclaimed}} as its second season, {{reception of the}} first season was still generally positive. Despite giving the Edifying Ed-Ventures DVD a negative review, IGN's Mike Drucker praised the show, saying: [...] "Every bit {{of the show is}} played for the maximum comic effect, and the interactions between the characters are usually very fun," [...] and particularly praised the season finale, [...] "Avast Ye Eds", saying that it is a [...] "good example of how the animators developed a clever, surreal environment that most kids could probably relate to. They <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> wild and allow regular childhood adventures turn into comedic epics, very over-the-top, but still linked to the way that kids act and react to strange situations." [...] While calling it a [...] "gem" [...] and of [...] "entertaining nature", he criticized the storylines as [...] "repetitive" [...] and said the show [...] "lacks the genius of SpongeBob". Terrence Briggs of Animation World Magazine considered every second of the show [...] "filler" [...] and lamented that the main characters are drawn as [...] "products from the school of acid-trip caricature." [...] After Briggs' review was published, a large number of letters supportive of the show were sent to the magazine, prompting it to [...] "take a second look" [...] at the show. Different reviewers then gave it a positive review, calling it a [...] "fresh show with very different approaches." ...|$|E
500|$|After Bataan and Corregidor, {{many who}} escaped the Japanese reorganized in the {{mountains}} as guerrillas still loyal to the U.S. Army Forces Far East (USAFFE). One example would be the unit of Ramon Magsaysay in Zambales, which first served as a supply and intelligence unit. After the surrender in May 1942, Magsaysay and his unit formed a guerrilla force which grew to a 10,000-man force {{by the end of}} the war. Another was the Hunters ROTC which operated in the Southern Luzon area, mainly near Manila. It was created upon dissolution of the Philippine Military Academy in the beginning days of the war. Cadet Terry Adivoso, refused to <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> home as cadets were ordered to do, and began recruiting fighters willing to undertake guerrilla action against the Japanese. [...] This force would later be instrumental, providing intelligence to the liberating forces led by General Douglas MacArthur, and took an active role in numerous battles, such as the Raid at Los Baños. When war broke out in the Philippines, some 300 Philippine Military Academy and ROTC cadets, unable to join the USAFFE units because of their youth, banded together in a common desire to contribute to the war effort throughout the Bataan campaign. The Hunters originally conducted operations with another guerrilla group called Marking's Guerrillas, with whom they went about liquidating Japanese spies. Led by Miguel Ver, a PMA cadet, the Hunters raided the enemy-occupied Union College in Manila and seized 130 Enfield rifles.|$|E

[...] Michael Specter writes in The New Yorker, [...] "it was a five-thousand-word screed that accused nearly everyone connected with health care in America– officials at the Centers for Disease Control, in Atlanta, researchers at the National Institutes of Health, in Washington, doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in Manhattan, and local politicians (particularly Mayor Ed Koch)– of refusing to acknowledge the implications of the nascent AIDS epidemic. The article's harshest condemnation was directed at those gay men who seemed to think that if they ignored the new disease, it would <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> away.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Asher was {{initially}} cast {{for a run}} of five episodes {{in the role of}} Anne-Marie, reportedly with the option of returning for more later in the series. [...] Coincidentally, Asher had played Luke Roberts' mother once before, in the 2001 revival of ITV soap Crossroads. Asher has commented on the co-incidence: [...] "It's the second time I've played Luke Roberts' [...] mother - the first was when we were in Crossroads together [...] We get along really well and are very fond of each other." [...] Series producer Diana Kyle was asked in November 2007: [...] "When you cast an actor, do you actively seek out well-known names - like Jane Asher [...] and Patsy Kensit [...] - or will a role <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> to whoever's better suited?", to which she responded: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But we want the best actors, and the star names we cast are always the best - which is why we go for them!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Knight reprised {{the role}} of Ruth in Pirates with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] Chicago radio host Bruce Duffie, {{interviewing}} Knight after seeing that production noted, [...] "Gillian Knight {{is one of those}} great personalities who <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> about their business season after season, giving splendid renditions of various roles, and adding luster to their home companies while not going far afield very often and, thus, passing up the opportunity for real world-wide stardom". During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house". [...] She advised audiences, [...] "Don't close your mind to anything because somebody has said, 'Oh, this is Gilbert and Sullivan,' or, 'This is modern music.' [...] Just keep an open mind and you may be surprised at how much you get out of it".|$|E

2500|$|On March 22, 2011, U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin (sitting by designation) {{issued a}} ruling on the amended {{settlement}} agreement, rejecting it. [...] From the ruling: t is incongruous {{with the purpose}} of the copyright laws to place the onus on copyright owners to come forward to protect their rights when Google copied their works without first seeking their permission. [...] While the digitization of books {{and the creation of a}} universal digital library would benefit many, the ASA would <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> too far. It would permit this class action - - which was brought against defendant Google Inc. ("Google") to challenge its scanning of books and display of [...] "snippets" [...] for on-line searching - - to implement a forward-looking business arrangement that would grant Google significant rights to exploit entire books, without permission of the copyright owners. Indeed, the ASA would give Google a significant advantage over competitors, rewarding it for engaging in wholesale copying of copyrighted works without permission, while releasing claims well beyond those presented in the case. [...] Accordingly, and for the reasons more fully discussed below, the motion for final approval of the ASA is denied." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Americans do {{not qualify}} for government-{{provided}} health insurance, are not provided health insurance by an employer, and are unable to afford, can{{not qualify for}}, or choose not to purchase, private health insurance. When charity or [...] "uncompensated" [...] care is not available, they sometimes <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> without needed medical treatment. This problem has {{become a source of}} considerable political controversy on a national level. The uninsured still receive emergency care and thus if they are unable to afford it, they impose costs on others who pay higher premiums and deductibles to cover these expenses indirectly. Estimates for 2008 reported that the uninsured would spend $30 billion for healthcare and receive $56 billion in uncompensated care, and that if everyone were covered by insurance then overall costs would increase by $123 billion. [...] A 2003 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report estimated total cost of health care provided to the uninsured at $98.9 billion in 2001, including $26.4 billion in out-of-pocket spending by the uninsured, with $34.5 billion in [...] "free" [...] "uncompensated" [...] care covered by government subsidies of $30.6 billion to hospitals and clinics and $5.1 billion in donated services by physicians.|$|E
2500|$|Gonet is an {{established}} actress in British television, {{known for her}} role in the 1990s BBC series The House of Eliott. Her casting as Jayne follows a trend of Holby City producers towards hiring established British actors - with Gonet joining a series 9 cast alongside former film actress Patsy Kensit as Ward Sister Faye Morton, comedian Adrian Edmondson as Consultant Surgeon Abra Durant and Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell as Nursing Consultant Mark Williams. Series creator Mal Young commented on the preference for established names when discussing Holby Citys inception, explaining: [...] "Soap actors are the best actors. There’s been so much snobbery before. The whole thing about typecasting was probably invented by actors who couldn’t get other work. From day one I knew I wanted to put on screen people that viewers want to watch. There’s no downside to that." [...] Series producer Diana Kyle also addressed this trend in November 2007, when asked: [...] "When you cast an actor, do you actively seek out well-known names - like Jane Asher (Lady Byrne) and Patsy Kensit (Faye) - or will a role <b>simply</b> <b>go</b> to whoever's better suited?". She responded to this question: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them.
