50|$|Traditional {{surface water}} {{treatment}} plants generally {{consists of three}} steps: clarification, filtration and disinfection. Clarification refers to the separation of particles (dirt, organic matter, etc.) from the water stream. Chemical addition (i.e. alum, ferric chloride) destabilizes the particle charges and prepares them for clarification either by settling or floating {{out of the water}} <b>stream.</b> <b>Sand,</b> anthracite or activated carbon filters refine the water stream, removing smaller particulate matter. While other methods of disinfection exist, the preferred method is via chlorine addition.

40|$|Small streams, at the Biological Dynamics of Fragmented Forest Project - INPA ca. 80 Km {{north from}} the city of Manaus (Amazonas, Braszil), were studied {{concerning}} the composition of the aquatic insects communities in different substrates. In each one of the 20 stretches, four samples of the principal biotopes were collected: leaf litter in riffle areas, leaf litter deposited on the botton of the <b>stream,</b> <b>sand</b> and roots/vegetation on marginal banks. The aim of this study were to evaluate the aquatic insect fauna and relate it with specific substrates inside the igarape. Leaf litter in riffle presented high richness number (106) while sand showed the lowest value (55). Higher similarity values occurred between leaf litter deposited on the botton and marginal roots/vegetation. Lower values occurred between leaf litter in riffle and sand substrates. Some collected taxa were considered indicators of one type of substrate, but there were some taxa that showed no preference. The indicator taxa occurred in riffle litter were found in deposited leaf litter in Southeast streams of Brazil. This indicates the current velocity may be responsible for the community established. The size of the stream is related to the order and flow regime. In this study bigger streams (presenting higher values of flow and order) showed more distinct communities in each substrate than the smaller ones...|$|E
40|$|The genus Feltria has a {{widespread}} Holarctic distribution. A few species (Lundblad, 1941, 1969) {{have also been}} reported from northern Burma but this latter area. as far as its water mite fauna is concerned, might better be {{considered part of the}} southern border of the Palearctic, rather than a part of the Oriental Region. Previously. thirty apparently valid species and subspecies of Feltria were known from North America. The present paper describes nine additional forms and brings the total from the Nearctic area to 39, which is nearly identical with the number known from Europe. Most North American species are found in mountainous regions, but four are known from cold streams and springs in Michigan. The majority of Nearctic species are found associated with mosses and other matted aquatic plants, but twelve (including four described in this paper) are typically residents of the interstitial water associated with <b>stream</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel deposits.

40|$|Dans cet article, nous présentons des travaux mettant en évidence les capacités de {{traitement}} biologique des eaux résiduaires urbaines au sein des milieux poreux de textures différentes. Une étude comparative du développement de la biomasse couplé aux mécanismes généraux de transferts gazeux à travers deux réacteurs biologiques est menée. Des lits d’infiltration percolation sont simulés par des colonnes garnies de sables d’origine et de structures différentes. Ils sont alimentés périodiquement via un automate de commande avec un influent d’une charge de 525 mgDCO/l et de 54 mgNK/l. Les résultats obtenus établissent le fait qu’un développement équilibré de la biomasse incluant les phases de croissance et de régression est intrinsèquement lié à {{la nature}} physique du matériau support. A l’aide des carottes prélevées sur les massifs filtrants et des sondes d’oxymétrie introduites à différentes hauteurs des lits d’infiltration, nous montrons que la répartition verticale du biofilm dans les colonnes ainsi que l’oxygénation des milieux poreux lors des périodes de repos sont également corrélées à la structure des supports pourtant de diamètres moyens similaires. L’efficacité de traitement biologique du carbone est supérieure pour un sable d’origine alluvionnaire comparativement à un sable concassé; la tendance s’inversant significativement lorsqu’il s’agit de la diminution de l’azote. In this article, we present work highlighting {{the capacity of}} variously textured porous media to biologically process urban waste water. A comparative study was undertaken that coupled biomass development with general gas transfer mechanisms through two biological engines. Infiltration/percolation beds are biological systems that treat water using a purifying bacterial culture that develops on a mineral support. Used in domestic wastewater treatment, they are regarded as being well suited to rural areas. These infiltration/percolation beds are {{easy to use and}} attain a high quality in their output, two factors that constitute assets for small communities. Infiltration/percolation beds were simulated in the present work by columns lined with sands of varying origin and structure. They were fed automatically, at set intervals, with waste water containing 525 mg/L of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 54 mg/L of Kjeldahl nitrogen. A balanced development of the biomass, including the phases of growth and regression, was intrinsically related to the physical nature of the material used as a support. First, during the supply period, balanced growth of the biomass was quickly reached within the crushed sand. Secondly, within round sand, the regression of the biofilm was less significant and more regular over several weeks. In both supports, the regression was well correlated with an exponential decay. Lastly, the frequency of the supply periods, the organic loads involved, and the rest periods imposed are all factors that contribute to a lack of accumulation of living and/or inert organic matter in the columns. After obtaining a balanced development of the biomass, the abilities of the columns to reduce the concentrations of carbon, Kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonia were evaluated. Samples of effluent were taken downstream, both before the beginning of the supply period and as it came out of the column approximately thirty minutes after beginning the drainage period. The percentage of suspended matter coming out of the columns gave rather precise information on the scrubbing of the solid mass caused by various shearing speeds or by the structure of the base. Generally, it appeared that :- The reduction of the overall DOC was higher than 70 %, regardless of which type of sand base was used. - In the water coming out of the column made up of round sand, the overall DOC content was without exception lower than 125 mg/L, as would be expected for an infiltration-percolation process. - The treatment of carbon in the columns based on <b>stream</b> <b>sand</b> was in general more effective than that obtained in columns with crushed sand. Concerning the treatment of nitrogen, crushed sand yielded outputs with a reduction in ammonia that was a lot higher than 80 % (mean ± SD: 92 ± 4 %) and was systematically higher than those obtained with <b>stream</b> <b>sand</b> (mean ± SD: 72 ± 7 %). The suspended matter content was extremely low in the effluent; since no suspended matter was introduced into the effluent, the concentration coming out of the column was the direct result of the biofilm becoming detached and/or, to a lesser extent, of the transport of the biomass in the liquid phase. As could be expected, because of the roughness causing more shearing, more particles became detached when the interior solid mass was made up of crushed sand. Using core samples taken from the filter's solid mass, as well as oxygen probes inserted at various levels into the biological engines, we showed that the vertical distribution of the biofilm in the columns, as well as the oxygenation of the porous media during the rest periods, were all correlated with the structure of the solid supports (note that all sands had similar average diameters). Gaseous exchanges within the filter's solid mass were dependent on both the type of coating and the depth at which they took place. The oxygen probes were inserted at depths of 14 cm and 18 cm respectively, to determine the percentage of oxygen saturation in the liquid phase within the filter during one week while the columns were operating. Two phases were characteristic of the exchanges observed in {{the upper part of the}} filter's solid mass. First we noted an instantaneous reduction in the oxygen content of the liquid phase, linked to the arrival of a batch, followed by a reoxygenation of this portion. Next there was a long phase, lasting approximately 94 % of the time between batches, during which time the oxygen content in the residual moisture remained constant. In the lower part of the solid mass, variation in oxygen content was different. Partial deoxygenation in the liquid phase of the porous media here was primarily due to the biochemical oxidation of the organic matter (i. e., consumption by the biomass). It was also due, to a lesser extent, to the augmentation in moisture content that occurs after each batch, and leads to a reduction in porosity and a decrease in oxygen transfer. During the final phase of drainage, a balance was created between the open porous space with air, and the space containing stagnant moisture. The diffusion of oxygen in the former and its transfer towards the latter thus compensated for this consumption, and it therefore remained constant. If the medium was left to dry out longer, the diffusion and transfer phenomena increased, and we observed an increase in oxygen content. With respect to the vertical distribution of biomass in the columns, we found that it was almost homogeneous inside the <b>stream</b> <b>sand,</b> up to a depth of 28 cm (total depth = 40 cm). Generally, the organic matter content at each point of measurement in the column was higher in the <b>stream</b> <b>sand</b> than in the crushed sand. The variation was greater around 28 cm, where there was a more significant quantity of moisture inside the sand...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to test our {{hypothesis}} that sand dunes in the White River Badlands (WRB), South Dakota, northern Great Plains, formed during one or more prolonged prehistoric droughts. WRB dune fields are located on tabletops north of the White River in southwestern South Dakota. These parabolic dunes have maximum relief of 30 m and open to the northwest, consistent with the dominant wind direction for the region. Currently, dunes are stabilized by a drought-adapted, mixed grass prairie community. Sand dunes form when 1) prolonged drought kills prairie vegetation, allowing wind to erode and transport sediment, forming sand dunes in drought conditions, or 2) local stream sediment supplies increase, causing dune formation under nondrought conditions. Thus, if mineralogical compositions of dune sands are equivalent to compositions of nearby stream sands, then dunes formed because of increased sand supplies, as opposed to drought. To test the hypothesis that WRB dunes formed in drought, the investigators made quantitative and qualitative comparisons of dune and <b>stream</b> <b>sand</b> compositions. Summers of 2015 and 2016, investigators collected representative samples from WRB dunes and the White River channel. Investigators analyzed sand compositions using two methodologies. First, using a petrographic microscope, investigators identified 300 grains in thin section from each sample to produce a statistically valid modal composition based on quartz, feldspar, and rock fragment content. Second, using the petrographic microscope, investigators identified distinct mineralogical associations in each sample for comparison. The presentation will include results of these quantitative and qualitative analyses...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of sand by chemical and mechanical weathering in a temperate humid climate {{and in a}} middle altitude mountain area has been investigated by comparing {{the composition of the}} sandy fraction of ancient and recent soils with the composition of parent rocks and <b>stream</b> <b>sands.</b> We examined the drainage basins of two high-gradient streams in the northern Apennines (Ospitale and Fellicarolo) and a short portion of the Leo stream derived from their confluence. Bedrock is made of a single rock type, the siliciclastic arkosic turbidites of the Cervarola Formation, and only in the lower portion of the basin the Leo stream cuts carbonate and pelitic lithotypes of Ligurian units. River bed sands have a lithic composition and are very rich in sedimentary rock fragments such as shales, silstones and fine-grained arenites derived from the Cervarola tubidites beds. The variations observed in the quartz/lithics ratio is primarily explained with weathering conditions (in particular soil type and steepness of slope), and only subordinately seems to be related with the river transport. The change in outcropping rocks in {{the lower part of the}} basin is immediately reflected in the lithic fraction of <b>stream</b> <b>sands,</b> marked by micritic fragments indicating contribution from carbonate units. Soils sands show different compositions. Recent soils from the highest watershed areas have a lithic composition. The more developed older dark soils capping red soils, and the chemically more active black swampy soils, show compositions gradually richer in quartz and feldspars. Pedogenic reactions initially reduce the lithic fragments, leading to an indirect enrichment of the more resistant quartz and feldspar grains. It is likely that the quartz-feldspar rich composition of the black swampy soils is partially related to the coarser-grained arenites of the bedrock. Results from this study indicate that in a drainage basin cutting well lithified sedimentary rocks, rich in shale and siltstones, the chemical activity and duration of pedogenetic processes, and the steepness of valley slopes, which controls the intensity of physical breackage of outcropping rocks, are the major factors controlling the production and composition of sand sediments. In a temperate humid climate these two factors seem to work some what independently and give an imprint to the produced sediment which changes as a function of different topographic conditions. Physical breackage prevails on steep slopes, thus the sediments are rich in unstable lithic grains. Even in very acidic soils, alteration of feldspar seems to be not significant, probably because the time from the last glaciation has been not long enough to produce visible effects on feldspar grains...|$|R
