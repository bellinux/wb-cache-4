5|$|Wet snow {{avalanches}} are a low-velocity {{suspension of}} snow and water, with the flow confined {{to the surface of}} the pathway. The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.|$|E
25|$|Landslide {{in which}} the <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> is located within the soil mantle or {{weathered}} bedrock (typically to a depth from few decimetres to some metres)is called a shallow landslide. They usually include debris slides, debris flow, and failures of road cut-slopes. Landslides occurring as single large blocks of rock moving slowly down slope are sometimes called block glides.|$|E
25|$|Many {{models have}} been {{proposed}} to explain what caused this huge slab of rocks to start sliding and what allowed it to slide so far on such a low slope, fragmenting, thinning and extending as it went. Most geologists who have worked in the area agree that Absaroka volcanism {{played a role in}} the sliding and many suggest that a major volcanic or steam explosion initiated movement. Another model involves injection of numerous igneous dikes with the resulting heating of water within pores in rocks causing an increase in pressure which initiated sliding. Some geologists have suggested that hot pressurized water (hydrothermal fluids), derived from a volcano which sat north of Cooke City, Montana, effectively lubricated the <b>sliding</b> <b>surface.</b> Another possibility is that once the slide was moving, friction heated the limestone along the <b>sliding</b> <b>surface,</b> creating pseudotachylite, which then further broke down to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas (or supercritical fluid). The gas supported the slide in the way that air pressure supports a hovercraft, allowing the slide to move easily down the very low slope. When the rockslide stopped, the carbon dioxide cooled and recombined with calcium oxide to form the cement-like carbonate rock now found in the fault zone. The consensus favors catastrophic sliding and calculations suggest that the front of the sliding mass may have advanced at a speed of over 100 miles/hour (160km/h), meaning that the mountain traveled to its present location in approximately 30 minutes.|$|E
40|$|Thrust bearing {{model is}} {{developed}} for fluid flow calculation and for determi-nation of bearing integral characteristics {{in the presence}} of <b>sliding</b> <b>surfaces</b> closure and shaft angular displacements. The model is based on the coupled solution of the problem of incompressible fluid flow between the <b>sliding</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the problem of bearing and shaft elements deformation under the action of the fluid film pressure. Verification of the bearing model results is carried out by the comparison versus the fluid flow calculation results obtained by STAR-CD software and the experimental and theoretical results represented in the certain literature.

25|$|In the 48 {{million years}} since the slide occurred, erosion has removed most of {{the portion of the}} slide sheet which moved out into the Bighorn Basin, leaving just one big block of {{carbonate}} rocks—Heart Mountain. Farther south, a large block of carbonate rock forms Sheep Mountain, which lies just south of the road that goes from Cody into Yellowstone Park. Some of the best views of the <b>sliding</b> <b>surface,</b> called the Heart Mountain fault, can be found along the Chief Joseph Highway (Wyoming Highway 296). The fault is particularly well exposed in Cathedral Cliffs, where it appears as a remarkably straight and nearly horizontal line just above a 2–3-meter-high cliff.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to powder snow avalanches, wet snow avalanches are a low velocity suspension {{of snow and}} water, with the flow confined to the track surface (McClung, first edition 1999, page 108). The low speed of travel {{is due to the}} friction between the <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> of the track and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~10–40km/h), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density. The body of the flow of a wet snow avalanche can plough through soft snow, and can scour boulders, earth, trees, and other vegetation; leaving exposed, and often scored, ground in the avalanche track. Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snow packs that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water. The isothermal characteristic of wet snow avalanches has led to the secondary term of isothermal slides found in the literature (for example in Daffern, 1999, page 93). At temperate latitudes wet snow avalanches are frequently associated with climatic avalanche cycles {{at the end of the}} winter season, when there is significant daytime warming.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The 2004 Chuetsu {{earthquake}} (M 6. 8) triggered {{thousands of}} landslides in the Miocene to Quaternary sedimentary rocks in Japan. The most common landslides were shallow disrupted landslides on steep slopes without geologic preference, but deep, coherent landslides also occurred in many locations. We studied about 100 deep, coherent landslides by field investigation and by interpretation of aerial photographs {{and found that}} many of them had occurred due to the reactivation of previous landslides. These had planar <b>sliding</b> <b>surfaces</b> along bedding planes or along oxidation fronts. Planar, bedding-parallel <b>sliding</b> <b>surfaces</b> were exposed or inferred from the geometry of the deformed ground surface, such as "horsts and grabens " and "roll-over antiform". The bedding-parallel <b>sliding</b> <b>surfaces</b> were made at the boundary between the overlying sandstone and underlying siltstone or along the bedding planes of the alternated beds of sandstone and siltstone. <b>Sliding</b> <b>surfaces</b> along the oxidation front were made in the area of black mudstone. New landslides (rockslide-avalanches) occurred within the <b>sliding</b> <b>surfaces</b> in tuff bands of a few-cm thickness that were interbedded in the siltstone. Most of the deep landslides occurred on slopes undercut by erosion or artificial excavation, whether they were reactivated or new ones. One rockslide-avalanche occurred on a slope where buckling deformation preceded the earthquake. Valley bottom sediments were mobilized on low-angle slopes in many locations, probably because they were saturated and partial liquefaction occurred by the earthquake...|$|R
