40|$|Abstract Background In stark {{contrast}} to the wealth of detail about C. elegans developmental biology and molecular genetics, biologists lack basic data for understanding the abundance and distribution of Caenorhabditis species in natural areas that are unperturbed by human influence. Methods Here we report the analysis of dense sampling from a <b>small,</b> <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> in the Amazonian rain forest of the Nouragues Natural Reserve in French Guiana. Results Sampling of rotting fruits and flowers revealed proliferating populations of Caenorhabditis, with up to three different species co-occurring within a single substrate sample, indicating remarkable overlap of local microhabitats. We isolated six species, representing the highest local species richness for Caenorhabditis encountered to date, including both tropically cosmopolitan and geographically restricted species not previously isolated elsewhere. We also documented the structure of within-species molecular diversity at multiple spatial scales, focusing on 57 C. briggsae isolates from French Guiana. Two distinct genetic subgroups co-occur even within a single fruit. However, the structure of C. briggsae population genetic diversity in French Guiana does not result from strong local patterning but instead presents a microcosm of global patterns of differentiation. We further integrate our observations with new data from nearly 50 additional recently collected C. briggsae isolates from both tropical and temperate regions of the world to re-evaluate local and global patterns of intraspecific diversity, providing the most comprehensive analysis to date for C. briggsae population structure across multiple spatial scales. Conclusions The abundance and species richness of Caenorhabditis nematodes is high in a Neotropical rainforest habitat that is subject to minimal human interference. Microhabitat preferences overlap for different local species, although global distributions include both cosmopolitan and geographically restricted groups. Local samples for the cosmopolitan C. briggsae mirror its pan-tropical patterns of intraspecific polymorphism. It remains an important challenge to decipher what drives Caenorhabditis distributions and diversity within and between species. </p...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Intramolecular {{signaling}} between distant sites {{within a}} protein plays {{a significant role}} in many biological processes. Interactions between proteins or between a ligand and a protein often induce local energetic and conformational changes at the binding site that subsequently propagate through the entire core of the protein to produce conformational and functional changes at a distant surface. Such propagated conformational changes are critical in mediating downstream signaling events. For example, hemoglobin's cooperative oxygenbinding properties result from long-distance interactions between the hemes and can be modulated by the binding of <b>small</b> molecules at <b>remote</b> <b>sites.</b> 1 Agonist binding to the extracellular domain of G protein-coupled receptors transduces a signal through its transmembrane domain inducing a conformational change on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, and consequently promoting nucleotide exchange in an associated G-protein.

40|$|Because the GPS carrier-phase {{observation}} measurement is {{very precise}} in frequency transfer, {{it can be}} used to estimate performance of a remote frequency reference with respect to the national frequency standard. TL has already set up a prototype system for this purpose. The stability and accuracy of a DUT (device under test) at a <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> with traceability to TLâ€™s frequency standard could be obtained after data processing. The prototype system includes the master site (herein at TL) and the <b>remote</b> <b>site.</b> At the <b>remote</b> <b>site,</b> the equipped GPS receiver runs with a DUT as its frequency reference. By performing the time difference (differences between two epochs) on carrier-phase observations, the DUTâ€™s frequency offset with respect to the GPS frequency standard can be estimated. At the master site, the GPS receiver is referenced to TLâ€™s frequency standard and the time difference and carrier-phase single difference (differences between two receivers at TL and the <b>remote</b> <b>site)</b> are performed at postprocessing. The frequency offset of the DUT relative to TLâ€™s frequency standard can be estimated in this way. Observations from the <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> could be sent to TL via the Internet. As for the system arrangement, the IGS (International GPS Service) site TWTF at TL serves as the master site and a single-frequency GPS receiver is adopted at the <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> to cost down expenses of system set up. Data analysis is done by the lab-developed software. A common-clock short-baseline test (using TLâ€™s frequency standard) and a 270 -km baseline test (using a high-performance 5071 A cesium clock as the remote frequency reference) were carried out to find the systemâ€™s performance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> robot workcell for teleoperation with communication delays {{on the order}} of 20 seconds. In these situations, direct teleoperation becomes impossible due to the delays in visual and force feedback. Teleprogramming has been developed in order to overcome this problem. ^ An integral part of teleprogramming is a semi-autonomous <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> robot system. The remote system is composed of a robot manipulator, sensors, controlling computer, and manipulator tools. The constraints on the <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> system and the amount of autonomy needed are defined partially by the teleprogramming system, and partially by the needs of the remote system. Development of the <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> system for teleprogramming evokes some pertinent research issues: low level manipulator control, semi-autonomous command execution, and <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> tool usage. ^ Low level manipulator control is based on a hybrid control scheme using wrist-based sensory feedback. Implementation of this control is presented and problems related to controlling the manipulator in an arbitrary frame are investigated. ^ High level commands are executed at the <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> in <b>small</b> autonomous steps. Implementation of tolerance checks and guarded moves are presented, including error detection and the detection of motion termination conditions in a partially known environment. ^ Power tools introduce redundant degrees of freedom into the manipulator/tool system. To control this redundant system, the tool is actively controlled in its natural degree of freedom and the corresponding degree of freedom in the manipulator becomes passive. Feedback for the manipulator/tool system is supplied by the wrist-based sensor. Two examples of sensing and control for tools are presented. ^ This research has resulted {{in the development of a}} <b>remote</b> <b>site</b> system for teleprogramming. The remote system, however, is both time-delay and input independent. The characteristics of the system, including the compliance, flexibility, and semi-autonomity, are useful to a wide variety of robotics applications, including manufacturing and direct teleoperation. ...|$|R
