40|$|A high gain, wide {{common-mode}} {{and high}} <b>swing</b> <b>error</b> amplifier is proposed. It {{can be applied}} to a PWM control chip. The error amplifier adopts folded cascode structure with gain boosted. This chip is simulated and fabricated in the CSMC 0. 5 μm CMOS. The result shows that the error amplifier has the DC gain of 141. 11 dB, the common-mode input range of 0 ~ 3. 87 v and the output swing of 0. 11 ~ 4. 80 v. These meet the requirements of engineering applications and can realize stable system output...|$|E

40|$|Heather Gulgin, of {{the faculty}} in the Movement Science Department, {{wanted to know if}} there were any {{correlations}} between physical movements, body types and golf swing faults. She collected various body measurements, proctored a physical fitness test and recorded the participants 2 ̆ 7 golf swings using a video camera, to look for some previously established golf <b>swing</b> <b>errors.</b> Our job as statistical consultants was to run correlation analyses of the data set she created from the participants 2 ̆ 7 body measurements, level of physical fitness and golf swing. By comparing the correlation coefficients, we will help Professor Gulgin determine if there is any relationship with various physical limitations and specific golf swing faults. In addition, comparison of these correlation coefficients would determine if there is any relationship between body somatotype and typical golf swing faults...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{a model for}} pitch sequencing in baseball that is defined by pitch-to-pitch correlation in location, velocity, and movement. The correlations quantify the average similarity of consecutive pitches and provide {{a measure of the}} batter's ability to predict the properties of the upcoming pitch. We examine the characteristics of the model for a set of major league pitchers using PITCHf/x data for nearly three million pitches thrown over seven major league seasons. After partitioning the data according to batter handedness, we show that a pitcher's correlations for velocity and movement are persistent from year-to-year. We also show that pitch-to-pitch correlations are significant in a model for pitcher strikeout rate and that a higher correlation, other factors being equal, is predictive of fewer strikeouts. This finding is consistent with experiments showing that <b>swing</b> <b>errors</b> by experienced batters tend to increase as the differences between the properties of consecutive pitches increase. We provide examples that demonstrate the role of pitch-to-pitch correlation in the strikeout rate model...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a simple control {{framework}} for on-line push recovery with dynamic stepping properties. Due to relatively heavy legs in our robot, {{we need to take}} swing dynamics into account and thus use a linear model called 3 LP which is composed of three pendulums to simulate swing and torso dynamics. Based on 3 LP equations, we formulate discrete LQR controllers and use a particular time-projection method to adjust the next footstep location on-line during the motion continuously. This adjustment, which is found based on both pelvis and <b>swing</b> foot tracking <b>errors,</b> naturally takes the swing dynamics into account. Suggested adjustments are added to the Cartesian 3 LP gaits and converted to joint-space trajectories through inverse kinematics. Fixed and adaptive foot lift strategies also ensure enough ground clearance in perturbed walking conditions. The proposed structure is robust, yet uses very simple state estimation and basic position tracking. We rely on the physical series elastic actuators to absorb impacts while introducing simple laws to compensate their tracking bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the functionality of different control blocks and prove the effectiveness of time-projection in extreme push recovery scenarios. We also show self-produced and emergent walking gaits when the robot is subject to continuous dragging forces. These gaits feature dynamic walking robustness due to relatively soft springs in the ankles and avoiding any Zero Moment Point (ZMP) control in our proposed architecture.
