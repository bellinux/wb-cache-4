Among his influences at Oxford were WS Watt, R Meiggs, RM Hare, Elizabeth Anscombe, Eric Dodds, Eduard Fraenkel, David Pears and Gilbert Ryle. He <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first part of the}} course, the pure classics (being particularly fond of writing Latin verses in the style of Ovid) and graduated in 1951 with a congratulatory first {{in the second part of}} the course and a prize fellowship at All Souls.|$|E

25|$|The Chapel {{includes}} a fascinating play on light, {{as there is}} no artificial light inside the main section of building during the daytime. There is sufficient sunlight to fully light the worship space, as a combination of smooth textures and reflective surfaces maximize all light <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building. At night, the lights from outside combined with candles inside the Chapel are more than enough to illuminate the worship area.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{planning}} talks {{began as}} early as 1861, though the construction project was not confirmed until twenty years later.

500|$|After {{reviewing}} the hype surrounding the book, author Barbara Schaaf concluded that its prose [...] "was first-rate – literate and with flashes of timeless insight. Anyone {{who can take}} a 15-year-old heroine... and dash off over 700 pages just {{to get her to}} age 21 without losing the reader, has real talent." [...] Schaaf added that Koen has a [...] "fine eye for art, architecture, fashion, manners and relays the everything," [...] though she critiqued the author for sometimes inserting too many historical details. She believed that <b>the</b> book especially <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> depicting <b>the</b> South Sea Bubble; [...] "most historical writers," [...] Schaaf opined, [...] "neglect the economic background of their periods, regardless of its importance, and [...] grasp of a complicated situation makes it as fascinating as her descriptions of the sexual behavior of the upper and lower classes." ...|$|R
25|$|Mumbai's debutants <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> victory as they cantered to a {{comfortable}} win. Pacer Sagar Trivedi claimed three for 21 as Punjab posted 254 on the board. Yuvraj scored a run-a-ball 93 {{to take the}} team to a respectable total after Dhawal Kulkarni and Trivedi claimed the top-order. Debutant Jay Bista then led the chase with a 87-ball 92 while Abhishek Nayar took Mumbai across the line with an unbeaten 44.|$|E
25|$|With the West Indies touring England in 2004, it was {{expected}} that Harmison, who had also <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three-match Test series against New Zealand earlier in 2004, would again be England's lead bowler, and the West Indies captain Brian Lara went as far as suggesting that England had no plan B after Harmison. However, Harmison was outshone by spin bowler Ashley Giles for the first three Tests, before he took 9 wickets in the final Test match. In that final match, he also punished the West Indies bowling with the bat, hitting three sixes and three fours in a brief innings ending at 34 not out. Harmison's bowling performance in this match took him {{to the top of the}} Pricewaterhousecoopers cricket ratings. In 2004, Harmison took 67 wickets in just 13 matches, at a superb average of 23.92.|$|E
500|$|Rugby, {{like other}} English public schools, had evolved its own variant of football. The game in Wills' era—a rough and highly {{defensive}} struggle involving hundreds of boys—was {{confined to a}} competition amongst the houses. Spanning his school years, Wills {{is one of the}} few players who is named in the newspapers' brief match reports. His creative play and [...] "eel-like agility" [...] baffled the opposition, and his penchant for theatrics endeared him to the crowds. One journalist noted his use of [...] "slimy tricks", a possible early reference to his gamesmanship. As a [...] "dodger" [...] in the forward line, he was a long and accurate shot at goal and served as his house's kicker. Wills also <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school's annual athletics carnival and his long-distance running ability in Hare and Hounds was unparalleled.|$|E

25|$|The clubs such as Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk and Chornomorets Odesa, {{who were}} recent contenders for the title, {{had to put}} up a fierce fight against the newly {{established}} contenders Metalurh Donetsk and Metalist Kharkiv to qualify for the European competitions. Metalist Kharkiv <b>shone</b> brightly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 2000s (decade) by consistently finishing right behind Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk in third place. Their most remarkable feat was their participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2009 European season when they had to face Dynamo Kyiv to earn a place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarter-finals of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, but lost on the away goals rule. That same 2008–09 UEFA Cup competition was won for the first time by Shakhtar Donetsk, the first club of independent Ukraine to win the title. It was also the last UEFA cup title before it changed its name to the Europa league.|$|R
500|$|After his {{impressive}} {{form for}} Australia A during January 2005, White {{was selected as}} part of the Australia A side to tour Pakistan in September that year. [...] After claiming four wickets, and averaging 35.50 with the bat in the 2 four-day matches, White <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subsequent one-day games. [...] Not required to bat in the first, he then scored 106 not out in the second and 59 not out in the third, also claiming a tail-end wicket. Having now demonstrated his ability as a big-hitting all-rounder, White was selected to make his international debut during the 2005 ICC Super Series against the ICC World XI. [...] Shaun Pollock, captaining the World XI team, said that his batsmen would target the young leg-spinner, but Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he expected White to bowl, after he'd [...] "handled things well in the Victoria game against them". He was named as supersub in the first two matches, being on field only during the ICC World XI innings, therefore being unable to bat. [...] He did not bowl in the first match, and only bowled three wicket-less overs in the second. [...] Despite controversy regarding the official status of the matches, these two appearances as supersub signified White's first two One Day International (ODI) appearances. [...] He started the third match, but as Australia closed their innings on 293/5, White was again not required to bat, nor did he bowl in the following ICC World XI innings.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his travels}} to Armenia, Soviet Russian writer Vasily Grossman {{observed}} Mount Ararat from Yerevan standing [...] "high {{in the blue}} sky." [...] He wrote that [...] "with its gentle, tender contours, it seems to grow {{not out of the}} earth but out of the sky, as if it has condensed from its white clouds and its deep blue.

2500|$|Alpert {{suggested}} that the Carpenters record a Burt Bacharach and Hal David song called [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] written in 1963. Though Richard worked up an arrangement only after Alpert's insistence, his arranging talents clearly <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finished product. His arranging and musical talents, as well as Karen's vocals, helped the song climb to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it stayed for a month. [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] gained public recognition seemingly overnight. According to Richard, even though the song became popular overnight, the Carpenters themselves did not.|$|E
500|$|Fear and Desire was a {{commercial}} failure, but garnered several positive reviews upon release. Critics {{such as the}} reviewer from The New York Times believed that Kubrick's professionalism as a photographer <b>shone</b> through <b>in</b> <b>the</b> picture, and that he [...] "artistically caught glimpses of the grotesque attitudes of death, the wolfishness of hungry men, {{as well as their}} bestiality, and <b>in</b> one scene, <b>the</b> wracking effect of lust on a pitifully juvenile soldier and the pinioned girl he is guarding". Columbia University scholar Mark Van Doren was highly impressed by the scenes with the girl bound to the tree, remarking that it would live on as a [...] "beautiful, terrifying and weird" [...] sequence which illustrated Kubrick's immense talent and guaranteed his future success. [...] Kubrick himself later expressed embarrassment with Fear and Desire, however, and attempted over the years to keep prints of the film out of circulation.|$|R
25|$|Griffith alone of {{the three}} fast bowlers made an impact <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three Test matches, taking 11 wickets; Constantine, a failure with both bat and ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tests, {{compensated}} with 1381 runs and 107 wickets in all first-class matches; Francis <b>shone</b> neither <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tests nor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other games. His six Test wickets cost 42 runs each and he conceded three-and-a-half runs an over; in first-class games he took just 56 wickets {{at an average of}} 31.96. He bowled West Indies' first ball in Test cricket <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game at Lord's, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match at The Oval he took four wickets for 112 runs, but England needed to bat only once <b>in</b> each of <b>the</b> three Tests, and the lowest total scored off the West Indies' bowling was the 351 of <b>the</b> second match. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> games against the first-class counties, Francis did not take five wickets in any single innings.|$|R
500|$|As {{a result}} of this episode, The Office became the first American comedy series to depict the Diwali holiday. Lauren Markoe of The Huffington Post has {{credited}} the episode with helping to introduce Diwali to the American public, writing that it [...] "represents perhaps the brightest spotlight ever <b>shone</b> on Diwali <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States." [...] In their 2012 book Diversity in U.S. Mass Media, Catherine A.

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{he became}} a crowd {{favourite}} for his languid style, skill and lampooned name, having to have it explained {{to him that the}} crowd were not [...] "booing" [...] him, but in fact [...] "abouing" [...] him. Hartson, however, scored consistently, notching 24 in his first season across all competitions, whilst Lampard flowered in midfield. The acquisition of Sinclair at Christmas revitalised West Ham as he <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wing back position. His seven goals in 14 games helped propel the team for the first time into the upper half of the table, with the side ultimately finishing the year in eighth.|$|E
2500|$|As a sophomore, Talcott was the {{starting}} quarterback in six of ten games for the undefeated 1898 Michigan football team that won the school's first Western Conference (as the Big Ten was then known) championship and prompted Louis Elbel to compose Michigan's fight song, [...] "The Victors." [...] In {{the early days of}} football, players were required to play on both offense and defense. [...] On defense, Talcott was a linebacker. [...] Blocking was known at the time as [...] "interference," [...] and after a 230 victory over Notre Dame in October 1898, The Michigan Alumnus wrote that [...] "Talcott <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interference." ...|$|E

Transferred by his guardian, Bishop John McCarthy of Cloyne, to the seminary of the Vincentian Fathers in Sundayswell in Cork, he was ordained to the priesthood in the Cathedral of St. Mary and St. Anne at Cork, on Sunday, 18 April 1875 by Bishop William Delany. It is believed that he celebrated his first Mass in the chapel of the Convent of Mercy in Mallow.|$|E

2500|$|Caddick {{was not to}} be out of the England {{side for}} long, as he was named in the squad to tour the West Indies. [...] He <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third Test at Queen's Park Oval, where he took 6/65 in the West Indies second innings, {{although}} this was overshadowed when England were bowled out for just 46 in their second innings, with Curtly Ambrose taking 11 wickets in the match. [...] He also managed 5/63 in the second innings of the fourth Test at Kensington Oval, although he was yet again overshadowed, this time by Alec Stewart scoring centuries in both England innings' and Angus Fraser's 8/75 in the first innings. Caddick did however finish the series as England's leading Test wicket taker, with 18 wickets to his name.|$|E
2500|$|Nothing {{published}} {{during the}} war made half the sensation that did this prophetic volume, whose predictions were so wonderfully accurate that {{very few of them}} were found to have proved false {{at the end of the}} dark contest, dark not only because beginning to be so doubtful, and laden with sorrow, and suffering, and loss, but because, although the North <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light of a glorious resolve, and the South contended for principle, the struggle was still one between brothers. The newspapers of the day were full of reviews and notices, eulogistic and otherwise, according to the party represented. The book revived courage and rekindled hope. [...] "It is worth a whole phalanx in the cause of human freedom," [...] wrote Charles Sumner; and Abraham Lincoln paused in the midst of his mighty work to send her a letter of thanks and lofty cheer.|$|E
