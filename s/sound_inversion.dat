The techniques open up the possibility of monitoring the ionosphere at otherwise inaccessible locations, such as over sea or inhospitable terrain. A new method of monitoring the ionosphere based on radio tomography {{can be used to}} create two-dimensional images of electron density. The results in this paper compare midpoint profiles derived from oblique ionograms with corresponding profiles obtained from tomographic images of electron density and from a vertical ionospheric sounder. The comparisons illustrate the oblique <b>sounder</b> <b>inversion</b> technique and its inherent limitations. The results provide useful information on the complementary nature of the separate ionospheric measurement techniques and have implications for the use of these measurements as inputs to real-time ionospheric models...|$|R

40|$|The {{variations}} in the adiabatic index in the second helium ionization zone of the Sun allow us to infer the helium abundance in the solar envelope using the observed solar oscillation frequencies. These variations leave their signature on the sound-speed in this region, hence, techniques based on solar <b>sound</b> speed <b>inversion</b> {{can be used to}} determine the abundance of helium. These techniques are known {{to be sensitive to the}} equation of state used in the reference models. Sensitivity of the helium abundance measurements to the equation of state is studied using models constructed with MHD or OPAL equations of state. Recent observations of high degree solar p- modes yield helium abundance Y = 0 : 246 and 0 : 249, respectively using reference models with MHD and OPAL equations of state. Further, the models constructed using OPAL equation of state are found to be in better agreement with the inferred sound speed in the Sun, particularly below the second helium ionization zone. 1.

40|$|Utah Valley University has a {{long-term}} program of groundwater {{development in the}} Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt {{in the state of}} Guanajuato, Mexico, in cooperation with Choice Humanitarian. Thus far, we have drilled a successful 50 -m well in basalt for the village of Tamaula and an unsuccessful 22 -m well in rhyolite for the village of Garbanzo. Well sites have been chosen based on spring locations and on fracture traces, which are linear features as seen on aerial photos. The objective {{of this study is to}} measure and model the geoelectric and magnetic characteristics of fracture traces as a means of determining which fracture traces are most indicative of actual fractured rock. Thus far, studies have been carried out on 20 fracture traces in rhyolite in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, six fracture traces in rhyolite / diorite / monzonite of the La Sal Intrusives in the La Sal Mountains of Utah, and one fracture trace in rhyolite of the Soldiers Pass Formation west of Utah Lake. The Earthâ€™s total magnetic field has been measured at about 1 -m spacing along profiles perpendicular to fracture traces using the Geometrics G- 856 Proton Precession Magnetometer. Magnetic susceptibilities have been measured in the field using the portable SM- 20 Magnetic Susceptibility Meter and in the lab using the Bartington MS 3 Magnetic Susceptibility Meter. Geoelectric soundings for resistivity, chargeability and self-potential have been carried out both on and off fracture traces using the Iris Instruments Syscal Junior Resistivity Meter with the Schlumberger array parallel to the fracture trace at spacings in the range AB/ 2 = 2. 29 - 137 m. Geoelectric profiles have been carried out perpendicular to fracture traces (with the array parallel to the fracture trace) at spacings AB/ 2 = 15. 2 m and 137 m. Geoelectric and magnetic modeling is being carried out using the 1 X 2 D-GM Magnetic Interpretation Software and the 1 X 1 D <b>Sounding</b> <b>Inversion</b> Software. Preliminary results indicate that some fracture traces are associated with both magnetic and electrical resistivity lows consistent with intermediate depth (~ 50 m) fractured rock, although not all fracture traces have these characteristics.

Upon me this pure, narrow, sunnily-ascetic Thoreau had exercised a great charm. I have scarce written ten sentences since I was introduced to him, but his influence might be somewhere detected by a close observer. Still it was as a writer that I had made his acquaintance; I took him on his own explicit terms; and when I learned details of his life, they were, {{by the nature of}} the case and my own PARTI-PRIS, read even with a certain violence in terms of his writings. There could scarce be a perversion more justifiable than that; yet it was still a perversion. The study indeed, raised so much ire in the breast of Dr. Japp (H. A. Page), Thoreau's sincere and learned disciple, that had either of us been men, I please myself with thinking, of less temper and justice, the difference might have made us enemies instead of making us friends. To him who knew the man from the inside, many of my statements <b>sounded</b> like <b>inversions</b> made on purpose; and yet when we came to talk of them together, and he had understood how I was looking at the man through the books, while he had long since learned to read the books through the man, I believe he understood the spirit in which I had been led astray.|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} of the geologic component of observed satellite magnetic and gravity fields requires accurate isolation of the geologic component of the observations, theoretically <b>sound</b> and viable <b>inversion</b> techniques, and integration of collateral, constraining geologic and geophysical data. A number of significant contributions were made which make quantitative analysis more accurate. These include procedures for: screening and processing orbital data for lithospheric signals based on signal repeatability and wavelength analysis; producing accurate gridded anomaly values at constant elevations from the orbital data by three-dimensional least squares collocation; increasing the stability of equivalent point source inversion and criteria for {{the selection of the}} optimum damping parameter; enhancing inversion techniques through an iterative procedure based on the superposition theorem of potential fields; and modeling efficiently regional-scale lithospheric sources of satellite magnetic anomalies. In addition, these techniques were utilized to investigate regional anomaly sources of North and South America and India and to provide constraints to continental reconstruction. Since the inception of this research study, eleven papers were presented with associated published abstracts, three theses were completed, four papers were published or accepted for publication, and an additional manuscript was submitted for publication...|$|R
40|$|WOSInternational audienceAn {{inversion}} {{scheme is}} proposed, relying upon the inversion {{of the noise}} of a moving ship measured on a single distant hydrophone. The spectrogram of the measurements exhibits striations which depend on waveguide parameters. The periodic behavior of striations versus range are used to estimate the differences of radial wavenumber between couples of propagative modes at a given frequency. These wavenumber differences are stacked for several frequencies to form the relative dispersion curves. Such relative dispersion curves can be synthesized using a propagation model feeded with a bottom geoacoustic model. Inversion is performed by looking for the bottom properties that optimize the fit between measured and predicted relative dispersion curves. The inversion scheme is tested on simulated data. The conclusions are twofold: (1) a minimum 6 dB {{signal to noise ratio}} is required to obtained an unbiased estimate of compressional sound speed in the bottom with a 3 m s 1 standard deviation; however, even with low signal to noise ratio, the estimation error remains bounded and (2) {{in the case of a}} multi-layer bottom, the scheme produces a single depthaverage compressional <b>sound</b> speed.

40|$|Ultrasound {{tomography}} is {{an emerging}} modality for imaging breast tissue {{for the detection}} of disease. Using the principles of full waveform <b>inversion,</b> high-resolution quantitative <b>sound</b> speed and attenuation maps of the breast can be created. In this thesis, we introduce some basic principles of imaging breast disease and the formalism of sound wave propagation. We present numerical methods to model acoustic wave propagation as well methods to solve the corresponding inverse problem. Numerical simulations of sound speed and attenuation reconstructions are used to assess the efficacy of the algorithm. A careful review of the preprocessing techniques needed for the successful inversion of acoustic data is presented. Ex vivo and in vivo sound speed reconstructions highlight the significant improvements that are made upon commonly used travel time sound speed reconstruction methods. Note that we do not present ex vivo or in vivo attenuation reconstructions in this thesis. For the sound speed images, the higher resolution and contrast of the waveform method will hopefully allow a radiologist to make a more informed diagnosis of breast disease. A comparison of full waveform sound speed imaging to MRI shows a great deal of concordant findings. Lastly, we give examples of the use of full waveform <b>inversion</b> <b>sound</b> speed imaging in a clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} global {{acoustic}} modes on the 8 B neutrino flux time series is computed {{for the first}} time. It is shown that the time fluctuations of the 8 B neutrino flux depend on the amplitude of acoustic eigenfunctions in the region where the 8 B neutrino flux is produced: modes with low n (or order) that have eigenfunctions with a relatively large amplitude in the Sun's core strongly affect the neutrino flux; conversely, modes with high n that have eigenfunctions with a minimal amplitude in the Sun's core have a very small impact on the neutrino flux. It {{was found that the}} global modes with a larger impact on the 8 B neutrino flux have a frequency of oscillation in the interval 250 Î¼Hz to 500 Î¼Hz (or a period in the interval 30 minutes to 70 minutes), such as the f-modes (n = 0) for the low degrees, radial modes of order n <= 3, and the dipole mode of order n = 1. Their corresponding neutrino eigenfunctions are very sensitive to the solar inner core and are unaffected by the variability of the external layers of the solar surface. If time variability of neutrinos is observed for these modes, it will lead to new ways of improving the <b>sound</b> speed profile <b>inversion</b> in the central region of the Sun...|$|R
40|$|Two {{approaches}} to determining the ocean sound profile using measured acoustic modal eigenvalues are examined. Both methods use measured eigenvalues and mode dependent assumed {{values of the}} WKB phase integral as input data and use the WKB phase integral {{as a starting point}} for relating the index of refraction to depth. Inversion method one is restricted to monotonic or symmetric sound speed profiles and requires a measurement of the sound speed at one depth to convert the index of refraction profile to a <b>sound</b> speed profile. <b>Inversion</b> method two assumes that the sound speed at the surface and the minimum sound speed in the profile are known and is applicable to monotonic profiles and to general single duct sound speed profiles. For asymmetric profiles, inversion method two gives the depth difference between two points of equal sound speed in the portion of the profile having two turning points, and in the remainder of the profile it gives sound speed versus depth directly. A numerical implementation of the methods is demonstrated using idealized ocean sound speed profiles numerical experiments used to test the performance of the inversions using noisy data. The two methods are used to determine the sediment sound speed profiles in two shallow water waveguide models, and inversion method one is used to find the sediment sound speed profile using data from an experiment performed in the Gulf of Mexico.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most {{predominant}} forms of cancer, comprising of 22. 9 % of all cancers in women, causing approximately 450, 000 deaths in 2008. The conventional imaging standard procedure for screening studies encompasses mammography followed by handheld ultrasound. However, there is a decrease in specificity and sensitivity when imaging younger women with dense breast tissue. This dissertation will investigate ultrasound grayscale, speed of sound, and attenuation imaging of the compressed breast to improve current screening procedure. Enabling improved efficiency in 3 D volume B-mode imaging would remove operator dependency on acquiring ultrasound data and improve diagnosis because handheld ultrasound sometimes is focused on a different lesion compared to the suspicious one found on the mammogram. Beamforming algorithms for use in reconfigurable arrays were investigated. A transmit beam with an extended depth of focus was developed by minimizing a cost function that reduced the side lobe energy while maximizing the depth of focus generated by the beam. Optimized channel selection of subelements in reconfigurable arrays was illustrated in order to remove excess side lobe energy caused by overall phase delay across the aperture. Speed of sound and attenuation imaging represent different imaging modes and have been shown to increase sensitivity and specificity in breast imaging studies. In the compressed breast, these transmission modes have limited views similar to those in X-ray tomosynthesis, resulting in a major streaking artifact in the axial direction. Using a regularized cost function, a priori information was used to aid the speed of <b>sound</b> and attenuation <b>inversion</b> to produce images with minimal streaking artifacts. The speed of sound images were employed in a forward model to produce attenuation coefficient images with only speed of sound artifacts, allowing creation of attenuation images representative of the bulk properties of the different tissues in the breast, i. e., including attenuation from local absorption and internal isotropic scattering of the ultrasonic energy independent of the acoustic properties of surrounding tissues...|$|R
