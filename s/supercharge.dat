5|$|In the Second World War, the {{regiment}} {{fought in the}} Middle East, seeing action in Syria against Vichy French forces, as well as operations in Iraq and Iran. It then joined 9th Armoured Brigade, seeing action in North Africa and Italy. With this formation, it {{took part in the}} Second Battle of El Alamein, spearheading the break-out of the 2nd New Zealand Division during Operation <b>Supercharge</b> on 2 November 1942.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders were {{withdrawn}} from their positions {{four days later}} and remained out of the fighting while the Australian 9th Division took up the offensive in the northern sector of the front. Along with two British infantry brigades, the 2nd New Zealand Division resumed the fight on 2 November in Operation <b>Supercharge,</b> which was intended to break the frontlines in the south. The German defences collapsed and on 4 November they began retreating with the New Zealanders in pursuit. The 9th Armoured Brigade {{was attached to the}} 2nd New Zealand Division in support, and led the initial advance along with the 6th Brigade but rain turned the ground boggy and halted the advance temporarily before it could resume on 8 November. In mid-November, the division was withdrawn for rest and re-organisation and shortly afterwards Bonifant, recovered from the wounds that he had received on 24 October, resumed command of the battalion.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the <b>supercharge,</b> the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E
5|$|The next day, the {{regiment}} was withdrawn and {{became part of}} the divisional reserve at Alam el Onsol. Orders arrived for an advance on 30 October for Operation <b>Supercharge,</b> planned as the final attack of the battle. The regiment was placed under the command of the 9th Armoured Brigade on 1 November, with each squadron attached to an armoured unit. A Squadron was attached to the 3rd Hussars, C Squadron to the Warwickshire Yeomanry and B Squadron to the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry. The assault began the following day, with the squadrons ordered to screen the minefields for the armoured brigade. The 3rd Hussars reached the Rahman track, losing their anti-tank guns. The Wiltshire Yeomanry lost a Crusader squadron to anti-tank fire and was nearly destroyed {{by the end of the}} day. Four B Squadron men were killed by anti-tank fire as the squadron advanced behind the Wiltshires. The Warwickshires, mistaking high ground for their objective, destroyed several anti-tank guns there. At the end of the day {{the regiment}}, except for C Squadron, returned to Alam el Onsol.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Tripoli in January 1943, the {{remaining}} Axis forces retreated to prepared defences in Southern Tunisia, {{in front of the}} Mareth Line built by France before the war. Here in March, Horrocks carried out one of his most successful actions. His corps, composed of the 1stArmoured Division, a Free French brigade and the attached New Zealand Corps (which included the 2nd New Zealand Division and the British 8th Armoured Brigade), was ordered to attack as part of Operation <b>Supercharge</b> after XXXCorps failed to breach the line. He carried out a flanking manoeuvre through a pass judged by the Germans to be impenetrable, rendering the Mareth position untenable and forcing the Axis into another retreat. Three Italian divisions were destroyed, and the German 15th and 21stPanzer Divisions and the 164thDivision were heavily depleted. Horrocks was then transferred to the First Army to take over IXCorps after its previous commander, Lieutenant-General John Crocker, was wounded in a training accident. He led this corps in the final Allied offensive in Tunisia during April and May 1943, capturing Tunis and accepting the surrender of the remnants of Rommel's Army Group Africa. He was mentioned in despatches on 24 June, and for his service in Tunisia, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 5 August. He was also given the rank of temporary lieutenant-general and war substantive major-general.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} TVS <b>supercharger</b> {{was invented}} by Eaton Corporation, a company which has been inventing superchargers since 1985. The TVS <b>supercharger</b> is a 5th generation <b>supercharger</b> and its design was stated to be a game changer for the world of superchargers. The TVS <b>supercharger</b> at its initial release was being primarily used by muscle car fanatics in their much older, 1960's-1970's, muscle cars. This is because superchargers tended to be heavier and better suited to increase power on heavier muscle cars who could handle the extra weight, rather than the modern-lighter sports cars being invented today. However, due to the lighter and more efficient design of the TVS <b>supercharger,</b> the TVS <b>supercharger</b> was quickly picked up by many modern car companies [...] One of the first companies to employ this <b>supercharger</b> was Toyota in their Toyota Aurion in 2007 and Audi quickly followed in 2010 by employing the TVS <b>supercharger</b> in all of their TFSI V6 engines.

25|$|After the Mareth Line in {{southern}} Tunisia had been outflanked in Operation <b>Supercharge</b> II, through the Tebaga Gap, Axis forces had withdrawn to the Wadi Akarit, north of Gabès. This position {{had been identified}} long before by Erwin Rommel as a good defensive position with secure flanks and a short supply route to Sicily. Rommel had wanted to withdraw there after the Second Battle of El Alamein, {{as it was the}} best place to resist the Eighth Army and prolong the Axis presence in Africa. With the British held at Wadi Akarit, all available troops in Tunisia could repulse the First Army (nominally British but with American and French units under command) to the west, before dealing a similar blow to Montgomery. The Gabès Gap was the last readily defensible position before the Eighth Army reached Sfax and formed a continuous front with the First Army advancing from the west.|$|E
25|$|A month later, the Scots Greys were {{in action}} {{again at the}} Second Battle of El Alamein. Now {{attached}} to the 22nd Armoured Brigade, part of the 7th Armoured Division.

Once the break-out began, with Operation <b>Supercharge,</b> the Scots Greys, now back with the 4th Armoured Brigade, which was attached to the 2nd New Zealand Division, began attempted break-out. In the course of their advance, the Scots Greys participated in the annihilation of the Ariete Division on 4 November 1942. At Fuka, the Scots Greys found the division's artillery.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of preliminary tests made on the effects of <b>supercharging</b> an air-cooled engine under airplane flight conditions. Service training airplanes were used in the investigation equipped with production types of Wright J engines. A N. A. C. A. Roots type <b>supercharger</b> was driven {{from the rear of the}} engine.

40|$|As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} to increase the power output of the V- 1710 - 93 engine at altitude, the engine-stage <b>supercharger</b> was combined with a constant-area vaneless diffuser designed to improve {{the performance of the}} engine-stage <b>supercharger</b> at the rated engine operating point. The performance of the modified <b>supercharger</b> was investigated in a variable-component <b>supercharger</b> test rig and compared with that of the standard <b>supercharger</b> with an 8 -vaned diffuser. A separate evaluation of the component efficiencies and a study of the flow characteristics of the modified <b>supercharger</b> was made possible by internal diffuser instrumentation. At the volume flow required by the engine for rated operating conditions, the modified <b>supercharger</b> increased the over-all adiabatic efficiency 0. 05 and the over-all pressure coefficient 0. 035. Furthermore, the capacity of the engine-stage <b>supercharger</b> was increased by replacing the standard 8 -vaned diffuser with the vaneless diffuser. The peak over-all adiabatic efficiency for the modified <b>supercharger,</b> however, was 0. 05 to 0. 07 lower than that of the standard unit over the range of tip speeds investigated. The improved performance of the modified <b>supercharger</b> at rated engine operating conditions resulted from a shift of the point of peak adiabatic efficiency and pressure coefficient of the standard <b>supercharger</b> to a higher flow. The energy loss through the vaneless diffuser was found to be small. Because of the restricted diffuser diameter, however, diffusion was inadequate, which resulted in a relatively small static-pressure rise through the diffuser, high diffuser-exit velocities, and excessive collector-case losses...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} cope with the extreme altitudes flown at, the pilot was {{provided}} with a specially-developed two-piece suit. This suit, which was principally composed of rubberised fabric, was joined at the waist using a form of pipe-clip. It was provided with a helmet, which featured a large forward window to provide view. It is complete with closed-circuit breathing apparatus, the oxygen jet being delivered via a small injector for circulation purposes. Once exhaled, the gas would travel via an external tube to a canister containing carbon dioxide-absorbing chemicals to restore it to a pure oxygen state prior to being re-circulated. The 138 had an internal capacity of 82 gallons, spread across 70 gallons in the lower tank and 12 gallons in the upper tank. A specially-developed fuel, known as S.A.F.4, was used for the altitude record flight, derived from standard grade Shell Ethyl aviation gasoline. Of note, this fuel has a high anti-knock value; the high degree of <b>supercharge</b> involved results in the fuel mixture reaching high temperatures, which generally increases the potential for detonation, thus a high anti-knock value was viewed to be of critical importance.|$|E
