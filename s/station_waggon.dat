5000|$|Once the M&LR's new {{extension}} {{had been}} opened, Oldham Road station was converted from passenger {{use to the}} receipt, unloading, storing and despatch of goods. From 1844, goods trains operated along what was now a short branch line (72-chains in length) from Oldham Road Junction near Miles Platting <b>station.</b> <b>Waggons</b> of 8 MT or more were raised and lowered from the goods yard at street level below by a double hoist. The business offices (including the Superintendent's office) of the railway remained at the station.|$|R
50|$|At Hadley Wood station, route 12 starts {{again as}} The Great North Way and is {{continuous}} from Hadley Wood {{station on the}} railway line from London to north of Letchworth at the Hertfordshire county boundary. There is a short cut cycle route direct from the <b>station</b> to <b>Waggon</b> Road.|$|R
60|$|This was {{the only}} house where a {{successful}} resistance was made, and on getting to the last station the party bivouacked near {{the ruins of the}} house, and, placing two men on guard, were soon asleep. They were undisturbed till morning, and mounting {{as soon as it was}} daylight, rode back to Mr. Armstrong's <b>station.</b> Three <b>waggons</b> had arrived late the night before, and with the assistance of the troopers were already loaded with furniture and other effects.|$|R
25|$|There {{were to be}} two {{inclined}} planes; one at Colton (332 {{yards with}} a gradient of 1 in 24) and one at Fordell House, known as the Vantage incline. Vantage was 1148 yards long with a gradient of 1 in 23.75. At Hillend an extra horse was <b>stationed</b> to assist <b>waggons</b> up the incline.|$|R
50|$|After the war, {{the station}} was like a battlefield. In July 1945, workers were asked to report to their {{workplaces}} {{to be able to}} participate in the reconstruction of the station. The debris was sufficient for the reconstruction of three signal boxes, because as much debris as possible was reused. Since there were no locomotives in the <b>station,</b> the ballast <b>waggons</b> had to be pushed by hand. The points, tracks and signals were also recovered and repaired.|$|R
50|$|Daily local freight trains {{called at}} each of the <b>stations</b> to shunt <b>waggons</b> in the goods yards until and after their closure to passengers, Uppermill closing for goods traffic on 15 June 1964. The section of the line from Diggle to Staley and Millbrook was closed to all traffic on 3 October 1966, with the {{remaining}} section from Stalybridge to Staley and Millbrook surviving for a few more years to serve Hartshead Power Station near the latter location.|$|R
6000|$|... "The loss is yours, I assure you," [...] said Mrs. Pardiggle {{with her}} {{commanding}} deportment. [...] "He {{is a very}} fervid, impassioned speaker--full of fire! <b>Stationed</b> in a <b>waggon</b> on this lawn, now, which, from {{the shape of the}} land, is naturally adapted to a public meeting, he would improve almost any occasion you could mention for hours and hours! By this time, young ladies," [...] said Mrs. Pardiggle, moving back to her chair and overturning, as if by invisible agency, a little round table at a considerable distance with my work-basket on it, [...] "by this time you have found me out, I dare say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR HENLEY, - I {{am sitting}} {{on the top of}} the cars with a mill party from Missouri going west for his health. Desolate flat prairie upon all hands. Here and there a herd of cattle, a yellow {{butterfly}} or two; a patch of wild sunflowers; a wooden house or two; then a wooden church alone in miles of waste; then a windmill to pump water. When we stop, which we do often, for emigrants and freight travel together, the kine first, the men after, the whole plain is heard singing with cicadae. This is a pause, as you may see from the writing. What happened to the old pedestrian emigrants, what was the tedium suffered by the Indians and trappers of our youth, the imagination trembles to conceive. This is now Saturday, 23rd, and I have been steadily travelling since I parted from you at St. Pancras. It is a strange vicissitude from the Savile Club to this; I sleep with a man from Pennsylvania who has been in the States Navy, and mess with him and the Missouri bird already alluded to. We have a tin wash-bowl among four. I wear nothing but a shirt and a pair of trousers, and never button my shirt. When I land for a meal, I pass my coat and feel dressed. [...] This life is to last till Friday, Saturday, or Sunday next. It is a strange affair to be an emigrant, as I hope you shall see in a future work. I wonder if this will be legible; my present <b>station</b> on the <b>waggon</b> roof, though airy compared to the cars, is both dirty and insecure. I can see the track straight before and straight behind me to either horizon. Peace of mind I enjoy with extreme serenity; I am doing right; I know no one will think so; and don't care. My body, however, is all to whistles; I don't eat; but, man, I can sleep. The car in front of mine is chock full of Chinese.|$|R
