5|$|One of Simpson's first tasks was {{to confer}} with the Chief Signals Officer at General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area, Brigadier General Spencer B. Akin. The two {{established}} mechanisms to divide responsibility for the theatre's communications between the two armies, which often worked together on the same projects. An important outcome of their first meeting {{was the creation of}} the Central Bureau as a combined <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> organisation. Simpson had been thinking about such an organisation while on the Orcades. Blamey had an appreciation of <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> from his time as Deputy Commander in Chief in the Middle East, and readily gave his support. After a slow start, <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> became an important element of the war in the South West Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Following the 29 August raid, the British {{learned from}} Ultra <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> that Tirpitz had not {{sustained}} any significant damage during Operation Goodwood. In public statements the Royal Navy {{claimed to have}} damaged or sunk 19 German warships during the attacks on Kaafjord, but did not report damage to Tirpitz.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{developed}} large {{intelligence services}} during the war. Prior {{the outbreak of}} war the Australian military possessed almost no intelligence gathering facilities and was reliant on information passed on by the British intelligence services. Several small <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> units were established in 1939 and 1940, which had some success intercepting and deciphering Japanese transmissions before {{the outbreak of the}} Pacific War.|$|E

5|$|Secrecy for the {{operation}} was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had been informed of {{the operation}} and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire. British <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> (Ultra) recorded the movement and buildup of German air forces in the region, but did not realise that an operation was imminent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} phases, British and Malaysian troops had {{attempted}} only {{to control the}} border, and to protect population centres. However, {{by the time the}} Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing borders to obtain information and forcing the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> to determine Indonesian movements and intentions.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 1972, the Easter Offensive, {{the largest}} {{combined}} arms {{operation of the}} entire Vietnam War, was in its third day. An early morning flight of two United States Air Force EB-66 aircraft was led by Bat 20, piloted by Lt. Col. Robert Singletary. Hambleton was a navigator aboard Bat 21. The two aircraft were escorting a cell of three B-52s. Bat 21 was configured to gather <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence,</b> including identifying North Vietnamese anti-aircraft radar installations to enable jamming. Bat 21 was destroyed by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile and Hambleton was the only survivor, parachuting behind the front lines into a battlefield filled with thousands of North Vietnamese Army soldiers.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9February, two New Zealand-crewed Beaufighters from No.489 Squadron {{conducted}} a patrol of the Norwegian coast. These aircraft first sighted a 1,500-ton merchant ship in Stong Fjord. Continuing north, they were surprised to find a Narvik-class destroyer accompanied by a minesweeper and two flak ships in Førde Fjord. The aircraft continued their patrol and spotted five large merchant ships in the Nord Gulen and two minesweepers and a flak ship near Bremanger. Despite the pilots' surprise, the Allied command was aware that Z33 was in the area from Ultra <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Australian Defence Force cooperates with militaries {{around the}} world. Australia's formal {{military}} agreements include the ANZUS Alliance with the United States of America, the Closer Defence Program with New Zealand, the Five Power Defence Arrangements with Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and the ABCA Armies Standardisation Program with United States, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand.

5|$|Following these raids the {{government}} conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo. During the early phases, British and Malaysian troops had attempted only {{to control the}} Malaysian/Indonesian border, and to protect population centres. However, {{by the time the}} Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing the border into Kalimantan to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> to determine enemy movements and intentions.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur began organising {{large scale}} {{intelligence}} services {{shortly after his}} arrival in Australia. On 15 April 1942, the joint Australian-US Central Bureau <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> organisation was established at Melbourne. Central Bureau's headquarters moved to Brisbane in July 1942 and Manila in May 1945. Australians made up half the strength of Central Bureau, which was expanded to over 4,000personnel by 1945. The Australian Army and RAAF also provided most of the Allied radio interception capability in the SWPA, {{and the number of}} Australian radio interception units was greatly expanded between 1942 and 1945. Central Bureau broke a number of Japanese codes and the intelligence gained from these decryptions and radio direction finding greatly assisted Allied forces in the SWPA.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{casualties}} {{could not}} be estimated {{because of lack of}} communications between units during the battle, which limited the value of American <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence.</b> North Korean armor suffered heavy losses. A total of 15–20 North Korean tanks were destroyed by anti-tank weapons and US aircraft, and North Korean prisoners estimated that 15 76-mm guns, six 122-mm mortars, and 200 artillerymen were lost. Losses among North Korean infantry were heavy, especially in the NK 3rd Division. The NK 3rd division was reported between 60 and 80 percent of its strength {{at the beginning of the}} battle and was reduced to 50 percent by its end, with total casualties ranging from 1,250 to 3,300.|$|E

5|$|On 10 November the 57th Independent Battalion {{advanced}} {{against the}} TO in Veliki Miletinac (east {{of the area}} captured in Operation Swath-10), capturing the village the same day. The neighbouring Mali Miletinac was captured by the HV the following day, and on 12 November the HV captured the villages of Bastajski Brđani and Rekići. Two days later the TO counterattacked, killing nine HV troops and wounding about ten more, but the HV defence held. Another effort to recapture Bastajski Brđani {{was made by the}} TO, reinforced with 50 paramilitary White Eagles. It failed (despite being well prepared and supported by artillery) because the defending HV force was alerted by <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> of the attack and reinforced. The White Eagles lost 46 killed in the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August, Admiral Scheer {{attempted}} {{to repeat the}} 31 May operation. The two serviceable German battlecruisers (Moltke and Von der Tann), supported by three dreadnoughts, would bombard Sunderland {{in an attempt to}} draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Thüringen, would trail behind and provide cover. British <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> informed Jellicoe of the German departure later in the day, and he sent the Grand Fleet out to intercept the Germans. On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35 on 19 August, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{forces on}} Bougainville {{detected}} the Japanese buildup. Information on {{the movement of}} the 17th Army was gained from many sources, including <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence,</b> patrols conducted by US Army troops into the interior of the island, aerial and naval patrols as well as the interrogation of Japanese prisoners. In addition, Japanese troops were also detected around the outpost, which was held by the 1stFiji Battalion at Ibu {{to the north of the}} perimeter. In response, Allied aircraft attacked bridges and areas in which Japanese troops were believed to be located. United States Navy PT boats and Landing Craft Infantry gunboats supported by PBY Catalina aircraft also patrolled the coast of Bougainville and attacked Japanese barges, but were unable to stop the movement of supplies and equipment by sea. In addition, American warships and aircraft periodically bombarded the main Japanese bases on Bougainville.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Signal</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Service {{was located}} in the Munitions Building {{during the early years}} of World War II. In September 1939, the <b>Signal</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Service was able to break Japan's cipher, Purple.

5|$|To disrupt British radio transmissions, Wolfgang Martini's unit, the Funkhorchdienst (Radio Enlightening Service, or <b>Signals</b> <b>intelligence)</b> {{attempted}} to jam radio-telephone frequencies. They created a subtle jamming technique which increased atmospheric interference which degraded {{the performance of}} British coastal radars. In addition Dornier Do 217s of Kampfgeschwader 2 (Bomber Wing 2) was ordered to fly electronic deception missions over the western channel to divert enemy aircraft. Joachim Coeler's Fliegerkorps IX prepared to strike at RAF bases in south-west England and to engage and slow down British naval forces that might attempt an interception. Fernaufklärungsgruppe 123 (strategic or long-range reconnaissance) was responsible for maintaining reconnaissance in the channel's east and west entrance and was to support Fliegerkorps IX.|$|E
5|$|Bodyguard of Lies {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} to Ultra, the codename for decrypted <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence.</b> It goes on to document {{the origins of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and the work of Dudley Clarke in the Middle East. In late 1942, Allied high command in London became aware of Clarke's successes during the North African Campaign. Based on his theories of deception, the LCS was created under Colonel John Bevan and granted broad powers to plan deception strategy. The introduction finishes with a discussion of how the Allies evolved deception strategy prior to 1943, including the Double-Cross System (the Allied system of double agents). The second section of the book introduces the German intelligence forces, in particular Admiral Canaris and his Abwehr intelligence agency. Brown discusses early deceptions, such as those surrounding Operation Torch, conducted against the Germans, and how the Abwehr struggled to decipher the information it was being fed.|$|E
5|$|During 1941 and {{the first}} months of 1942 Japan conquered or {{established}} de facto rule over almost the entire South China Sea region. Control of the sea was vital to the Japanese economy, as it was the conduit through which essential supplies of oil and other natural resources passed from occupied Malaya, Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. As the war turned against Japan, convoys of ships passing through the South China Sea frequently came under attack from Allied submarines and – by late 1944 – aircraft. These attacks were guided by information gained from <b>signals</b> <b>intelligence</b> and long-range air patrols, supplemented by reports from coast watchers along the Chinese coast and other observers in Asian ports. While losses of oil tankers and freighters were increasingly heavy, the Japanese Government continued to order ships to make the voyage. In an attempt to limit losses, convoys and individual ships took routes well way from the established sea lanes, or sailed close to the shore and operated only at night.|$|E
