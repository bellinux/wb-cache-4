The Tower of Ar tonelico from Metafalss is different from the tower in the first game since it does not look like a tower initially, but still has some of the same essential facilities (Plasma Bell (represented as the Lift Generators) and Musical Corridor (called here the Wings of Hynemos)). The Song Magics are still used like programs, but in this tower there are two Song Magic servers: the Sol Marta server and the Infel Phira Server. The Sol Marta server is located in the upper zone of the tower, acting like a <b>stationary</b> <b>satellite.</b> However, Sol Marta is not a proper Song Magic server, and instead, it serves as a relay for the First Tower of Ar tonelico, which was the {{setting for the}} first game. On the other hand, the Infel Phira server is located in a satellite that orbits the sky around the tower and shares its name with said server. Given Sol Marta's purpose as a relay for the First Tower, it works with the same kind of hymmnos as it and executes the EXEC variety of hymns. On the other hand, the Infel Phira server works with another kind of hymmnos called the New Testament of Pastalie hymmnos, and executes the METHOD variety of hymns.|$|E

To avoid many questions with full frame CCD drift scan mode, part frame CCD drift scan mode was achieved by software. In order to obtain good circular images of reference stars and GSS (Geo <b>Stationary</b> <b>Satellites),</b> part frame CCD drift scan mode and stare mode were carried out by turns. Making and implementing observation plan for GSS were discussed also. The elementary version of special software for data reduction was finished by ourselves. This special software was called SHAO_GSS_Positioning. The main functions of this software includes detecting stars in FTS file automatically, matching and identifying reference stars automatically, obtaining parameters of suitable plate model and magnitude mode of CCD automatically and finally getting the optical coordinates and visual magnitudes of GSS. By the way, UCAC 2 is used to be the catalogue of reference stars. More than fifty GSS were observed by this system and their coordinates and magnitudes were computed by SHAO_GSS_Positioning. The total internal errors of optical positioning results was about 0. 5 as. There were two main part of error source, the local reference system which was about 0. 15 as and the measurement coordinates of objects which were about 0. 45 as. The better observation condition the station is and the better optical performance the telescope is, The higher precision-position for GSS will be obtained. According to the observing process and the matching result of the previous test which purpose was surveying GSS in one small sky area, a new survey plan was made. The main principle of the new survey plan is always having telescope point to the equator in order to avoid missing the objects which will pass by the area of equator. The advantages and efficiency of the new survey plan were analysed detailedly also. Usually, GSS objects are observed with stare mode so that images of reference stars will be stretched because of the relative movement between telescope and stars. Therefore, a new centering method, that is MGC (mean-geometric-centering), was applied to compute centers of stars. MGC is more precise than moment for computing centers of stretched stars images. In fact, MGC is more suitable for saturated stats images also. 研制成功基于S 1 C 077 相机的外部同步触发装置，使S 1 C 077 相机具有适用于天文观测的CCD漂移扫描（drift scan）功能。为解决通常利用满帧（Full Frame）CCD漂移扫描模式观测带来的诸多问题，通过程序实现了短帧（Part Frame）CCD漂移扫描模式。利用短帧CCD漂移扫描模式和凝视模式交替观测恒星和地球同步卫星，获得参考恒星和地球同步卫星良好的圆星像。讨论了利用此设备观测地球同步卫星观测方案的制定和实施。 针对该设备获得的地球同步卫星的观测资料，独立编制了数据处理软件的初级版本，该软件主要包括以下功能：漂移扫描恒星FTS图像中星像的自动化检测、参考星的匹配与证认、CCD成像模型参数的归算、星等模型参数归算以及最终得到地球同步卫星的光学位置（站心平位置）和视星等。该软件选用UCAC 2 为参考星表。 利用上海天文台的 20 cm马克苏托夫望远镜和 25 cm牛顿－卡塞格林望远镜已经对几十颗地球同步卫星进行了观测。基于该软件对一些实测资料进行了处理，得到了目标的光学位置和视星等。光学定位结果的内部精度约为 0. 5 角秒。详细分析了主要的误差来源，分别是由参考星决定的局部参考架的误差约 0. 15 角秒，目标量度坐标误差约为 0. 45 角秒。当台站观测条件好、望远镜光学性能佳时，地球同步卫星的光学定位精度将会大大提高，理论上可以与该望远镜的恒星定位精度相当。 根据对小天区地球同步卫星搜索的试验性研究，通过对搜索过程和比对结果的分析，提出了新的搜索方案。新搜索方案的出发点是“具有“ 8 ”字运动的有倾角的地球同步卫星总是会在 24 小时内两次穿过赤道”。对新搜索方案的搜索效率和实施优点做了详细的分析和讨论。 通常观测地球同步卫星时采用跟踪卫星的凝视模式观测，针对观测资料中出现的拖长恒星星像的特点，利用平均几何中心法定恒星星像的中心。通过与重心法定拖长星像中心结果的比较，认为确定拖长星像的重心，平均几何中心法要远优于重心法。另外在确定曝光过度星像中心时，平均几何中心法也能够获得精度很高的结果...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the characteristics of dust storm processes over the western United States, available dust storm events reported by media or recorded by NASA earth observatory are classified into four types based on the prevailing weather systems. Then these four types of dust storm events related to cold fronts, downbursts, tropical disturbances, and cyclogenesis and their selected typical representative events are examined to explore their identifiable characteristics based on in-situ and remote sensing measurements. We find that the key feature of cold front-induced dust storms is their rapid process with strong dust emissions. Events caused by rapid downbursts have the highest rates of emissions. Dust storms due to tropical disturbances show stronger air concentrations of dust and last longer than those caused by cold fronts and downbursts. Finally, dust storms caused by cyclogenesis last the longest. The analysis of particulate matter records also shows that the relative ratio of PM 10 (size less than 10 μm) values on dust storm-days to non-dust storm-days is a better indicator of event identification compared to previous established indicators. Moreover, aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from both in-situ and satellite datasets allow us to capture dust storm processes. We show that MODIS AOD retrieved from the deep blue data better identify dust storm-affected areas and the spatial extension of event intensity. Our analyses also show that the variability in mass concentrations during dust storm processes captured only by in-situ observations is consistent with the variability in AOD from <b>stationary</b> or <b>satellite</b> observations.

MTSI continue to {{play a significant role in}} understanding our planet. They have been considered in many applications such as precision agriculture, geology, environment and terrestrial ecology, urban growth and forest monitoring. Accurate and up-to-date land use data is necessary to understand and assess the changes. This issue is the subject of several research stemming from different points of view. In the literature review, change prediction methods proposed are often encountered problems within MTSI because they are completely influenced by seasonal and random variations. Two significant challenges stand out. First, methods must allow change detection in non-stationary MTSI. Secondly, methods must build a prediction system to predict future state of land use. In this chapter, an overview and comparative study of Hidden Markov models (HMM) used in land use change prediction is presented. In fact, HMM have been widely used in change prediction in MTSI under stationary hypothesis. Then a generic change prediction approach for MTSI, involving detection and characterization of change types (trend, seasonal and random) is provided. The experimental results on a series of LANDSAT images showed a good results for prediction. The experiment on MODIS dataset also confirms the improved performance of the propose system.

40|$|To improve {{dust storm}} {{identification}} over the western United States, historical dust events measured by air quality and satellite observations are analyzed {{based on their}} characteristics in data sets of regular meteorology, satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD), and air quality measurements. Based on the prevailing weather conditions associated with dust emission, dust storm events are classified into the following four typical types: (1) The key feature of cold front-induced dust storms is their rapid process with strong dust emissions. (2) Events caused by meso- to small-scale weather systems have {{the highest levels of}} emissions. (3) Dust storms caused by tropical disturbances show a stronger air concentration of dust and last longer than those in (1) and (2). (4) Dust storms triggered by cyclogenesis last the longest. In this paper, sample events of each type are selected and examined to explore characteristics observed from in situ and remote-sensing measurements. These characteristics include the lasting period, surface wind speeds, areas affected, average loading on ground-based optical and/or air quality measurements, peak loading on ground-based optical and/or air quality measurements, and loading on satellite-based aerosol optical depth. Based on these analyses, we compare the characteristics of the same dust events captured in different data sets in order to define the dust identification criteria. The analyses show that the variability in mass concentrations captured by in situ measurements is consistent with the variability in AOD from <b>stationary</b> and <b>satellite</b> observations. Our analyses also find that different data sets are capable of identifying certain common characteristics, while each data set also provides specific information about a dust storm event. For example, the meteorological data are good at identifying the lasting period and area impacted by a dust event; the ground-based air quality and optical measurements can capture the peak strength well; aerosol optical depth (AOD) from satellite data sets allows us to better identify dust-storm-affected areas and the spatial extent of dust.

This {{is used as a}} foundation from which can be derived the requirements of an improved method for space exploration. This new method requires the use of many small probes, deployed over an area of a planet much larger than that covered by conventional landers or rovers.

These are deployed over a large area, in contrast with the convention which is to use a single large device with increased capabilities, but which can operate only within a single location. The cost in terms of payload mass is equivalent, but allows for the coverage of a much larger area. A design implementing this new exploration method is created. This design includes a deceleration system, communications and power systems as well as a small suite of suitable analysis tools. The merits of this new platform are assessed against those past exploration missions described earlier. The primary criteria against which this comparison is made is in regard to the mass of the overall mission and the expected return of information.

To date, observations from the X-Ray Sensor (XRS) onboard the Geo- <b>stationary</b> Operational Environmental <b>Satellite</b> (GOES) {{have been used}} to derive these properties, but have been limited by a number of factors, including the lack of a consistent background sub- traction method capable of being automatically applied to large numbers of flares. In this paper, we describe an automated temperature and emission measure-based background subtraction method (TEBBS), which builds on the methods of Bornmann (1990). Our algorithm ensures that the derived temperature is always greater than the instrumental limit and the pre-flare background temperature, and that the temperature and emission measure are increasing during the flare rise phase. Addi- tionally, TEBBS utilizes the improved estimates of GOES temperatures and emission measures from White et al. (2005). TEBBS was successfully applied to over 50, 000 solar flares occurring over nearly three solar cycles (1980 - 2007), and used to create an extensive catalog of the solar flare thermal prop- erties. We confirm that the peak emission measure and total radiative losses scale with background subtracted GOES X-ray flux as power-laws, while the peak temperature scales logarithmically. As expected, the peak emission measure shows an increasing trend with peak temperature, although the total radiative losses do not. While these results are comparable to previous studies, we find that flares of a given GOES class have lower peak temperatures and higher peak emission measures than previously reported.

40|$|Automated {{systems for}} observing physical, {{chemical}} and biological conditions in the sea are being implemented worldwide {{as part of the}} Global Ocean Observing System. This report describes their use in the Baltic and the Skagerrak-Kattegat areas. An evaluation of the use of FerryBox systems in the waters around Sweden shows that the quality of data from near surface waters is high, and that the frequent sampling makes possible observations of short term phenomena such as algal blooms. These events are often overlooked by infrequent sampling using research vessels, which leads to erroneous estimates of phytoplankton biomass, ecosystem carrying capacity etc. Data come from the Helsinki Lübeck route, operated by the Finnish Institute for Marine Research and from routes in the Skagerrak- Kattegat operated by the Norwegian Institute for Water Research. FerryBox data were compared with data from traditional sampling, principally from RV Argos operated by SMHI, but also from the HELCOM databank at ICES. Observations using automated systems such as <b>satellites,</b> <b>stationary</b> platforms (buoys and piles) and FerryBox systems may contribute substantially to improving the quality of results from models describing the physical and biogeochemical conditions in Scandinavian waters. Boundary conditions for models can be obtained using measurements in the eastern North Sea and in the Skagerrak, while data assimilation from a network of buoys, FerryBoxsystems and research vessels improves the quality of model results. Today, between four and six automated oceanographic observation systems are in operation in Swedish waters, which can be compared to more than 700 for meteorological purposes. A dramatic {{increase in the number of}} observations is necessary for effective data assimilation. To make the observations useful for biogeochemical models, parameters such as inorganic nutrients, phytoplankton biomass and oxygen must be added to the basic parameters salinity and temperature. A detailed proposal for a new infrastructure for marine monitoring and operational oceanography in Sweden is put forward. FerryBox systems should be operated in collaboration with institutes in Finland, Estonia, Poland, Germany, Denmark and Norway. Coastal buoys contribute to the monitoring needs of the EU Water Framework Directive while offshore buoys are for long term climate and ecological research and for fulfilment of the EU Marine Strategy Directive. Products combining satellite data with in-situ observations should be developed. These automated systems augment monitoring using research vessels but do not replace it. SMHI, the Swedish Institute for the Marine Environment, the Swedish Water Authorities, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, Swedish Navy, Coast guard, Maritime Administration and Board of Fisheries are proposed to govern and operate the system, with SMHI as the lead partner. The function -National data host for operational oceanographic data- is proposed, to be established at the National Oceanographic Data Centre at SMHI.
