40|$|Introduction. Women {{often use}} <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> as a {{complement}} or alternative to traditional medicine. Guided by the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking, {{this study examined}} use of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> among mothers of young children living in the Central Appalachian Region. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among mothers of young children (n= 178). The outcome measure of interest {{was the use of}} any <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> in the past six months. Two scales were developed to measure information seeking channels and to measure beliefs about the safety/efficacy of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies.</b> Results. One-third reported using <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> in the past six months, with fenugreek being the most common. Most reported using <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> to increase breast milk production and to relieve cold/flu-like symptoms. Women scoring highest in information seeking channels were three times as likely to use <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies.</b> Women scoring highest in the beliefs about the safety/efficacy of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> were four times as likely to use <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies.</b> Conclusion. <b>Herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> are commonly used among women living in the Central Appalachian Region, a region with lower education and income level. Therefore, public health interventions about the types, safety, and efficacy of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> may improve health within this population...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> had {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} last one decade in Nigeria. This {{has led to the}} production of herbal products with bogus claims. The microbial quality and antibacterial properties of two Nigerian <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> with such claimed efficacy of curing all manners of microbial diseases were assessed. The <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> were discovered to be contaminated with the following microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus cereus, Basidiobotrytis sp, Oedocephalum sp, Varicosporium sp and Articulospora inflata. Antibacterial analysis using the killing rate revealed that the <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> had bacteriostatic and not bacteriocidal effect. Qualitative phytochemical screening of the <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> revealed the presence of saponin, tannins, alkaloids, anthraquinone and cardiac glycosides which suggest possible antimicrobial effect.

40|$|The use of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> by African {{farmers in}} the {{treatment}} of livestock diseases was investigated using a range of methods, including group interviews, structured interviews, semi-structured interviews and participant observation. The study was concerned mainly with the 'why' and 'how' of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> use among African livestock holders farming on communally-owned land in central Eastern Cape Province. We found that the use of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> was still widespread because these remedies were cheap, locally available and convenient to administer. Farmers also used <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> because they did not have knowledge of conventional remedies or found these too expensive and therefore used <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> as a last resort. Most of the farmers interviewed (73 %) had used some form of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy.</b> A small number of farmers did not use <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> at all. They rejected them because they had bad experiences in the past or because they considered the practice outdated and socially inferior. Often farmers used <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> in combination with conventional ones, but a substantial number relied on <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> only. Farmers obtained <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> principally by preparing their own or by purchasing from herbalists. Different plant parts were used to prepare <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> in the form of infusions, decoctions, powders, pastes, and juices from fresh plant material. Preparations were made from a single plant or from a range of plants. Application of a remedy was by different routes and methods, depending on the perceived cause of the disease condition. Topical applications were used for skin conditions, powders were rubbed into incisions, drenches were common {{in the treatment of}} systemic conditions, and drops to treat ears and eyes. We identified several aspects of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> utilisation that could be subject to improvement, which included the absence of standard dose regimes, the potential toxicity of certain compounds present in plants used, over-exploitation of the plant resource and a lack of interest by the youth to learn the art...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{alternative}} therapies has become widespread. In particular, {{there has been a}} resurgence in the public's demand for <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies,</b> despite a lack of high-quality evidence to support the use of many of them. Given the increasing pressures to control healthcare spending in most countries, {{it is not surprising that}} attention is being focused on the cost effectiveness of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies.</b> We address the question of whether there is sufficient information to enable the assessment of the cost effectiveness of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies.</b> In so doing, we discuss the current state of play with several of the more high-profile alternative <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> [Chinese medicinal herbs for atopic eczema, evening primrose oil, ginkgo biloba, hypericum (St John's wort) ] and some which have made the transition from being alternative to being orthodox remedies. We use historical context to discuss, on the one hand, the increasing commodification of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> and on the other, the trend towards greater regulatory control and licensing {{of alternative}} <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies.</b> We argue that unless great care is exercised, these changes are not necessarily in the best interests of patients. In order to identify cost-effective care, we need reliable information about the costs as well as the efficacy and safety of the treatments being assessed. For most alternative therapies, such data are not available. We believe that studies to gather such data are long overdue. Whilst we argue strongly in favour of control of some <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies,</b> we urge caution with the trend towards licensing of all <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies.</b> We argue that the licensing of those <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> with equivocal benefits and few risks, as evidenced by a long history of safe use, increases barriers to entry and increases societal healthcare costs.

40|$|Abstract Background Few data {{exist on}} {{survival}} or health-related {{quality of life}} (QOL) related to <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> use among long-term breast cancer survivors. The objective of this report is to examine whether <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> use is associated with survival or the health-related QOL of these long-term breast cancer survivors. Methods In 1999 - 2000, we collected the information of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> use and QOL during a telephone interview with 371 Los Angeles Non-Hispanic/Hispanic white women who had survived more than 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis. QOL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form- 36 (SF- 36) questionnaire. Patients were followed for mortality from the baseline interview through 2007. 299 surviving patients completed a second telephone interview on QOL in 2002 - 2004. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards methods to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for mortality and applied multivariable linear regression models to compare average SF- 36 change scores (follow-up - baseline) between <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> users and non-users. Results Fifty-nine percent of participants were <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> users at baseline. The most commonly used <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> were echinacea, <b>herbal</b> teas, and ginko biloba. <b>Herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> use was associated with non-statistically significant increases in the risks for all-cause (44 deaths, RR = 1. 28, 95 % CI = 0. 62 - 2. 64) and breast cancer (33 deaths, RR = 1. 78, 95 % CI = 0. 72 - 4. 40) mortality. Both <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> users' and non-users' mental component summary scores on the SF- 36 increased similarly from the first survey to the second survey (P = 0. 16), but <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> users' physical component summary scores decreased more than those of non-users (- 5. 7 vs. - 3. 2, P = 0. 02). Conclusions Our data provide some evidence that <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> use is associated with poorer survival and a poorer physical component score for health-related QOL among women who have survived breast cancer for at least 10 years. These conclusions are based on exploratory analyses of data from a prospective study using two-sided statistical tests with no correction for multiple testing and are limited by few deaths for mortality analysis and lack of information on when <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> use was initiated or duration of or reasons for use. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{systematically}} compares newspaper {{coverage of}} clinical trials for <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies,</b> a popular type of complementary and alternative medicine, with clinical trials for pharmaceuticals using a comparative content analysis. This is a timely inquiry given the recognized {{importance of the}} popular press {{as a source of}} health information, the complex and significant role of complementary and alternative medicine in individual health-care decisions, and the trend toward evidence-based research for some complementary and alternative medical therapies. We searched PubMed for clinical trials, Lexis/Nexis for newspaper articles in the UK, US, Australia/New Zealand, and Factiva for Canadian newspaper articles from 1995 to 2005. We used a coding frame to analyze and compare 48 pharmaceutical and 57 <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> clinical trials as well as 201 pharmaceutical and 352 <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> newspaper articles. Results <b>Herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> clinical trials had similar Jadad scores to pharmaceutical trials but were significantly smaller and of shorter duration. The trials were mostly studies from Western countries and published in high-ranking journals. The majority of pharmaceutical (64 %) and <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> (53 %) clinical trials had private sector funding involvement. A minority declared further author conflicts of interest. Newspaper coverage of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> clinical trials was more negative than for pharmaceutical trials; a result only partly explained by the greater proportion of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> clinical trials reporting negative results (P = 0. 0201; χ 2 = 7. 8129; degrees of freedom = 2). Errors of omission were common in newspaper coverage, with little reporting of dose, sample size, location, and duration of the trial, methods, trial funding, and conflicts of interest. There was an under-reporting of risks, especially for <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies.</b> Conclusion Our finding of negative coverage of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> trials is contrary to the positive trends in most published research based primarily on anecdotal accounts. Our results highlight how media coverage is not providing the public with the information necessary to make informed decisions about medical treatments. Most concerning is the lack of disclosure of trial funding and conflicts of interest that could influence the outcome or reporting of trial results. This lack of reporting may impact the medical research community, which has the most to lose by way of public trust and respect. </p...|$|R

Two intervals of eyes-closed resting EEG data were obtained individually before and after each administration. Results showed that only the <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> but not the saline solution induced elevation in cordance, an index correlated with cerebral perfusion, in the anterior brain region. In addition, the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as examined by the LORETA analysis, was also increased after the application of the <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> but not saline solution.

The {{aim of this}} study was to identify the commonly used <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> and their preparations in Sri Lankan patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 220 diabetic patients using <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> for perceived glyceamic benefit. Results: All the patients used their regular conventional medications together with <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies.</b> The most commonly used medication was metformin (91. 4 %). Ivy gourd (Coccinia grandis) was the most commonly used <b>herbal</b> <b>remedy</b> (32 %), followed by Crepe ginger (Costus speciosus) (25 %) and Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) (20 %). <b>Herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> used less frequently were Finger millet (Eleusine corocana) (5 %), Anguna leaves (Wattakaka volubilis) (5 %), Goat weed (Scoparia dulcis) (4 %), Selacia reticulata (4 %), Fenugreek (Trigonella Foenum Graecum) (3 %) and Tree turmeric (Coscinium fenestratum) (0. 5 %). None of the patients used commercially available over-the-counter herbal products. The common preparations were salads (72. 8 %), curries (12. 8 %), herbal tea (6 %) and herbal porridges (6 %).

40|$|Traditional Chinese {{medicine}} (TCM) {{has been}} a major part of healthcare in China, and has extensively affected medicine and healthcare in surrounding countries {{over a long period of}} time. In the fight against cancer, certain anticancer remedies using herbs or herbal formulas derived from TCM have been developed for the management of malignancies. Furthermore, there are clinical trials registered for the use of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> in cancer management. Herbal medicine has been used as part of combined therapies to reduce the side‑effects of chemotherapy, including bone marrow suppression, nausea and vomiting. <b>Herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> have also been used as chemopreventive therapies to treat precancerous conditions in order to reduce the incidence of cancer in high‑risk populations.

To retrieve relevant data, the authors have searched through computer-based literatures by full text search in Medline (via Pubmed), ScienceDirect, Current Contents Connect (ISI), Cochrance Library, CINAHL (EBSCO), CrossRef Search and Embase (all from inception to May 2010). Many herbal compounds undergo Phase I and/or Phase II metabolism in vivo, with cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) playing a major role. Some herbal ingredients are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) which is highly expressed in the intestine, liver, brain and kidney. As such, the activities of these drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters are determining factors for the in vivo bioavailability, disposition and distribution of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies.</b> There are increasing pharmacokinetic studies of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies,</b> but these studies are mainly focused on a small number of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> including St John 2 ̆ 7 s wort, milk thistle, sculcap, curcumin, echinacea, ginseng, ginkgo, and ginger. The pharmacokinetic data of a small number of purified herbal ingredients, including anthocyanins, berberine, catechins, curcumin, lutein and quercetin, are available. For the majority of <b>herbal</b> <b>remedies</b> used in folk medicines, data on their disposition and biological fate in humans are lacking or in paucity. For a herbal medicine, the pharmacological effect is achieved when the bioactive agents or the metabolites reach and sustain proper levels at their sites of action.
