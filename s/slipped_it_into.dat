5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{created their}} first chance inside 24 seconds, when Ljungberg put Henry clear down the {{right-hand}} side. The striker used his pace {{to get the}} better of Lundekvam, only to have his shot blocked by goalkeeper Antti Niemi. Bergkamp's goal effort in the eighth minute was cleared off the line by full back Chris Baird, after Niemi fumbled Henry's initial shot. Southampton fashioned their first opportunity in the 15th minute through a high cross; in spite of unsettling the Arsenal defence, the unmarked Svensson volleyed over the bar. Baird moments after won the ball in midfield and curled a shot that left Seaman [...] "scrambling across his goal to save". Seven minutes before the break, Arsenal went into the lead. Henry, receiving the ball from Parlour, <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Bergkamp down the right. He in turn fed the ball to Ljungberg, whose shot was blocked. The ball rebounded in the direction of Pirès, who needed one touch to set himself and another to fire at the near post, despite Niemi getting a hand. Arsenal missed further chances to extend their lead when a cross from the right by Henry was shot over the bar by Pirès and from the same area, Bergkamp's [...] "cross-cum-shot" [...] was missed by Ljungberg.|$|E
2500|$|Along with Beatles bandmate John Lennon {{and their}} wives, George Harrison first took the hallucinogenic drug Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in April 1965, when a dentist friend <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> their after-dinner coffee. The {{heightened}} perception {{induced by the}} hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles, notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt {{as a result of}} first taking the drug: [...] "I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, and I could see him in every blade of grass. It was like gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours. It changed me, {{and there was no way}} back to what I was before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And here is {{a bottle}} of ink," [...] the {{grateful}} financier said, <b>slipping</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the other's pocket; [...] "it is all that we have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{book will}} cut no figure in this matter," [...] replied the official, <b>slipping</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his coat pocket; [...] "all the entries in it were {{made before the}} writer's death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Uncle Peter!" [...] cried Mary Louise, distressed; but Peter was obdurate and Bub never whimpered. He {{even managed}} to close his knife, between kicks, and <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his {{trousers}} pocket.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he closed}} the book, <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his pocket and with another low bow walked away.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} studied it very {{carefully}} before he <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the inner {{pocket of his}} coat.|$|E
60|$|He <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his waistcoat-pocket. He {{would take}} it down with him, and pay Hargate {{directly}} after dinner.|$|E
50|$|The {{depressant}} GHB (also used by assailants as a {{date rape}} drug, {{in which case}} they <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a victim's drink) is intentionally taken by some users as a party drug and club drug.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{the girl}} {{found that the}} door was {{equipped}} with a heavy wooden bar upon the inside, and after several efforts the combined strength of the two enabled them to <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> place, {{the first time in}} twenty years.|$|R
60|$|Half an hour later, Cynthia gave Mr. Bixby the {{envelope}} as he unhitched his horse; and so deftly did Bijah <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his pocket, {{that he must}} certainly have misjudged its contents. None of the loungers at Ephraim's remarked the transaction.|$|R
60|$|As the box entered Carl’s hands he {{flattened}} it, and, as he whirled around, he <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> {{the bosom}} of his costume.|$|E
60|$|Higgs took up {{the ring}} {{and looked at it}} again; then, as though in a fit of abstraction, <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his {{waistcoat}} pocket.|$|E
60|$|Cesare {{folded the}} letter and <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the breast of his doublet. From his girdle he took a second paper. He turned from Ramiro.|$|E
50|$|He {{approaches}} Emsworth {{and offers}} him a bribe, which Emsworth innocently confuses {{with an offer}} to buy his encyclopaedias. He takes the man's $500, and quietly <b>slips</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Mrs Ed's handbag while she sleeps, resolving {{to put a stop}} to his son's arrogance right away.|$|R
60|$|He {{handed a}} little packet across to Rochester, who <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> {{carelessly}} <b>into</b> his pocket.|$|R
5000|$|Next, Bugs saws {{a circle}} around Rocky's chair, only letting him see the tool near the end. Bugs then <b>slips</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Mugsy's hands and hides, while Rocky shoots wildly and confronts Mugsy with some hitting while screaming, [...] "I don't know how ya's done it, but I know ya's done it!!!".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--pretty little thing! I {{picked it}} up in Holland;" [...] {{as though he had}} found it by the roadside, and <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his {{umbrella}} when nobody was looking! ...|$|E
60|$|ALICK [wagging {{his head}} sadly]. I {{had to tell}} her. And then I--I-- bought her a {{sealskin}} muff, and I just <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> her hands and came away.|$|E
60|$|Thus ordered, the man {{who held}} the diamond pin <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his pocket. Then he raised his heavy cane and started to do as bidden when Jerry rushed at him.|$|E
6000|$|She {{refused to}} {{recognize}} anything but meaningless badinage in his words. [...] "Oh, as a soldier, yes!--you {{must be used}} to obeying orders." [...] He did not reply, and she added, releasing her hand and <b>slipping</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his arm, [...] "I am tired now; will you {{take me back to}} the princess?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{guard was}} {{pressing}} his {{face against the}} bars, {{to look in the}} direction indicated, and Francis, who was already standing on his left leg, with the right raised so as to give freedom to the hand next to the man, had no difficulty in drawing the stiletto from its sheath, and <b>slipping</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his trousers.|$|R
60|$|As {{the ruler}} of Ptarth, {{followed}} by his courtiers, descended from the landing-stage above the palace, the servants dropped into their places {{in the rear of}} their royal or noble masters, and behind the others one lingered to the last. Then quickly stooping he snatched the sandal from his right foot, <b>slipping</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his pocket-pouch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Police!" [...] said Miss Pilbeam, in {{a thrilling}} whisper. The skipper {{stepped into the}} {{cupboard}} without further parley, and the girl, turning the key, <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> her pocket and sped downstairs.|$|E
60|$|Harper {{picked up}} {{what was left}} of the bread, and with {{characteristic}} caution <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his pocket. “It may come in handy. I’ve been out with the Sin Verguenza before,” he said.|$|E
60|$|Therefore, when--as if in placid {{defiance}} of Pompadour's challenge--Lord Eglinton handed the Duke of Cumberland's letter silently {{back to the}} King, the latter <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his pocket with a gesture of ostentatious indifference.|$|E
60|$|When {{the bell}} rang they were glad to drop the lessons and fall upon their breakfast with the {{appetite}} of wolves, especially Jack, who sequestered oatmeal and milk with such rapidity that {{one would have thought}} he had a leathern bag hidden somewhere to <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> <b>into,</b> like his famous namesake when he breakfasted with the giant.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think in}} future {{that you need}} use so large a wad, Paolo; half that size will be ample; {{and of course you}} need only <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> your mouth when we are going through a village, or meet a party likely to {{question}} us. As to your cheek, it will be days before that fiery mark disappears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's an ugly {{thing to}} go to prison for," [...] he remarked, <b>slipping</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his pocket. [...] "It was a stupid thing to do, anyhow, you know. You couldn't have got away with it--unless," [...] he added, looking over the parapet as though struck with a sudden idea, [...] "unless you had a confederate below." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a clumsy, old-fashioned thing, but the Colonel saw {{the glint}} of a percussion-cap upon the nipple, and {{knew that it was}} loaded. He <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the inner pocket of his Norfolk jacket.|$|E
60|$|Lying {{back in his}} seat, he {{extended}} his arm over the table and pushed the watch away slightly. Captain Mitchell walked up with undisguised eagerness, put it to his ear, then <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his pocket coolly.|$|E
60|$|Then the bearers {{lifted the}} coffin and <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the platform-spring wagon, which was backed {{up to the}} door. The other teams loaded up, and the {{procession}} moved off, down the perilously muddy road toward the village burying-ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ah, smart, smart!' he cried, {{in a kind}} {{of ecstasy}} of delight. 'You are the very man for us. You are not to be talked over, and quite right, too. Now, here's a note for a hundred pounds, and if you think that we can do {{business}} you may just <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> your pocket as an advance upon your salary.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{give it to}} him," [...] mumbled Jorgenson {{as though}} {{pursuing}} a mere fixed idea. [...] "Just <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> quietly <b>into</b> his hand. He will understand." ...|$|R
50|$|At dinner, a truly awful meal {{is served}} and Lord Adalbert and Lady Eugenia bicker constantly. Monty has brought along poison, {{intending}} to <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Lord Adalbert’s food, but cannot do so unnoticed (“Poison in My Pocket (Reprise)”). Miss Shingle, who initially brought Monty {{the news of}} his true lineage, appears; {{it turns out that}} she’s been employed as a servant by the D’Ysquiths for 39 years.|$|R
