5|$|An {{elite and}} well trained force of bodyguards known as Garudas {{protected}} {{the members of}} the royal family at all times. These servants moved closely yet inconspicuously by the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> master, their loyalty being so complete that they committed suicide after his death. Hero stones (virgal) erected in memory of these bodyguards are called Garuda pillars. The Garuda pillar at the Hoysaleswara temple in Halebidu was erected in honor of Kuvara Lakshma, a minister and bodyguard of King Veera Ballala II.|$|E
5|$|In Nuenen, Van Gogh {{focused on}} {{painting}} and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined {{him on his}} forays; {{she fell in love}} and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|The owls {{shown are}} recognizable, but not sculpted naturalistically: {{the shape of}} the beak, the length of the legs, and details of plumage deviate from those of the owls that are {{indigenous}} to the region. Their plumage is colored like the deity's wings in red, black and white; it is bilaterally similar but not perfectly symmetrical. Both owls have one more feather on the right-hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> plumage than on the left-hand side. The legs, feet and talons are red.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most animals, {{porpoises}} are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> brain at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached to the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers {{with which they are}} able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E

From 5 April Jews {{over the age of}} six had to wear a 10x10cm (3.8x3.8in) yellow badge on the upper-left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> coats or jackets. Jews had to declare the value of their property, and were forbidden from moving home, travelling, owning cars or radios, listening to foreign radio stations, or using the telephone. Jewish authors could no longer be published, their books were removed from libraries, and Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked.|$|E
5|$|The 1888–89 New Zealand Native {{football}} team played 107 rugby union matches during their 14-month {{tour of the}} British Isles, Australia, and New Zealand. The tour was the longest in rugby history, and the first by a New Zealand team to Europe. The team was privately organised by Joe Warbrick, and was originally intended to contain only Māori players. Several non-Māori {{and a number of}} non-New Zealand-born players were eventually recruited to strengthen the <b>side.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>their</b> rugby matches, they won 78, lost 23, and drew 6. The team played three internationals: a heavy loss to England, a win over Ireland, and a narrow loss to Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{suborder}} Cryptobranchoidea {{contains the}} primitive salamanders. A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found, {{but there are}} only three living species, the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), the Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) and the hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) from North America. These large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded. A unique feature is their ability to feed by suction, depressing either the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lower jaw or the right. The males excavate nests, persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them, and guard them. As well as breathing with lungs, they respire through the many folds in their thin skin, which has capillaries close to the surface.|$|E

5|$|For its fiftieth anniversary, Fantasia {{returned}} to 550 theaters nationwide on October 5, 1990, in its traditional 1946 version including the live action scenes with Taylor {{and the original}} Stokowski score. The film underwent a two-year restoration process which began after a six-month search {{to piece together the}} original negatives that had been in storage since 1946. This marked the first time since then that a release of the film had been processed from the original and not from a copy. Each of its 535,680 frames were restored at YCM Laboratories, and an untouched print from 1951 was used for guidance on color and tone. Theaters were required to have specific stereo equipment installed, and to present the film in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio with black borders on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> screens. The Stokowski soundtrack was digitally remastered using the 1955 magnetic soundtrack, with an estimated three thousand pops and hisses being removed in the process. The 1990 reissue of Fantasia went on to gross $25 million domestically.|$|E
5|$|It {{was normal}} in fleet {{actions of the}} 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately, exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away, often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy. In contrast, Howe was {{counting}} on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with {{the advantage of the}} weather gage to attack the French directly, driving through their line. However, this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters; each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent's force (as Rodney had done at the Battle of the Saintes 12years earlier). Instead, Howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the French line, intending to breach it at every point and rake the French ships at both bow and stern. The British captains would then pull up on the leeward <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> opposite numbers, cutting them off from their retreat downwind, and engage them directly, hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|On the 39th lap, Castroneves overtook Bräck {{around the}} outside at turn three and moved into third place, and Fernández got ahead of Bräck {{around the outside}} at the same corner two laps later. Takagi drove {{to the inside of}} the third turn {{underneath}} Servià, and both drivers made contact with the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cars; Servià became briefly airborne and heavily damaged the left side of his car when he hit the outside wall which caused the fifth caution. Servià was unhurt but Takagi managed to continue without any apparent damage. The race resumed on lap 45 with de Ferran leading Tagliani. Castroneves hit the rear-end of Tagliani's car on the following lap but both drivers continued without damage. The sixth caution was shown on the 49th lap when Takagi hit the right-rear wheel of Moreno's car in the turn three right-hand corner. Moreno was sent into a spin while Takagi's suspension had broke and retired from the event. de Ferran and Tagliani made pit stops for fuel and tires during the caution and could reach the end of the race without a second pit stop. De Ferran and Tagliani rejoined in 14th and 15th places.|$|E

5|$|The Bannatyne {{manuscript}} {{states that}} the flag was unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay in 1480. The manuscript related that during the battle, the clan's chief, William Dubh (historically lived c.1415–1480), was slain, and in consequence his clan began to lose heart. A priest then ordered the flag's bearer, Murcha Breac, to unfurl the Fairy Flag to rally the clan. Up until this point, the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan were on the opposing <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> kinsmen, the MacLeods of Lewis. However, once the MacLeods of Lewis noticed that the flag had been unfurled, they switched sides to join forces with their kinsmen. Unfortunately for both MacLeod clans, {{the outcome of the}} battle had already been determined and they were on the losing side. Among the vast numbers of MacLeods slain were Murcha Breac and the twelve guardians of the flag. William Dubh is buried on the island of Iona with his predecessors, and the body of Murcha Breac is placed within the same tomb. The manuscript states that this was the greatest honour which could be bestowed upon his remains. R.C. MacLeod suggested that the MacLeod effigy within Iona Abbey may mark the burial of the first chiefs of the clan, as well as William Dubh, and the mentioned standard bearer. William Dubh is thought to have been the last MacLeod chief buried on Iona; his son, Alasdair Crotach (1450–1547), was buried in St Clements Church, on Harris.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern small footed bat {{is between}} 65 and 95millimeters in length, has a {{wingspan}} of 210 to 250millimeters, and weighs between 4 and 8grams. The bat {{got its name}} from its abnormally small hind feet, which are only 7 to 8 millimeters long. The fur on the dorsal <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> body is dark at the roots, and fades to a light brown at the tips, which gives the bats a signature shiny, yellow-brown appearance. The fur on the dorsal {{side of the body}} is a dull gray color, which is believed to help camouflage themselves in their hibernacula. The defining characteristic of this bat is its face-mask, which is completely black. They also have black ears, wings and interfemoral membrane, (the membrane between the legs and tail). Like all bats, the Eastern small-footed bat has a patagium that connects the body to the forelimbs and tail, allowing the animal to fly. Their head is very flat and short, with a forehead that slopes gradually away from the rostrum, a feature that is unique to other individuals in the Myotis species. They have erect ears, which are very broad at the base and a short flat nose. They have a keeled calcar (protruding cartridge on the hind legs to support the interfemoral membrane) as well as a pointed tragus Their tail is between 25-45 millimeters in length and protrudes past their interfemoral membrane, and they have a dental formula of 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of commencement, Alumni Hall is {{outfitted}} with patriotic red white and blue banners and flags. Commencement exercises begin each year at 1:50 pm {{as members of the}} senior class gather in the Stoutenburg Gymnasium and process through the campus, crossing by the Cushing Center and Hilary Hall and arriving at Alumni Hall for the commencement ceremony. The graduating class processes onto the quad to the designated seating area directly in front of Alumni Hall as a hired brass ensemble plays the Pomp and Circumstance March. If the weather is inclement, commencement takes place in the Thomas F. Sullivan Arena. The academic processional of the College's Mace, color guard, graduands, members of the monastic community, and the faculty can take over twenty minutes. The national anthem is performed by a student or students selected. The performer is usually a member of the Saint Anselm College Choir. Next, a student selected by the administration delivers the coveted student address that he/she submitted for consideration. This is followed by the College President's address. The faculty award of the year from the Saint Anselm College Chapter of the American Association of University Professors is presented to a deserving faculty member. The student award for service and citizenship is presented to a community service-minded senior in recognition for an outstanding community project. This award is not given every year, only when there is consensus among administration that a particular student is deserving. Honorary doctorates are then conferred among selected honorary degree recipients. After the keynote address by one of the honorary degree recipients, the graduates are awarded their degrees of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science. After the benediction, graduates flip their graduation tassel to the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cap and process out to the recessional song as the Abbey bells resound throughout campus. Finally, family and friends meet with the new graduates to take photographs.|$|E
