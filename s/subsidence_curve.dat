40|$|Summary. The {{nature of}} {{subsidence}} near the ridge {{crest of the}} intermediate and fast spreading mid-ocean ridges of the Indian and Pacific Oceans is investigated using surface-ship bathymetry and magnetics profiles. The ridge {{can be divided into}} discrete sections, apparently bounded by distinct structural features such as major fracture zones, in which ba'thymetry plotted against crustal age forms a well-defined envelope with a width roughly the amplitude of the local bathymetry. The averaged bathymetry in all of the regions studied follows closely a square root of age <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve</b> which in most regions has a subsidence coefficient, C 1, in the range of 340 - 390 m Myr-'l 2. The best fitting <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve,</b> however, never reproduces the amplitude of the axial topographic high. The most notable region displaying unusual behaviour is the East Pacific Rise between 9 "s and 22 "s. In this region, the western flank of the ridge is subsiding at 200 - 225 m Myr-'/ ' while the eastern flank is subsiding at 'normal ' rates of 350 - 400 m Myr-'/ 2.

40|$|The Adana Basin of {{southern}} Turkey, {{situated at the}} SE margin of the Central Anatolian Plateau (CAP) is ideally located to record Neogene topographic and tectonic changes in the easternmost Mediterranean realm. We correlate 34 seismic profiles with corresponding exposed units in the Adana Basin. The time-depth conversion of the interpreted seismic profiles allows us to reconstruct the <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve</b> of the Adana Basin and to outline the occurrence of a major increase in both subsidence and sedimentation rates at 5. 45 – 5. 33 Ma, leading to the deposition of almost 1500 km 3 of conglomerates and marls. Our provenance analysis of the conglomerates reveals {{that most of the}} sediment is derived from and north of the SE margin of the CAP. A comparison of these results with the composition of recent conglomerates and the present drainage basins indicates major changes between late Messinian and present-day source areas. We suggest that these changes in source areas result of uplift and ensuing erosion of the SE margin of the plateau. This hypothesis is corroborated by the comparison of the Adana Basin <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve</b> with the <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve</b> of the Mut Basin, a mainly Neogene basin located on top of the CAP southern margin, showing that the Adana Basin subsidence event is coeval with an uplift episode of the plateau southern margin. The collection of several fault measurements in the Adana region show different deformation styles for the NW and SE margins of the Adana Basin. The weakly seismic NW portion of the basin is characterized by extensional and transtensional structures cutting Neogene deposits, likely accomodating the differential uplift occurring between the basin and the SE margin of the plateau. We interpret the tectonic evolution of the southern flank of the Anatolian Plateau and the coeval subsidence and sedimentation in the Adana Basin to be related to deep lithospheric processes, particularly lithospheric delamination and slab break-off...|$|E

40|$|Several {{sedimentary}} basins in Africa {{are classified}} as intracratonic basins, but no conclusive formation mechanism has been identified for these basin types. Tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> may help in unraveling formation mechanisms or identify tectonic forcing for these basins. This thesis presents and analyses basin <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> for basins {{in the interior of}} Africa and near its passive margins. A backstripping program has been written to solve the backstripping equations needed to make the tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> from the well data. Results of backstripping 77 wells from 13 basins in Africa are presented. The results are interpreted to identify phases of fast and slow tectonic subsidence and it is investigated whether these can be related to plate tectonic events from the Cambrian to the present. The tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> of the Ghadames, Illizi, Timimoun, Algeria Regional, Murzuq, Al Kufrah, Iullemmeden, (Upper Egypt), Taoudeni and Zaire basins largely characterize intracratonic basins, Chad and partly Upper Egypt resemble rift basins, and Mozambique and Tanzania Coastal show strong similarity to passive margin basins. The results of the correlations show that the tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> of the Tanzania Coastal and Mozambique passive margin basins can be correlated to the Africa-Antarctica break-up initiated at 176 Ma (Tanzania Coastal Basin) and to the India-Madagascar break-up at 90 Ma (Mozambique Basin). Many of the North African intracratonic basins show indications that can be correlated to tectonic events occurring at the margins of Africa, i. e. the Hercynian Unconformity and Alpine events. But there are no very clear signals of how far into the plate interior these events have affected the basins. </p...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  4 a, the {{subsidence}} areas are becoming larger with the continuous advancing. The range {{and values of}} subsidence gradually increased, and then subjected to be stable without any abnormal phenomenon, which followed the general laws of mining subsidence. However, <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve</b> has its specific characteristics, when comparing {{with those in the}} mid-eastern China mining areas, such as Yanzhou mining area (Wu et al. 2010), which are: (1) the uniform subsidence areas were relatively larger in subsidence basin and the trough margins was more sharp. There was an obvious difference of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve,</b> which showed more convergence at the two ends of open-off cut, leading to the extent of the trough towards the goaf. The subsidence value of 10  mm was taken as the boundary of the affected mining areas, and the boundary was approximately 1.0 H (H: the average mining depth, meter) away to the open-off cut. (2) when the working face was approximately 1.5 H away to the observation points, the subsidence value reached the peak, and then maintained stable. During this period, the affected time lasted 27  days where around the observation points. The reason is that with the increasing advancing speed, the time of surface deformation continuously decreased, which speed up the recovery process of surface ground. As Fig.  4 b shows, the process of surface deformation and the shape of the distribution in the transverse direction followed those in the longitudinal direction basically. Because the subsidence was affected by the adjacent old goaf, the subsidence values and range on the side of old goaf was larger, it is safe to indicate that multi-disturbance can result in the increase of subsidence values and range. In additional, inclination deformation values concentrated at {{the two sides of the}} mining boundary due to high-intensive mining, while inclination deformation outside the mining boundary decreased sharply, nevertheless, curvature deformation followed the general laws of mining subsidence.|$|E
40|$|Widely {{accepted}} basin forming {{mechanisms are}} limited to flexure of the lithosphere, and lithospheric stretching followed by cooling and thermal subsidence. Neither of these mechanisms works {{for a group of}} large basins, sometimes known as “intracontinental sags”. In this paper we investigate cooling and thickening of initially thin lithosphere as a basin forming mechanism, by a combination of forward modelling and a backstripping study of two Palaeozoic North African basins: Ghadames and Al Kufrah. These are two of a family of basins, once unified, which lie over the largely accretionary crust of North Africa and Arabia. Such accretionary crust tends to be juvenile, consisting of amalgamated island arcs, accretionary prisms and melanges, and typically has near-normal crustal thicknesses but initially thin mantle lithosphere. Post-accretion subsidence is modelled using a plate cooling model similar to cooling models for oceanic lithosphere. The crustal composition and thickness used in the models are varied around average values of accretionary crust to represent likely heterogeneity. The model allows the lithosphere to thicken as it cools and calculates the resulting isostatic subsidence. Water-loaded tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> from these forward models are compared to tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> produced from backstripped wells from Al Kufrah and Ghadames Basins. A good match between the <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> for the forward model and backstripping is produced when the best estimates for the crustal structure, composition and the present day thickness of the lithosphere for North Africa are used as inputs for the forward model. The model produces sediment loaded basins of 2 – 7 km thickness for the various crustal assemblies over ~ 250 Myr. This shows that lithospheric cooling provides a viable method for producing large basins with prolonged subsidence, without the need for initial extension, provided the condition of initially thin mantle lithosphere is met...|$|R
40|$|Seven tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves,</b> {{based on}} outcrop data, have been {{calculated}} {{in order to}} constrain the geodynamic evolution of the Permian-Mesozoic sedimentary succession (up to 10 km thick) of the Central Southern Alps basin (Italy). The analysis of the tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves,</b> covering a time span of about 200 Ma, allowed us to quantify the subsidence rates, to document the activity of syndepositional fault systems and calculate their slip rates. Different stages, in terms of duration and magnitude of subsidence-uplift trends, {{have been identified in}} the evolution of the basin. The fault activity, reconstructed by comparing <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> from adjacent sectors, resulted as highly variable both temporally and spatially. Strike-slip tectonics was coeval to Permian sedimentation, as suggested by the strong differences in the subsidence rates in the sections. The evolution and subsidence rates suggest a continental shelf deposition from Early Triassic to Carnian, when subsidence came to a stop. A rapid resumption of subsidence is observed from the Norian, with a subsidence pulse in the Late Norian, followed by the regional uplift, in the Late Rhaetian. The following Early Jurassic subsidence is characterized by tectonic subsidence similar to that of the Norian. The Norian and Early Jurassic pulses were characterized by the highest slip rates along growth faults and are identified as two distinct tectonic events. The Norian-Rhaetian event is tentatively related to transtensional tectonics whereas the Early Jurassic event is related to crustal extension. The Early Jurassic subsidence records a shift in space an time of the beginning of the extensional stage, from Late Hettangian to the east to Late Pliensbachian-Toarcian to the west. From the Toarcian to the Aptian, the curves are compatible with regional thermal subsidence, later followed (Albian-Cenomanian) by uplift pulses in a retrobelt foreland basin (from Cenomanian onward) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the structural and stratigraphic evolution of the Southern Permian Basin during latest Carboniferous to Early Jurassic times, supported by quantitative subsidence analyses and forward basin modelling for 25 wells, leads us to modify the conventional model for the Rotliegend-Zechstein development of this basin. The Late Permian-Early Jurassic tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> are typical for a Permian to Early Triassic extensional stage that is followed by thermal subsidence. However, a purely extensional model is extremely problematic because active faulting during this time is 'minor' and generally hard to document. Using inverse techniques to model the <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves,</b> we quantitatively show that a significant component of Late Permian and Triassic tectonic subsidence {{can be explained by}} thermal relaxation of Early Permian lithospheric thinning, and by delayed infilling of paleo-topographic depressions that developed during the Early Permian. In this interpretation, Stephanian-Autunian wrenching resulted in thermal destabilisation of the lithosphere, deep fracturing of the crust, disruption and erosion of its sedimentary cover and regional uplift of the area of the future Southern Permian Basin. Upon termination of wrench tectonics and associated volcanism, {{towards the end of the}} Autunian, the Southern Permian Basin began to subside in response to thermal contraction of the lithosphere. The evolving basin was isolated from the World oceans and had subsided possibly up to some 700 m below their level at the beginning of Upper Rotliegend sedimentation. After catastrophic flooding of this paleotopographic depression at the beginning of the Zechstein, changing sea level, sedimentation and subsidence rates remained essentially in balance. Although the effects of Triassic rifting overprinted parts of the Southern Permian Basin, its overall subsidence pattern persisted well into the Jurassic. In contrast to the remainder of the Southern Permian Basin, Permian and Triassic crustal extension contributed significantly to the subsidence of the Polish Trough. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The Williston Basin {{is one of}} {{a number}} of North American intracratonic basins whose {{subsidence}} is poorly understood. The Basin is circular in shape and contains nearly 5 km of preserved sedimentary rocks at its center; ranging from Cambrian to Tertiary in age. The Basin's subsidence is investigated quantitatively using the backstripping method in order to gain a better understanding of its origin. Data from 24 oil exploration wells located in central and northwest portions of the basin were correlated and used in the study. A computer program called UNPAK was developed to perform the backstripping analysis. Tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> were calculated to evaluate episodic subsidence models and extrapolated across unconformities to evaluate continuous subsidence models. Extrapolated tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> near the center of the basin display a relatively constant subsidence through the Paleozoic, at a rate of slightly less than 1 cm ka- 1, and then decrease to the present-day. Improbable behavior of <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> was used to constrain the magnitude of the eustatic models used in the backstripping calculations. A Cambro-Ordovician first-order rise of between 100 and 160 m, and a Cretaceous first-order rise of approximately 150 m above present-day sea level are consistent with the stratigraphic record in the Basin. No bathymetric corrections were used in the backstripping calculations, however, results from this study indicate water depth during deposition of the Bakken Formation was probably in the range of 50 to 100 m. Calculated point-loads necessary to account for the deflection of the Basin (using an elastic plate model) ranged from 2. 5 x 1018 N to 2. 9 x 1018 N, for an episodic model. If a continuous subsidence model was invoked, then a load of between 5. 3 x 1018 N and 6. 5 x 1018 N is required to account for the deflection of the Basin. Of the previously proposed models to account for the basin's subsidence, continuous subsidence models were favored. A phase-change model, involving progressive metamorphic reactions of gabbro to eclogite, seemed the most likely of these models. Evidence in favor of the continuous subsidence models includes: an excellent fit of the extrapolated tectonic subsidence data to a smooth curve (implying a single subsidence mechanism); an axis of sedimentation which shifted in a circular fashion around a relatively stationary center of deposition; very close correspondence between unconformities in the basin and falls in second-order relative changes in sea level from published curves; and evidence for uplift and erosion of the surrounding cratonic arches in between depositional cycles. Future acceptance of a continuous subsidence model to explain the Williston Basin's subsidence will ultimately depend upon the outcome of the debate surrounding the existence and origin of short-term eustatic changes...|$|R

In this region, the western flank of the ridge is subsiding at 200 – 225 m Myr− 1 / 2 while the eastern flank is subsiding at ‘normal’ rates of 350 – 400 m Myr− 1 / 2. Other anomalous areas include the region between the Easter Island hot spot and the Chile Rise triple junction in which the ridge crest is shallow and which is subsiding at rates of about 290 m Myr− 1 / 2, and the region east of the Australia-Antarctic Discordance in which the northern flank is subsiding at 440 m Myr− 1 / 2. This area may also be subsiding asymmetrically although there is not much data from the southern flank. The asymmetric subsidence in the 9 °S- 22 °S region of the East Pacific Rise begins immediately at the ridge crest and the low subsidence rates on the west flank continue to at least 12 Myr old crust. Oligocene-aged crust on the western flank is subsiding at more normal rates, but is 500 m shallow with respect both to the world-wide average and to the conjugate crust on the eastern flank. The simplest model to explain these observations is that the western flank is underlain by a hotter mantle, perhaps as the result of upwelling resulting from the large-scale return circulation from the trenches. Depending on the depth of compensation, the observed asymmetry could result from a lateral temperature gradient of 0. 05 – 0. 10 °C km− 1 and a total lateral temperature variation of under 100 °C...|$|E

The underlying sediments are volcaniclastic sandstones {{with a large}} proportion of shallow-water carbonate debris; sedimentary structures including complete Bouma sequences, cross-laminae, and scouring are common.

40|$|In {{the area}} of the Cenozoic Rhine rift system, crustal and lithospheric {{thicknesses}} range between 24 and 35 km, and 60 and 120 km, respectively. This rift system transects the deeply truncated Variscan Orogen and superimposed Permo-Carboniferous wrench-induced troughs, and Late Permian and Mesozoic thermal sag basins. At the time of its Westphlian consolidation, the Variscan Orogen was probably characterized by 45 - 60 km deep-crustal roots that were associated with its Rheno-Hercynian Saxo-Thuringian, Saxo-Thuringian-Bohemian and Bohemian-Moldanubian sutures, all of which are transected by the Cenozoic Rhine rift system. During the Stephanian Early Permian wrench-induced disruption of the Variscan Orogen, subducted lithospheric slabs were detached causing upwelling of hot mantle material. During the resulting thermal surge, partial delamination and/or thermal thinning of the continental mantle-lithosphere induced regional uplift. At the same time the Variscan orogenic roots were destroyed and crustal thicknesses reduced to 28 - 35 km in response to the combined effects of mantle-derived melts interacting with the lower crust, regional erosional unroofing of the crust and, on a more local scale, by its mechanical stretching. Towards the end of the Early Permian, the potential temperature of the asthenosphere returned to ambient levels. With this, regional, long-term thermal subsidence of the lithosphere commenced, controlling {{the development of a new}} system of Late Permian and Mesozoic thermal sag basins. However, the evolution of these basins was repeatedly overprinted by minor short-term subsidence accelerations that reflect the build-up of far-field stresses related to rifting in the Tethyan and Atlantic domains. Comparison of observed and modelled <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> suggests that in {{the area of}} the Rhine rift system the lithosphere had equilibrated with the asthenosphere at the end of the Cretaceous at depths of 100 - 120 km, before it became thermally destabilized again by Cenozoic rifting and plume-related magmatism. Modelled <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> indicate that by the end of Early Permian times the thermal thickness of the remnant mantle lithosphere ranged between 10 and 50 km in areas that were later incorporated into Mesozoic thermal sag basins; this corresponds to mid-Permian thermal lithosphere thicknesses of 40 - 80 km. © The Geological Society of London 2004...|$|R
40|$|The {{dominance}} of volcanic processes {{and the importance}} of vertical tectonics in the geological evolution of the Pacific Basin has been recognised since the time of Charles Darwin. Data gathered on several legs of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and numerous marine expeditions in the past decade have confirmed Menard's postulate that the Pacific Basin was the scene of volcanism on an enormous scale in Mesozoic time. Widespread mid-plate volcanism between ∼ 110 and 70 m. y. B. P. characterised the area bounded by the Line Islands, the Mid-Pacific Mountains and the Nauru Basin-Marshall Islands. Heating of the Pacific lithospheric plate during this period of volcanism resulted in regional uplift and the bathymetric evolution of the area diverged significantly from a "normal" Parsons-Sclater <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve.</b> The Farallon plate, now almost entirely subducted, was also the scene of mid-plate volcanism that produced such features as the Nicoya Plateau now found as an allochthonous ophiolitic terrain landward of the middle America trench. Large, benthonic, reef-associated foraminifera comprising a pseudorbitoid fauna, hitherto considered to be largely restricted to Central America, have now been additionally recorded from DSDP Sites 165, 315 and 316 in the Line Islands, Site 462 in the Nauru Basin, and in New Guinea. The distribution of this fauna, of Campanian/Maastrichtian age, is interpreted as indicating "stepping stone" connections (aseismic ridges, plateaus and seamounts) between the Caribbean, Farallon, and Pacific plates 70 - 80 m. y. B. P. Similarities between the geology of the Nauru Basin and the Caribbean Ocean crust reinforce the interpretation of the latter as a former part of the Farallon plate. Estimates of the sea-level and continental freeboard change caused by the thermally induced uplift of the Pacific and Farallon plates, as well as substantial areas in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean Basins, indicate that such shallowing of the sea floor could have been the major factor in causing global Cretaceous transgressions. © 1981...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} the Jurassic-Eocene sedimentary record of northwestern Montana and the geometry and kinematics of the thrust belt, {{in order to develop}} a unifying geodynamic-stratigraphic model to explain the evolution of the Cordilleran retroarc of this region. Provenance and subsidence analyses suggest the onset of a foreland basin system by Middle Jurassic time. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons and detrital modes of sandstones indicate provenance from accreted terranes and deformed miogeoclinal rocks. Subsidence commenced at ∼ 170 Ma and followed a sigmoidal pattern characteristic of foreland basin systems. Jurassic deposits of the Ellis Group and Morrison Formation accumulated in a back-bulge depozone. A regional unconformity/paleosol zone separates the Morrison from Cretaceous deposits. This unconformity was possible result of forebulge migration, decreased dynamic subsidence, and eustatic sea level fall. The late Barremian(?) -early Albian Kootenai Formation is the first unit in the foreland that consistently thickens westward. The <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve</b> at this time begins to show a convex-upward pattern characteristic of foredeeps. The location of thrust belt structures during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous is uncertain, but provenance information indicates exhumation of the Intermontane and Omineca belts, and deformation of miogeocline strata, possibly on {{the western part of the}} Purcell anticlinorium. By Albian time, the thrust belt had propagated to the east and incorporated Proterozoic rocks of the Belt Supergroup as indicated by provenance data in the Blackleaf Formation, and by cross-cutting relationships in thrust sheets involving Belt rocks. From Late Cretaceous to early Eocene time the retroarc developed a series of thrust systems including the Moyie, Snowshoe, Libby, Pinkham, Lewis-Eldorado-Steinbach-Hoadley, the Sawtooth Range and the foothills structures. The final stage in the evolution of the compressive retroarc system is recorded by the Paleocene-early Eocene Fort Union and Wasatch Formations, which are preserved in the distal foreland. A new ∼ 145 Km balanced cross-section indicates ∼ 130 km of shortening. Cross-cutting relationships, thermochronology and geochronology suggest that most shortening along the frontal part of the thrust belt occurred between the mid-Campanian to Ypresian (∼ 75 - 52 Ma), indicating a shortening rate of ∼ 5. 6 mm/y. Extensional orogenic collapse began during the middle Eocene...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{characteristics}} of sedimentary deposits in continental basins, especially those controlled by extension, {{are often used}} to infer global climatic changes. We question the relevance of such an approach because the stratigraphic pattern of those basins are mostly similar whatever their latitudes/paleolatitudes (i. e. their general climatic conditions), namely the transition from (1) an ancestral drainage network to (2) deep lake with a dominance of black and grey shale deposits, (3) shallow oxic lake with a dominance of red pelites deposits and to eventually (4) a new drainage network. Such transitions observed in Late Palaeozoic continental basins throughout Laurasia and Gondwana are generally interpreted as evidence of global change from a wet climate to an arid climate. From the sedimentological and structural analysis of a Late Palaeozoic basin, the Graissessac-Lodève basin, {{in the south of}} the Variscan French Massif Central, we proposed a new tectono-stratigraphic sequence of this basin from the Late Carboniferous to the Early Trias. We estimate the paleo-area (from 295 - 450 km 2 to 880 - 1150 km 2) of the basin and we deduce a <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve</b> from the Late Carboniferous to the Late Permian (from 600 ± 200 m/My to 100 ± 10 m/My). We conclude that the Graissessac-Lodève basin stratigraphic pattern corresponds to a classical continental rift sequence controlled by tectonics. In order to assess a possible control of the stratigraphic sequence by the climate, we have reconstructed the paleo-depth of the lake with (1) the morphometric analysis of the wave ripples and (2) with an estimation of the lacustrine slope considering the tectonic origin of the lake. We find that the maximum lacustrine depth has evolved from a range of 80 - 300 m during the Late Carboniferous to 40 - 45 m during the Late Permian. From our estimates of the different configurations of the basin, we show that the volume of the water in the lake has remained nearly constant between 10 and 30 km 3, from the Late Carboniferous (300 My) to the Late Permian (250 My). Eventually, we conclude that the sedimentological indicators of shallowing and episodic drying observed from the Late Carboniferous to Late Permian in this basin, and probably in all the Pangea basins of the same type, are the consequence of the basin enlargement by tectonics and its sedimentary filling rather than climatic change...|$|E
40|$|A backstripping {{analysis}} of 225 wells {{located within the}} Sirt Basin, Libya, provides new constraints {{on the development of}} the Sirt Basin. Four tectonic phases are identified from Late Jurassic to present. The presentation of contour maps of subsidence and crustal stretching allows spatial and temporal variations in stretching to be visualized. A close match is observed with stretching phases documented for other African basins, consistent with discrete phases in the opening of the Tethys and Atlantic. Rifting and reactivation appear to be primarily controlled by the orientation of the basin and the underlying basement structure with respect to stress directions. The tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> have also been forward modeled with an automated modeling technique to quantify the variation in timing and the magnitude of rifting. The tectonic subsidence history of the Sirt Basin is characterized by periods of stretching, alternating with periods of relative tectonic quiescence and thermal subsidence.

40|$|Basin {{subsidence}} analysis, {{employing the}} backstripping method, indicates that two fundamentally different basin-generating mechanisms controlled the Tanqua depocentre {{development in the}} southwestern Karoo Basin, South Africa. On one hand, the <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> display initial dominantly decelerating subsidence suggesting an extensional regime and thermal control due to heating of the lithosphere possibly in a strike-slip setting. While on the other hand, a cooling phase followed the initial heating phase, and subsequent rapidly accelerating subsidence most likely a foreland basin compression which suggests flexure of the lithosphere. Based on this work, the subsidence phases of the Tanqua depocentre implies that the southwestern Karoo Basin was superimposed on a passive continental margin, i. e. on a lithosphere which was already mechanically extended and had thermally subsided. This implies that subsidence was initiated and mainly controlled by mechanical (i. e. detachment faults of basement blocks) rather than thermal events (i. e. sediment burial). In this context, the southwestern Karoo Basin evolved from a "passive" continental margin into an Andean-type continental foreland basin; hence charaaerizing a fully evolved post-rift setting along the southwestern Gondwana margin. © 2011 December Geological Society of South Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the basin-fill history of the Barrow-Dampier Subbasin (Northwest Shelf, Australia) as a spectacular and complex example of the stratigraphic record of continental breakup. From the Permian until the Holocene, the Barrow-Dampier Subbasin under-went development from a continental sedimentary basin located on the Gondwana continent to a rift graben. When extensional movement ceased, the subbasin developed as a passive continental margin. This study, based on marine seismic data (about 600 km) and logs of 20 wells, includes a seismic stratigraphic analysis tied to wells in the vicinity, chronostratigraphic charts, and the calculation of <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves.</b> The basin fill is characterized by a hierarchically organized architecture. The largest scale are four tectonic-stratigraphic units: prerift (Upper Permian to Pliensbachian), rift (until Callovian), postrift (until the Upper Cretaceous), and convergence (Neogene). The tectonostratigraphic units were built by 13 sequences of the time scale of second-order sequences. Several of the sequences coincide with discrete subsidence episodes on geohistory plots. For most sequences and sequence bound-aries, either a eustatic or a tectonically enhanced origin could be established. A series of seismic facies maps for these sequences visualize the sedimentary basin evolution. Several of the second-order sequences can be subdivided into systems tracts or higher order sequences...|$|R
40|$|Analyses of facies {{associations}} and biotic assemblages integrated with backstripping analysis are presented to improve {{understanding of the}} development of a shallow water Miocene carbonate ramp in the Central Apennines (Italy), with special reference to the relationships between tectonic subsidence and the internal architecture of the ramp. Subsidence curves were calculated for six measured sections located in different sectors of the platform. Dating is derived from Sr isotope analyses (from previous studies) and regional correlations. Corrections for eustasy and paleobathymetry were deduced from biota and facies analyses. The subsidence curves show rates that vary both in space and time. By analysing the vertical motions in different sectors of the ramp over a fixed time span (Burdigalian to Tortonian), it was possible to evaluate the control on platform architecture exerted by tectonically induced changes in sea-floor bathymetry and highlight the effects of tectonic migration. Most analysed sites experienced a short period of tectonic uplift or stability followed by a period of slow subsidence. This preceded increased subsidence which resulted in drowning of the shallow-water carbonate platform. The stability/uplift is progressively younger towards the north-eastern sectors that correspond to progressively more external zones of the foreland relative to the Apenninic orogenic belt. The subsequent drowning is related to the diachronous down-flexure of the Adriatic lithosphere due to its eastward retreating subduction under the Apennines. The small magnitude of the uplift suggests that the formation of a foreland bulge due to subduction-related flexure of the Adriatic plate was probably not the responsible mechanism. Hence, this uplift is related to the development of proto-thrusts or to the propagation of compressive stresses in the foreland. These vertical motions influenced the geometry of the platform during the 17. 5 - 16  Ma stage. During this period the platform was characterised by exceptional progradation of the bryomol-dominated proximal outer ramp facies belt. This rapid spreading may be induced by the combined effect of increased eutrophic conditions and a contemporaneous decrease in the sea-floor bathymetry resulting from the tectonic uplift. From the Tortonian onwards, when the platform became involved in the eastward migrating foredeep system, the tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve</b> records a short period of fast tectonic subsidence rates followed by a period of slow subsidence or slight uplift during basin drowning and infilling, respectively. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|ODP Leg 203 {{established}} a new legacy hole {{for a long-term}} Dynamics of Earth and Ocean Systems/Ocean Seismic Network observatory and sampled basement in a young fast-spreading environment at Site 1243. The age of basement at this site, based on a full spreading rate of 141 mm/yr, the East Pacific Rise <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve,</b> and the lower most sediments is ∼ 11 Ma. Basement was drilled and cored to a total depth of 195. 3 mbsf, sampling 87. 1 m of oceanic crust with an average recovery of 25. 5 %. Although Leg 203 did not quite achieve the proposed crustal penetration of 100 m, the core returned from Hole 1243 B is significant given the sparse sampling of deep basement rocks from young Pacific seafloor. All the recovered volcanic rocks are aphyric or plagioclase±olivine-phyric basalts. On a SiO 2 vs total alkali diagram, two alkaline units are distinguished from the five remaining tholeiitic units. Samples from Units 1 and 3 display the most primitive compositions while the alkaline units are more evolved. The tholeiitic units display REE patterns characteristics of N-MORB and the alkaline units are typical of E-MORB. The basement sampled at Hole 1243 B is relatively fresh with Loss On Ignition (LOI) varying between 0. 10 % and 3. 95 %. The alteration paragenesis is dominated by iron-oxyhydroxide (Fe(O,OH) x), brown clay minerals, Ca-carbonate and zeolites and restricted to narrow rims of pillows. The Sr isotope compositions of the basement samples are close to unaltered basalt isotope compositions. Most 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios vary from 0. 7029 to 0. 7035 although three samples yielded higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (from 0. 7042 to 0. 7047). All measured O isotope compositions are above mantle values ranging between 6. 5 and 8. 5 within the tholeiitic units and from 6. 6 to 9. 1 within the alkaline units. There is a clear relationship between both the O and the Sr isotope compositions of the basalts and their LOI. These geochemical data are indicative of low temperature interactions between rocks and seawater-derived fluids and typical of the low temperature seafloor weathering of the ocean crust. The characteristics of basement recovered at Site 1243 are distinctive from those previously sampled in young Pacific oceanic crust in the well studied Holes 504 B or 896 A. The main differences are (a) the occurrence of more enriched units composed of alkali basalts and typical of E-MORB and (b) the overall low degree of alteration of the oceanic crust...|$|E
40|$|The Witwatersrand basin {{is unique}} {{in terms of its}} mineral wealth. The gold in the Witwatersrand basin is mainly {{concentrated}} in the placers and two types of unconformities are associated with the placer formation. This paper attempts to quantitatively describe the origin and depositional process of placers within the context of basin analysis, geohistory and sequences stratigraphic framework. Several tectonic models have been proposed for the evolution of the Witwater~rand basin and it seems as if a cratonic foreland basin accounts for many of the observed features observed the Central Rand Group basin. The tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>curve</b> generated for the Witwatersrand Basin clearly implies foreland basin response which was superimposed an older, deep seated extensional basin. These compressive tectonics can be superimposed on extensional basins, where the shift from extensional to compressional tectonics lead to inversion processes. The critical issues about the Witwatersrand basin which were addresed in this review, is the validity of basin wide correlation of placer unconformuties and whether sequence stratigraphy is applicable to fluvial systems of the Witwatersrand sequence. It is believed that the Central Rand Group was deposited as alluvial - fan deltas by fluvially dominated, braidplain systems with minor marine interaction which had a considerable impact on the preservation of economically viable placers. Most important to the exploration geologist is the recognition of stacking patterns of the fluvial strata to determine change in the rate at which accommodation was created. Identifying sequence boundaries and other relevant surfaces important for identifying these stacking patterns of the sequences, depends entirely on the recognition of a hierarchy of stratal units including beds, bedsets, parasequences, parasequence sets and the surfaces bounding sequences. Placers are closely associated with the development of disconformities and therefore become important to recognise in fluvial strata. If these placers are to become economic, the duration of subaerial exposure of the unconformities that allowed the placers to become reworked and concentrated must be determined. In order to preserve the placer, a sudden marine transgression is necessary to allow for minimal shoreline reworking and to cap the placer to prevent it from being dispersed. The placers in the Witwatersrand basin occur in four major gold-bearing placer zones in the Central Rand Group. Accordingly they can be assigned to four supercycles, which are cyclical and therefore predictive. It is the predictive nature of these rocks and the ability of sequence stratigraphy to enhance this aspect, which is a pre-requisite for an effective exploration tool in the search for new ore bodies or their extension in the Witwatersrand basin. ...|$|E
40|$|The Iberian Basin was an intracratonic rift basin in central-eastern Spain {{developed}} since Early Permian times. The basin boundary faults were normal, listric faults controlling an asymmetric extension propagating northeast with time. Hercynian {{or older}} lineaments controlled {{the orientation of}} the Iberian Basin and extension was accommodated basically in the hanging wall block by the formation of secondary grabens and a central high. The basin was related with the coeval Ebro, Catalan and Cuenca-Mancha Basins and their connections are discussed. <b>Subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> show that the Early Permian-Early Jurassic period of extension can be subdivided into three rifting episodes and a flexural one. Extension factor increases from 1. 17 in the northwest to 1. 29 near the Mediterranean coast. The increasing extension rate was accommodated by transfer faults trending NNE-SSW, more important in the Levante area. The rift evolution is intermittent and seems to reflect distinct stress fields. The collapse of the late Hercynian orogen and related increased heat flux, extension and rifting is the most probable origin of the Iberian Basin and related basins. The origin of the Catalan and the Valencia-Prebetic Basins is related to the southwards migration of the Hesse-Burgundy Rift along the eastern margin of the Iberian Microplate...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} series of simple {{numerical}} models to explain the anomalous subsidence and deposition phenomena on the northern continental margin of the South China Sea, in particular in the Baiyun Sag. The results suggest that a short-period high rate deposition of around 17 Ma is related to a rapid subsidence event, which {{may be due to}} episodic emplacement of a dense intrusion. Necking and gravity models indicate that {{in the basement of the}} Baiyun Sag, there is a dense zone that is 100 - 200 kg/m(3) more dense than the surrounding country rock. Considering its high magnetic intensity and regional igneous activity, the dense zone is thought to be related to a phase of basalt intrusion that may have taken place around 17 Ma. Thermal and subsidence models indicate that a hot denser intrusion can cause significant subsidence immediately after the intrusion. The subsidence rate then slows down with cooling, thus becoming consistent with the observed <b>subsidence</b> <b>curves</b> at around 17 Ma. The results also indicate that the lithospheric strength under the Baiyun Sag is negligible, and that the high-velocity layer in the lowermost crust may be not an original part of the pre-rift crust. Instead, it is thought to be underplated intrusion emplaced at around 30 Ma when the continental margin broke up. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
