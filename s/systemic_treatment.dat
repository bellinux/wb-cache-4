5|$|The {{first line}} therapy for aphthous {{stomatitis}} is topical agents rather than systemic medication, with topical corticosteroids being the mainstay treatment. <b>Systemic</b> <b>treatment</b> is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due {{to the risk of}} adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy induced {{hair loss}} occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can {{manifest}} as alopecia totalis, telogen effluvium, or less often alopecia areata. It is {{usually associated with}} <b>systemic</b> <b>treatment</b> due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss, although permanent cases can occur. Chemotherapy induces hair loss in women more often than men.|$|E
25|$|Breast cancer {{management}} takes {{different approaches}} depending on physical and biological {{characteristics of the}} disease, {{as well as the}} age, over-all health and personal preferences of the patient. Treatment types can be classified into local therapy (surgery and radiotherapy) and <b>systemic</b> <b>treatment</b> (chemo-, endocrine, and targeted therapies). Local therapy is most efficacious in early stage breast cancer, while systemic therapy is generally justified in advanced and metastatic disease, or in diseases with specific phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|Systemic therapy uses {{medications}} to treat cancer cells throughout the body. Any combination of <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments</b> {{may be used}} to treat breast cancer. Standard of care <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments</b> include chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and targeted therapy.|$|R

25|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy consisting of <b>systemic</b> <b>treatment</b> with estrogen {{alone or in}} combination with a progestogen, has well-documented and considerable beneficial effects on the skin of postmenopausal women. These benefits include increased skin collagen content, skin thickness and elasticity, and skin hydration and surface lipids. Topical estrogen {{has been found to}} have similar beneficial effects on the skin. In addition, a study has found that topical 2% progesterone cream significantly increases skin elasticity and firmness and observably decreases wrinkles in peri- and postmenopausal women. Skin hydration and surface lipids, on the other hand, did not significantly change with topical progesterone. These findings suggest that progesterone, like estrogen, also has beneficial effects on the skin, and may be independently protective against skin aging.|$|E

40|$|Conjunctival {{melanoma}} (CM) is {{an exceptionally}} rare tumor, with a propensity for local and distant recurrence, with the lungs, skin, liver, and brain {{being the most}} common sites of metastasis. Recent progress in <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments,</b> with checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies blocking BRAF and MEK, has redefined the standard of care of advanced unresectable and metastatic melanoma. Although most trials did not include patients with conjunctival melanoma, its close molecular and genetic relationship to cutaneous melanoma might suggest a similar response to these novel agents. The authors describe two uncommon cases of metastatic conjunctival melanomas with distinct genetic profiles and, as such, submitted to different <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Staging {{breast cancer}} is the initial step to help {{physicians}} determine the most appropriate course of treatment. As of 2016, guidelines incorporated biologic factors, such as tumor grade, cellular proliferation rate, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) expression, and gene expression profiling [...] into the staging system. Cancer that has spread beyond the breast and the lymph nodes is classified as Stage 4, or metastatic cancer, and requires mostly <b>systemic</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% {{of those}} {{treated with the}} drug) associated with systemic metronidazole therapy include: nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and metallic taste in the mouth. Intravenous administration is commonly associated with thrombophlebitis. Infrequent adverse effects include: hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itch, flushing, fever), headache, dizziness, vomiting, glossitis, stomatitis, dark urine, and paraesthesia. High doses and long-term <b>systemic</b> <b>treatment</b> with metronidazole {{are associated with the}} development of leucopenia, neutropenia, increased risk of peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system toxicity. [...] Common adverse drug reaction associated with topical metronidazole therapy include local redness, dryness and skin irritation; and eye watering (if applied near eyes). Metronidazole has been associated with cancer in animal studies.|$|E
50|$|Psoriasis {{resistant}} to topical treatment and phototherapy may {{be treated with}} systemic therapies including medications by mouth or injectable treatments. People undergoing <b>systemic</b> <b>treatment</b> must have regular blood and liver function tests to check for medication toxicities. Pregnancy must be avoided for most of these treatments.

40|$|Advanced and metastatic {{endometrial cancer}} (EC) is {{associated}} with a poor prognosis despite the avaibility of <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments</b> including endocrine therapy and combination cytotoxic chemotherapy. Response rates of <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments</b> are associated with high toxity, have poor response rates and responses generally are short lasting. Recent findings on the molecular aberrations of the subtypes of EC have enabled in vitro and in vivo studies to exploit targeted treatment for this disease. One of the most common molecular aberrations in EC is the P 13 K-AKT-mTOR pathway being activated through different mechanisms in both, type I and type II ECs. The aim of this review is to summarize the numerous preclinical and clinical studies and discuss the future directions...|$|R
40|$|The <b>systemic</b> {{disparate}} <b>treatment</b> {{theory of}} employment discrimination is in disarray. Originally formulated in United States v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the <b>systemic</b> disparate <b>treatment</b> theory provides plaintiffs with {{a method for}} creating an inference of unlawful discriminatory intent if plaintiffs can first present sufficient statistical evidence establishing that the employer was engaged in a 2 ̆ 2 pattern or practice 2 ̆ 2 of discrimination. While the Court and scholars have recently given substantial attention to the disparate impact theory, they have not adequately analyzed {{the contours of the}} <b>systemic</b> disparate <b>treatment</b> theory. For example, there are currently disputes about whether the <b>systemic</b> disparate <b>treatment</b> theory can be utilized by plaintiffs in (1) ADEA cases, (2) ADA cases, (3) hostile work environment cases, and (4) private individual (non-class) discrimination cases brought under any of the antidiscrimination statutes. The development of a coherent approach to <b>systemic</b> disparate <b>treatment</b> law is becoming increasingly important. Since 2006, the EEOC has made pursuit of its 2 ̆ 2 Systemic Initiative 2 ̆ 2 a top priority in its enforcement strategy. Thus, difficult questions about the application of the <b>systemic</b> disparate <b>treatment</b> theory will continue to surface. This Article takes a first step toward bringing order to the <b>systemic</b> disparate <b>treatment</b> theory. Drawing upon economic models of optimal allocation of burdens of proof in civil litigation and an application of Bayesian probability analysis, this Article argues that the proper extent of the <b>systemic</b> disparate <b>treatment</b> theory depends on three critical considerations: (1) the background prevalence (or prior probability) of the type of discrimination alleged; (2) the relative strength of the evidentiary signal provided by the proffered statistical evidence; and (3) the parties 2 ̆ 7 relative access to evidence on the element of discriminatory intent. Applying the principles developed here, this Article concludes that the Teamsters <b>systemic</b> disparate <b>treatment</b> theory should be available as a method of proof for plaintiffs in ADEA, ADA, and individual (non-class) cases, but not in hostile work environment cases...|$|R

40|$|Background Human {{papillomavirus}} is {{the most}} significant factor contributing to cervical cancer. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) implement an integrative approach to treat cervical atypia. This study explored practice consensus and variance among NDs. Methods A purposefully selected panel of six NDs participated in a modified Delphi study to validate practice. Three electronic web-based surveys were completed over nine months. Results Local and <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments</b> were included in all ND protocols. Six protocols included cervical cancer screening guidelines, green tea suppositories, and oral folic acid. Five protocols included oral green tea, diindoylemethane (DIM), and cartenoids. Four protocols incorporated Vitamin C. Two NDs considered escharotics when managing cervical atypia. All NDs included health behavior management in their protocols. Conclusion Naturopathic management of cervical atypia varies across practitioners. However, in general, elements of management include (1) cervical cancer screening guidelines, (2) local and <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments,</b> (3) health behavior/lifestyle recommendations, and (4) immune system support...|$|R
40|$|Many {{patients}} with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) require <b>systemic</b> immunomodulating <b>treatment</b> to achieve adequate disease control. We sought to systematically evaluate the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments</b> for moderate-to-severe AD. A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (until June 2012). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating <b>systemic</b> immunomodulating <b>treatments</b> for moderate-to-severe AD were included. Selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and generation of treatment recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Efficacy outcomes were clinical signs, symptoms, quality of life, and the course of AD. Safety data were compared by calculating the weekly incidence rates (as percentages) for adverse events. Thirty-four RCTs with 12 different <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments</b> and totaling 1653 patients were included. Fourteen trials consistently indicate that cyclosporin A efficaciously improves clinical signs of AD. Cyclosporin A is recommended as first-line treatment for short-term use. A second-line treatment option is azathioprine, but efficacy is lower, and evidence is weaker. Methotrexate {{can be considered a}} third-line treatment option. Recommendations are impossible for mycophenolate, montelukast, intravenous immunoglobulins, and systemic glucocorticosteroids because of limited evidence. A meta-analysis was not performed {{because of a lack of}} standardization in outcome measures. Although 12 different interventions for moderate-to-severe AD have been studied in 34 RCTs, strong recommendations are only possible for the short-term use of cyclosporin A. Methodological limitations in the majority of trials prevent evidence-based conclusions. Large head-to-head trials evaluating long-term treatments are require...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Alopecia areata is nonscarring telogenic {{alopecia}} of autoimmune etiology. It {{is estimated}} to be thepresenting complaint in 2 % of dermatologic consultations, and can appear at any age although it is more common in young patients. Treatment depends on several factors, such as extent of the disease and age, and maybe local or <b>systemic.</b> Local <b>treatments</b> aim to achieve hair regrowth, but do not alter the underlying condition, whereas <b>systemic</b> <b>treatments</b> can modify the course of the disease.
