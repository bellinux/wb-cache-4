However, {{in contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR {{in such a way}} that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation <b>should</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E

25|$|George Lakoff, a {{professor}} of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use logic programming to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained biological neural network. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel {{they know what they}} mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function <b>should</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one’s life should be straightforward.|$|E

25|$|Deeper {{analysis}} is needed {{before we can}} understand why these distinctions <b>should</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> {{a difference in the}} twins' ages. Consider the spacetime diagram of Fig.2‑11. This presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the path integral) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.|$|E
25|$|The superactinide {{series is}} {{expected}} to contain elements 121 to 157. In the superactinide series, the 7d3/2, 8p1/2, 6f5/2 and 5g7/2 shells should all fill simultaneously: this creates very complicated situations, {{so much so that}} complete and accurate CCSD calculations have been done only for elements 121 and 122. The first superactinide, unbiunium (element 121), should be a congener of lanthanum and actinium and should have similar properties to them: its main oxidation state should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just as in elements 119 and 120. Relativistic stabilization of the 8p subshell <b>should</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a ground-state 8s28p1 valence electron configuration for element 121, in contrast to the ds2 configurations of lanthanum and actinium. Its first ionization energy is predicted to be 429.4kJ/mol, which would be lower than those of all known elements except for the alkali metals potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium: this value is even lower than that of the period 8 alkali metal ununennium (463.1kJ/mol). Similarly, the next superactinide, unbibium (element 122), may be a congener of cerium and thorium, with a main oxidation state of +4, but would have a ground-state 7d18s28p1 valence electron configuration, unlike thorium's 6d27s2 configuration. Hence, its first ionization energy would be smaller than thorium's (Th: 6.3eV; Ubb: 5.6eV) because of the greater ease of ionizing unbibium's 8p1/2 electron than thorium's 6d electron.|$|E

500|$|At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge's Division was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps and was stationed {{on the east side}} of the Stones River. When the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Major General William Rosecrans, attacked on December 31, 1862, beginning the Battle of Stones River, Bragg's main force initially repelled the attack. Bragg ordered Breckinridge to reinforce him on the west side of the river, but Brigadier General John Pegram, who commanded a Cavalry brigade, erroneously reported that a large Union force was advancing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was slow to comply with Bragg's order. When he finally crossed the river, his attacks were ineffective, and Bragg ordered him back across the river. By January 2, Union forces had taken a ridge that ran along the river; against Breckinridge's advice, Bragg ordered the 2nd Division to launch a near-suicidal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, [...] "if [...] <b>should</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> disaster and I be among the killed, I want you to do justice to my memory and tell the people that I believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first point}} follows from basic {{properties}} of the real numbers: L has a supremum and R has an infimum, which are easily seen to be equal; being a real number it either lies in R or in L, but not both since L and R {{are supposed to be}} disjoint. The second point generalizes the 0.999.../1.000... pair obtained for p1="0", p2="1". In fact one need not use the same alphabet for all positions (so that for instance mixed radix systems can be included) or consider the full collection of possible strings; the only important points are that at each position a finite set of symbols (which may even depend on the previous symbols) can be chosen from (this is needed to ensure maximal and minimal choices), and that making a valid choice for any position <b>should</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a valid infinite string (so one should not allow [...] "9" [...] in each position while forbidding an infinite succession of [...] "9"s). Under these assumptions, the above argument shows that an order preserving map from the collection of strings to an interval of the real numbers cannot be a bijection: either some numbers do not correspond to any string, or some of them correspond to more than one string.|$|E
500|$|There is a divide among Gilbert and Sullivan {{scholars}} as {{to whether}} Gilbert is, as Jones argues, {{a supporter of the}} status quo whose focus is merely to entertain or, on the other hand, predominantly to satirise and protest [...] "against the follies of his age". The Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther posits that this disagreement arises from Gilbert's [...] "techniques of inversion – with irony and topsyturvydom", which lead to [...] "the surface meaning of his writings" [...] being [...] "the opposite of their underlying meaning". Crowther argues that Gilbert desires to [...] "celebrate" [...] society's norms while, at the same time, satirising these conventions. In Pinafore, which established many patterns for the later Savoy operas, Gilbert found a way to express his own conflict that [...] "also had tremendous appeal to the general public". He creates [...] "a highly intelligent parody of nautical melodrama... controlled by the conventions it mocks". While nautical melodrama exalts the common sailor, in Pinafore Gilbert makes the proponent of equality, Sir Joseph, a pompous and misguided member of the ruling class who, hypocritically, cannot apply the idea of equality to himself. The hero, Ralph, is convinced of his equality by Sir Joseph's foolish pronouncements and declares his love for his Captain's daughter, throwing over the accepted [...] "fabric of social order". At this point, Crowther suggests, the logic of Gilbert's satiric argument <b>should</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> Ralph's arrest. But to satisfy convention, Gilbert creates an obvious absurdity: the captain and Ralph were switched as babies. By an [...] "accident of birth", Ralph is suddenly an appropriate husband for Josephine, and both the social order and the desire for a romantic happy ending are satisfied at once. Crowther concludes, [...] "We have an opera which uses all the conventions of melodrama and ridicules them; but in the end {{it is difficult to see}} which has won out, the conventions or the ridicule." [...] Thus, Pinafore found broadbased success by appealing to the intellectual theatregoer seeking satire, the middle-class theatre-goer looking for a comfortable confirmation of the [...] "existing social order" [...] and the working-class audience who saw a satisfying melodramatic victory for the common man.|$|E
