25|$|Litvinov's demise as Soviet Foreign Minister in March 1939 {{signaled}} {{an increasing}} tension and danger for Finland and the Baltic countries, and indirectly for Sweden. Litvinov {{was known as}} being friendly towards the West, whereas the new minister, Molotov, had made a more aggressive impression. Litvinov's half-promises to accept and <b>support</b> <b>joint</b> Finnish–Swedish provisions {{for the defense of}} Åland against the potential German threat were not upheld by his successor. As a consequence, Soviet-leaning ministers in Sweden, such as Ernst Wigforss and Östen Undén, proposed Sweden's withdrawal from these plans. Parliament agreed, being eager to continue Sweden's successful policy, since 1812, of non-confrontation towards Russia.|$|E
