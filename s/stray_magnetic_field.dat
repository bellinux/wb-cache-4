40|$|The {{disturbing}} {{effect of}} the <b>stray</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> of Fe-based amorphous ribbons on the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) sensor has been investigated systematically in this paper. Two simple methods were used for examining the disturbing {{effect of the}} <b>stray</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> of ribbons on the GMI sensor. In order to study {{the influence of the}} <b>stray</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> on the GMI effect, the square-shaped amorphous ribbons were tested in front, at the back, on the left and {{on the top of a}} meander-line GMI sensor made up of soft ferromagnetic films, respectively. Experimental results show that the presence of ribbons in front or at the back of GMI sensor shifts the GMI curve to a lower external <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> On the contrary, the presence of ribbons on the left or on the top of the GMI sensor shifts the GMI curve to a higher external <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> which is related to the coupling effect of the external <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and the <b>stray</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The influence of the area and angle of ribbons on GMI was also studied in this work.

It has been found that the shift of meaning and sign controlled the magnetic parameter in the process of plastic deformation is conditioned by structural changes, passing in steels when fractional rolling: formation of rolling texture and increase of crystallographic orientation of grains lengthwise of rolling direction with the increase of deformation ratio. The revealed correlation between the degree of cold plastic deformation, <b>stray</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength and structural changes, taking place in lowcarbon steel 08 ps and low-alloy steels 09 G 2 S and 10 HSND, allows for recommending the passive ferroprobe method for control of structural changes of metal in the process of cold plastic deformation.

This paper presents a contactless scanning prototype based on tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) sensors for quantification of MNPs present in lateral flow strips (LFSs). The sensing unit of the prototype composes of two active TMR elements, which are parallel and closely arranged to form a differential sensing configuration in a perpendicular magnetic field.

In order not to disturb other {{experiments in}} the vicinity of aSPECT, we had to develop a magnetic field return yoke for the magnet system.
