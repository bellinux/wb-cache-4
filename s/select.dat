5|$|Davis was {{selected}} by the Philadelphia Eagles as the eighth overall selection in the 1991 NFL Draft, one pick after former Tennessee teammate Charles McRae {{was selected}} by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It {{was the first time}} in NFL history that two former college teammates who played the same position were drafted back-to-back. Davis was the first draft pick by new Eagles head coach Rich Kotite. The Eagles traded up from the 19th pick with the Green Bay Packers to <b>select</b> Davis, giving Green Bay the 19th selection (which was used on cornerback Vinnie Clark) and a first-round pick in the 1992 NFL Draft. The pick in 1992 ended up being the 17th selection, and the Packers traded it to the Atlanta Falcons for quarterback Brett Favre on February 10, 1992. The Falcons then traded the pick to the Dallas Cowboys (who used it to <b>select</b> cornerback Kevin Smith) and received the 19th selection (used to <b>select</b> running back Tony Smith) and a fourth round pick (used to <b>select</b> cornerback Frankie Smith).|$|E
5|$|Following the {{absorption}} of Virginia Tech and Miami into the ACC, questions arose about how an 11-team league could fairly <b>select</b> participants in the conference championship game. A divisional structure involving two six-team divisions competing for two championship-game slots would not be possible. In addition, the ACC could not continue to <b>select</b> its champion via round-robin play since there were now 11 teams and only seven or eight conference games available per team. Even the NCAA's addition of a 12th game to the regular season did little to relieve the conference's problem. Prior to the 2004college football season, the ACC requested a waiver to the NCAA's rule requiring conferences to have 12-plus teams before having a conference championship game. Before the season began, however, the NCAA rejected the ACC's application, and the league had to use a semi-round-robin format to <b>select</b> a champion during the 2004 football season. After that season, the inclusion of Boston College as the ACC's 12th team solved the problem of enabling the ACC to have a championship football game.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{approach}} of maximization of total selection response (response from selection between crosses plus response from selection within crosses), optimum number of crosses and progeny per cross in the breeding of self-fertilizing crops have been determined. Optimum numbers of crosses and maximum selection responses depend on testing capacity, number of <b>selected</b> crosses, number of lines <b>selected</b> from each <b>selected</b> cross, and heritability. For the general case of various numbers of <b>selected</b> crosses and various numbers of <b>selected</b> lines from each <b>selected</b> cross, the main results are: The maximum selection response increases (i) with an increasing testing capacity, (ii) with an increasing heritability, (iii) with a decreasing number of <b>selected</b> crosses and (iv) with a decreasing number of <b>selected</b> lines from each <b>selected</b> cross. If a certain predetermined {{fraction of the total}} testing capacity should be finally <b>selected,</b> the maximum selection response (a) exhibits a maximum for very small numbers of <b>selected</b> crosses and then steadily decreases (very slowly) with increasing number of <b>selected</b> crosses, (b) increases with increasing heritability, (c) increases with decreasing <b>selected</b> fraction, and (d) increases with increasing testing capacity...|$|R

5|$|In {{choosing}} the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee {{had the right}} to <b>select</b> the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series, Cotton Bowl Classic, Capital One Bowl, and Outback Bowl made their selections. Just as in the ACC, the selection committee could not <b>select</b> an SEC team with two more losses than the highest available team. The bowl earned the right to <b>select</b> these teams via its multimillion-dollar payout system, which guarantees {{a certain amount of money}} to the participating conferences. Prior to 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC. After the bowl increased its payout to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third.|$|E
