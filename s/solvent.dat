5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed <b>solvent</b> {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions. The {{reason for this is}} that when the <b>solvent</b> is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that <b>solvent</b> mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E

Acetic acid {{is used as a}} <b>solvent</b> in the production of terephthalic acid (TPA), the raw material for polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In 2006, about 20% of acetic acid was used for TPA production.|$|E
50|$|Commonly used <b>solvents</b> are polar aprotic <b>solvents</b> such as THF, DMSO, Acetonitrile, DMF {{as well as}} in {{non-polar}} aprotic <b>solvents</b> such as toluene. Neat <b>solvents</b> or {{a mixture}} of <b>solvents</b> may be used.|$|R
5000|$|Polar aprotic <b>solvents</b> are <b>solvents</b> {{that lack}} an acidic {{hydrogen}}. Consequently, {{they are not}} hydrogen bond donors. These <b>solvents</b> generally have intermediate dielectric constants and polarity.

Other <b>solvents</b> meeting IUPACs criteria include DMF, HMPA, and DMSO.|$|R

5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the <b>solvent</b> will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the <b>solvent</b> can permeate the plastic, the <b>solvent</b> evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for <b>solvent</b> welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. <b>Solvent</b> welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E
5|$|These {{facts are}} {{obscured}} by the omission of the <b>solvent</b> from the expression that is normally used to define pKa, but pKa values obtained in a given mixed <b>solvent</b> {{can be compared to}} each other, giving relative acid strengths. The same is true of pKa values obtained in a particular non-aqueous <b>solvent</b> such a DMSO.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid {{is often}} used as a <b>solvent</b> for {{reactions}} involving carbocations, such as Friedel-Crafts alkylation. For example, one stage in the commercial manufacture of synthetic camphor involves a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement of camphene to isobornyl acetate; here acetic acid acts both as a <b>solvent</b> and as a nucleophile to trap the rearranged carbocation.|$|E

5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} <b>solvent</b> than methane. Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose <b>solvent</b> was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E

5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of <b>solvents</b> can be used, {{although}} most dyes will dissolve better in some <b>solvents</b> than in others. Some of the <b>solvents</b> used are water, glycol, ethanol, methanol, hexane, cyclohexane, cyclodextrin, and many others. <b>Solvents</b> are often highly toxic, and can sometimes be absorbed directly through the skin, or through inhaled vapors. Many <b>solvents</b> are also extremely flammable.

For correlating the {{reaction rate}} constants in binary mixed <b>solvents</b> an empirical method based on the Arrhenius equation coupled with a Redlich-Kister type excess function introduced to obtain the excess activation energy in the mixed <b>solvents</b> is proposed.

5|$|If the ionic {{compound}} is soluble in a <b>solvent,</b> it can {{be obtained}} as a solid compound by evaporating the <b>solvent</b> from this electrolyte solution. As the <b>solvent</b> is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals. Another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until the solution is supersaturated and the solid compound nucleates.|$|E

50|$|Cellulose remains {{insoluble}} to most <b>solvents</b> {{since it}} has a strong and highly structured intermolecular hydrogen bonding network, which resists common <b>solvents.</b> NMMO is able to break the hydrogen bonding network that keeps cellulose insoluble to water and other <b>solvents.</b> Similar solubility has been obtained in a few <b>solvents,</b> particularly a mix of lithium chloride in dimethyl acetamide and some hydrophilic ionic liquids.|$|R
30|$|However, most {{of these}} methods rely heavily on organic <b>solvents,</b> mainly due to the {{hydrophobic}} group needed in the nanoparticle preparation processes [27]. These organic <b>solvents</b> may be residual within the particles and cannot be completely removed by conventional practices, such as reduced pressure distillation or freeze drying. As a result, trace amounts of organic <b>solvents</b> remain in the medicine, which are called residual <b>solvents.</b> Although residual <b>solvents</b> are very little and may meet the special directions published in pharmacopeias which have been strictly controlling the maximum allowable amounts of the residual <b>solvents</b> in pharmaceutical products, the residual <b>solvents</b> will be accumulating {{in the body and}} may accentuate the disease or cause other serious issues. Hence, the manufacturers have been aspiring to minimize the amount of the organic <b>solvents</b> used in the drug production process. Therefore, it will be a pretty major leap for the medicine, the human health, and the environment to use “green” chemistry into the pharmaceutical industry, although facing amounts of difficulties.|$|R
5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic <b>solvent,</b> similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The <b>solvent</b> and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a <b>solvent</b> {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E

Among the methods that are {{or have been}} used are: <b>solvent</b> extraction (using various extractants, usually multidentate β-diketone derivatives, organophosphorus compounds, and amine compounds), chromatography using various ion-exchange or chelating resins, coprecipitation (possible matrices include LaF3, BiPO4, BaSO4, Fe(OH)3, and MnO2), electrodeposition, and biotechnological methods. Currently, commercial reprocessing plants use the Purex process, involving the <b>solvent</b> extraction of uranium and plutonium with tributyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen is {{commonly}} used during sample preparation in chemical analysis. It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples.
