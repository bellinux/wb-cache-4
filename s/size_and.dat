40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an algorithm, {{based on the}} fixed point iteration, to solve for <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> biases using transistor compact models such as BSIM 3 v 3, BSIM 4, PSP and EKV. The proposed algorithm simplifies the implementation of <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> biasing operators. <b>Sizing</b> <b>and</b> biasing operators were originally proposed in the hierarchical <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> biasing methodology [1]. They allow to compute transistors <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> biases based on transistor compact models while respecting designer’s hypothe- ses. Computed <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> biases are accurate, and guarantee the correct electrical behavior as expected by the designer. <b>Sizing</b> <b>and</b> biasing operators interface with a Spice-like simulator, allowing possible use of all available compact models for circuit <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> biasing over different technologies. To illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithm, a folded cascode OTA was efficiently sized with a 130 nm process, then was migrated to a 65 nm technology. Both <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> migration were performed in a few milliseconds...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading {{are widely}} used to create {{products}} to fit selected populations. Currently, the <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading rules are derived from anthropometric measures; however past researches have indicated {{that it is not}} very accurate. This study proposes a new technique to use principal component analysis (PCA) on 3 D surface points for <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading wearable products. The accuracy of the proposed method is illustrated by developing a <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading rule for the feet. After developing a model using the feet data of 60 participants and validating using the feet data of 10 different participants, results showed that <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading using PCA is more accurate than traditional techniques. Compared with traditional foot sizing, PCA based <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading showed an improvement of about 25 % in accuracy. In addition, results also indicated that the grading rule derived from PCA loading was better than the proportional grading. This research provides a new direction to consider when developing the <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading rules. It can be extended to calculate the number of <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> the <b>size</b> increment for various wearable products. Institute of Textiles and ClothingSchool of Desig...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A unified {{optimization}} {{framework is}} presented for simultaneous gate <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> placement. These processes are unified using Lagrangian multipliers, which synchronize {{the efforts of}} the gate <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> placement subproblems. As far as we know, this is the first work that formulates and solves the simultaneous gate <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> placement under area density constraints, which are handled by the quadratic penalty method. We show that this rigorous framework results in an algorithm that is faster than separate iterations of gate <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> placement steps, and leads to more robust results for a set of benchmarks.

The efficacy of (a) electro-impedance volumetric zone sensing (ES) also called a Coulter counter/multisizer; (b) optical microscopy (OM); and (c) laser diffraction (LD), for the <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> counting of microbubbles was assessed. Microspheres with certified mean diameter and number concentration {{were used to assess}} <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> counting reproducibility (precision) and reliability (accuracy) of ES, OM and LD.

Statistical analyses of intra-method variability for the SonoVue™ mean diameter showed that the best microbubble sizing reproducibility was obtained using OM with a mean diameter sizing variability of 1. 1 %, compared with a variability of 4. 3 % for ES and 7. 1 % for LD. The best microbubble counting reproducibility was obtained using ES with a number concentration variability of 8. 3 %, compared with a variability of 22. 4 % for OM and 32 % for LD.
