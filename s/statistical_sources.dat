Such scientific resources began to exist only half a century later. In 1894, Friedrich Engels did mention the research of the émigré socialist Georg Christian Stiebeling, who compared profit, income, capital and output data in the U.S. census reports of 1870 and 1880, but Engels claimed that Stiebeling explained the results [...] "in a completely false way" [...] (Stiebeling's defence against Engels's criticism included two open letters submitted to the New Yorker Volkszeitung and Die Neue Zeit). Stiebeling's analysis represented [...] "almost certainly the first systematic use of <b>statistical</b> <b>sources</b> in Marxian value theory." ...|$|E
