50|$|The <b>seat</b> and the <b>back</b> <b>panels</b> {{are created}} by the cross pieces {{designed}} in a mold. In this way, the problematic sharp bend between the <b>seat</b> and the <b>back</b> is avoided {{and the length of}} individual rods is shortened. The <b>seat</b> and <b>back</b> are curved to the shape of the body. The rear legs extend into the armrest. The formation of this element requires high-quality wood with a good deal of waste involved. This is a prefabricated chair held together with bolts and nuts.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the convertible version of the TR7 required the interior light, {{which was in the}} headlining, to be removed. This was replaced by lights with integral switches in each of the door cards. A map light, mounted between the <b>seats</b> on the <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> below the rear parcel shelf, was deleted. The convertible also required a smaller fuel filler cap, as the deck area in front of the boot lid was reduced to allow for the stowage of the hood. These modifications were also applied to the hard top for the 1978 year model (starting after the factory's summer shutdown in 1977), presumably to maintain commonality of parts on the assembly line. The wheel trims were also changed at this time, from smaller black trims that covered only the centre of the wheels, to larger silver ones, covering the whole wheel. However, {{only a small number of}} 1978 year model cars, with the smaller filler cap and lights in the door cards, were produced at Speke, due to the industrial action there in 1977-78.|$|R
50|$|The <b>seat</b> and the <b>back</b> are {{the same}} as in the third model. The front and rear legs touch at the top and the spread apart diagonally downwards. To support this A-shape, the plywood armrest, which is curved at a right angle (through {{high-frequency}} dielectric heating), is affixed to the upper section. The chair structure is strengthened further by the armrest being joined to the <b>back</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Some {{devices have}} {{an issue that}} causes the phone's <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> to come off. The issue {{may be due to}} the glue used for the <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> or the {{expanding}} battery pack that could be a fire hazard. Motorola is offering replacements for affected devices.|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of car seat has been {{designed}} in which the back-rest is able to move freely in the vertical direction. The design allows the back-rest to follow the vertical vibration {{of the back of}} an occupant of the seat. This is intended to decrease any strain on the lumbar part of the spinal column caused by a different vertical motion at the seat squab and the <b>seat</b> <b>back.</b> The transmission of vertical (z axis) vibration from the base of this seat to the seat surface, to the back-rest and to the backs and heads of seat occupants has been measured. Measurements were made with the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> fixed, to prevent vertical motion relative to the seat frame, and with the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> free to move. Vibration transmissibilities from the seat base to the seat surface were characterized by a resonance at frequencies in the region of 4 Hz. The resonance frequencies were slightly higher with the fixed back-rest than with the moving back-rest. The transmissibilities at frequencies above 4 Hz -were generally higher with the fixed back-rest. Measurements with no contact between the seat occupants and the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> indicated that the dynamic properties of the human body and the seat cushion were less influenced by the moving <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> than by the fixed <b>seat</b> <b>back.</b> Differential motion between the seat surface and <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> was smaller with the moving <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> than with the fixed back. © IMechE 1996. </p...|$|R

5000|$|In 1936, Nash {{introduced}} the [...] "Bed-In-A-Car" [...] feature, which allowed the car's interior {{to be converted}} into a sleeping compartment. The rear <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> hinged up, allowing the rear seat cushion to be propped up into a level position. This also created an opening between the passenger compartment and the trunk. Two adults could sleep in the car, with their legs and feet in the trunk, and their heads and shoulders on the rear seat cushions. In 1949 this arrangement was modified so that fully reclining front <b>seat</b> <b>backs</b> created a sleeping area entirely within the passenger compartment. In 1950 these reclining <b>seat</b> <b>backs</b> were given the ability to lock into several intermediate positions. Nash soon called these new <b>seat</b> <b>backs</b> [...] "Airliner Reclining Seats".|$|R
