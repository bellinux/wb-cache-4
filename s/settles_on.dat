5|$|Candide and Cacambo {{eventually}} reach Suriname, {{where they}} split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares {{to travel to}} Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local {{men who have been}} through various ill-fortunes and <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> a man named Martin.|$|E
5|$|Whole colonies can {{reproduce}} asexually, forming two colonies {{with the}} same genotype. The possible mechanisms include fission, bailout and fragmentation. Fission occurs in some corals, especially among the family Fungiidae, where the colony splits into two or more colonies during early developmental stages. Bailout occurs when a single polyp abandons the colony and <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> a different substrate {{to create a new}} colony. Fragmentation involves individuals broken from the colony during storms or other disruptions. The separated individuals can start new colonies.|$|E
5|$|Stony corals {{have a great}} {{range of}} {{reproductive}} strategies and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Many species have separate sexes, the whole colony being either male or female, but others are hermaphroditic, with individual polyps having {{both male and female}} gonads. Some species brood their eggs but in most species, sexual reproduction results in the production of a free-swimming planula larva that eventually <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> the seabed to undergo metamorphosis into a polyp. In colonial species, this initial polyp then repeatedly divides asexually, to give rise to the entire colony.|$|E

50|$|In {{the last}} 150 years several subgroups of Hutterites emerged. When the Hutterites {{migrated}} to the United States in 1874 and the following years there was a division between those who <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> colonies and lived with community of goods and those who <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> private farms according to {{the conditions of the}} Homestead Act of 1862. The homesteaders were called Prairieleut, while the ones who <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> the three communal colonies developed into three branches: Schmiedeleut, Dariusleut and Lehrerleut.|$|R

5|$|Material worn {{from the}} margins of the land {{eventually}} ends up in the sea, where it is subject to attrition as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport material away from its place of origin. Sediment carried to the sea by rivers <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> the seabed causing deltas to form in estuaries. All these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides, and currents. Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to prevent flooding through building breakwaters, seawalls, and other defenses against the sea. In Britain, the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surges, while the failure of the dykes and levees around New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina created a humanitarian crisis in the United States. Land reclamation in Hong Kong permitted the construction of Hong Kong International Airport through the leveling and expansion of two smaller islands.|$|E
5|$|The mild seas that {{surround}} Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 days per year— {{this is far}} below the United Kingdom's average annual total of 55.6 days of frost. Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to six days per year; almost all winters have {{no more than one}} day with snow lying. It may snow or sleet in winter, yet it almost never <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> the ground—coastal areas in South West England such as Portland generally experience the mildest winters in the UK. Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that Devon and Cornwall experience. The growing season lasts for more than 310 days per year, and the borough is in Hardiness zone 9.|$|E
5|$|The slug-like larva of Phoronis ovalis swims {{for about}} 4 days, creeps on the sea-bed for 3 to 4 days, then bores into a {{carbonate}} floor. Nothing {{is known about}} three species. The remaining species develop free-swimming actinotroch larvae, which feed on plankton. The actinotroch is an upright cylinder with the anus {{at the bottom and}} fringed with cilia. At the top is a lobe or hood, under which are: a ganglion, connected to a patch of cilia outside the apex of the hood; a pair of protonephridia (smaller and simpler than the metanephridia in the adult); the mouth; and feeding tentacles that encircle the mouth. After swimming for about 20 days, the actinotroch <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> the seabed and undergoes a catastrophic metamorphosis (radical change) in 30minutes: the hood and larval tentacles are absorbed and the adult lophophore is created round the mouth, and both now points upward; the gut develops a U-bend so that the anus is just under and outside the lophophore. Finally the adult phoronid builds a tube.|$|E

5|$|Dylan, a 28 year-old grad student, is {{depressed}} {{because he}} {{is in love with}} his best friend, Kira, but she is dating Dylan's roommate, Mason. He has a cynical worldview and criticizes the world for its materialism, {{and at the same time}} wishes he could connect better with the people in it. When his roommate is away one night, Dylan and Kira begin a secret affair. When Dylan overhears Mason and Kira discussing how pitiful he is, Dylan decides to commit suicide. He jumps off a tall building, but survives due to unlikely events. That night, he is visited by a demon who claims he spared Dylan's life. The demon says Dylan must now murder one person for every additional month he wants to live. Dylan convinces himself this was a hallucination, but he begins to grow sick as the end of the month approaches. When the demon appears a second time, Dylan decides to track down a man who molested Dylan's friend when they were children. After shooting him, Dylan's sickness goes away. The next month, Dylan struggles to find another target he feels deserves to die. He <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> a brothel run by a Russian mob. He murders one of the men, but is violently beaten by one of the sex workers before he escapes. His unexplained injuries lead Kira to end their secret romance, although they remain friends. Dylan begins taking boxing lessons and stalking a corrupt businessman. A detective, Lily Sharpe, begins to connect the dots between Dylan's murders; the Russian mob begins to hunt for Dylan.|$|E

25|$|The red Pierrot is a weak flier, and flutters about {{close to}} the ground. It flies in short bursts and settles often but not for very long. It basks with its wings half open, but prefers shade to sun, and jungle or {{undergrowth}} to open areas. It keeps on the wing almost till dark when it <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> the undersides of leaves and twigs often in company. It is sluggish {{early in the morning}} and late in the evening.|$|E
25|$|Thunderstorms {{may occur}} {{intermittently}} {{at any time}} of year, but are most common throughout late-spring and summer. Rain falls throughout the year, Atlantic storms give significant rainfall in the autumn, these gradually becoming rarer towards the end of winter. Autumn and summer have often been the wettest seasons in recent times. Snow falls every winter and usually <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> the ground several times, and usually melts after a few days. Newport records few days with gales compared to most of Wales, again due to its sheltered location. Frosts are common from October to May.|$|E
25|$|Bioimmuration {{occurs when}} a {{skeletal}} organism overgrows or otherwise subsumes another organism, preserving the latter, or an impression of it, within the skeleton. Usually it is a sessile skeletal organism, such as a bryozoan or an oyster, which grows along a substrate, covering other sessile sclerobionts. Sometimes the bioimmured organism is soft-bodied and is then preserved in negative relief {{as a kind of}} external mold. There are also cases where an organism <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> top of a living skeletal organism that grows upwards, preserving the settler in its skeleton. Bioimmuration is known in the fossil record from the Ordovician to the Recent.|$|E

25|$|Other {{critics have}} {{attempted}} to use more scientific methods to determine {{the date of the}} play. For example, Gary Taylor has employed stylometry, particularly the study of contractions, colloquialisms, rare words and function words. Taylor concludes that the entire play except Act 3, Scene 2 was written just after Henry VI, Part 2 and Henry VI, Part 3, which he assigns to late 1591 or early 1592. As such, Taylor <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> a date of mid-1592 for Titus. He also argues that 3.2, which is only found in the 1623 Folio text, was written contemporaneously with Romeo and Juliet, in late 1593.|$|E
25|$|Professor Fr. Arsenius John Baptist Vuibert (S.S.), a 19th-century historian, {{observed}} that Biblical Chronologies are uncertain due to discrepancies in {{the figures in}} Genesis and other methodological factors, accounting for hundreds of different chronologies being assigned by historians. In {{the case of the}} Fathers of the Sixth Ecumenical Council, who assigned 5509 BC. as the date of the creation of man, he writes that it was in response to the emperor's wishes to fix an era or convenient starting point for historical computation. Therefore, it was a decision of mere historical convenience, not respecting either faith or morals, which are what is truly of intrinsic value in the Scriptures. Having made this disclaimer, he <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> the Benedictine Chronology of 4963 BC for the purposes of his history.|$|E

However, he {{is in love with}} Mary Garth, who will not accept him until he {{abandons}} the Church and <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> a more suitable career. At one time, Mr Featherstone bequeathed Fred a considerable fortune, but Featherstone later rescinded this will. However, Featherstone, on his deathbed, begs Mary to destroy the second will. Mary refuses and begs Featherstone to wait until the morning, when a new and valid will can be drawn up, but he dies before this can be done. In debt, Fred is forced to take out a loan guaranteed by Mary's father, Caleb Garth. When Fred cannot repay the loan, Caleb Garth's finances are compromised. This humiliation shocks Fred into reassessing his life, and he resolves to train as a land agent under the forgiving Caleb.|$|E

Ryder discovers that Meridian, a Dyson sphere-like construct, was taken away from the city, disconnecting the vaults and rendering the planets uninhabitable. The Archon launches an attack on Hyperion, severing SAM from Ryder, while also capturing Ryder's sibling, whose SAM implant he intends to use {{in order to take}} over Meridian. Ryder manages to activate the Remnant fleet and, together with other allied forces, makes an assault on the kett fleet guarding Meridian. The Ryder twins work to defeat the kett, eventually disconnecting the Archon from Meridian's system and killing him in the process. Ryder is hailed as a hero, having activated Meridian and made the cluster more suitable for settlement. Hyperion, after crash-landing onto Meridian, <b>settles</b> <b>on</b> the planet as humanity's new home.|$|E
