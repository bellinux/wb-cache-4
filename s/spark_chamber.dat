500|$|Fitch {{conducted}} much of {{his research}} at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, where he became acquainted with James Cronin. The two of them played bridge at nights while {{they waited for the}} Cosmotron to become available. Cronin had built a new kind of detector, a <b>spark</b> <b>chamber</b> spectrometer, and Fitch realized that it would be perfect for experiments with K mesons (now known as kaons), which Yale University physicist Robert Adair had suggested had interesting properties worth investigating. They could decay into either matter or antimatter. Along with two colleagues, James Christenson and René Turlay, they set up their experiment on the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven. They discovered an unexpected result. The decay of neutral K mesons did not respect CP symmetry. K mesons that decayed into positrons did so faster than those that decayed into electrons.0 Meson |last=Christenson |first=J. H. |last2=Cronin |first2=J. W. |last3=Fitch |first3=V.

Put simply, they had found [...] "the answer to the physicist's 'Why do we exist?'" [...] For this discovery, Fitch and Cronin received the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

50|$|To {{accomplish}} its task, EGRET {{was equipped}} with a <b>spark</b> <b>chamber,</b> calorimeter, and plastic scintillator anti-coincidence dome. The <b>spark</b> <b>chamber</b> was used to induce a process called electron-positron pair production as a gamma ray entered the telescope. The calorimeter on the telescope was then used to record {{the data from the}} electron or positron. To reject other energy rays that would skew the data, scientists covered the telescope with a plastic scintillator anti-coincidence dome.

50|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{detecting}} individual gamma rays ranging from 30 MeV to 30 GeV, EGRET was equipped with a plastic scintillator anti-coincidence dome, <b>spark</b> <b>chamber,</b> and calorimeter. Starting from {{the outside of the}} telescope, scientists covered EGRET with a plastic scintillator anti-coincidence dome. The dome acted as a shield, blocking any unwanted energy waves from entering the telescope and skewing the data. To actually create recordable, usable data, scientists used a process called electron-positron pair production, which is creating an electron and positron simultaneously near a nucleus or subatomic particle. In order to induce this process, scientists assembled a multilevel thin-plate <b>spark</b> <b>chamber</b> within the telescope. A <b>spark</b> <b>chamber</b> is basically a chamber with many plates of metal and gases such as helium or neon. Finally, to record the data from the electron or positron about the gamma ray, scientists equipped EGRET with a thallium-activated sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) calorimeter at its base. The calorimeter captured the resolution of the gamma rays that entered EGRET.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to these}} issues, bubble {{chambers}} {{have largely been}} replaced by wire chambers, which allow particle energies to be measured at the same time. Another alternative technique is the <b>spark</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since NASA {{scientists}} {{wanted only}} {{certain types of}} gamma rays to be processed and recorded, they set up EGRET with many systems of checks to filter out any unwanted information. The most basic type of filter EGRET had was only allowing gamma rays entering the telescope from certain angles to be let into the <b>spark</b> <b>chamber.</b> As the gamma ray travelled through the <b>spark</b> <b>chamber,</b> it struck one of the metal plates within the <b>spark</b> <b>chamber.</b> Once the gamma ray {{came in contact with}} a plate of metal, it initiated the process of electron-positron pair production and created an electron and positron. Once both the electron and positron were created, if one of these particles was still moving down throughout the telescope and a signal from the anticoincidence scintillator wasn’t fired, the particle was imaged and its energy level recorded. With each gamma ray having to pass all of these systems of checks, the results of EGRET were supported to be the most valuable out of the other CGRO instruments.|$|E

50|$|The {{process can}} also be used to detect {{ionizing}} radiation by using the gas multiplication effect of the avalanche process.

50|$|As {{research}} devices, <b>spark</b> <b>chamber</b> detectors {{have lower}} resolution than bubble chamber detectors. However {{they can be}} made highly selective {{with the help of}} auxiliary detectors, making them useful in searching for very rare events.|$|E
50|$|Streamer {{chambers}} are {{a different}} type of detector, closely related to spark chambers. In a <b>spark</b> <b>chamber</b> one looks at a stack of parallel plates edge-on. For this reason, best viewing is afforded when the particle comes in perpendicularly to the plates. A streamer chamber, in contrast, typically has only two plates, at least one of which is transparent (e.g. wire mesh or a conductive glass). Particles come in roughly parallel to the plane of these plates. A much shorter high-voltage pulse is used than with a <b>spark</b> <b>chamber,</b> so there is insufficient time for sparks to form. Instead very dim streamers of ionised gas are formed. These can be seen when image enhancement is applied (see external links below).|$|E
50|$|The {{process can}} also be used to detect {{radiation}} that initiates the process, as the passage of a single particles can amplified to large discharges. This is the mechanism of a Geiger counter and also the visualization possible with a <b>spark</b> <b>chamber</b> and other wire chambers.|$|E

40|$|The MPS II {{detectors}} are narrow {{drift space}} chambers designed for high position resolution in {{a magnetic field}} and in a very high particle flux environment.
