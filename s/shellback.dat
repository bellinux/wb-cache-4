5000|$|The line-crossing {{ceremony}} is an initiation rite in various navies that commemorate a sailor's first {{crossing of the}} Equator. The tradition may have originated with ceremonies when passing headlands, and become a [...] "folly" [...] sanctioned as a boost to morale, or have been created as a test for seasoned sailors to ensure their new shipmates were capable of handling long rough times at sea. Sailors who have already crossed the Equator are nicknamed <b>Shellbacks,</b> Trusty <b>Shellbacks,</b> Honorable <b>Shellbacks,</b> or Sons of Neptune. Those who have not crossed are nicknamed Pollywogs, or Slimy Pollywogs; in the Royal Canadian Navy they are nicknamed Tadpoles, or Dirty Tadpoles; an earlier nickname was griffins.|$|R

50|$|California Maritime Academy {{observed}} the line-crossing ceremony until 1989, {{after which the}} ceremony was deemed to be hazing and was forbidden. The 1989 crossing was fairly typical, as it was not realized {{to be the last}} one. Pollywogs participated voluntarily, though women midshipmen observed that they were under social pressure to do the ceremony but were targets of harder abuse. Pollywogs (midshipmen and anyone else who had not crossed) ascended a ladder from the Forecastle to the superstructure deck of the ship. There, they crawled down a gauntlet of <b>shellbacks</b> on both sides of a long, heavy canvas runner, about 10-12 meters. The <b>shellbacks</b> had prepared 3-foot, or 1-meter, lengths of canvas/rubber firehose, which they swung hard at the posterior of each wog. The wogs then ascended a ladder to the boatdeck to slide down a makeshift chute into the baptism of messdeck leavings in sea water in an inflated liferaft back on the superstructure deck. Wogs then returned to the forecastle, where they were hosed off by firehose and then allowed to kiss, in turn, the belly of the sea-baby, the foot of the sea-hag, and the ring of King Neptune, each personified by <b>shellbacks.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{song was}} praised for its impudence. Sam Lansky of Time.com wrote [...] "Lo can be vulgar, {{as on the}} lusty “Talking Body,” which sets a {{scabrous}} singalong hook against some of <b>Shellback’s</b> irresistibly catchy production, but that sexiness is shot through with frustration; she owns her desire, full-throttle." ...|$|R
50|$|Ogden {{had turned}} sailors and Marines into Golden <b>Shellbacks</b> {{on at least}} five occasions. On 10 November 1976, June 24, 1985,1988, 1992, and again in November 1999, Ogden crossed the Equator and the International Dateline simultaneously. During the 2001 crossing, Ogden was hosting Alpha Company 1/1 BLT of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{eve of the}} {{equatorial}} crossing is called Wog Day and, as with many other night-before rituals, is a mild type of reversal {{of the day to}} come. Wogs—all of the uninitiated—are allowed to capture and interrogate any <b>shellbacks</b> they can find (e.g., tying them up, cracking eggs or pouring aftershave lotion on their heads). The wogs are made very {{aware of the fact that}} it will be much harder on them if they do anything like this.|$|R

5000|$|Dilly Mulerider.

(He was apparently turned in by his sister, Leslie Press. Leslie Press in turn has worked across the nation at various liquor stores because they are the only place where she can smoke at work.) He briefly dated Dilly Mulerider and portrayed the resurrected Jesus in her [...] "Easter around the Square" [...] production, but broke up for a while. He later began offering his own lesson plans for order, in addition to offering to lecture children who might be confused on transgender issues after the public transition of Caitlyn Jenner.
