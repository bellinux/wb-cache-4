50|$|<b>Serve</b> <b>and</b> volley is a {{style of}} play in tennis where the player serving moves quickly towards the net after hitting a serve. The server then {{attempts}} to hit a volley (a shot where the ball is struck without allowing it to bounce), {{as opposed to the}} baseline style, where the server stays back following the <b>serve</b> <b>and</b> attempts to hit a ground stroke (a shot where the ball is allowed to bounce before contact is made). The <b>serve</b> <b>and</b> volley style of play has diminished in recent years with advances in racquet and string technologies which allow players to generate a great amount of top spin on ground strokes and passing shots. The slowing of court surfaces and deflation of balls, promoting longer rallies for the enjoyment of spectators, has also put a damper on the <b>serve</b> <b>and</b> volley style. Some also claim that a lack of teaching of the <b>serve</b> <b>and</b> volley to juniors, who are too small to effectively employ this method, has caused it to become obsolete in grassroots tennis.|$|R

When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally <b>served</b> <b>and</b> proves to be a success. The Chefs convince Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence and decides to keep him instead.|$|E
