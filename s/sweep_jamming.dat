50|$|<b>Sweep</b> <b>jamming</b> {{is when a}} jammer's {{full power}} is shifted from one {{frequency}} to another. While this {{has the advantage of}} being able to jam multiple frequencies in quick succession, it does not affect them all at the same time, and thus limits the effectiveness of this type of jamming. Although, depending on the error checking in the device(s) this can render a wide range of devices effectively useless.|$|E
40|$|Currently, frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) {{proximity}} sensors {{are widely}} used. However, they {{suffer from a}} serious <b>sweep</b> <b>jamming</b> problem, which significantly reduces the ranging performance. To improve its anti-jamming capability, this paper analyzed the response mechanism of a proximity sensor with the existence of real target echo signals and <b>sweep</b> <b>jamming,</b> respectively. Then, a multi-channel harmonic timing sequence detection method, using the spectrum componentsâ€™ distribution difference between the real echo signals and <b>sweep</b> <b>jamming,</b> is proposed. Moreover, a novel fast Fourier transform (FFT) -based implementation was employed to extract multi-channel harmonic information. Compared with the traditional band-pass filter (BPF) implementation, this novel realization scheme only computes FFT once, in each transmission cycle, which significantly reduced hardware resource consumption and improved the real-time performance of the proximity sensors. The proposed method was implemented and proved to be feasible through the numerical simulations and prototype experiments. The {{results showed that the}} proximity sensor utilizing the proposed method had better anti-sweep jamming capability and ranging performance...|$|E
40|$|Wideband suppressing jamming {{is one of}} {{the main}} threats faced by Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) system. The {{identification}} of wideband jamming modes and estimation of its parameters provide beneficial reference for applying effective anti-jamming measures. Aiming at familiar wideband jamming modes faced by DSSS, five characteristic parameters are extracted. An automatic identification method of wideband jamming modes based on fractional Fourier transforms (FRFT) and layered decision-making algorithm is proposed. Through the simulation results and analysis, it can be found that the method can effectively identify non-jamming, narrow-band jamming, wideband noise jamming, wideband comb jamming and wideband <b>sweep</b> <b>jamming.</b> It has the advantages of high identification rate, simplicity, short sample time, fine stability and robustness, etc...|$|E
40|$|Countermeasures against heat seeking {{missiles}} require {{access to}} efficient laser sources, which should emit wavelengths at band I, II and IV. Efficient diode pumped solid-state lasers, combined with efficient non-linear wavelength shifters, allow {{the development of}} practical tuneable mid-IR countermeasure sources. The paper describes the requirements {{and the development of}} a tabletop laser source for study of DIRCM techniques. Jamming laser systems must be able of creating pulse sequences in the frequency range between 100 Hz and 10, 000 Hz, including the capability to mix and <b>sweep</b> the <b>jam</b> frequency. A Nd:YVO 4 pump laser with maximum pump power of 3 Watt and pulse length of 10 ns, and a maximum modulation frequency of 100 kHz was selected. A linear single resonant OPO cavity with 30 mm long, 1 mm thick PPLN crystals was build. With the tabletop laser system we were able to generate wavelengths from 1. 5 to 4 micron. In band I, at 2 micron we can generate between 400 - 550 mW, and in band II, from 3 - 4 micron we can generate 130 - 160 mW laser jam power. The beam quality (M 2) is approximately 2. 5. The power efficiency for the idler was 8. 8 %, while the slope power efficiency was 15 %. Jam patterns are generated by use of an acousto-optic modulato...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{anti-jamming}} {{performance of the}} NR-DCSK system. We consider several practical jamming environments including broad-band jamming (BBJ), partial-time jamming (PTJ), tone jamming (TJ) consisting of both single-tone and multi-tone, and <b>sweep</b> <b>jamming</b> (SWJ). We first analytically derived the bit error rates of the considered system under the BBJ and the PTJ environments in closed-form expressions. Our derived {{results show that the}} system performances under these two jamming environments are enhanced as $P$ increases, where $P$ is the parameter of the NR-DCSK modulation scheme denoting the number of times a chaotic sample is repeated. In addition, our results demonstrate that for the PTJ, the optimal value of the jamming factor is close to zero when the jamming power is small, however, it increases and approaches one as the jamming power enlarges. We then investigate the performance of the considered system under the TJ and the SWJ environments via Monte-Carlo simulations. Our simulations show that single-tone jamming causes a more significant performance degradation than that provided by multi-tone jamming counterparts. Moreover, we point out that the system performance is significantly degraded when the starting frequency of the sweep jammer is close to the carrier frequency of the transmitted chaotic signals, the sweep bandwidth is small, and the sweep time is half of the transmitted bit duration.
