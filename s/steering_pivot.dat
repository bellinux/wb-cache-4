2500|$|Bicycle wheels {{were not}} strong enough for cars [...] until the {{development}} of tangentially spoked wheels. They rapidly became well established in the bicycle and motor tricycle world but were not common on cars until around 1907. This was encouraged by the Rudge-Whitworth patented detachable and interchangeable wheels designed by John Pugh. These wheels owed their resistance to braking and accelerative stresses to their two inner rows of tangential spokes. An outer row of radial spokes gave lateral strength against cornering strains. These wheels were deeply dished so that <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> pins might lie as near {{as possible to the}} center-line of the tires. Their second feature was that they were easily detachable [...] being mounted on splined false hubs.|$|E
50|$|MacPherson {{originally}} {{created the}} design for use at all four wheels, {{but it is more}} commonly used for the front suspension only, where it provides a <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> as well as a suspension mounting for the wheel.|$|E
5000|$|... 1976 models had {{the front}} brake caliper {{moved to the}} right fork leg, behind the fork as opposed to {{in front of the}} fork. This placed the brake caliper nearer the <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> center-line, {{requiring}} slightly less effort to steer.|$|E
50|$|The Hillman Imp {{designers}} {{learned from}} {{the problems with the}} Corvair, having crashed one at a relatively low speed, and designed their rear-engined car with semi-trailing arm suspension at the rear. To attain correct handling balance, they actually used swing axle geometry at the front, with the <b>steering</b> <b>pivots</b> mounted at the outer ends of single swing wishbones. These caused too much understeer and uneven tyre wear, and modifications were made to reduce the positive camber of the front wheels by lowering the swing axle pivot points. Aftermarket kits were also available to do this, and an inexpensive alternative was to insert a tapered shim to change the inclination of the kingpin carrier relative to the wishbone.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, {{with the}} 'turntable' {{steering}} of horse-drawn wagons, {{this was a}} single pin on which the moveable axle was pivoted beneath the wagon's frame. This located the axle from side to side, but {{the weight of the}} wagon was carried on a circular wooden ring turntable surrounding this. Similar centre <b>pivot</b> <b>steering</b> was used by steam traction engines, the kingpin being mounted on the 'perch bracket' beneath the boiler. Some early cars also used centre <b>pivot</b> <b>steering,</b> although it became apparent that it was unsuitable for their increasing speeds.|$|R
50|$|This {{ability to}} {{fine-tune}} ball-jointed suspension allows manufacturers {{to make the}} automobile more stable and easier to steer, compared to the older kingpin style suspension. It may also be quieter and more comfortable, because lateral and fore and aft compliance in the suspension can be introduced in controlled amounts at the control arm inner pivots without compromising {{the integrity of the}} <b>steering</b> axis <b>pivots,</b> which are now ball joints instead of a king pin and trunnions. The smoother ride may also increase tire tread life, since the ball-joint suspension allows better control of suspension geometry and so can provide better tire-to-road contact.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{approximation}} {{to perfect}} Ackermann steering geometry may be generated {{by moving the}} <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> points inward so as to lie on a line drawn between the steering kingpins and {{the centre of the}} rear axle. The <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> points are joined by a rigid bar called the tie rod which can also be part of the steering mechanism, {{in the form of a}} rack and pinion for instance. With perfect Ackermann, at any angle of steering, the centre point of all of the circles traced by all wheels will lie at a common point. Note that this may be difficult to arrange in practice with simple linkages, and designers are advised to draw or analyse their steering systems over the full range of steering angles.|$|E
50|$|The MacPherson strut {{is a type}} of {{automotive}} suspension system that uses the top of a telescopic damper as the upper <b>steering</b> <b>pivot.</b> It is widely used in the front suspension of modern vehicles and is named for American automotive engineer Earle S. MacPherson, who originally invented and developed the design.|$|E
50|$|Hub-center {{steering}} (HCS) is one {{of several}} different types of front end suspension/steering mechanisms used in motorcycles and cargo bicycles. Hub-center steering is characterized by the <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> points being inside the hub of the wheel, rather than above the wheel in the headstock as in the traditional layout. Most hub-center arrangements employ a swingarm that extends {{from the bottom of the}} engine/frame to the centre of the front wheel.|$|E
50|$|Cook Brothers had {{developed}} an unusual vehicle for desert conditions. This had two four-wheel-drive bogies {{each with its}} own engine. <b>Steering</b> was by <b>pivoting</b> the front bogie. They then developed their design into a tank destroyer with two engines at the rear.There was sufficient interest from the Army for a contract for development as the T55. Testing led to modifications to the pilot as the T55E1. Further testing confirmed that it was not suitable and the T55EI was cancelled.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{feasibility}} study of a special electric traction wheel-set for a micro-car for disabled customers. In our university department some solutions on the topic had already been developed in the past. The design has not been carried out in a sequential way, {{but it has been}} lead in “concurrent-engineering” style and it has been speeded up thanks to the employment of solid modelling. The 3 D design technology has helped in a very efficient way {{to take into account the}} impact of any modification on any component to the neighbouring items. The following topics have been considered: design for disabled customers, maximum ease of use and low cost technology. This job therefore has coped the main problems related to designing a new car. Some innovative solutions have been proposed and an overall design procedure has been experienced. This paper in particular describes the results of a research activity connected with the study of the general lay-out of such a wheel set. Some different configurations were explored, each showing its strong and weak points. It is to point out that, while the traditional arrangements connected with gasoline or diesel engines were hugely studied, with the electric traction all the wheel sets must be reshaped. In fact too many car designers tend to use the same lay-out used before, wasting much of the potential advantages offered by electric motors. During this study some radically new designs were explored, for example not using any live axle for transmission or trying to use thrust ball bearing for steering axles. In the following a gallery of proposed and studied solutions will be exposed, showing the most characteristic points. We developed the study and design phases starting from some specifications: the group must be composed by electric motor (geared or not), brake, wheel hub, front or rear traction, in case of front traction the group must have <b>steering</b> <b>pivots</b> (attachments for <b>steering</b> rods). This apparatus has been designed to be used in a light car (which is under development in our faculty). However the proposed design may fit even standard city cars. Design goals were: 1) Keeping very low steering radius (intended use in city environment) 2) Absence of traditional suspension system (our light car has some innovative design in this) 3) Respect of Ackermann geometry. Some different design solution have been developed and are exposed in the paper. The most relevant feature is that every wheel has its own motor, so achieving a dramatic reduction in encumbrance...|$|R

50|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and even}} death wobble are all words and phrases used to {{describe}} a quick (4 - 10 Hz) oscillation of primarily just the steerable wheel(s) of a vehicle. Initially, {{the rest of the}} vehicle remains mostly unaffected, until translated into a vehicle yaw oscillation of increasing amplitude producing loss of control. Vehicles that can experience this oscillation include motorcycles and bicycles, skateboards, and in theory any vehicle with a single <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> point and a sufficient amount of freedom of the steered wheel, including that which exists on some light aircraft with tricycle gear where instability can occur at speeds of less than 50 mph; this does not include most automobiles. The initial instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels and aircraft landing gear.|$|E
5000|$|Have both driveshafts of {{the equal}} length by using an {{intermediate}} shaft (or [...] "lay shaft") {{on one side of}} the transmission. This is already implemented on most modern cars. When the driveshafts have different length and excessive torque is applied, the longer half shaft flexes more than the shorter one. However, this is a short term transient effect. To avoid fatigue failure, the amount of drive shaft torsional deflection must necessarily be small. Effects due to one wheel spinning more slowly than the other are usually negligible. Equal lengths of the driveshafts, in the case of no asymmetric suspension deflection due to roll or bump, keep the drive shaft angles equal. The main component of torque steer occurs when the torques in the driveshaft and the hub are summed vectorially, giving a resultant torque vector around the <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> axis (kingpin). These torques can be substantial, and in the case of shafts making equal angles to the hub shafts, will oppose one another at the steering rack, and so will cancel. These torques are strongly influenced by the position of the driveshaft universal joint (CV joint) in relation to the steering axis, however due to other requirements such as achieving a small or negative scrub radius an optimum solution is not generally possible with simple suspension configurations such as MacPherson strut.|$|E
50|$|Modern dumpers have {{payloads}} {{of up to}} 10 t {{and usually}} steer by articulating at {{the middle of the}} chassis (<b>pivot</b> <b>steering).</b> They have multi-cylinder diesel engines, some turbocharged, electric start and hydraulics for tipping and steering and are usually four-wheel drive. An A-frame known as a ROPS (Roll-Over Protection) frame, may be fitted over the seat to protect the driver if the dumper rolls over. Some dumpers have FOPS (Falling Object Protection) as well. Lifting skips are available for discharging above ground level. In the 1990s dumpers with swivel skips, which could be rotated to tip sideways, became popular, especially for working in narrow sites such as road works. Dumpers are {{the most common cause of}} accidents involving construction plant.|$|R
50|$|Clark {{provided}} a 5-ton prototype, {{based on their}} Model 75 log-skidder, powered by a Cummins 6-cyl. diesel engine. Caterpillar's entries were in the eight-ton class and were designated: XM520 (8-ton cargo truck), XM553 (10-ton wrecker recovering) and XM559 (8-ton, 2.500-gallon tanker). Le Tourneau-Westinghouse offered three variants in the 15-ton class: XM437 Cargo, XM438 Tanker and XM554 Wrecker.Without exception, the prototypes consisted of two segments, housing engine and driver's compartment {{in the front and}} using the rear part as main transport unit, whereby steering was accomplished by articulating the whole front unit relative to the rear, as opposed to <b>pivot</b> <b>steering</b> the front wheels conventionally. The large wheels with big, low-pressure tires were mounted without any suspension or steering mechanism, greatly simplifying the design. In order to keep the wheels on the ground on uneven terrain, the front and rear units could not only swivel around a vertical axis, but also along the vehicle's longitudinal axis, allowing significant articulation.|$|R
5000|$|Active guiding {{systems are}} {{composed}} of a sensor, an actuator connected to a guide mechanism, and a controller. The sensor can be any detector, which can reliably pick up the edges of a web. The most common types of sensors are pneumatic (only works with nonporous webs), optical (works well with opaque webs), ultrasonic (works with most material), or paddies (thick webs). Recent developments have introduced to the industry a new sensor technology based on light scattering and spatial filtering that allows {{the use of an}} optical sensor to detect the edge of any material. [...] The web must be flat (free of curl) and stable (free of flutter) through the edge sensor. For this and other reasons, the sensor is often placed near a roller. If two sensors are used, the web could be guided to the front edge, back edge, or center. Common active guide systems include <b>steering</b> guide (remotely <b>pivoted</b> guide), displacement guide (offset-pivot guide), unwind guide, and rewind guide.|$|R

40|$|Scientists {{have long}} been able to shift the {{direction}} of a laser beam, steering it toward a target, but often the strength and focus of the light is altered. For precision applications, where the quality of the beam cannot be compromised, scientists have typically turned to mechanical steering methods, redirecting the source of the beam by swinging the entire laser apparatus toward the target. Just as the mechanical methods used for turning cars has evolved into simpler, lighter, power steering methods, so has the means by which researchers can direct lasers. Some of the typical contraptions used to redirect lasers are large and bulky, relying on <b>steering</b> gimbals <b>pivoted,</b> rotating supports to shift the device toward its intended target. These devices, some as large and awkward as a piece of heavy luggage, are subject to the same issues confronted by mechanical parts: Components rub, wear out, and get stuck. The poor reliability and bulk not to mention the power requirements to run one of the machines have made mechanical beam steering components less than ideal for use in applications where weight, bulk, and maneuverability are prime concerns, such as on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or a microscope. The solution to developing reliable, lighter weight, nonmechanical steering methods to replace the hefty steering boxes was to think outside the box, and a NASA research partner did just that by developing a new beam steering method that bends and redirects the beam, as opposed to shifting the entire apparatus. The benefits include lower power requirements, a smaller footprint, reduced weight, and better control and flexibility in steering capabilities. Such benefits are realized without sacrificing aperture size, efficiency, or scanning range, and can be applied to myriad uses: propulsion systems, structures, radiation protection systems, and landing systems...|$|R
50|$|The company, {{named after}} its founders the Mathew brothers, {{produced}} forklift trucks in Horley in Surrey, England. Between 1964 and 1971 {{a range of}} forklifts carrying loads of 8000 lb to 17,765 lb, named the Yard Model and the Compact Model were produced. These used axles made by GKN Centrax Ltd at Newton Abbot in Devon, under licence from the Rockwell Standard Company. The frequent failure of axles supplied by Centrax for loads heavier than recommended by Rockwell led to a legal case which eventually went before Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. This model with <b>pivot</b> <b>steering</b> and equal sized wheels was {{the basis of the}} first radial arm machines, the RAM40 with 40 cwt (2 imperial tons) lift capacity, produced c.1980. This was soon improved with a telescopic boom, producing the Teleram 40. These compact machines with the operator sitting above the automatic gearbox and {{just in front of the}} engine proved popular with farmers for their ability to go almost anywhere and do a wide range of jobs, while being able to manoeuvre in confined spaces.|$|R
40|$|This Master of Science thesis report {{describes}} {{the development process}} which aims to create a concept for a new off-road electric wheelchair for Permobil, {{with a focus on}} the vehicle-to-ground interface. It was performed between January and July 2015 as part of the Master Degree program, Industrial Design Engineering at Luleå University of Technology. Everyone does not have the ability to walk or transport themselves by their own means at trails or rough terrain due to injuries or other kinds of disabilities. The project aims to investigate how a solution should be designed in order to suffice the needs of these kinds of users. In order to achieve the goals, a series of research questions was determined, one of which read: How does the vehicle-to-ground interface affect the traction of the vehicle and the comfort of the user?The theoretical framework presents research findings necessary to reach the aim of this project and focuses on topics such as modularity, terrain types, off-road capability, vehicle dynamics and comfort. The overall development process in this project used a method called Pulse Model. The first stage of the project was market research with a primary focus on Permobil’s X 850 model, which was put through several tests. The main problems found were that its lack of lateral stability, low ground clearance, and overall harsh and bumpy ride comfort. The idea generation included both the use of LEGO® Technic bricks, the catalogue method and function prototypes, which resulted in a multitude of different suspension systems. A concept with front and rear trailing arms were chosen for further development and a full-scale prototype was fabricated and tested, which provided important feedback for the final concept. The prototype enabled a set of key aspects that should be considered when designing an off-road wheelchair. These were a ground clearance of at least 200 mm, four wheel drive, 50 / 50 weight distribution, 360 degree rear wheel <b>steering,</b> a front <b>pivot</b> bar suspension system and active lateral stability system in the rear which makes it able to maintain a level seat while traversing side slopes. In this project it was demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} design an off-road electric wheelchair which enables people with disabilities to move around more freely and independently in tough terrain. It is also possible achieve this on Permobil’s new modular chassis, which will reduce both manufacturing, stock and production costs for the products overall life cycle.
