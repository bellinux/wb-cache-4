50|$|<b>Share</b> <b>of</b> <b>Voice</b> in Online Advertising is an ad {{revenue model}} {{that focuses on}} weight or {{percentage}} among other advertisers. For example, if there are four advertisers on a website, each advertiser gets 25 percent of the advertising weight.

Recent {{advances}} in voice-based telecom information systems enable underprivileged and low-literacy users to access and offer online services without expensive devices or specialized technical knowledge. We propose SRLs (speech resource locators), a mechanism that facilitates the creation, access, and <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> online <b>voice</b> content. To test the interaction with SRLs, {{we developed a}} proof-of-concept application that allows for simple <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> content. We subsequently created a smartphone application for the same service that provided a graphical user interface to the online voice application. Our findings show that literate underprivileged people were able to share online voice content on feature phones and smart phones whereas in low-literacy people were unable to access shared content over feature phones but {{able to do so}} on smart phones. We conclude by highlighting opportunities and challenges for the design of voice-based applications that support information sharing...|$|R

50|$|The <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> {{advertising}} {{model is}} contrary to pay per click, cost per impression and/or pay to play (see brokered programming), which are pay-for-performance models that generate revenue for the publisher (typically, the website owner) only if the advertisement is clicked or viewed. The publisher is incentivized to seek out as many advertisers as possible, often on a bid-based system. Furthermore, <b>Share</b> <b>of</b> <b>Voice</b> bypasses the ethical dilemmas that come with PPC and CPI models, which are subject to abuse by click fraud, or Pay to Play tactics (advertorials, product placement, news coverage in exchange for ad purchases, etc) that are not always transparently paid ads.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{commerce}} {{has increasingly}} {{been recognized as}} one of the most significantly prosperous areas for deploying information technology. This paper aims to advance the value of the information by providing a novel voice-information sharing mechanism. The proposed mechanism is a combination of a location-based information service known as a Killer App and a virtual community that consequently becomes a WCP (Wireless Content Provider). This community embodies context aware intelligence by analyzing the context-sensitive behavior of the community members and; furthermore, enabling proactive and precise context sensitive voice-information sharing. This voice-information sharing mechanism is comprised of an IVR system, a location service, EPN (Euclidean distance with Positive and Negative Strength) Clustering, Naïve Bayesian Prediction, and a set of metrics for monitoring the progress of the community. The primitive results show that our mechanism satisfactorily reaches the goal <b>of</b> proactive, precise <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> information between community members...|$|R

Email exchanges were used as a form of narrative enquiry that provided opportunity and space to negotiate identities and make meaning from experiences. The exchanges provided a critical space, characterised by trust, honesty and care for the self and for each other, that enabled a <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> authentic <b>voices</b> and a reaffirming of identities that were made vulnerable through the exposing of the self as an emotional, politicised subject.

It is made through an agreement (the co-promotion agreement) which requires a lot of collaboration between the sales and marketing organisations of both companies.

40|$|Termination of a {{telephone}} call can only be realized by the network operator of the receiving party. For this reason, the markets for fixed and mobile call termination are regulated ex-ante including price control. To determine the costs of call termination the current regulatory regime considers only {{those parts of the}} network where customers compete for jointly used resources (mainly bandwidth). Therefore, the critical border is the "demarcation point" between the end customer dedicated access network and the aggregation network where customers compete for bandwidth. In addition to the extent of the overall network cost to be considered (depending on the location of the demarcation point) the traffic <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the <b>voice</b> termination service (which determines how much of the relevant cost is borne by voice termination) compared to all the other services sharing the same NGN/ NGA network needs to be taken into account.

This allows us to compare the impact of different demarcation points and service scenarios on the level <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> termination rates for three NGA architectures (FTTH/P 2 P, FTTH/PON and FTTC).
