40|$|Childhood oppositional defiant {{disorder}} (ODD) has commonly {{been thought}} {{to increase the}} risk of conduct disorder (CD) in late childhood and adolescence. However, <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CD may also emerge during preschool and middle childhood. The few studies that have examined whether ODD increases the risk of such early onset CD have produced equivocal results, potentially due to methodological issues. In this study, a community sample of Norwegian 4 -year-olds (n = 1042, 49. 9 % males) was examined bi-annually over four waves <b>of</b> data collection. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD, CD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depressive disorders were measured through interviews with parents and children using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment and the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment. The results showed that at all ages, more <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD predicted more <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CD at the next age of examination even after adjusting for previous CD and comorbid conditions. The effect of previous ODD on CD two years later did not differ according to gender, SES, or parental cohabitating status at any point in time. There was modest homotypical continuity in <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CD and moderate homotypical continuity in <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD increased from age 4 to 8 and declined to age 10. In conclusion, <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD increase the risk <b>of</b> early onset <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CD. The continuity in <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD, and to some extent CD, combined with an increased risk <b>of</b> early <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CD forecasted by <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD, underscore the importance of detection, prevention and treatment of behavioral disorders already in early childhood...|$|R

40|$|The general aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{contribute}} to the knowledge about co-occurring <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD and depression in adolescence, focusing on sex differences, as well as aetiology, help-seeking and assessment. Studies I–III used epidemiological samples of self-reports from all students in Västmanland aged 15 – 16 and 17 – 18 years. Study I investigated the prevalence <b>of</b> co-occurring <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD and depression, as well as associations between co-occurring <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD and depression and one environmental stress factor; experience of sexual abuse. Study II examined associations between one biological factor—a polymorphism in TFAP- 2 β—and co-occurring <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD with andco-occurringsymptoms of depression. Study III investigated the association between the parent–adolescent relationship and seeking help from specialized mental health services in relation to <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD and/or depression. Study IV was a clinical study among adolescent psychiatric patients that compared self-reported ADHD symptoms via the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale–Adolescent version (ASRS-A) and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale–Adolescent–Screening version (ASRS-A-S) with an ADHD diagnosis determined by the gold-standard method; the Kiddie Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia diagnostic interview. Studies I–III showed that the phenotype <b>of</b> co-occurring <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD and depression is frequent, with a distinct preponderance among girls. Approximately 50 % of both boys and girls with co-occurring <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD and depression had also experienced sexual abuse, indicating that this is a group with multiple risk factors for long-term impaired mental health. Results also support biological sex differences because girls with <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD and a common polymorphism of TFAP- 2 β (absence of a 9 repeat) reported more <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> depression, but boys did not. Further, only 5 % of the adolescents with <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD and/or depression sought help from specialized mental health services. The co-occurrence <b>of</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD and depression was a stronger predictor of help-seeking than all other psychosocial factors investigated, including secure attachment cognitions styles to parents. Among help-seeking girls, co-occurring <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD and depression were more common than <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ADHD without co-occurring <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> depression.

40|$|Objective: Scientific {{knowledge}} about <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> common mental disorders in elite sports is scarce.

Methods: A prospective cohort study with a 12 -month follow-up period was conducted. The study used validated questionnaires to assess <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> common mental disorders (thus not clinically diagnosed) as well as several stressors; an electronic questionnaire was set up and repeatedly distributed. Results: A total of 203 elite athletes gave their written informed consent to participate in the study, from which 143 completed the 12 -month follow-up period (follow-up rate of 70 %). Incidence <b>of</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CMD ranged from 6 % for adverse alcohol use to 57 % for <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> anxiety/depression. Over the follow-up period, around 17 % of the participants reported two simultaneous <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CMD, and around 19 % reported three simultaneous <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CMD.

Conclusions: Substantial 12 -month incidence rates <b>of</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CMD (self-reported and not clinically diagnosed) were found among Dutch elite athletes (especially for anxiety/depression), appearing similar to the ones found among athletes from other sports disciplines and the Dutch general population.

The aim of this study was to examine whether the sleep problems are associated with the maternal <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> depression during pregnancy. The study is part of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. The whole cohort included 3808 participants and our sample consisted of 3242 mothers. Our sample included the mothers who have filled and returned at least one of the three questionnaires during pregnancy. Maternal depression was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at 14 th, 24 th and 34 th weeks of gestation. Maternal quality of sleep in terms <b>of</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> insomnia, sleepiness and self-evaluated general sleep quality was studied using the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire at 14 th, 24 th and 34 th weeks of gestation.

40|$|Background. Mental disorders, {{especially}} depression, {{are common}} problems among the elderly. Objectives. To determine the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> mental disorders, {{with emphasis on}} <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> depressive disorders, in patients aged 65 years and older. Material and methods. The study involved 93 patients (59 women, 34 men, median age 70). The Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire (PRIME -MD PHQ) {{was used for the}} preliminary diagnosis of mental disorders. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9) was used to assess the severity <b>of</b> depressive <b>symptoms.</b> Results. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>of</b> mental disorders were detected in 59 patients (63. 4 %). Thirty six (42. 3 %) patients reported <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> depressive syndrome, 13 (14 %) – <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> anxiety, 3 (3. 2 %) declared alcohol overuse. Sleep disorders were reported by 58 (62 %) patients. In the group of patients who reported depressive syndrome the prevalence of somatic complaints was significantly higher. The positive correlation between the number and severity of somatic complaints and <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> depressive disorders was revealed. In this group sleep disorders and anxiety were also reported significantly more frequent. Among the 59 patients who presented with <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> mental disorders 18 (30. 5 %) were treated pharmacologically due to psychiatric reasons.
