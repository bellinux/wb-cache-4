This paralleled the SAT, which is graded on a scale of 200 to 800 for each section (the narrower range is to distinguish from which test a score comes and to denote less accuracy). However, unlike the old (2005) SAT, the old PSAT did not include higher-level mathematics (e.g., concepts from Algebra II) or an essay in its writing section (which was added to the SAT in 2005).

Significant general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA), and SCA x block effects indicated that there are both additive and non-additive genetic influences on MFA. Individual-tree narrow-sense heritability estimates were variable, ranging from 0. 17 for earlywood (ring) 4 MFA to 0. 51 for earlywood (ring) 20 MFA. Genetic correlations between MFA, specific gravity and the growth traits were non-significant due to large estimated standard errors.

The effects of four <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> were examined in the mainline population {{and the effects of}} seven <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> and four breeding strategies were examined in the elite population.

In contrast, reliabilities of the estimated breeding value (EBV) in later lactation traits are lower than those of earlier lactation traits.

Net merit, selection accuracy, and HL increased by adding lactation persistency to the <b>selection</b> <b>index</b> whose component traits were only milk yields. Lactation persistency of the second and (especially) third parities contributed to increasing HL while maintaining the first five lactation milk yields compared with the <b>selection</b> <b>index</b> whose only component traits were milk yields.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prediction}} of the outcomes from multistage breeding schemes {{is especially important}} for the introduction of genomic selection in dairy cattle. Decorrelated <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> can be used for the optimisation of such breeding schemes. However, they decrease the accuracy of estimated breeding values and, therefore, the genetic gain to an unforeseeable extent and have not been applied to breeding schemes with different generation intervals and selection intensities in each selection path. Methods A grid search was applied in order to identify optimum breeding plans to maximise the genetic gain per year in a multistage, multipath dairy cattle breeding program. In this program, different values of the accuracy of estimated genomic breeding values and of their costs per individual were applied, whereby the total breeding costs were restricted. Both decorrelated <b>indices</b> and optimum <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> were used together with fast multidimensional integration algorithms to produce results. Results In comparison to optimum indices, the genetic gain with decorrelated indices was up to 40 % less and the proportion of individuals undergoing genomic selection was different. Additionally, the interaction between selection paths was counter-intuitive and difficult to interpret. Independent of using decorrelated or optimum <b>selection</b> <b>indices,</b> genomic <b>selection</b> replaced traditional progeny testing when maximising the genetic gain per year, as long as the accuracy of estimated genomic breeding values was ≥ 0. 45. Overall breeding costs were mainly generated in the path "dam-sire". Selecting males was still the main source of genetic gain per year. Conclusion Decorrelated <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> should not be used because of misleading results and the availability of accurate and fast algorithms for exact multidimensional integration. Genomic selection is the method of choice when maximising the genetic gain per year but genotyping females may not allow for a reduction in overall breeding costs. Furthermore, the economic justification of genotyping females remains questionable. </p...|$|R
40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{is introduced}} {{to quantify the}} significance of accelerometer locations for fault diagnosis of helicopter gearboxes. The basis for this methodology is an influence model which represents the effect of various component faults on accelerometer readings. Based on this model, a set of <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> are defined to characterize the diagnosability of each component, the coverage of each accelerometer, and the relative redundancy between the accelerometers. The effectiveness of these indices is evaluated experimentally by measurement-fault data obtained from an OH- 58 A main rotor gearbox. These data are used to obtain a ranking of individual accelerometers according to their significance in diagnosis. Comparison between the experimentally obtained rankings and those obtained from the <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> indicates that the proposed methodology offers a systematic means for accelerometer location selection...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 31 <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> were {{constructed}} on five characters in 33 diversed genotypes of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). High heretability couple with high genetic advance {{expected in the}} next generation and association of characters were the basis for choosing of the characters for discriminant function analysis. Green fodder yield and grain yield have to be simultaneously improved through selection. Amongst the single character <b>selection</b> <b>indices,</b> grains/panicle offered maximum genetic worth (11. 51). In general, inclusion of every character in the function, exerted a progressive relative efficiency over straight selection. The highest relative efficiency over straight selection on grain yield alone was realized while grain yield/plant (x 1), fodder cutting maturity (x 2), green fodder yield/plant (x 3), digestible dry matter/plant (x 4) and grains/panicle (x 5) were concurrently integrated in the function...|$|R
