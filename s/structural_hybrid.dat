40|$|Preconditions for {{the design}} of {{efficient}} organic solar-light-converting systems are strong absorptions across the visible region, the capacity to funnel excited state energy by intermolecular energy transfer, and alternative association processes in the photoinduced electron transfer. In this context, thiopyridyl porphyrins (PorSPy) and ruthenium phthalocyanines (RuPcs) proved to be versatile building blocks for the construction of novel supramolecular Por-Pc hybrid systems (PorSPy-RuPc) by axial coordination at ruthenium. The thiopyridyl groups placed at the bay region of the porphyrins coordinate the RuPc dye. A notable redistribution of the electron density in the new heterochromophore structures evidences the electron-donating/-accepting communication between the two dyes in the supramolecular <b>hybrids.</b> These <b>structural</b> <b>hybrids</b> were investigated physicochemically by means of their ground and excited state reactivities.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss the {{properties}} of particle verbs in light of a proposal about syntactic projection. In section 2 I suggest that projection involves functional structure in two important ways: (i) only functional phrases can be complements, and (ii) lexical heads that take complements and project must be inflected. In section 3, I show that the structure of particle verbs is not uniform with respect to (i) and (ii). On the one hand, a particle always combines with an inflected verb; in this respect, particle verbs look like verb-complement constructions. On the other hand, the particle is not a functional phrase and therefore is not a proper complement, which makes {{the combination of the}} particle and the verb look more like a morphologically complex verb. I argue that syntactic rules can in fact interpret the node dominating the particle and the verb as a projection and as a complex head. In section 4, I show that many of the characteristic properties of particle verbs in the Germanic languages follow from {{the fact that they are}} <b>structural</b> <b>hybrids...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} hybrid materials and epoxy and carbon fiber (CF) composites were improved significantly {{as compared to the}} CF composites made from unmodified epoxy. The reasons could be attributed to the strong interfacial interaction between the CF and the epoxy composites for the existence of carbon nanomaterials. The microstructure and dispersion of carbon nanomaterials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and optical microscopy (OM). The results showed that the dispersion of the hybrid materials in the polymer was superior to other carbon nanomaterials. The high viscosity and shear stress characterized by a rheometer and the high interfacial friction and damping behavior characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) indicated that the strong interfacial interaction was greatly improved between fibers and epoxy composites. Remarkably, the tensile tests presented that the CF composites with hybrid materials and epoxy composites have a better reinforcing and toughening effect on CF, which further verified the strong interfacial interaction between epoxy and CF for special <b>structural</b> <b>hybrid</b> materials...|$|E

Furthermore, the calculation flowchart of the hybrid reliability index is presented and it is solved using the modified limit-step length iterative algorithm, which ensures convergence. And the validity of convergent algorithm for the hybrid reliability model is verified through the calculation examples in literature. In the end, a numerical example is demonstrated to show that the hybrid reliability index is applicable for the wear reliability assessment of mechanisms, where truncated random variables, fuzzy random variables, and interval variables coexist.

40|$|The widely abused {{psychostimulant}} cocaine {{is thought}} to elicit its reinforcing effects primarily via inhibition of the neuronal dopamine transporter (DAT). However, not all DAT inhibitors share cocaine’s behavioral profile, despite similar or greater affinity for the DAT. This {{may be due to}} differential molecular interactions with the DAT. Our previous work using transporter mutants with altered conformational equilibrium (W 84 L and D 313 N) indicated that benztropine and GBR 12909 interact with the DAT in a different manner than cocaine. Here, we expand upon these previous findings, studying a number of structurally different DAT inhibitors for their ability to inhibit [3 H]CFT binding to wildtype, W 84 L and D 313 N transporters.

40|$|The {{asymmetric}} synthesis of novel axially chiral biaryl compounds 5 a-f containing a seven- or eight-membered heterocyclic medium ring is described. These molecules {{can be considered}} to be <b>structural</b> <b>hybrids</b> of allocolchicine- and steganacin-type natural products. The synthesis featured an atropo-diastereoselective biaryl Suzuki coupling in which a benzylic stereocenter efficiently transferred its stereochemical information to the biaryl axis. The coupling conditions were optimized, and two biphenylphosphane ligands (DavePhos and S-Phos) were found to give the highest yields and diastereoselectivities. A three-element stereochemical model was proposed to explain the observed diastereoselectivities. In a second key step, the medium ring of the target molecules was formed by a stereoselective S(N) 1 -type cyclodehydration that probably involved a configurationally stable carbocationic intermediate, as supported by calculations. Alternatively, S(N) 2 -type cyclizations were employed on the same Suzuki coupling products to give the target molecules in a stereodivergent or stereoconvergent manner. These cyclization methods furnished the target hybrid analogues 5 a-f with ee values above 94 %. All analogues were evaluated as antimicrotubule agents and against a panel of cancer-cell lines using colchicine (1) and N-acetylcolchinol (3) as references.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{view of the}} {{importance}} of material reduction and rational structural design due to the rapid increase in oil and steel prices, an optimized <b>structural</b> <b>hybrid</b> design system for the doubler plate of a ship’s hull structure was developed. A direct design process by a structural designer was added to this developed optimized system to increase the design efficiency and provide a way of directly inserting a designer's decisions into the design system process. As the first step of the doubler design system development, the design formulas used in doubler design system were introduced. Based on the introduction of influence coefficients and according to the variations in the doubler length, breadth, doubler thickness, and average corrosion thickness of the main plate, the design formulas for an equivalent plate thickness were developed, and a hybrid design system using these formulas was suggested for the slender doubler plate of a ship structure subjected to a longitudinal in-plane compression load. By using this developed design system, a more rational doubler plate design can be expected considering the efficient reinforcement of the plate members of ship structures.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} automated fabric defect detection methods developed in recent years. Fabric defect detection, as a popular topic in automation, is a necessary and essential step of quality control in the textile manufacturing industry. In categorizing these methods broadly, a major group is regarded as non-motif-based while a minor group is treated as motif-based. Non-motif-based approaches are conventional, whereas the motif-based approach is novel in utilizing motif as a basic manipulation unit. Compared with previously published review papers on fabric inspection, this paper firstly offers an up-to-date survey of different defect detection methods and describes their characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. Secondly, it employs a wider classification of methods and divides them into seven approaches (statistical, spectral, model-based, learning, <b>structural,</b> <b>hybrid,</b> and motif-based) and performs a comparative study across these methods. Thirdly, it also presents a qualitative analysis accompanied by results, including detection success rate for every method it has reviewed. Lastly, insights, synergy and future research directions are discussed.

40|$|We review magnetic, superconducting and non-Fermi-liquid {{properties}} of the structurally layered heavy-fermion compounds CenMmIn 3 n+ 2 m (M=Co, Rh, Ir). These properties suggest d-wave superconductivity and proximity to an antiferromagetic quantum-critical point. Key words: CenMmIn 3 n+ 2 m; d-wave superconductivity; quantum criticality The report [1] of pressure-induced superconductivity in the heavy-fermion compound CeRhIn 5, with a transition temperature exceeding 2 K, has motivated further exploration [2, 3, 4, 5] of this compound and the broader family of materials CenMmIn 3 n+ 2 m, where M is a transition metal Co, Rh or Ir. Diffraction studies [6, 7] show that the family {{can be considered a}} <b>structural</b> <b>hybrid</b> of CeIn 3 and ’MIn 2 ’; for n = 1, single layers of CeIn 3 and ’MIn 2 ’ are stacked sequentually along the tetragonal c-axis, and for n = 2 there are two adjacent layers of CeIn 3 separated by a single layer of ’MIn 2 ’. Crystallographic layering in the n = 1 members produces electronic anisotropy, reflected particularly in a Fermi surface dominated by a slightly warped cylindrical sheet. [8, 9, 10, 11] Though these materials should not be considered strictly 2 -dimensional, their electronic and structural anisotropies do influence magnetic, superconducting and quantum-critical properties.

This process allows to obtain productivity gains reducing sintering time and hence the cost. In current study it was used a machined substrate in which it is built by sintering the remaining part. The purpose of present work was to study the effect of the substrate material and interface microstructure on the fatigue performance under constant and variable block loadings. The sintering laser parts were manufactured in maraging steel AISI 18 Ni 300, while the substrates of hybrid specimens were produced alternatively in two materials: the steel for hot work tools AISI H 13 and the stainless steel AISI 420. Fatigue strength will be quantified in terms of S - N curves. The results show that tensile properties of sintered specimens and of the hybrid parts was similar. Fatigue strength for short lives, of the sintered specimens and hybrid parts was quite similar. However, the fatigue strength of hybrid parts tends to decrease, for long lives, when compared with single sintered specimens. The fatigue tests under block loadings leads to indicate that the application of Miner's law is adequate to predate fatigue life in hybrid components with sintered implants, despite having been observed a tendency to be conservative for long life...|$|E

40|$|The strive {{of architects}} for maximum {{transparency}} and maximum lightness encounters {{issues in the}} cold-formed steel building industry. Closely spaced vertical members are needed to develop the unique properties these structures have, resulting however in only small openings. To increase the transparency of cold-formed steel frames, traditional sheeting materials which are screwed onto the frame are replaced by glass panes which are adhesively bonded to the frame using a structural sealant. In case of such <b>structural</b> <b>hybrid</b> cold-formed steel-glass elements, the sealant-glass system restrains the cold-formed steel members vertically, horizontally and rotationally. In this research, the horizontal translational stiffness of a linear structural sealant connection between cold-formed steel members and monolithic glass panels is determined by means of experimental testing. This paper reports about the obtained data from these experiments. Box-type specimens consisting of two cold-formed steel C-sections or tubular sections adhesively ‘sandwiched’ between two monolithic glass panels were subjected to a tensile force, such that shear must develop in the structural sealant. The horizontal translational stiffness k derived from the experimental relationship between the applied load and the relative displacement between glass and steel, had the same order of magnitude as comparable traditional screwed cold-formed steel-OSB or cold-formed steel-gypsum connections. This study, therefore, demonstrated the potential of these linear adhesive connections to provide sufficient horizontal translational stiffness of a cold-formed steel frame braced with adhesively bonded glass panels...|$|E

The lead compound of the series, 5 -methoxy- 2 -[N-(2 -benzamidoethyl) -N-n-propylamino]tetralin (12 a), displayed high affinities for the dopamine D- 2 A receptor (K-i = 3. 2 nM), the dopamine D- 3 receptor (K-i = 0. 58 nM) as well as the serotonin 5 -HT 1 A receptor (K-i = 0. 82 nM). The structure-affinity relationships of the series suggest that the 2 -amino-tetralin moieties of the compounds occupy the same binding sites as the DPATs in all three receptor subtypes. The benzamidoethyl side chain enhances the affinities of the compounds for an three receptor subtypes, presumably by occupying an accessory binding site. For the dopamine D- 2 and D- 3 receptors, this accessory binding site may be identical to the binding site of the 2 -pyrrolidinylmethyl-derived substituted benzamides. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Versatile {{peroxidase}} (VP) from Bjerkandera adusta is a <b>structural</b> <b>hybrid</b> between lignin (LiP) and manganese (MnP) peroxidase. This hybrid {{combines the}} catalytic {{properties of the}} two above peroxidases, being able to oxidize typical LiP and MnP substrates. The catalytic mechanism is that of classical peroxidases, where the substrate oxidation is carried out by a two-electron multistep reaction {{at the expense of}} hydrogen peroxide. Elucidation of the structures of intermediates in this process is crucial for understanding the mechanism of substrate oxidation. In this work, the reaction of H 2 O 2 with the enzyme in the absence of substrate has been investigated with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The results reveal an EPR signal with partially resolved hyperfine structure typical of an organic radical. The yield of this radical is 30 %. Progressive microwave power saturation measurements indicate that the radical is weakly coupled to a paramagnetic metal ion, suggesting an amino acid radical in moderate distance from the ferryl heme. A tryptophan radical was identified as a protein-based radical formed during the catalytic mechanism of VP from Bjerkandera adusta through X-band and high-field EPR measurements at 94 GHz, aided by computer simulations for both frequency bands. A close analysis of the theoretical model of the VP from Bjerkandera sp. shows the presence of a tryptophan residue near to the heme prosthetic group, which is solvent-exposed {{as in the case of}} LiP and other VPs.
