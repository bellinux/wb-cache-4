5|$|The {{civilian}} posse {{arrived at}} the battleground as the fighting finished. Although they initially congratulated Ross for winning the battle, some of them later complained that Ross had pushed ahead without them <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have to share the glory or the spoils of war.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman quietly {{began to}} regroup the Ansar as a {{religious}} sect. Until 1914, he lived in seclusion in Omdurman or on Aba Island, closely watched by Slatin's intelligence agents. Despite the surveillance he built considerable influence in the White Nile region. He often visited the many mosques in Omdurman to meet his followers with his face covered <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be recognized by government agents. He received many visitors who sought his blessing.|$|E
5|$|After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, {{including}} {{those who did not}} sit as representative peers, were excluded from the House of Commons. Irish peers were more favoured and not subjected to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons.|$|E
50|$|Barre {{once said}} that {{he tried not to}} listen to other guitarists <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be {{influenced}} by them. He said he never took guitar lessons <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not sound like other players. However, one guitarist he has praised and recognized as being an influence is Leslie West, from the American band Mountain.|$|R

5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be prepared either way.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{if he had}} 100,000 strings {{worth of}} gold and silver and used this money to buy {{productive}} property, in a year he would gain 10,000 strings; after ten years or <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have regained the 100,000 strings {{and what would be}} divided among the family would be interest. If it were invested in a pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. He would still have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E
5|$|Hope {{had been}} offered {{a leading role in}} Stanley Kubrick's war film, Full Metal Jacket, when he was offered the role of Gorman. He interacted with the other film's cast and crew, since both were shot near the Battersea Power Station in Nine Elms. The cast who played Colonial Marines (except latecomer Michael Biehn) {{underwent}} several weeks of training with United States Marines without Hope. Director James Cameron said that he wanted Hope separated <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be seen as an outsider, complementing Gorman's onscreen inexperience.|$|E

5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer. He appears to have been {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Kennan {{began his}} program on history, politics, culture, and the Russian {{language}} at the University of Berlin's Oriental Institute. In doing <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{follow in the}} footsteps of his grandfather's younger cousin, George Kennan (1845–1924), a major 19th century expert on Imperial Russia and author of Siberia and the Exile System, a well-received 1891 account of the Czarist prison system. During the course of his diplomatic career, Kennan would master a number of other languages, including German, French, Polish, Czech, Portuguese, and Norwegian.|$|E
5|$|In {{producing}} the English dub {{version of the}} series, Media Blasters chose Lex Lang as Sanosuke's voice actor. When writing Sanosuke's dialogue, Clark Cheng, the writer of the English dub script, noted that the character was smarter {{than he would have}} liked in the first few episodes, so Cheng tried slowly to change the character's dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be more similar to the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Holman Hardt {{is actually the}} one controlling the weather. All of the bizarre weather was the side-effect of his long-silent love for Sheila. He felt guilty that his weather-related problem caused Mootz to crash his car, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> cause it to rain for Mootz. Once he realized Mootz had been drunk {{the night of the}} accident, however, he stopped. Unfortunately, Mulder begins to unintentionally attract Sheila, resulting in a massive thunderstorm that materializes due to the meteorologist's emotions. At the town's high school reunion, however, Hardt admits his love for Sheila, who accepts him. The storm stops, and Hardt and Sheila live happily ever after.|$|E
5|$|When the deanship of the {{law school}} came open in 1929, Macdonald agonized over whether he should seek the job. He {{apparently}} had strong support from several members of the university's board of governors. At the same time however, he was increasingly drawn to politics and accepting the deanship would mean postponing his political ambitions indefinitely. In the end, the job was offered to Sidney Smith, another prominent Canadian academic who accepted on condition that Macdonald remain at the school. Macdonald did stay, but only for one more year. In 1930, he resigned <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be free to enter politics.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1523 Anne was {{secretly}} betrothed to Henry Percy, {{son of the}} 5th Earl of Northumberland, but the betrothal was broken by Cardinal Wolsey in January 1524 and Anne was sent back home to Hever Castle. In February/March 1526, Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne. She resisted his attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, which her sister Mary had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be free to marry Anne. When {{it became clear that}} Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage, the breaking of the Catholic Church's power in England began. In 1532, Henry granted Anne the Marquessate of Pembroke.|$|E

5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E
5|$|N. T. Rama Rao and Garikapati Varalakshmi {{were chosen}} {{as one of}} the leading pairs of actors. During the songs' shoot, Ghantasala taught Rama Rao to play {{harmonium}} and gave him a few music lessons <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look believable in the film. Yandamuri Jogarao and Savitri, who had played minor roles in Shavukar and Pathala Bhairavi, were chosen as the other leading pair. In playing the role of the zamindar, S. V. Ranga Rao exhibited a strange body language, inspired by a stranger he had observed at a railway station. Dr. Sivarama Krishnayya and C.V.V. Panthulu played the role of Rama Rao's father in the Telugu and Tamil versions. Padmanabham played two roles; a postman and Ranga Rao's friend.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, his sons, {{and other}} Confederate {{soldiers}} encountered Union Army cavalry along Grassy Lick Run south of Romney on April 24, 1862. Parsons carried a double-barreled shotgun, {{and proceeded to}} fire his weapon at the Union forces at close range. As Parsons made his escape from the Union Army forces, he saw his son fired upon as he ran across the road, and supposed he had been killed. He traveled {{to the home of}} a Mr.Hott, and told him of the news of his son's possible death. Parsons became pale and was helped down from his horse by Hott's sons, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not fall. According to Hott, Parsons died moments later.|$|E

5|$|To {{play for}} an inter-county GAA team, Canavan {{had to work}} around a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) bylaw, because of a dispute in his parish, Errigal Ciarán. Two clubs claimed to {{represent}} the parish, the established Ballygawley St. Ciaran's club and the newly formed club, then called Errigal Ciaran Naomh Malachai. Players from the Errigal team were not recognised as being GAA members, because the club failed to register correctly. Canavan registered {{as a member of}} the Killyclogher hurling club, even though he didn't play the sport, just <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be eligible for selection for the Tyrone minors. Prior to that, he had not played legitimate club football, but had forged his way onto the Tyrone under-age teams with his performances at school level. The two clubs united under the banner of Errigal Ciaran two years later.|$|E
5|$|Aldridge spent 1917 and 1918 {{with the}} Chicago Cubs, {{serving in the}} bullpen. In 1917 Aldridge played in thirty games, winning six games and losing six, with a 3.12 earned run average and two saves. In 1918 he played only three games, {{pitching}} only twelve innings, before joining the United States Navy during {{the final year of}} World War I. After returning from the war, he played for the Los Angeles Angels, an affiliate of the Cubs, in the Pacific Coast League. Aldridge returned to the Cubs for the 1922 season. He played the next three years for Chicago, with consistent performances. In 1922, 1923 and 1924 he played 36, 30 and 32 games respectively, with 16, 16 and 15 wins in the three seasons, with respective earned run averages of 3.52, 3.48 and 3.50. During this time his son Vic Aldridge, Jr. served unofficially as the Cubs batboy and even had a uniform donated by Mordecai Brown <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look the part. In 1923 he was ejected from a game.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{development}} of Final Fantasy X, game scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{was concerned about the}} relationship between the player and the main character in a Final Fantasy title and wanted {{to try to make the}} story easier to follow. Since the player and the main character find themselves in a new world, Nojima wanted Tidus' understanding of that world to track the player's progress in the game. Nojima felt that Tidus was the easiest character to draw in the first half of Final Fantasy X, because character and player learn about the storyline together. Nojima created a brief description of Tidus for character designer Tetsuya Nomura, and Nomura created a sketch for input from Nojima and other staff members. Nomura was asked to design Tidus differently from the game's theme <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stand out. Movie director Hiroshi Kuwabara noted the difficulty the developers had in making Tidus and the other main characters realistic. The staff wanted to use an undead person as a playable character, and Tidus was meant to be that character. During Final Fantasy X development, however, Nojima saw a film with a similar idea for its protagonist. The role of an undead person was then given to a secondary character, Auron.|$|E
