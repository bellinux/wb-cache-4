The character, originally used by Hart {{in the late}} 1980s, had recently been revived as a superhero gimmick that parodied various wrestlers. At Over the Edge, Hart was to emulate World Championship Wrestling (WCW) wrestler Sting's (Steve Borden) ring entrance by descending from the arena rafters into the ring. The entrance was successfully tested on the November 15, 1998, episode of Sunday Night Heat; however, during his descent at Over the Edge, a cable disengaged from the <b>safety</b> <b>vest</b> he wore, and he fell more than [...] from the rafters into the ring. As he fell, he landed chest-first {{on one of the}} ring's padded turnbuckles. The accident was not seen by television viewers. A pre-recorded interview video was shown at the start of Hart's descent, and when the broadcast returned live, the cameras quickly turned away from the ring to the audience. Soon afterward, Jim Ross, one of the commentators of the event, informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had fallen from the rafters, that the incident was [...] "not a part of the entertainment" [...] and that it was [...] "a real situation". EMTs came down to the ring and gave Hart CPR, but he showed no response to the treatment. Bringing Hart out on a gurney, the EMTs boarded the heavily injured wrestler into an ambulance and took him to a nearby hospital in Kansas City.|$|E

40|$|A {{new design}} of <b>safety</b> <b>vests</b> was {{developed}} for patients with uncontrollable behaviour or altered conscious level in this study. A comprehensive approach for designing functional textile and apparel products was adopted. The design request and exploration of the design situation and problem were identified. The settings in the general and psychiatric wards and the traditional ways {{of the use of}} <b>safety</b> <b>vests</b> on patients were examined. Problems of the traditional <b>safety</b> <b>vests</b> were identified, such as loose fitting design and large armholes, tight neckline which may result in unexpected accidents such as strangulation, difficulty of wearing, limited mobility, and obsolete functional design. A new set of design criteria and specifications were then developed. An interaction matrix of design specification for <b>safety</b> <b>vests</b> was formulated since some of the design specifications are in conflict with each other. For instance, a tight fit design could optimize the level of restraint, but it may result in patients’ psychological and physiological discomfort due to limited mobility.

40|$|A static {{field study}} was conducted, both {{during the day}} and at night, to examine the effect that color {{contrast}} within a <b>safety</b> <b>vest</b> has on noticeability. Fluorescent orange and yellow fabrics were matched with orange, yellow, silver, or white retroreflective trim to appear similar to a <b>safety</b> <b>vest.</b> The method of paired comparisons was used to develop a linear scale of how noticeable the various color combinations appeared under cluttered and uncluttered viewing conditions. The results indicate that color contrast within the <b>safety</b> <b>vest,</b> as well as relative to the environmental surround, affects judgments of noticeability. However, in the nighttime condition color contrast was not an identifiable attribute, as all the retroreflective materials used appeared white when illuminated. In the nighttime condition, the luminance of the retroreflective trim accounted for almost all {{of the variance in the}} noticeability judgments. The results of this study suggest that a design for safety apparel that includes a combination of fluorescent yellow and fluorescent orange fabrics (providing color contrast for the daytime) with silver/white micro-prismatic retroreflective trim (proving high luminance for nighttime) is likely to be the most noticeable combination in both daytime and nighttime conditions...|$|E

The Smart <b>Safety</b> <b>Vest</b> is a proposed &# 039;internet of things&# 039; solution to the heat stress problem in construction. This innovative e-textile monitors the physiological parameters of construction workers in real time, communicates the data to the cloud, then visualises the data on the wearer&# 039;s smart-phone, and in a web-based management system. Alerts warn of anomalies. The feasibility of this system has been validated through iterative design and by rigorous laboratory tests. This paper reports the experimental procedure used to investigate microclimate variations prior to field testing, which involved a sweating manikin placed in a thermal chamber. Various microclimate scenarios were tested on different layers of protective clothing, and during different activity levels with carefully chosen sweat rates and walking speeds to represent working conditions in construction. These tests showed variations in microclimates under different working and clothing conditions. This research provides initial evidence about microclimate variations, offering useful insights for regulators.

40|$|A virtual {{human body}} model (HBM), {{developed}} for vehicle crash simulations, {{was used to}} conduct a pilot study of dangerous accidents that occur in equestrian sports. It was performed to illustrate the potential that the explicit finite element (FE) HBMs have to improve rider safety and to assess the protective capacity of the <b>safety</b> <b>vest.</b> Four different questions were addressed: 1. When a rider is trampled by a horse, how does the risk of injury vary with chest impact location? 2. Does a safety-vest provide protection if the rider is kicked by a horse and does the protection vary with {{the violence of the}} hoof impact? 3. Can a safety-vest provide any benefit when the rider is hit by the horse after a rotational fall? 4. How does the risk for thoracic injuries vary when the rider falls off the back of a horse at different angles? The HBM was the Total Human Model for Safety AM 50 version 3. 0 (Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan), improved for thorax injury predictability in a previous automotive project. The FE code was LS-DYNA (Livermore Software Technology Corporation, USA). Models of a generic <b>safety</b> <b>vest,</b> a horse impactor and a hoof were developed as part of this project. The risk of thorax injury was evaluated with stresses and strains measured for each rib, and the chest deformation criteria Dmax and DcTHOR. 1. The risk of injury was higher for hoof impacts close to the sternum compared to more lateral locations that had up to 25 % less risk. Hence, this knowledge could be used to optimize novel safety-vest designs with HBM simulations. 2. Yes, the safety-vest provided protection against horse kicks, and it varied with the violence of the kick. Therefore, if the range of impact energy that occurs in real-world accidents is known, HBM simulations can be used to optimize the vest material properties. 3. No, the safety-vest did not provide any benefit when the horse lands on top of the rider. This conclusion suggests that safety measures should focus on preventing this type of accident, rather than designing personal protection for the rider. 4. When the rider falls with the head first, the number of predicted rib fractures increases compared to flat falls. However, the model predicts rib fractures for all of the falls simulated from a height of 1. 5 meters for a rider without a <b>safety</b> <b>vest.</b> To conclude, FE HBMs have the potential to improve equestrian safety and further studies on equestrian safety-vests designs are warranted.

40|$|While {{considerable}} {{data indicate}} that positioning retroreflective markings on a pedestrian’s extremities can dramatically enhance nighttime conspicuity, most relevant safety devices (vests) limit coverage to the torso. We asked 120 participants to press a button whenever they recognized that a pedestrian was present during a short drive at night. A test pedestrian wearing different configurations of retroreflective markings was positioned on the left shoulder of an unilluminated two-lane roadway. Compared to an ANSI class-II vest alone, response distances were significantly greater when the vest was supplemented with ankle markings and when a full biological motion configuration was worn. Conspicuity was also greater when the pedestrian was walking and when facing the approaching test vehicle. Relative to a full eleven-element biological motion configuration, adding just two retroreflective ankle straps to a conventional <b>safety</b> <b>vest</b> is considerably more practical while still providing substantial conspicuity benefits...|$|E

40|$|Motorcycle crash related {{injuries}} and deaths are increasing rapidly in many African nations. Utilizing conspicuity measures, such as wearing reflective, fluorescent <b>safety</b> <b>vests,</b> are effective as crash prevention strategies. Furthermore, use of some conspicuity measures is mandated by law among motorcycle-taxi drivers in Tanzania. Nonetheless, uptake remains low. Locally appropriate strategies to improve crash preventative behaviors are needed. To explore whether use of conspicuity measures {{could be improved}} through eliminating cost-barriers, we tested a distribution strategy involving the provision of free motorcycle <b>safety</b> <b>vests</b> among a population of motorcycle-taxi drivers in Moshi, Tanzania. We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial among 180 motorcycle-taxi drivers in which {{half of the participants}} (90) were randomized to the intervention arm and received a free reflective vest. The other half of the participants (90) were randomized to the control arm and did not receive free vests. Whether motorcycle taxi drivers used the reflective vest was then unobtrusively observed on city streets over a period of three months. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate differential uptake of the vests between trial arms. At baseline, 3. 3 % of individuals in both arms used a reflective vest. In three months of follow-up, 79 drivers in the intervention arm and 82 drivers in the control arm were able to be observed. In the intervention arm the average proportion of observations during which drivers were observed to be using a reflective vest was 9. 5 %, compared to 2. 0 % in the control arm (odds ratio: 5. 5, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 1 - 26. 9, p-value: 0. 04).
