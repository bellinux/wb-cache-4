5|$|An {{event of}} grave {{embarrassment to the}} Soviet Union came in October 1981 when one of its {{submarines}} ran aground near the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona. As this was a militarily sensitive location, Sweden took an aggressive stance on the incident, detaining the Whiskey-class <b>sub</b> <b>for</b> two weeks as they awaited an official explanation from Moscow. Eventually it was released, but Stockholm refused to accept Soviet claims that this was merely an accident, especially since numerous unidentified submarines had been spotted near the Swedish coast. Sweden also announced that radiation had been detected emanating from the submarine and they believed it to be carrying nuclear missiles. Moscow would neither confirm nor deny this and instead merely accused the Swedes of espionage.|$|E

25|$|The {{last game}} of the season saw Middlesbrough play Manchester City. They started in next season's kit. After quarter of an hour, City captain Richard Dunne brought down Tuncay in the box to give the home side their second penalty of the season, which saw Dunne sent off. Stewart Downing, who started every league {{game of the}} season, {{converted}} the penalty for his ninth goal of the season. Alves got his fourth of the season on 37 minutes. In the second half, Downing got another to make double figures for the season, and mark the first time Boro had scored more than two goals in one game since the last game of the previous season. It got better when Alves got his second just minutes later. Johnson made it five on 70 minutes. Anthony McMahon made his first appearance of the season coming on as a <b>sub</b> <b>for</b> Luke Young with 15 minutes to play. Rochemback scored a thirty-yard free kick to make it six with his first goal of the season. Jérémie Aliadière got another to make it seven. Elano got a consolation goal, before Afonso Alves completed a hat-trick to give Boro an emphatic 8–1 win. The game was the first time Boro had scored eight in a game since 1974, and {{the first time in the}} top flight since 1950. Alves' third goal was the 500th Boro goal in all competitions at the Riverside, and the 1,000th in the Premier League this season, as well as the club's 600th Premier League goal. It also saw the first time Boro registered five different goalscorers since 1939.|$|E

2500|$|Mickey Stanley covered {{center field}} for the 1968 Tigers, won a Gold Glove Award at the {{position}} and led all American League outfielders with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage. Prior to 1968, Stanley had been used mostly as a backup outfielder, but an injury to Al Kaline expanded his playing time, as Jim Northrup moved to right field to <b>sub</b> <b>for</b> Kaline. [...] When shortstop Ray Oyler went [...] "0 for August", and his batting average fell to [...]135, manager Mayo Smith made {{one of the most}} talked-about managerial moves in baseball history, moving Stanley to shortstop for the last 9 games of the regular season and for all 7 games of the 1968 World Series. The move also allowed Smith to play both Kaline and Northrup in the outfield. Stanley had not played the shortstop position before the 1968 season, but was a talented athlete with a good glove. [...] Though Stanley made 2 errors in the World Series, neither error led to a run being scored. In its [...] "The End of the Century" [...] series, ESPN rated Mayo Smith's decision to move Stanley to shortstop for the World Series as one of the 10 greatest coaching decisions of the 20th Century in any sport.|$|E
