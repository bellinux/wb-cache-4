One hundred <b>seed</b> samples collected from 100 farmers representing ten upazilas under nine major wheat growing districts of Bangladesh were included. <b>Seed</b> health and quality analysis revealed that moisture content of farmer saved <b>seed</b> ranged between 12. 04 - 13. 30 %. Six type’s <b>seed</b> contaminants– weed <b>seeds,</b> insects, varietal mixture, <b>seed</b> with husk, other crop <b>seed</b> and inert matter; and five types of abnormal <b>seeds</b> - black pointed <b>seed,</b> discoloured <b>seed,</b> undersized <b>seed,</b> shriveled <b>seed</b> and insect damaged <b>seed,</b> recorded in Farmer saved <b>seed.</b> On an average, 58. 48 % ‘clean’ or ‘best’ <b>seed</b> was recovered from farmer saved wheat <b>seed</b> by removing the <b>seed</b> contaminants and abnormal <b>seeds</b> through manual <b>seed</b> cleaning. Clean <b>seed</b> had the highest weight, while the undersized and black point Grade 5 <b>seeds</b> were lighter than all other categories of wheat <b>seed.</b> Of the 13 fungi encountered in farmers’ <b>seeds,</b> five target pathogenic fungi identified, in order of prevalence, were - Bipolaris sorokiniana, Alternaria tenuis, Curvularia lunata, Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus flavus.

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by <b>seeding</b> selected storms with silver iodide. It {{was thought that}} the <b>seeding</b> would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two <b>seeding</b> forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government would not approve <b>seeding</b> operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide <b>seeding</b> is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.|$|E
5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen {{also discovered that}} tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water {{and a great deal}} of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As cloud <b>seeding</b> needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that <b>seeding</b> would have no effect.|$|E
40|$|From a plant’s perspective, the {{difference}} between a <b>seed</b> predator and a <b>seed</b> disperser should be straightforward: attract animals that will disperse <b>seeds</b> and defend <b>seeds</b> from potential predators. Unlike pulp-eating frugivores, <b>seed</b> predators regularly encounter diverse plant protective mechanisms. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine feeding constraints, morphological adaptations, and the mechanical process of <b>seed</b> predation. While there is evidence that some <b>seed</b> predators cause severe losses to <b>seed</b> crops, there is also evidence that <b>seed</b> predators enhance <b>seed</b> dispersal and germination. We also examine four methods by which neotropical <b>seed</b> predators may contribute to dispersal. 1) <b>Seed</b> predators examined here ingested fruit when <b>seeds</b> were full-sized, but not yet mature (i. e., <b>seeds</b> of mature fruit may be avoided by <b>seed</b> predators and available for dispersal by other frugivores). 2) Sympatric <b>seed</b> predators may ingest <b>seeds</b> from different plants thus reducing overall predator load on any individual plant. 3) <b>Seed</b> predators that manipulate <b>seeds</b> (e. g., remove pericarp and <b>seed</b> coat) may enhance germination if the prepared <b>seeds</b> are dropped, discarded, or buried and not ingested. 4) Small <b>seeds</b> may miss mastication and swallowed intact with a food bolus. The last mechanism is the most likely to contribute to <b>seed</b> dispersal by the widest array of vertebrate <b>seed</b> predators, but primate <b>seed</b> predators may facilitate <b>seed</b> dispersal using all four mechanisms. Therefore, the traditional dichotomy of <b>seed</b> predator vs. <b>seed</b> disperser oversimplifies the interactions between <b>seed</b> predators and plants. Am. J. Primatol...|$|R

Approximately 80 % of the smallholder farmers in Africa depend for their <b>seed</b> on the informal <b>seed</b> system, consisting of farmers involved in selection, production and dissemination of <b>seed.</b> The lack of overhead, distribution and <b>seed</b> testing costs enables seed-producing farmers to offer <b>seed</b> for low prices, but <b>seed</b> quality is not always good. Seed-producing farmers multiply their <b>seed</b> on-farm without frequent <b>seed</b> renewal, referred to as <b>seed</b> recycling, which may lead to low <b>seed</b> quality. This research analysed the effect of <b>seed</b> recycling on physiological quality and <b>seed</b> health of cowpea and maize, and compared <b>seed</b> quality of the formal and informal <b>seed</b> system.   We tested the physical and physiological quality of cowpea <b>seeds</b> produced by the formal and informal <b>seed</b> system. Five out of six foundation <b>seed</b> samples, 79 out of 81 samples of farmers’ <b>seed,</b> and six out of six <b>seed</b> company samples failed to meet standards for foundation and certified <b>seeds</b> of the National Agriculture <b>Seed</b> Council (NASC), the <b>seed</b> industry regulatory agency in Nigeria. No evidence was found for a negative effect of <b>seed</b> recycling on physiological quality of cowpea <b>seeds.</b> We analysed 45, 500 cowpea <b>seeds</b> for seed-borne bacteria and fungi to compare the performance of formal and informal <b>seed</b> systems. All samples were heavily infected with seed-borne pathogens, including  Fusarium oxysporum (69 % of the samples) and Macrophomina phaseolina (76 %). No evidence was found that <b>seed</b> recycling in the informal <b>seed</b> system did lead to increased levels of seed-borne pathogens. We also analysed <b>seed</b> quality of farmer-produced maize <b>seed</b> to compare it with the formal <b>seed</b> system. The <b>seed</b> company samples had significantly higher germination (99. 3 %) than farmer-produced <b>seed</b> (97. 7 %), but not a single sample passed the requirements for certified <b>seed</b> of the NASC. Twelve seed-borne pathogens were identified including Bipolaris maydis (found in 45 % of the farmer-produced samples), Botryodiplodia theobromae (97 %) and Fusarium verticillioides (100 %). <b>Seed</b> recycling had no {{negative effect on the}} physiological quality or <b>seed</b> health of maize <b>seed.</b> We analysed formal and informal <b>seed</b> systems to assess the opportunities to prevent mycotoxigenic fungi infection in maize <b>seeds.</b> A range of control methods to avoid fungal infection and mycotoxin production is discussed in relation to three criteria for sustainable implementation in developing countries. An integrated approach is recommended, with special attention towards the local <b>seed</b> system. As an overall conclusion of the work it can be stated that the informal <b>seed</b> system did not underperform compared to the formal <b>seed</b> system for cowpea, but did underperform in relation to <b>seed</b> company samples of maize. There was no evidence that <b>seed</b> recycling reduces <b>seed</b> quality of cowpea and maize <b>seed</b> samples, so frequent <b>seed</b> renewal will not improve <b>seed</b> quality of the informal <b>seed</b> system. We recommend a new quality assurance system for the informal <b>seed</b> system based on <b>seed</b> quality testing by farmers themselves, without interference by government or external laboratories. Farmers publish their <b>seed</b> testing results on the bag, while buyers can retest the <b>seed</b> to verify the quality.
