25|$|A fuse {{consists}} of a metal strip or wire fuse element, of small cross-section compared to the circuit conductors, mounted between a pair of electrical terminals, and (usually) enclosed by a non-combustible housing. The fuse is arranged in series to carry all the current passing through the protected circuit. The resistance of the element generates heat due to the current flow. The size and construction of the element is (empirically) determined so that the heat produced for a normal current does not cause the element to attain a high temperature. If too high a current flows, the element rises to a higher temperature and either directly melts, or else melts a <b>soldered</b> <b>joint</b> within the fuse, opening the circuit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Printed {{circuit boards}} (PCBs) are being {{widely used in}} the {{electronic}} packages. <b>Solder</b> <b>joints</b> are often used to interconnect chip resistors and other components onto PCBs. The defects of <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> will increase quality costs and deteriorate performance. If <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> can’t be located accuracy, AOI system will not inspect <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> at the right place of <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> and must lead to misjudgement. Especially, the misjudgement will increase dramatically under uncertain noise disturbance to micro-size <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> due to inaccuracy location. In this work, an eliminating uncertain noise method is proposed and a robust location algorithm for PCB’s <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> is present. Firstly, some location windows are set based on technology parameters of chip and its <b>solder</b> <b>joints,</b> and <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> feature image is obtained from it <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> image based on series of image pre-processing. Secondly, the layout frame outside <b>solder</b> <b>joints,</b> which {{is viewed as a}} noise disturbance to location, is extracted as a binary image and is projected to X axis and Y axis, then the smaller region, which include <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> but no the layout frame, is obtained based on calculating the sum features function of layout frame. Thirdly, the blob feature image of <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> is extracted from its gray images of red, green, blue layers; it may have some noise blob around <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> feature, then an evaluation function is develop to judge blob, which maybe belongs to noise or <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> feature, and only <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> feature are remained. Fourthly, with the help of setting <b>solder</b> <b>joints</b> windows, the integrated projection method is developed to locate <b>solder</b> <b>joints.</b> Finally, the proposed location method is compared with other two algorithms in the experiment.

Although the SAC solder bears a lower creep strain rate {{compared with the}} SnPb solder in common thermal cycling conditions, {{it is found that}} there exits conditions at which the SnPb <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> maintain a longer life than the SAC <b>solder</b> <b>joint.</b> The determination lies on the maximum normalized equivalent stress levels (sigma/E) experienced by the two kinds of <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> during the temperature cycles. Even under the same straining and thermal cycling condition, it is observed that the maximum sigma/E induced in the two kinds of <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> are normally different, {{as a result of their}} different rate of stress relaxation. The analysis shows that both the absolute and relative magnitude of sigma/E experienced by the two kinds of <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> affect the relative life.

50|$|Since {{copper pipe}} quickly conducts heat {{away from a}} joint, great {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the joint is {{properly}} heated through to obtain a good bond. After the joint is properly cleaned, fluxed and fitted, the torch flame is applied to the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it, with the solder applied at the gap between the tube and the fitting. When all the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder and causing the <b>soldered</b> <b>joint</b> not to seal properly. Before oxidation the molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag.
