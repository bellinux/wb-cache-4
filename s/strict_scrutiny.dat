5|$|In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia {{referred}} to the <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> approach but asserted that in reality it was not {{very different from the}} traditional rational nexus standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of the <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina Supreme Court {{declined}} to rehear the case, the Capobiancos filed a petition with the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari. Seven entities filed amici curiae briefs with the Supreme Court {{in support of}} hearing the case. This included amici briefs by two former Solicitors General of the United States, Paul Clement {{on behalf of the}} guardian ad litem, and Greg Garre on behalf of the birth mother, suggesting that the Equal Protection Clause requires applying <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> to ICWA’s race-based placement preferences. The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, the National Council for Adoption, the California State Association of Counties and the Center for Adoption Policy were also among those that submitted briefs.|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
5000|$|Langer's legal victory led to reinterpretation of 'prior restraint' {{to prevent}} inexperienced police {{officers}} from again using an easily obtained [...] "tele-warrant" [...] {{to carry out}} similar raids on art exhibitions. Obtaining a warrant now requires the <b>stricter</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of experienced judges.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the development of}} the law of searches at sea. The statutes authorizing these searches, the cases construing these statutes and the constitutional limitations are examined in detail. Finally, the present trends toward <b>stricter</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of searches on constitutional grounds are discussed and criticized, and a suggested framework for future analysis is presented...|$|R
50|$|Up until June 1946, bills {{passed by}} the National Council still needed the {{unanimous}} assent of the occupation administration to become law. In an agreement signed on June 28, the Allies eased this restriction; Austria was now allowed to proclaim laws {{that had not been}} vetoed by all four Allied commissioners within 31 days of having been passed. Only changes to constitutional law remained subject to <b>stricter</b> <b>scrutiny.</b>|$|R
25|$|Judge Walker {{then found}} Proposition 8 unconstitutional {{because it does}} not pass even a {{rational}} basis review (as he explains in the Equal Protection context), much less <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny.</b>|$|E
25|$|The “informed consent” {{regulation}} {{was challenged}} in court. In January 2013 the U.S. District {{court ruled that}} the law did not specifically target religion and therefore must not pass <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny.</b>|$|E
25|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy, {{who joined}} in the {{plurality}} opinion, wrote separately to express his view that anytime a district is drawn with a pre-ordained racial composition that <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> would apply.|$|E
60|$|In reply, {{the leading}} {{counsel for the}} Crown {{said that it was}} neither his wish nor his duty to strain the law against me, or to put a worse {{interpretation}} upon the facts than they would bear under the <b>strictest</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> He must point out, however, that if the contention of his learned friend were correct, Sir John Bell was one of the wickedest villains who ever disgraced the earth.|$|R
2500|$|Moore is {{significant}} for establishing precedent for wider use of federal writs {{of habeas corpus}} to oversee state court convictions that occurred under conditions that violated federal constitutional rights. It {{marked the beginning of}} <b>stricter</b> <b>scrutiny</b> by the Supreme Court of state criminal trials in terms of their compliance with the Bill of Rights. [...] This ruling reduced the capacity of a local community [...] "to permanently deprive or deny the rights of those who might be prosecuted in its courts." ...|$|R
40|$|UPS and FedEx {{are both}} package {{delivery}} services, however UPS workers are considered employees under the National Labor Relations Act and {{are represented by}} the Teamsters Union. FedEx, which began as an air delivery service is {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Railway Labor Act. In recent years, FedEx management has restructured its relationships with its workers in such a way as to classify them as independent contractors. Legislative actions on both the state and federal level have sought to impose <b>stricter</b> <b>scrutiny</b> on employers classifying their employees as independent contractors...|$|R
25|$|Justice Kennedy also dissented separately, {{arguing that}} the Court failed to apply, in fact, <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> as {{required}} by Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke. Both Scalia and Thomas also dissented separately.|$|E
25|$|When a law {{or other}} act of {{government}} is challenged {{as a violation of}} individual liberty under the Due Process Clause, courts now use two forms of scrutiny or judicial review. The inquiry balances the importance of the governmental interest being served and the appropriateness of the method of implementation against the resulting infringement of individual rights. If the governmental action infringes upon a fundamental right, the highest level of review, <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> is used. To pass <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> the law or the act must be both narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.|$|E
25|$|The dissenting justice on the Colorado Supreme Court {{argued that}} neither a suspect class nor a {{fundamental}} right {{was involved in the}} case, and thus he would have applied a rational basis test instead of <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny.</b>|$|E
60|$|After {{much thought}} they had decided upon a place of {{concealment}} for the quill containing Ronald's credentials, which would, they thought, defy the <b>strictest</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> A hole had been bored from the back into the heel of Ronald's boot deep enough to contain the quill, and after this was inserted in the hiding place the hole was filled up with cobbler's wax, {{so that it would}} need a close examination indeed to discover its existence. Thus, although they were several times closely searched, no document of a suspicious nature was found upon them.|$|R
5000|$|Under the EPC, and in {{particular}} its Article 52, [...] "programs for computers" [...] are not regarded as inventions {{for the purpose of}} granting European patents, but this exclusion from patentability only applies {{to the extent to which}} a European patent application or European patent relates to a computer program as such. As a result of this partial exclusion, and despite the fact that the EPO subjects patent applications in this field to a much <b>stricter</b> <b>scrutiny</b> when compared to their American counterpart, that does not mean that all inventions including some software are de jure not patentable.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{defenders}} of the show {{have suggested that the}} show's notoriety stands as yet more proof of the political motivations behind the anti-Arabist and Islamophobic subjection of Palestinians to the <b>strictest</b> <b>scrutiny</b> and subsequent generalizations of Arabs to support an improper negative stereotype. The argument has been advanced that [...] "Israel is following all the Palestinians, large and small, and placing them under a microscope with a predefined concept of culture, media and religion. It only wants to catch up Palestinians and accuse them on themes of terrorism." [...] Criticism of the show has been regarded as criticism of Islam as a religion.|$|R
25|$|City of Richmond v J.A. Croson Co., 488 US 469 (1989) 6 to 3, {{government}} contracting {{according to}} diversity criteria unlawful. Race preference {{is subject to}} <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> or more difficult to justify than other remedies for discrimination.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruling was}} {{appealed to the}} Court of Appeals. On August 15, 2014 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{reversed}} {{the decision by the}} lower court, and ruled that the regulation does have to be reviewed under <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> to determine whether it infringes on Orthodox Jews' freedom of religion.|$|E
25|$|These {{landmark}} {{decisions in}} Estrada vs. Escritor established that benevolent neutrality-accommodation is the framework by which free exercise cases must {{be decided in}} the Philippines. This amounts to a requirement that any law which conflicts with a violator's sincerely held religious beliefs must pass a <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> test {{in order to be}} enforceable.|$|E
6000|$|... "In reality," [...] Victor said, [...] "I {{shall be}} safer here than I should be journeying towards the frontier. The papers this morning {{say that in}} {{consequence}} of the escape of suspected persons, and of the emigration of the nobles to join the enemies of France, orders have been sent that the <b>strictest</b> <b>scrutiny</b> is to be exercised on the roads leading to the frontier, over all strangers who may pass through. All who cannot give a perfectly satisfactory account of themselves and produce their papers en regle, are to be arrested and sent to Paris. Therefore, my chance of getting through would be small indeed, whereas while remaining in Paris {{there can be little}} fear of detection." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could see}} the drift of his story plainly enough. His object, under the thin {{disguise}} of the Italian romance, was to meet my unanswerable objection to suspecting Mrs. Beauly's maid--the objection that the woman had no motive for committing herself to an act of murder. If he could practically contradict this, by discovering a motive which I should be obliged to admit, his end would be gained. Those inquiries which I had pledged myself to pursue--those inquiries which might, at any moment, take a turn that directly concerned him--would, in that case, be successfully diverted from the right to the wrong person. The innocent maid would set my <b>strictest</b> <b>scrutiny</b> at defiance; and Dexter would be safely shielded behind her.|$|R
5000|$|The Supreme Court of California {{overturned}} that decision. It {{recognized that}} computer programs {{are subject to}} Free Speech protection. However, in this case, the restrictions placed by the injunction were [...] "content neutral", and were necessary to serve a [...] "significant government interest" [...] (protecting a trade secret). Additionally, CSS was not a subject of public concern and therefore are not subjected to <b>stricter</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> Based on all these findings, the Supreme Court of California remanded for the Court of Appeal to reevaluate {{the validity of the}} trade secret claims to decide whether the injunction should be granted or not. Thus, the narrow question before the Supreme Court of California was whether the preliminary injunction violated Bunner's right to free speech under the United States and California Constitutions even though DVD CCA was presumed likely to prevail on its trade secret claim against Bunner.|$|R
25|$|Echoing Justice O'Connor's {{point from}} the U.S. case, the ruling in Estrada vs. Escritor {{went on to}} quote her as having said that <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> is {{appropriate}} for free exercise challenges because “he compelling interest test reflects the First Amendment’s mandate of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society.|$|E
25|$|For example, in Bolling v. Sharpe, , {{which was}} a {{companion}} case to Brown v. Board of Education, the schools of the District of Columbia were desegregated even though Washington is federal. Likewise, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña , an affirmative action program {{by the federal government}} was subjected to <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> based on equal protection.|$|E
25|$|Congress {{passed the}} Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in 1993, which {{required}} {{the application of}} <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> In response to the Supreme Court's 1997 ruling in City of Boerne v. Flores, which declared the RFRA unconstitutional as applied to the states, Congress passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) in 2000, which grants special privileges to religious landowners and prisoners.|$|E
60|$|As for the Indian, the hesitating gesture excepted, the <b>strictest</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> or the keenest {{suspicion}} {{could have}} detected {{no signs of}} feeling. The senseless form before him was not less moved than he appeared to be, {{so far as the}} human eye could penetrate. Wyandotté was unmoved. He believed that, in curing the sores on his own back in this particular manner, he had done what became a Tuscarora warrior and a chief. Let not the self-styled Christians of civilized society affect horror at this instance of savage justice, so long as they go the whole length of the law of their several communities, in avenging their own fancied wrongs, using the dagger of calumny instead of the scalping-knife, and rending and tearing their victims, by the agency of gold and power, like so many beasts of the field, in all the forms and modes that legal vindictiveness will either justify or tolerate; often exceeding those broad limits, indeed, and seeking impunity behind perjuries and frauds.|$|R
50|$|In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384 (Cal. 2008) was a California Supreme Court {{case where}} {{the court held that}} laws {{treating}} classes of persons differently based on sexual orientation should be subject to <b>strict</b> judicial <b>scrutiny,</b> and that an existing statute and initiative measure limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violate the rights of same-sex couples under the California Constitution and may not be used to preclude them from marrying.|$|R
40|$|In this article, Professor Bernstein {{argues that}} the misuse of {{scientific}} evidence is a growing problem in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and England. The problem is particularly apparent in these common law countries because they all rely on lay jurors as triers of fact to some extent. Courts and commentators in the United States and the Commonwealth have debated {{the extent to which}} the relevant rules of evidence need to be modified and modernized to deal with the 2 ̆ 2 junk science 2 ̆ 2 problem. Overall, there is a trend toward <b>stricter</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of scientific evidence in these countries. The article begins with a discussion of the development of the rules regarding the admissibility of scientific evidence in the United States. It then turns to a discussion of the emerging controversy over scientific evidence in the Commonwealth. The article concludes with a discussion of what Americans can learn from developments in the law of scientific evidence in the Commonwealth, and what Commonwealth scholars can learn from American law...|$|R
25|$|In these {{affirmative action}} cases, the Supreme Court has employed, or {{has said it}} employed, <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> since the affirmative action {{policies}} challenged by the plaintiffs categorized by race. The policy in Grutter, and a Harvard College admissions policy praised by Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, passed muster because the Court deemed that they were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest in diversity. On one side, critics have argued—including Justice Clarence Thomas in his dissent to Grutter—that the scrutiny the Court has applied in some cases is much less searching than true <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> and that the Court has acted not as a principled legal institution but as a biased political one. On the other side, {{it is argued that}} the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to prevent the socio-political subordination of some groups by others, not to prevent classification; since this is so, non-invidious classifications, such as those used by affirmative action programs, should not be subjected to heightened scrutiny.|$|E
25|$|Religious groups became {{concerned}} that this case would be cited as precedent for further regulation of common religious practices and lobbied Congress for legislative protection. RFRA provided a <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny</b> standard, requiring narrowly tailored regulation serving a compelling government interest in any case substantially burdening {{the free exercise of}} religion, regardless of the intent and general applicability of the law.|$|E
25|$|White parted {{company with}} Rehnquist in {{strongly}} supporting the Supreme Court decisions striking down laws that discriminated {{on the basis}} of sex, agreeing with Justice William J. Brennan in 1973's Frontiero v. Richardson that laws discriminating {{on the basis of}} sex should be subject to <b>strict</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> However, only three justices joined Brennan's plurality opinion in Frontiero; in later cases gender discrimination cases would be subjected to intermediate scrutiny (see Craig v. Boren).|$|E
50|$|Censorship in the Soviet Union was {{pervasive}} and strictly enforced. This {{gave rise to}} Samizdat, a clandestine copying and distribution of government-suppressed literature. Art, literature, education, and science were placed under <b>strict</b> ideological <b>scrutiny,</b> since {{they were supposed to}} serve the interests of the victorious proletariat. Socialist realism is an example of such teleologically-oriented art that promoted socialism and communism. All humanities and social sciences were tested for strict accordance with historical materialism.|$|R
6000|$|Austria, {{thanks to}} its own Khevenhullers and its English guineas, was already rising in various quarters: and now when the Prussian Affair is settled, Austria springs up {{everywhere}} like an elastic body with the pressure taken from it; mounts steadily, month after month, in practical success, and in height of humor in a still higher ratio. And {{in the course of}} the next Two Years rises to a great height indeed. Here--snatched, who knows with what difficulty, from that shoreless bottomless slough of an Austrian-Succession War, deservedly forgotten, and avoided by extant mankind--are some of the more essential phenomena, which Friedrich had to witness in those months. To witness, to scan with such intense interest,--rightly, at his peril;--and to interpret as actual [...] "Omens" [...] for him, as monitions of a most indisputable nature! No Haruspex, I suppose, with or without [...] "white beard, and long staff for cutting the Heavenly Vault into compartments from the zenith downwards," [...] could, in Etruria or elsewhere, [...] "watch the flight of birds, now into this compartment, now into that," [...] with <b>stricter</b> <b>scrutiny</b> than, on the new terms, did this young King from his Potsdam Observatory.|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{contends that}} because of the {{continuing}} legislative inability to deal adequately with this issue the courts must apply <b>strict</b> judicial <b>scrutiny</b> by way of a representational reinforcement theory to cases concerning the medicinal use of marijuana.
