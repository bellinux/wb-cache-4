2500|$|Marvin Zindler's {{trademark}} <b>signoff</b> {{at the end}} of each report was, nearly shouting: [...] "Marrrrrvin Zindler..... Eyeeeeeewitness NEWS!" [...] To {{which the}} anchor, usually longtime KTRK newscaster Dave Ward, calmly replied [...] "Thank ya, Marvin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{he moved}} to ABC in a half-hour weekly format that allowed Morgan more room to develop and expand his topical, often ad-libbed satires, hitting popular magazines, soap operas, schools, the BBC, baseball, summer resorts, {{government}} snooping, and landlords.

2500|$|Garroway's relaxed, {{informal}} style when {{on the air}} {{became part}} of his trademark. In 1960, New York Times reviewer Richard F. Shepard wrote, [...] "He does not crash into the home with the false jollity and thunderous witticisms of a backslapper. He is pleasant, serious, scholarly looking and not obtrusively convivial." [...] On television, Garroway {{was known for his}} <b>signoff,</b> saying [...] "Peace" [...] with an upraised palm.|$|E
2500|$|On September 1, 1986, {{amidst a}} brewing battle among CBS's Board of Directors {{for control of}} the company and turmoil at CBS News, Rather closed his {{broadcast}} with the word [...] "courage," [...] repeating it the following night. On September 3, Rather said the masculine noun for the Spanish word for [...] "courage," [...] "coraje" [...] (the primary translation for [...] "courage" [...] in Spanish is [...] "valor"). In the face of media attention and pleas from his staff, Rather abandoned the <b>signoff</b> on September 8.|$|E
2500|$|While {{his wife}} was ill, Jim Jordan had been closing his radio shows by saying [...] "Goodnight, Molly." [...] In early 1938, the Federal Communications Commission ordered him to stop, {{claiming}} it violated a rule about using public airwaves for personal communications. After a few weeks' deliberation, the Commission found that no regulations had been broken, because Molly {{was the name of}} Marian Jordan's radio character. Jordan was then able to resume his [...] "Goodnight, Molly" [...] <b>signoff.</b> In January 1939, the show moved from NBC Chicago to the new NBC West Coast Radio City in Hollywood.|$|E
2500|$|Durante's {{radio show}} was {{bracketed}} with two trademarks: [...] "Inka Dinka Doo" [...] as his opening theme, and the invariable <b>signoff</b> that became another familiar national catchphrase: [...] "Good night, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are." [...] For years Durante preferred {{to keep the}} mystery alive. One theory was that it referred to {{the owner of a}} restaurant in Calabash, North Carolina, where Durante and his troupe had stopped to eat. He was so taken by the food, the service, and the chitchat he told the owner that he would make her famous. Since he did not know her name, he referred to her as [...] "Mrs. Calabash". Another idea was that it was a personal salute to his deceased first wife, Jeanne (Olsen) Durante, who died in 1943. [...] "Calabash" [...] might be a mangle of Calabasas, the California city where they made their home during the last years of her life. His friend and co-star, Candy Candido, (in an interview with Chuck Shaden's [...] "Speaking of Radio" [...] in 1988), [...] reported that he met the actual woman in Chicago when traveling with Durante, but was sworn to keep the secret. Alternatively, Jimmy's [...] friend and radio producer, Phil Cohan revealed to Chuck Shaden's Speaking of Radio interview in 1988 that it was a fabrication. Needing a closing to his show, the writers tossed around several names settling on Cohan's calabash pipe as the best-sounding moniker.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Bob's Drive-In Theater: Originally debuting in January 1984 as The Movie Channel's Drive-In Theater and airing on Fridays in late prime time, {{the weekly}} double feature {{showcase}} presented {{a mix of}} cult films, B movies and some exploitation films. In January 1986, the program was moved to Saturday nights with {{the appointment of a}} regular host, Joe Bob Briggs (the alter ego of actor and film critic John Bloom, who was asked by TMC management to portray his Texan redneck character – standardly donning cowboy attire and a ten-gallon hat – for a guest hosting role on the program, after gaining notice through his one-man comedic stage show An Evening with Joe Bob Briggs, later retitled Joe Bob Dead in Concert). Each of the features presented on the retitled Joe Bob's Drive-In Theater were bookended by taped wraparound segments that featured Bloom building upon the persona he cultivated in his syndicated newspaper column and stage show, and incorporated many recurring gags from Briggs' unique way of introducing movies (featuring a summary of the amount of violence and nudity included in the films being showcased , with nouns suffixed with [...] "-fu" [...] often being used to refer to objects featured in fight scenes) to colorful tales that often dealt with romantic troubles and brushes with the law that involved him rushing to see a film at a local drive-in. He also read letters from viewers on the air, who often requested specific movies to be aired, some of which were. As Briggs, Bloom also closed each edition with the <b>signoff,</b> [...] "this is Joe Bob Briggs, reminding you that the drive-in will never die". Bloom's work as the Joe Bob character also extended to roles as host of The Movie Channel's Midnight Madness block {{during the second half of}} the 1980s, and for an extension of the [...] "Drive-In Theater", the [...] "All-Night Drive-In", which aired on Fridays from May 1988 to May 1991 as part of the [...] "VCR Overnight" [...] block. After Joe Bob's Drive-In Theater ended its ten-year run on TMC on February 24, 1996, Bloom would reprise the Joe Bob Briggs character as host of TNT's horror film block MonsterVision from 1997 to 2000.|$|E
