5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{lightened}} {{to raise her}} draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
500|$|According to {{literary}} critic Mary Ellen Snodgrass, Irish Thoroughbred {{is not as}} polished as later Roberts works. [...] Snodgrass cites many predictable elements, including the core [...] "confrontation between an overconfident male and an assertive girl-woman". [...] Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, romance novel heroines were generally [...] "trembling virgins", of an inferior class and power level than the hero. The hero often was very rich and powerful, while the heroine worked in traditional, subordinate, female roles, such as governess or secretary. [...] The heroine of Irish Thoroughbred conformed to this pattern in part, by being sexually inexperienced, immature, and poor, but Roberts deliberately deviated {{from the rest of}} the stereotype by providing her with a hot-tempered and independent personality. [...] Her later books have continued in the same vein. [...] As Roberts explains, [...] "My heroine may <b>have</b> problems, <b>she</b> may <b>be</b> vulnerable, but <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intelligent. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> independent and so does he, or I'm not interested in telling their stories." [...] The popularity of this book and Roberts's subsequent novels helped transform the genre, making authors more willing to give heroes and heroines economic and emotional parity.|$|R

The bulk of the convoy reached Malta the next day before the escorts rejoined Force H. A week later she screened the capital ships of Force H as they covered another Malta convoy (Operation Style). Foxhound returned to the UK in August for a refit that lasted until November. The ship was briefly assigned to Escort Group EG.3 in the North Atlantic for convoy escort duties later that month until she {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in late December.|$|E
5|$|Rusalka, {{named after}} the mythological creature, was ordered on 25 January 1865 and {{construction}} began on 10 June at the Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying was not until 6 June 1866. She was launched on 12 September 1867 and completed in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 762,000 rubles. Construction was considerably delayed by late deliveries of drawings, material, and the death of her original builder. The ship struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast in June 1869 and damaged her bottom plating badly enough that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run aground to prevent her from sinking. Rusalka served her entire career with the Baltic Fleet and was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870. The ship had her boilers replaced in 1878 and 1891 and she was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} sold to the Peruvian Navy in 1912, but they never paid the last two {{installments}} and the ship remained inactive at Brest during World War I. The French agreed to take the ship back in 1917, keeping the money already paid, and they sold her in 1918 to a Belgian shipping company that converted her into a freighter. Renamed Péruvier, the ship's engines broke down and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> towed to her destination where part of her cargo of coal was discovered to be on fire during her maiden voyage as a merchant vessel in 1920. Deemed uneconomical to repair, Péruvier was towed to Antwerp and later scrapped in 1923.|$|E

5|$|HMS Hardy was the {{flotilla}} {{leader for}} the H-class destroyers, built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. Hardy was transferred to Freetown, Sierra Leone, in October 1939 to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K. After returning to the United Kingdom in early 1940, the ship became flagship of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla assigned to the Home Fleet. During the Norwegian campaign of 1940, Hardy participated in the First Battle of Narvik where she sank one German destroyer. As the British ships were withdrawing, they were discovered by two other German destroyers that so badly damaged Hardy that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run aground to stop her from sinking. The ship was lifted by a rising tide and eventually capsized.|$|E
5|$|In September 1804, Linois {{attacked}} a small British convoy at Vizagapatam in the Bay of Bengal and captured one ship, but was again driven off by inferior British forces. The damage Marengo suffered {{on the return}} to Isle de France was so severe that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overhauled at Grand Port, and after subsequent cruises in the Red Sea and in the central Indian Ocean, where Linois was again driven away from a large British convoy by inferior British forces, he attempted to return to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope. On the return journey, Linois's ships sailed into the cruising ground of a British squadron participating in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 and was captured by overwhelming forces at the Action of 13 March 1806, almost exactly three years after leaving France. Linois's activities in the Indian Ocean had caused panic and disruption across the region, but the actual damage inflicted on British shipping was negligible and his cruise known more for its failures than its successes. In France, Napoleon was furious and refused to exchange Linois for captured British officers for eight years, leaving him and his crew as prisoners of war until 1814.|$|E
5|$|Shōhō {{was quickly}} located again {{that morning and}} sunk. In turn, the Japanese spotted the oiler, , and her escorting destroyer, which were misidentified as a carrier and a light cruiser. A single dive bomber was lost during the {{consequent}} airstrike that sank the destroyer and damaged Neosho badly enough that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> scuttled a few days later. Late in the afternoon, the Japanese launched a small airstrike, without any escorting fighters, based on an erroneous spot report. The American carriers were far closer to the Japanese than they realized and roughly in line with their intended target. Alerted by radar, some of the American Combat Air Patrol (CAP) was vectored to intercept the Japanese aircraft, the rest being retained near the carriers because of bad weather and fading daylight. The American fighters mauled the Japanese attackers who were forced to call off the attack, {{but some of the}} surviving Japanese pilots became confused in the darkness and attempted to verify if the American carriers were their own before being driven off.|$|E

5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E
