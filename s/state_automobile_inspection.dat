50|$|In Kiev, Ukraine, the Bogdan A091 and A092 buses are {{the most}} common route taxi which can be found running around the city, while the Etalon bus serves on the lower {{ridership}} route. In Kiev, the marshrutka is more popular and the fare is a bit more expensive than the regular public bus. Hail and Ride is possible regardless of the designated bus stop, but generally this is up to driver's final decision (NB: <b>State</b> <b>Automobile</b> <b>inspection</b> (ДАІ) doesn't allow to take passengers outside from the bus stops along the city routes). As of now, marshrutkas in Kiev do not require ticket-perforating, although a passenger can ask for a ticket when paying the fare, but there is no staff working to randomly check the tickets as on a regular bus (although the traditional hole punch still remains on existing vehicles). Outside of Kiev it is not unusual to find marshrutki that are secondhand Western European minibuses or converted vans. Often they still have all the original paintwork advertising the former owner's business.|$|E
