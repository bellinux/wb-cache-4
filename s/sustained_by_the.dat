Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between signification and representation {{in the context of}} social, cultural and philosophical topicalities of today. <b>Sustaining</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> differential theory of language of the French structuralist F. de Saussure and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> theory of simulation of the contemporary philosopher of media J. Baudrillard, it is maintained that under the influence of historical transformations of capitalism the sign and the referent sever from each other. Under the influence of changing of the engineering and the order of fabrication, the production is replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reproduction. That is why, according to J. Baudrillard, the overall process of simulation establishes and the post-marxistic political economy constitutes self–defining non–referential system of signification. <b>Sustaining</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> semiotics of F. de Saussure, the signs of the social status become autonomic in point of the Real, and they exist only in relation with the other signs in the medium of contemporary simulacrum. That is why the social life can be treated as the fighting for the prestige and status. Under these circumstances the classical principle of representation is displaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contemporary principle of simulation.   <! [...] $ 2009 - 12 - 16 12 : 10 : 44 $ [...] ...|$|R

Using the Dvorak technique, the peak intensity of the cyclone was estimated at T-number of 7.5 according to the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), yet the Advanced Dvorak Technique of the CIMSS automatically estimated at T8.0, the highest ranking on the Dvorak Scale. However, since the JTWC, SAB and CIMSS are not the official warning centres for Australian cyclones, these intensities remain unofficial.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} battles of Ginchy and Morval, the 1/10th {{was engaged in}} a purely supporting role: trench networks were constructed and improved near Delville Wood, and the dead collected and buried. A party of two officers and 100 other ranks {{was attached to the}} Third West Lancashire Field Ambulance during the Battle of Morval. After bivouacking at Pont Rémy, the battalion transferred with its division to the relatively quiet Ypres Salient in October. The routine of alternating between the front line, being in support, and in reserve preoccupied the battalion until the Third Battle of Ypres in July 1917. Casualties were nevertheless <b>sustained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> battalion during this period, invariably as a result of shelling and sniping.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mourning}} doves migrate along flyways over land. On rare occasions, mourning doves {{have been}} seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico, but this is exceptional. Spring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males. Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes. However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, <b>sustained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of bird feeders.|$|E

5|$|The {{culture of}} Kerala is {{composite}} and cosmopolitan {{in nature and}} it {{is an integral part of}} Indian culture. It is synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures, defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity <b>sustained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Malayali people. It has been elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures. However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions. Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year. The Malayalam calendar, a solar calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala, finds common usage in planning agricultural and religious activities.|$|E

These currents create the magnetic field that cancels the internal field outside the magnetosphere. They also interact substantially with the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy.

5|$|According to Home Office statistics, an {{estimated}} 400businesses within {{half a mile}} (0.8km) of the blast were affected, 40% of which did not recover. The heaviest damage was <b>sustained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> three buildings nearest the bomb: Michael House, comprising a Marks & Spencer store and a six-storey office block; Longridge House, offices for Royal and Sun Alliance, an insurance company; and the Arndale Centre, a shopping mall. Michael House was deemed beyond economic repair and demolished. Marks & Spencer {{took the opportunity to}} acquire and demolish the adjacent Longridge House, using the enlarged site for the world's biggest branch of the store. The company's fortunes changed during construction, and Selfridges subsequently co-occupied the building; Marks & Spencer leased part of the Lewis's store in the interim. The frontage of the Arndale was badly damaged and was removed in a remodelling of that part of the city centre.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exchange}} rate stability <b>sustained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem {{now known as the}} Triffin dilemma, in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.|$|E

One breach spanning 150km (93mi) across required 5,000personnel, 32,000sandbags, and bulldozers dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to relieve water flow. In Aichi's Ama District, reconstruction efforts for levees, roadways, and infrastructure lasted {{until the end of}} December1959. Due to losses <b>sustained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pearl industry as {{a result of}} the typhoon, Japanese pearl production in 1959 was expected to decrease by 30% in 1959, with production losses of 40% expected in 1960. Monetary losses to the industry were expected to eclipse US$15million, causing Japanese pearl costs to hike up by 20%. Furthermore, the effects of Vera on the country's pearl industry were expected to persist for two to three years.|$|E
