40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that self-gravitation reduces <b>static</b> spherically-symmetric cumulative <b>energy</b> distributions below {{the value of their}} radii times the “Planck force”, which is the inverse of G times the fourth power of c. In this article quantitative treatment of self-gravitation is extended to any <b>static</b> <b>energy</b> density that is nonnegative, smooth and globally integrable. The resulting dimensionless local gravitational energy-reduction factor (namely the inverse of the local gravitational time-dilation factor) is shown to satisfy the zero-momentum nonrelativistic Lippmann-Schwinger quantum scattering equation for a repulsive potential which is proportional (with a known coefficient) to that <b>static</b> <b>energy</b> density. Standard perturbative Born-type iteration of Lippmann-Schwinger equations can diverge for sufficiently strong potentials, which in the gravitational case correspond to sufficiently large <b>static</b> <b>energy</b> densities. We have been able, however, to devise an alternate, completely nonperturbative iteration method for Lippmann-Schwinger equations in coordinate representation. Every one of this nonperturbative method’s successive approximations to the local gravitational energy-reduction factor turns out to be positive and {{less than or equal to}} unity. In consequence, the self-gravitationally corrected <b>static</b> <b>energy</b> contained in any sphere is bounded by that sphere’s diameter times the “Planck force”.

40|$|The zonal and meridional {{components}} of the atmospheric general circulation are used to define a global thermodynamic stream function in dry <b>static</b> <b>energy</b> versus latent heat coordinates. Diabatic motions in the tropical circulations and fluxes driven by midlatitude eddies are found to form a single, global thermodynamic cycle. Calculations based on the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset indicate that the cycle has a peak transport of 428 Sv (Sv = 109  kg s− 1). The thermodynamic cycle encapsulates a globally interconnected heat and water cycle comprising ascent of moist air where latent heat is converted into dry <b>static</b> <b>energy,</b> radiative cooling where dry air loses dry <b>static</b> <b>energy,</b> and a moistening branch where air is warmed and moistened.

The latter includes the long-term mean and interannual variability from 1979 to 2001 and, in the Tropics, corresponds to the large-scale overturning global monsoon and the embedded Hadley and Walker circulations. In the extratropics, it includes the quasi-stationary planetary waves, which are primarily a factor in the Northern Hemisphere winter. In addition to the mean annual cycle, results are presented for the interannual variability. In the extratropics, poleward transports of both latent and dry <b>static</b> <b>energy</b> reinforce one another. However, the results highlight strong cancellations between the transports of latent and dry <b>static</b> <b>energy</b> in the Tropics as moisture is converted into latent heat, and also between quasi-stationary and transient components in the extratropics. Hence the total energy transports and divergences are fairly seamless with latitude and the total interannual variability is substantially less than that of the components. The strong interplay between the transient and quasi-stationary waves in the atmosphere highlights the symbiotic relationship between them, as the stationary waves determine the location and intensity of the storm tracks while the transient disturbances help maintain the stationary waves. These results highlight that observationally there is a very strong constraint that the global energy budget places on atmospheric dynamics. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In recent years, high {{performance}} computing sys-tems have obtained more processing cores and share a last level cache (LLC). However, as their number grows, the core-to-way ratio in the LLC increases, presenting problems to existing cache partitioning techniques which require {{more ways than}} cores. Furthermore, effective energy management of the LLC becomes increasingly important due to its size. This paper proposes a Region Aware Cache Partitioning (RECAP), an LLC energy-saving scheme for high-performance, many-core processors. RE-CAP partitions the data within the cache into shared and private regions. Applications only access the ways containing the data that they require, realising dynamic energy savings.

This paper compares three techniques for reducing <b>static</b> <b>energy</b> consumption in on-chip level- 1 and level- 2 caches. One technique employs low-leakage transistors in the memory cell. Another technique, power supply switching, can be used to turn off memory cells and discard their contents. A third alternative is dynamic threshold modulation, which places memory cells in a standby state that preserves cell contents. In our experiments, we explore the energy/performance trade-offs of these techniques and find that dynamic threshold modulation achieves the best results for level- 1 caches, improving the energy-delay product by 2 % in a level- 1 instruction cache and 7 % in a level- 1 data cache.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Static</b> <b>energy</b> {{dissipation}} in cache memories will {{constitute an}} increasingly larger portion of total microprocessor energy dissipation due to nanoscale technology characteristics {{and the large}} size of on-chip caches. We propose to reduce the <b>static</b> <b>energy</b> dissipation of an on-chip data cache {{by taking advantage of}} the frequent values (FV) that widely exist in a data cache memory. The original FV-based low-power cache design aimed at only reducing dynamic power, at the cost of a 5 % slowdown. We propose a better design that reduces both static and dynamic cache power, and that uses a circuit design that eliminates performance overhead. A designer can utilize our architecture by simulating an application and then synthesizing the FVs into an application-specific FV cache design when values will not change, or by simulating and then writing to an FV-cache with configuration registers when values could change. Furthermore, we describe hardware that can dynamically determine FVs and write to the configuration registers completely transparently.
