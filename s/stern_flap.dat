5|$|Both {{boats were}} {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1909, with U-4 commissioned in August and U-3 in September. During the evaluations {{conducted by the}} Navy, the U-3 design bested the U-1 (Lake) and U-5 (Holland) classes in reliability and provided the best living conditions. They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke.

New farings were also designed to accommodate the increased dimensions of the other new components. The stationary foil was also replaced with a new self-aligning foil in an attempt to reduce unwanted lift due to improper alignment. Stiffness tests were performed on the wake survey gear. The results and implications of the stiffness experiments are also discussed. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{study on}} various methods of {{reducing}} the resistance of patrol craft {{have been carried out}} by many researchers. These methods included the application of stern flaps, stern wedges, and microbubble injection. However, due to its simplicity and practicality, <b>stern</b> <b>flap</b> is the most promising and cost effective method. The effect of a <b>stern</b> <b>flap</b> on the resistance performance of the planing hull crew boat is presented. Model tests were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the <b>stern</b> <b>flap</b> on reducing planing hull craft resistance. Five different <b>stern</b> <b>flap</b> designs were tested as part of systematic investigation to determine the optimum geometrical characteristics of the <b>stern</b> <b>flap.</b> Results of model resistance experiments showed that four of the flaps tested showed an increase in resistance while the flap at zero degree angle reduced the total resistance by 7. 2 percent at 23 knots, and an average reduction rate of 4. 5 percent. At 23 knots, an 8. 2 percent reduction in effective power was predicted...|$|E

40|$|The HALIFAX Class frigates {{comprise}} {{a class of}} 12 warships that will represent Canada?s primary naval defence capability well into the 21 st century. Driven by a concern regarding the escalating cost of fuel to operate the HALIFAX Class frigates, the Institute for Ocean Technology has been contracted by the Department of National Defence to carry out research, {{in collaboration with the}} Defence R&D Canada ? Atlantic, to develop a viable <b>stern</b> <b>flap</b> appendage that will reduce hydrodynamic resistance for a Class-wide blended annual speed profile with secondary benefits such as an increase in forward speed, improved propeller cavitation performance and a reduced stern wave system. Research carried out by other navies has shown that the addition of a suitable stern appendage can reduce warship fuel costs from 5 to 10 % depending on the operational profile of the ship. This paper provides {{a detailed description of the}} hydrodynamic design process for an optimum <b>stern</b> <b>flap</b> appendage suitable for Canada?s HALIFAX Class frigates that includes a literature review, extensive physical and numerical modeling, data analysis procedure and some example results.

40|$|Stern flaps are {{appendages}} {{attached to}} the transom of a vessel which can decrease resistance at some speeds. This can translate to significant fuel savings when applied to a fleet of similar ships. A recent study investigating a <b>stern</b> <b>flap</b> design for the Canadian Navy?s HALIFAX Class frigates showed a significant sensitivity to trim angle at high speeds. Further exploration {{on the role of}} trim angle was conducted using CFD simulations for three naval combatants: the Canadian HALIFAX Class, the U. S. CG- 47 /DD- 963, and the U. S. DDG- 51. The CFD simulations were validated against model test data for each hull type, and then used to determine the role of trim angle in resistance reduction from stern flaps.

40|$|In February 2011, the U. S. Navy {{accepted}} itâ€™s 60 th DDG 51 Class destroyer, {{and there}} are still many more to be built. Propulsion fuel efficiency on this class thus becomes a fertile area for cost saving. NSWCCD has recently embarked on the design of an initial Stern End Bulb for potential retrofit on the DDG 51. Powering evaluation via computational fluid dynamics methods and scale model testing has been completed for an initial stern end bulb design. The speed improvement and the potential fuel saving is presented. In addition, updated fuel savings potential associated with many previously proposed hydrodynamic improvements such as the DDG 51 retrofit bow bulb, a larger diameter propeller, propeller pitch sensor and setting of optimal pitch, <b>stern</b> <b>flap</b> design, twisted rudder, and hull and propeller cleaning, are discussed and fuel savings are estimated...|$|E
