25|$|The {{mechanics}} of drag systems usually consist of {{any number of}} discs (drag washers) arranged in a stack on the <b>spool</b> <b>shaft</b> or in some cases, on the drive shaft. There is generally a screw or lever mechanism that presses against the washers—the higher the pressure, the greater the resistance. Drag washers are commonly made of materials such as steel, Teflon, carbon fiber, other reinforced plastics or metal alloys. Since large fish can generate a lot of pulling power, reels with higher available drag forces (which generate greater heat) for higher-test lines will use stronger and more heat-resistant materials than reels designed for low-test lines. A good drag system is consistent (generates the same force over and over), durable and smooth (no jerkiness).|$|E
50|$|The first steam-powered hoist caused {{problems}} because as it saw use beyond the initial digging, which was its only intended purpose. The hoist broke on 13 November 1866, trapping five miners underground; they were rescued using a winch the following day. Two years later, the hoist {{was replaced with}} a machine taken from the Notre-Dame mine, which had a steam break, gears, and a <b>spool</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E

50|$|More {{advanced}} {{gas turbines}} (such as {{those found in}} modern jet engines) may have 2 or 3 <b>shafts</b> (<b>spools),</b> hundreds of compressor and turbine blades, movable stator blades, and extensive external tubing for fuel, oil and air systems.|$|R
50|$|To {{maintain}} cable tension, a {{torsion spring}} is coupled to the spool. The spool is coupled to {{the shaft of}} a rotational sensor (a potentiometer or rotary encoder). As the transducer's cable extends along with the movable object, it causes the <b>spool</b> and sensor <b>shafts</b> to rotate. The rotating shaft creates an electrical signal proportional to the cable's linear extension or velocity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. the low {{pressure}} oil chamber {{and the high}} pressure oil chamber act directly on Both sides of the rotary valve. It will be large axial force to the valve body If the system working pressure is greater. The resulting outcome is low vibration frequency of the rotary valve driven hydraulic exciter. How to improve the hydraulic exciter frequency?We can improve {{the speed of the}} rotary valve or increase the number of rotary valve guide groove. But if we increase the tank guided number,the diameter of the rotary valve spoo must be increased. Design a rotary valve without axial force can solve the problem of the rotary valve <b>spool</b> <b>shaft</b> size restricted. By calculation and analysis of the rotary valve spool suffered axial force. The work of a single rotary valve chamber pressure problems can be solved spool axial forc...|$|E
40|$|Paragon Films {{has always}} strived to {{increase}} productivity and decrease waist within their company. The plant located in Union Gap, Washington currently has two production lines operating 24 / 7 managed by 2 to 3 people. The heavy line produces 5000 to 10000 revolutions per roll. This production line has a three part system that automatically feeds the paper cores to the spool shafts {{to roll the}} films. Therefore, the employees during that shift {{do not have to}} worry about filling up the bin very often. On the other hand, the second production line, which produces the hand films, does not have a system that can feed paper cores to the <b>spool</b> <b>shaft</b> requiring more constant attention by the employees. The drive of this project was to design and manufacture a similar Core Feeder that would automatically feed the cores to the table. This design had size restriction due to the limited space beside the production line but would still manage to improve productivity in the plant. The Core Feeder System will allow employees to fill the bin with more than 200 and only be revisited every couple hours...|$|E
5000|$|Flat-board design: In this design, a {{flat board}} {{rests on the}} ice. A shaft runs {{perpendicular}} to the board with a spool of line on one end and a trip bar on the other. A spring is mounted to {{one end of the}} board, and a metal [...] "flag pole" [...] is attached to the spring. The flag is set by placing the flag pole under the trip bar. When a fish bites, pulling the line spins the <b>spool,</b> therefore the <b>shaft,</b> and therefore the trip bar. With nothing to hold the flag down, it springs up and alerts the angler to a strike.|$|R
2500|$|At , {{the engines}} {{were still at}} idle power. Power {{settings}} for jet engines are expressed in instrument readings and flight data recorders as percentages labeled as [...] "N1" [...] and [...] "N2". N1 and N2 refer to the <b>spools,</b> or <b>shafts,</b> of a jet engine on which the compressor and turbine blades are mounted; jet engine power is measured {{as a percentage of}} maximum N1 or N2 rpm. Although the shafts are not mechanically connected, the speed of one spool can be calculated based on the speed of the other spool and atmospheric conditions. The Tu-154 manual indicates that a go-around must be initiated at 200 m if the engines are running at or below 75% N2. This is because jet engine throttle response is not linear; jet engines have to [...] "spool up" [...] in order to produce more thrust. At power settings higher than 78%, this response is almost instantaneous; at idle power, it can take a full 8 seconds for a jet engine to [...] "spool up" [...] to full power. On PLF 101, the N2 values were not recorded by the flight data recorder (FDR). The N1 values were, and at 200 m they indicated 32%-33% N1. 75% N2 equates to 51%-52% N1 for the given conditions. As such, the engines were well below the 75% minimum N2 reading, and the crew should have initiated a go-around at this point, even though they were still above Minimum Decision Altitude (MDA). However, they did not go around, and continued the descent. The Final Report would later determine that a go-around was technically possible from as low as 40 m, but that 200 m was the first of many times that the crew were required to go around, but did not.|$|R
