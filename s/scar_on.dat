5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to be that young.|$|E

Examining his corpse, Mulder and Krycek find a <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his neck and realize {{he was in the}} Special Forces stationed in Vietnam in 1970, and one of only two survivors, the other being Cole. They head to the VHA hospital in New Jersey where they discover that Cole was discharged, despite the fact that his doctor does not remember doing so.|$|E

5|$|After {{a fierce}} battle, Ozai slams Aang into a rock, hitting the <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his back from Azula's {{lightning}} {{in the previous}} season and inadvertently releasing his locked seventh chakra, allowing Aang to enter the Avatar State. With the combined power of his past lives, Aang quickly overwhelms Ozai but refuses to kill him. After subduing Ozai, Aang finally understands the lion-turtle's meaning and uses energybending to strip Ozai of his Firebending powers, removing his ability to wage war while Sozin's Comet vanishes beyond the horizon. During his coronation, Zuko promises to aid {{the world in the}} postwar reconstruction. A final scene depicts the main cast gathered in Iroh's new tea shop, while Aang and Katara begin a romantic relationship.|$|E
5|$|Booth's {{body was}} {{shrouded}} {{in a blanket}} and tied {{to the side of}} an old farm wagon for the trip back to Belle Plain. There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him. Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that the}} man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> the back of his neck.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{events are}} {{continually}} occurring on the lunar surface. The most common events are {{those associated with}} micrometeorites, as might be encountered during meteor showers. Impact flashes from such events have been detected from multiple and simultaneous Earth-based observations. Tables of impacts recorded by video cameras exist for years since 2005 {{many of which are}} associated with meteor showers. Furthermore, impact clouds were detected following the crash of ESA's SMART-1 spacecraft, India's Moon Impact Probe and NASA's LCROSS. Impact events leave a visible <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> the surface, and these could be detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution. No impact craters formed between the Clementine (global resolution 100 metre, selected areas 7-20 metre) and SMART-1 (resolution 50 metre) missions have been identified.|$|E

5|$|In early {{drafts of}} Final Fantasy VII, Tifa {{was to be}} a {{background}} character. Her role in AVALANCHE was to add support behind the scenes, and to cheer everyone up after missions, as well as having a particular fondness for Cloud. She was also supposed to have a large <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> her back caused by Cloud, and partial amnesia from the incident when she had received it. A scene intended to imply herself and Cloud having sex was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but it was replaced with a toned down version by Kitase in which a risqué line is followed by a fade to black. In an interview Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become such an issue at the time.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the three}} {{previous}} novels in the Harry Potter series, the main character, Harry Potter, {{has struggled with}} the difficulties of growing up, and the added challenge of being a famed wizard: when Harry was a baby, Lord Voldemort, the most powerful Dark wizard in history, killed Harry's parents but mysteriously vanished after unsuccessfully trying to kill Harry, which left a lightning-shaped <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> Harry's forehead. This results in Harry's immediate fame and his being placed {{in the care of}} his abusive muggle, or non-magical, aunt and uncle, Aunt Petunia Dursley and Uncle Vernon Dursley, who have a son named Dudley Dursley.|$|E
5|$|At the SSR, Carter learns {{from the}} {{crippled}} war veteran Agent Daniel Sousa that the chauvinistic and promotion-seeking Agent Jack Thompson is following a lead on club owner Spider Raymond, {{who is looking}} to fence Stark's inventions. Raymond indeed sells the formula to the silent Leet Brannis. Infiltrating the club in disguise, Carter breaks into Raymond's safe and discovers that the formula has already {{been turned into a}} weapon. By the time Thompson gets there, Raymond is dead, killed by a man in a green suit, who follows Carter back to her apartment and kills her roommate. Carter pushes him out a window, and notices that he has a <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his neck where his voice box once was. After attempting to comfort her, Stark's butler Edwin Jarvis takes Carter to see Dr. Anton Vanko at Stark Industries, who deduces that the weapon was created at a Roxxon Oil refinery.|$|E

5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in Corfu, Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard submarine chaser SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E
5|$|In orbit, the Enterprise {{crew and}} Jameson beam {{down into the}} tunnels beneath Karnas' manor, but find that their arrival was {{anticipated}} and face off against armed guards. Jameson collapses during the fight, and the crew beams back to the Enterprise, where they discover Jameson was not shot but instead the reverse aging drug is destroying his body. Karnas demands to see Jameson or he will kill a hostage every 15 minutes. Picard opts to beam himself, Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), Jameson, and eventually Jameson's wife Anne directly to Karnas' office. Though Karnas initially refuses {{to believe that the}} young man is Jameson, Picard shows him the images of his reverse aging {{over the last few days}} after which Jameson reveals a <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his wrist inflicted by Karnas years ago. Karnas prepares to fire on Jameson to get his revenge, but decides to get his revenge by watching Jameson suffer and die horribly from the drug instead. Jameson dies shortly afterward in his wife's embrace. Karnas agrees to let the hostages go, and to allow Jameson to be buried on Mordan IV at Anne's request.|$|E
5|$|Light Yagami, {{the true}} {{identity}} of Kira, discovers {{the location of}} Mello's hideout. An indirect result {{of this is that}} Mello meets the Shinigami Sidoh, the original owner of Mello's Death Note. Sidoh reveals to him—in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate—that there are two extra fake rules (in addition to a number of real ones specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these spurious rules to fool the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent. However, Light launches a SWAT team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates remote-controlled explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with a <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his face, and the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.|$|E

5|$|On 8 June 1999, Kouao took Climbié {{to a local}} GP surgery. The {{practice}} nurse {{there did}} not carry out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems. By the middle of June 1999, Victoria was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron, an unregistered childminder, who Kouao met at {{her job at the}} hospital. There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron. On several occasions, Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié's fingers. When questioned by Cameron, Kouao said that they were caused by razor blades that Climbié played with. Kouao and Victoria met Ackah on the street on or around 14 June 1999. In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm, Ackah noted a <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> Climbié's cheek, which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator. On 17 June 1999, in response to what she had seen three days earlier, Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié's home, and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable.|$|E
5|$|Pandora's Tower is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where players take {{the role of}} Aeron as he explores a fortress called the Thirteen Towers, suspended above a ravine known as the <b>Scar,</b> <b>on</b> a quest to cure his lover Elena of a curse. Aeron can be controlled through both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk or the Classic Controller. The base from which Aeron explores the Thirteen Towers is the Observatory, a building {{on the edge of}} the Scar. In the Observatory, Aeron can save his progress, and interact with Elena and the merchant Mavda. The main objective when inside the Thirteen Towers is the reach the Masters, powerful monsters housed at the top of each tower in a locked room which act as the game's bosses. These rooms must be accessed by solving puzzles throughout each Tower to unlock the door. On his way through the Towers, Aeron must fight numerous smaller enemies: he can perform a basic melee attack, and a charged attack which deals higher damage and will trigger additional attacks if the player times a button press with the appearance of a targeting ring around Aeron.|$|E
5|$|Sometime after Lochry's Defeat, Brant and Simon Girty {{got into}} an altercation along the Ohio River. According to {{contemporary}} gossip, Girty took exception to Brant's boasting about {{the success of the}} expedition, perhaps because Girty believed his brother George deserved more credit. The two men, who were reportedly drunk, came to blows, which ended when Brant slashed Girty in the head with his sword. The wound, which took several months to heal, left a <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> Girty's forehead. When Brant returned to Detroit in October, he had a sword cut on his leg, which had become infected and initially looked as if it would result in amputation. The wound was officially reported as accidentally self-inflicted, although gossipers said that it {{was the result of the}} fight with Girty. Brant's Iroquois companions returned home, but Brant was compelled to stay in Detroit over the winter in order to recover.|$|E
