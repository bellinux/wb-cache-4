40|$|Different {{forms of}} tocopherols, {{together}} with tocotrienols, are collectively named as vitamin E (a lipid-soluble vitamin with antioxidation effect {{in several stages}} of peroxidation of lipids in vivo) and each possesses different degree of medical, biological and physiochemical significance. Among four tocopherols (α-, β-, γ- and δ-tocopherol), alpha-tocopherol {{has been reported to}} possess the highest biological activity. In order to obtain the larger amounts, vitamin E is synthesized as a racemic mixture of D- and L- forms which are optical isomers, unlike a natural tocopherol that is found only in the D-form. Synthetic vitamin E is derived from petroleum products as allracemic alpha tocopherol and its ester form all-racemic alpha tocopheryl acetate (or DL-tocopheryl acetate). The tocopheryl esters are more stable for an extended time of use. In the belief that vitamin E is a natural <b>skin</b> <b>conditioner</b> and humidifier, it is used in cosmetic industry in the preparation of lipsticks, shadows, powders, humidifiers, soaps, creams, shampoos etc. The recent popularity of vitamin E preparations for topical application, together with reports of adverse dermatological reactions linked to cosmetics containing this vitamin led to concern about the desirability of including these compounds in such products. Therefore, a sensitive, accurate and rapid HPLC method was developed for determination of alpha-tocopherol and its ester form in cosmetics. The chromatographic separation was performed on a column Purospher Star RP 18 (150 x 4. 0 mm i. d., 5 μm), with a mobile phase consisted of a methanol - n-hexane (90 : 10, V/V) The flow rate was kept at 1. 2 ml min- 1. Detection of all-racemic alpha-tocopherol and the ester form all-racemic alpha-tocopheryl acetate was carried out at 220 nm. Effect of various parameters (different concentration of methanol and n-hexane in the mobile phase composition and different columns used), and the separation of alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopheryl acetate from other numerous ingredients present in cosmetic preparations was studied. The proposed method was fully validated according to the ICH guidelines in terms of accuracy, precision, linearity, limit of detection and quantification and range (5). The method is sensitive and allows detection of active components in concentrations of 0, 007 μg and 0, 011 μg for α-tocopherol, and α-tocopherol acetate, respectively, while the lowest concentrations that could be determined were 0, 023 μg, and 0, 033 μg for α-tocopheryl acetate and α-tocopherol, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Cattle {{just love}} calliandra Calliandra calothyrsus is an {{extraordinarily}} versatile species. In April 2002, Spore wrote about its useful ability to release allelopathic or growth inhibiting compounds into the environment, which can reduce infestations of striga weed. In Uganda where dairy farmers were supplied with imported cows, calliandra {{is helping to}} solve another problem how to satisfy the bovine newcomers appetite for greenery without causing deforestation and erosion. Farmers found that a winning combination is zero-grazing with calliandra as high-octane fodder. Dina Twesase is one small-scale farmer who relies on this formula. She feeds her single Friesian cow with calliandra, which she began growing {{with the help of}} the Africare 2000 and the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). Farmers in the region have learned the benefits of planting C. calothyrsus in contour hedgerows to conserve soil and water, improve soil fertility, and obtain fencing materials, firewood, stakes and bee forage. But, as Dina has discovered, calliandra really scores as a source of protein for dairy cattle. A supplement of 3 kg of calliandra is equivalent to 1 kg of expensive commercial dairy meal. She grows the calliandra amongst her crops, avoiding the need to convert any of her small property to pasture. In return for the fancy diet, her cow produces 20 l of milk per day. Marvellous marula In parts of Africa, the marula tree is valued so highly that giving someone the seed kernel is considered a true sign of friendship. Its small golden fruit featured most memorably in Spore 90, which reported how elephants got tipsy when the berries fermented in their stomach. In its native southern Africa, the fruits of the marula tree (Schlerocarya birrea) are used to make a liqueur. More recently, producers have tuned into the potential of this valuable fruit which has four times more vitamin C than oranges as a basis for a whole range of other products. A community-based company in the Limpopo Province of South Africa makes fruit pulp, seed oil and <b>skin</b> <b>conditioner</b> from organic marula. Marula Natural Products Pty Ltd operates on fair trade principles and, as well as processing the fruit, acts as intermediary between African producers and export buyers. Cowpea Plants battle cowpea pests Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp., needs no introduction. Spore has written about this useful grain legume on many occasions, and ACP farmers prize the crop for its high protein levels, resistance to drought and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. But while the cowpea s virtues are well known, the plant does have a major drawback it is highly susceptible to pests and diseases, with losses of up to 90 %. Indeed, Spore has often examined this seemingly intractable problem. There are some encouraging signs, however. Scientists at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) have developed high-yielding varieties with resistance to major diseases, insect pests, nematodes and parasitic weeds. Varieties with resistance to parasitic weeds such as Striga are currently being tested in farmers' fields and early maturing varieties with increased drought and shade tolerance are also being developed. Meanwhile, cowpea producers in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal are learning how to make and use plant-based insecticides. Projet Niébé pour l Afrique (PRONAF) uses high-yielding varieties that are resistant to key pests, diseases and weeds including flower thrips (Megalurothrips sjostedti), pod borer (Maruca vitrata), storage weevils (Callosobruchus maculatus) and Striga combined with botanical insecticides, solar drying, and triple bagging storage techniques. Effective plant-based pesticides include pawpaw, neem and extracts from pepper and tobacco. The many uses of moringa Moringa oleifera, the oleaginous tree found in most tropical countries of Africa, Asia and America, is no stranger to the pages of Spore. It made its first appearance in Spore 19 when we wrote about its seeds, which offer an ecological solution to filtering and purifying water. Moringa is also a very generous tree of life. Its leaves, which are rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins, can be made into a sauce and eaten with cereals. Dried and powdered, they help combat malnutrition, especially in children. This tree may be used in many ways, whether traditional or innovative. In 2002, Spore 100 counted no fewer than 19 different applications. A number of other avenues of research are still being explored, including potential uses as animal fodder, as a vegetable growth hormone, as paper pulp, green fertiliser and as a phytopharmaceutical product. It seems as if moringa has yet to reveal the full range of its virtues. The magic grass vetiver For centuries, the oil extracted from the roots of vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides) has been used in the perfume trade. In October 2004, Spore wrote about how rural dwellers in Mali and Nigeria were selling vetiver to the cosmetics industry. This remarkably useful plant is also used for soil and water conservation, and increasingly, as an environmental tool. When planted as a contour hedge, vetiver acts as a filtering system that slows down rainfall runoff, reduces rilling and collects soil sediments at the hedge face. In ACP regions, vetiver is used to halt erosion, for example, in the Caribbean, Madagascar, Nigeria, Senegal and parts of the Pacific. In Ethiopia and Malawi, the grass is planted on sloping ground to reduce run off and sediment flows in upper watersheds, thus improving water quality further downstream. Spore 80 reported that trials in Thailand had shown that planting rows of vetiver grass could help absorb agrochemicals, particularly pesticides. Similar trials have since been successfully carried out in China and there is now interest in spreading this technology further afield. In South Africa, vetiver has been used to reclaim toxic mine dumps. Vetiver has the advantage of thriving in both wet and dry conditions, and on both highly acidic and alkaline soils. It also has a high tolerance to pests and diseases. Perhaps its most remarkable feature is its extraordinarily long roots, which will grow to depths of 3 to 4 m. Many cultivars are non flowering, which means the plant cannot become a weed. Once established, vetiver needs little maintenance, and its leaves and roots can be used for thatching and weaving. No wonder the Americans call it magic grass! Grain amaranth makes a comeback Grain amaranth is one of the world's forgotten foods. Grown extensively by the Incas and Aztecs of Central and South America, this versatile, hardy grain is packed with vitamins and minerals and may hold out hope for improving food security in dryland ACP regions. Spore 119 wrote about Kenyan farmers who are planting Amaranthus hybridus one of several varieties suitable for grain production {{with the help of the}} local NGO Strategic Poverty Alleviation Systems (SPAS). In Nigeria, a USAID project is also helping farmers to discover the benefits of this long neglected crop. Grain amaranth is especially suitable for hot, dry conditions, and has good resistance to pests and diseases. It grows rapidly and with little water, and is exceptionally high in lysine, a critical amino acid often deficient in plant protein. SPAS has supplied certified seeds for planting, and the hope is to tap growing export markets, as well as domestic ones more than 40 products containing grain amaranth are currently on the health food market in the United States alone.

40|$|The role of {{friction}} in the functional performance of biomaterial interfaces is widely reckoned {{to be critical}} and complicated but poorly understood. To better understand friction forces, we investigated the natural adaptation of the holdfast or byssus of mussels that live in high-energy surf habitats. As the outermost covering of the byssus, the cuticle deserves particular attention for its adaptations to frictional wear under shear. In this study, we coacervated one of three variants of a key cuticular component, mussel foot protein 1, mfp- 1 [(1) Mytilus californianus mcfp- 1, (2) rmfp- 1, and (3) rmfp- 1 -Dopa], with hyaluronic acid (HA) and investigated the wear protection capabilities of these coacervates to surfaces (mica) during shear. Native mcfp- 1 /HA coacervates had an intermediate coefficient {{of friction}} (μ ∼ 0. 3) but conferred excellent wear protection to mica with no damage from applied loads, F ⊥, as high as 300 mN (pressure, P, > 2 MPa). Recombinant rmfp- 1 /HA coacervates exhibited a comparable coefficient of friction (μ ∼ 0. 3); however, wear protection was significantly inferior (damage at F ⊥ > 60 mN) {{compared with that of}} native protein coacervates. Wear protection of rmfp- 1 /HA coacervates increased 5 -fold upon addition of the surface adhesive group 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine, (Dopa). We propose a Dopa-dependent wear protection mechanism to explain the differences in wear protection between coacervates. Our results reveal a significant untapped potential for coacervates in applications that require adhesion, lubrication, and wear protection.

40|$|The {{etiology}} of nosocomial infections, {{the frequency of}} contaminated hands with the different nosocomial pathogens, {{and the role of}} health care workers' hands during outbreaks suggest that a hand hygiene preparation should at least have activity against bacteria, yeasts, and coated viruses. The importance of efficacy in choosing the right hand hygiene product is reflected in the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline on hand hygiene (J. M. Boyce and D. Pittet, Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 51 : 1 - 45, 2002). The best antimicrobial efficacy can be achieved with ethanol (60 to 85 %), isopropanol (60 to 80 %), and n-propanol (60 to 80 %). The activity is broad and immediate. Ethanol at high concentrations (e. g., 95 %) is the most effective treatment against naked viruses, whereas n-propanol seems to be more effective against the resident bacterial flora. The combination of alcohols may have a synergistic effect. The antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine (2 to 4 %) and triclosan (1 to 2 %) is both lower and slower. Additionally, both agents have a risk of bacterial resistance, which is higher for chlorhexidine than triclosan. Their activity is often supported by the mechanical removal of pathogens during hand washing. Taking the antimicrobial efficacy and the mechanical removal together, they are still less effective than the alcohols. Plain soap and water has the lowest efficacy of all. In the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline, promotion of alcohol-based hand rubs containing various emollients instead of irritating soaps and detergents is one strategy to reduce skin damage, dryness, and irritation. Irritant contact dermatitis is highest with preparations containing 4 % chlorhexidine gluconate, less frequent with nonantimicrobial soaps and preparations containing lower concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate, and lowest with well-formulated alcohol-based hand rubs containing emollients and other <b>skin</b> <b>conditioners.</b> Too few published data from comparative trials are available to reliably rank triclosan. Personnel should be reminded that it is neither necessary nor recommended to routinely wash hands after each application of an alcohol-based hand rub.

40|$|Highly {{hydrophobic}} chemicals with {{an extremely}} low aqueous solubility {{in the range}} of a few μg L- 1 are used in a broad range of applications ranging from industrial applications (lubricants, flame retardants, preservatives, etc.) to consumer products like cosmetics (also referred to as personal care products). Their use in “rinse off” products such as shower gels, shampoos, <b>skin</b> creams, hair <b>conditioners,</b> etc., lead to a release of substantial amounts into the aquatic environment via the wastewater pathway. Thus, studies on their environmental effects on aquatic organisms are strongly required, also in regards to the registration under REACH. However, data on potential aquatic toxicity of these highly hydrophobic substances are scarce and the application of ecotoxicological standard tests is by no means straightforward. Due to strong sorption to surfaces like test vessels and test organisms, but also potential degradation and volatilization, the establishment of constant exposure concentrations is difficult and most standard tests are not suitable. Moreover, the analytical quantification of these compounds in range of their low water solubility is technically challenging. One approach addressing this problem is the so-called "poorly solubles approach" proposed by Tolls et al. in 2009. It is intended to be an assessment tool for the environmental impact of poorly soluble substances. It is based upon a grand scale analysis of ecotoxicity data and identified a general threshold value for inert substances with a narcotic mode of action which defines the lower limit of potentially occurrence of any acute or chronic effect on aquatic organisms. Beside this specific approach, the so-called hydrophobicity cut-off in toxicity is often discussed. By this theory, the well-established correlation between increasing log Kow and increasing bioaccumulation (and toxicity) is limited to substances with log Kow values below 6. Above this log Kow, i. e., for highly hydrophobic substances, a cut-off in toxicity is reported, leading to a decreasing aquatic toxicity with increasing hydrophobicity. Multiple explanations for this phenomenon have been published but also strongly questioned by a range of recent studies. The aim of this thesis was (1) to develop and apply a suitable methodology for a reliable adaption of existing ecotoxicological standard tests to highly hydrophobic substances, (2) to develop suitable analytics for the detection of these substances in aqueous media at their solubility range in the lower μg L- 1 area, and (3) to evaluate the results in regards to the “poorly solubles approach” and hydrophobicity cut-off phenomena. Two hydrophobic model substances were selected: bromochlorophene (BCP), a preservative partially used in cosmetics with a log Kow of 6. 12, and dodecylbenzene (DDB), a surfactant precursor substance with a log Kow of 8. 65. A conventional silicone O-ring based passive dosing setup was adapted to test the toxicity of BCP at different concentrations for aquatic organisms of various trophic levels, i. e., algal growth inhibition, Daphnia magna immobilization, and Danio rerio fish-embryo toxicity. Effect concentrations derived by passive dosing were additionally compared with corresponding effect concentrations derived by standard co-solvent setups. At the same time, exposure concentrations (i. e., in the presence of exposed organisms) and freely dissolved concentrations (i. e., without organisms present) of BCP were measured and compared in all test media. The passive dosing format led to EC 50 -values in the lower μg L- 1 range for algae, daphnids, and fish embryos, whereas increased effect concentrations were measured in the co-solvent setups for algae and daphnids. An optimized passive dosing methodology was developed for ecotoxicity testing and solubility determination of highly hydrophobic liquids like DDB in various test systems exactly at its saturation limit, i. e., at maximum solubility. Silicone O-rings were saturated by direct immersion in pure liquid DDB, which resulted in considerable swelling of > 14 % (loading by swelling). In repeated tests, fast equilibration, improved exposure control and good precision of toxicity tests could be demonstrated. First, the solubility of DDB in different media was measured in two test setups based on silicone swelling and long-term direct addition, and was sufficiently determined in all media in the lower μg L- 1 range. Afterwards, the new passive dosing format was further developed to determine algae growth rate inhibition at DDB solubility. Here, a moderate toxicity level of 13 ± 5 % (95 % CI) in a first and 8 ± 3 % (95 % CI) in a repeated test was measured. Subsequent, more aquatic test systems with organisms of different trophic levels were adapted to the new method of passive dosing exactly at saturation. Both, prolonged acute Daphnia magna immobilization as well as Danio rerio fish embryo toxicity tests were conducted and further optimized. For daphnids testing, where the animals freely migrate through the undisturbed water phase, the development of a silicone O-ring enclosure cage was necessary to prevent direct contact of the organism to the dosing polymer. Whereas fish embryos did not show any toxic response within 96 h, Daphnia immobilization was repeatedly found comparatively high at 19. 3 % (mean) within 72 h in the optimized test system. Overall, the results demonstrate that passive dosing in general offers advantages over conventional aqueous toxicity testing of hydrophobic substances like BCP, but also that optimization work led to precise exposure control even at extremely low concentrations of highly hydrophobic liquids like DDB. The new passive dosing approach showed good precision and repeatability and the results offer a good basis for discussions on the reliability of reported hydrophobicity cut-offs in toxicity and the “poorly solubles approach”. A final evaluation of these phenomena based upon the results of just a few substances is still difficult. However, the occurrence of toxic responses at extremely low solubilities could be clearly shown and strongly argue against the universal applicability of toxicity thresholds...|$|R
