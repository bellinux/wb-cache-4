5000|$|A vital {{component}} of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic governor which regulates the idling speed and maximum {{speed of the}} engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery. Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable idling speed and can easily overspeed, resulting in its destruction. Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engine's gear train. [...] These systems {{use a combination of}} springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed. [...] Modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit (ECU). The ECM/ECU receives an engine speed signal, as well as other operating parameters such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature, from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> timing through actuators to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions. Controlling the timing of the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing fuel economy (efficiency), of the engine. The timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the piston before top dead centre. For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel injection when the piston is 10° before TDC, the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection,</b> or timing, is said to be 10° BTDC. Optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its speed and load, and is usually 4° BTDC in 1,350-6,000 HP, net, [...] "medium speed" [...] locomotive, marine and stationary diesel engines.|$|E

Once the pressure in the injector reaches a pre-determined level, the plunger lifts and injection starts.|$|E

The maxillary first molars were extracted and customized-titanium implants were placed immediately in thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were divided into experimental (bisphosphonate) group and control group. At 4 weeks after implantation, the rats in the bisphosphonate group were subcutaneously injected with alendronate three times a week for 6 weeks where as the rats in control group were injected with saline. The rats were sacrificed at 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 weeks after <b>starting</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> and maxillary bones were collected subsequently. Alveolar bone remodeling around the implants were evaluated by radiographic and histologic analysis.

Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures analysis of variance and independent t test at a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS. There was no statistically significant difference in the bone area (%) around implant between the bisphosphonate group and the control group. However, the amount of empty lacuna was significantly increased in the bisphosphonate group, especially in the rats sacrificed at 4 weeks after <b>starting</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> compared to that of the corresponding control group.

The Latin hypercube together with a non-linear programming by quadratic Lagrangian algorithm {{were used in the}} optimisation. Comparisons were made in the engine loads in terms of the optimisation history, objectives, sub-objectives and design parameters. The commonalities of the design parameters of the optimums were summarised. Additionally, a detailed combustion process comparison was conducted on the same engine loads (100 % and 25 % engine loads) between the optimum and baseline designs, respectively. Finally, the effects of the design parameters on the objective were investigated by the response surface methodology. The results indicate that the non-linear programming by quadratic Lagrangian method is an effective algorithm to spot the optimums with the best trade-off between nitrogen oxides and soot emissions. The optimisation process presents better qualities at 100 % and 75 % engine loads than in the case of 50 % and 25 % engine loads. The design parameters of the optimum under each engine load have something in common, namely, that they all prefer late injection, low swirl, large injection angle and slightly smaller nozzle protrusion length.

In-cylinder pressure was recorded in combination with cycle-resolved flame imaging, gaseous emissions and particle size distribution. This complete characterization was performed at three injection phasing settings, with butanol and commercial gasoline. Optical accessibility from below the combustion chamber allowed visualization of diffusive flames induced by fuel deposits; these localized phenomena were correlated to observed changes in engine performance and pollutant species.

To better understand this, high-speed shadowgraphy is used to visualize fuel injection and evaporation at different <b>Start</b> <b>of</b> <b>Injections</b> (SOI). Spray penetration and injection targeting are derived from shadowgraphy movies.

However, spray penetration and ignition sensitivity are barely affected by the injection pressure. There is a critical SOI range, in which a significant amount of fuel is trapped in the crevice volume. Injection in this critical range has a negative influence on the combustion efficiency and ignition sensitivity.
