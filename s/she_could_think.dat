5|$|Chrissie {{plans to}} sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, {{although}} Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of her, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> well of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake {{that he has a}} recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.|$|E
500|$|She {{followed}} her same [...] "writing ritual" [...] {{that she had}} followed for years and used in writing all of her books and poetry: she rented a hotel room, closeted herself there from the early morning to the afternoon, and wrote on legal pads. After deciding upon the theme [...] "America", she wrote down everything <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of about the country, which she then [...] "pushed and squeezed into a poetic form". Angelou recited the poem on January 20, 1993.|$|E
500|$|... "For the Last Time, I'm Dominican" [...] was {{composed}} by Fordham, Perry, and Stevens. Fordham knew {{she wanted to}} write a Latin-themed number for Carla, but could not decide on a style; so she [...] "literally was on iTunes listening to every Latin style of music <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of," [...] before settling on a tango. The song also parodies [...] "Tango: Maureen" [...] from [...] "Rent." [...] The sequence was filmed two months after principal photography, to give Judy Reyes' pelvis enough time to heal for her to be able to tango.|$|E
60|$|She did not answer. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> of her appalling shame.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of Madame Déroulède or of Anne Mie {{without the}} most agonising, the most torturing shame.|$|R
60|$|But now! How was she {{to think}} about all this now? And {{thinking}} of these things, how {{was it possible that}} she should have heart left to feel for the miseries of Lady Fitzgerald? With all her miseries would not Lady Fitzgerald still be more fortunate than she? Let come what might, Lady Fitzgerald had had a life of prosperity and love. No; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of Lady Fitzgerald, nor of Herbert: <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> of Owen Fitzgerald, of her daughter, and of herself.|$|R
500|$|Prior {{to being}} hired at Mirage, the {{producer}} had spent years {{looking for a}} suitable screenwriter – someone who was [...] "equally strong {{in the areas of}} satire and romance" [...] and could think in Austen's language [...] "almost as naturally as he or <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> {{in the language of the}} twentieth century." [...] Doran read screenplays by English and American writers until she came across a series of comedic skits, often in period settings, that actress Emma Thompson had written. Doran believed the humour and style of writing was [...] "exactly what [...] been searching for." [...] Thompson and Doran were already working together on Mirage's 1991 film Dead Again. A week after its completion, the producer selected Thompson to adapt Sense and Sensibility, although she knew that Thompson had never written a screenplay. Also a fan of Austen, Thompson first suggested they adapt Persuasion or Emma before agreeing to Doran's proposal. The actress found that Sense and Sensibility contained more action than she had remembered, and decided it would translate well to drama.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Taylforth {{said that}} she wished that Kathy could {{come back from the}} dead and that {{it was a mistake to}} kill her off. Earlier that year {{executive}} producer Diederick Santer revealed that he would like to have brought back Kathy from the dead but vowed not to revive deceased characters. Taylforth reiterated her desire to return to EastEnders in 2013 and that she heard a writer in 2011 saying that producers wanted her to return and asked her if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of a way to bring Kathy back. She revealed that producer John Yorke told her that killing off Kathy was [...] "one of the biggest mistakes they've ever made", and the writer who had decided to kill off Kathy regretted it afterwards, though said it was a [...] "good idea at the time". EastEnders spokespeople stated there were currently no plans for Taylforth to return and that some of the producers who had said they wanted Kathy to return had since left. [...] In 2014, Taylforth revealed that she doubts whether Kathy is really dead and said that many EastEnders viewers have written with proposed storylines on how she could make a return to the show.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> {{of nothing}} to say, {{and for a}} while they {{remained}} in silence. Then he got up.|$|E
6000|$|Carley {{would have}} fallen but for his support. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think.</b> <b>She</b> was all instinct. Only the amaze--the sudden horror--drifted--faded as before fires of her heart! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{extraordinary}} {{how cold}} she looked. I suppose <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of any appropriate gesture. There can {{have been few}} precedents indeed for such a situation.|$|R
60|$|But {{the girl}} felt no {{softening}} of the heart; that strange fire was still burning in her, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> of the cruel words, the unjust blow.|$|R
60|$|Bernard {{looked at}} her rather keenly. He was a shrewd judge {{of men and women}} and saw that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think.</b>|$|E
60|$|OCTAVIUS. She {{asked me}} how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of {{anything}} now but her dear father. She stifled a sob--[he breaks down].|$|E
60|$|It {{could not}} be Mr. Fotheringham, the only poet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, and she could only beg to be told.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} have misjudged her," [...] he said. [...] "Doubtless while my fa- -, while Adam Dishart lived, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> of you with pain; but after his death--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> {{not even}} <b>think.</b> <b>She</b> {{would have to}} be alone for that.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can do the}} sums, if {{that was}} all, but I don't know what to set out from, or {{anything}} about it. Mamma said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> how I should keep house.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Now Rosina {{generally}} had {{her answer}} ready, and I am very {{sorry to say}} that she did not always speak the truth when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of anything better. On this occasion she was anxious to think of something better, for fear of getting Jaqueline into a scrape about the chemical experiment in her bedroom. But Rosina was fluttered, as we said, by the royal kindness, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of nothing but to curtsy, and say: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you come}} by the train?" [...] she said, at last, reduced in her agony to utter the first unmeaning {{question}} of which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think.</b>|$|E
60|$|Rachel was a {{good deal}} stung by his banter, which she felt to be {{directed}} equally against them both, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of no repartee.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, mamma said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> how Miss May {{could take}} one from thence. The whole place {{is full of}} thieves, and do you know, Bessie Boulder has lost her gold pencil-case." ...|$|R
60|$|Elinor {{would not}} oppose his opinion, because, {{whatever}} might be her general {{estimation of the}} advantage of a public school, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of Edward's abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Alice {{thought the}} whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave {{that she did not}} dare to laugh; and, as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of {{anything}} to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|What {{was to be}} {{done with}} Topsy? Miss Ophelia was quite puzzled. She shut her up in a dark room till <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> about it.|$|E
6000|$|Ida nearly {{fell off}} her perch in her amazement. The only words of which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> were [...] "My {{goodness}} me!" [...] {{so she said}} them.|$|E
60|$|She {{pointed to}} a writing-table and went away, while the first letters so amazed Geraldine that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of nothing else, and hastened to summon Clement.|$|E
60|$|Feemy gave a long, {{long sigh}} as {{she heard the}} word. She wished for no message from her brother; he had robbed her of everything; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of him without horror and shuddering.|$|R
60|$|Then {{what should}} she say {{and what should}} <b>she</b> do? Rachel <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of no plan; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only sit still and pray while the shadow of that awful hour crept ever nearer.|$|R
60|$|Fanny {{left the}} room with a very sorrowful heart; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not feel the {{difference}} to be so small, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction. As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress.|$|R
60|$|She had {{finished}} all the preparations <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of. She sat and waited. She {{listened for the}} door-bell, the telephone. Her eagerness was stilled. Her hands drooped.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Dorcas was not {{satisfied}} with this arrangement; but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of nothing better just then, and appeared determined {{there should be no}} further discussion on the subject.|$|E
60|$|On {{the trip}} back to Oakdale, Abigail Prim cuddled {{in the back seat}} beside her father, told him all that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> to tell of Bridge and his {{goodness}} to her.|$|E
60|$|She {{returned}} to her room to wait for Ursula and Birkin. She wanted to get away, only to get away. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> or feel until she had got away, till she was loosed from this position.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will {{endeavor}} to be good," [...] she said, and then flushed with annoyance at the adjective. Half-dazed {{by the cold}} as <b>she</b> was, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of a more suitable one. Winston, however, retained his gravity.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> {{of another}} word, not one, {{and she fell}} into a horrible silence, {{wringing}} her hands piteously. It was {{impossible for her to}} go on, and impossible for her to leave the floor till the word of release came.|$|R
