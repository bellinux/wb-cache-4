5|$|Dutch records {{suggest that}} at least 453 civilians died during the battle, either {{as a result of}} Allied bombing on the first day or during the {{subsequent}} fighting. After the battle, the residents of Arnhem and its surrounding towns and villages were forcibly evicted from their homes, allowing the Germans to turn the north bank of the Rhine into a heavily defended line. Residents were not allowed to return home without a permit and most did not return until after the war. The Dutch homes were then systematically looted, with the spoils being sent to bombing victims in Germany. The Germans continued to fight Allied forces on the plains between Arnhem and Nijmegen, and the bridge that the 1st Airborne had fought <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> was eventually destroyed by the Allies to deny German forces its use. On 7 October, it was bombed and destroyed by Martin B-26 Marauders of 344th Bomb Group, USAAF. The buildings of Arnhem were heavily shelled by the Allies {{over the next few months}} and suffered further when the city was eventually liberated in April 1945.|$|E
500|$|Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post criticized Depp's acting. [...] "The {{cumulative}} effect isn't pretty. Nor is it kooky, funny, eccentric or even mildly interesting. Indeed, throughout his fey, simpering performance, Depp {{seems to be}} straining <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> weirdness that the entire enterprise begins to feel like those excruciating occasions when your parents tried to be hip. Aside from Burton's usual eye-popping direction, the film's strenuous efforts at becoming a camp classic eventually begin to wear thin." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain {{had thought}} about {{entering}} politics since his return from Vietnam, although 1964 {{had been the only}} time in his life he had ever voted. In 1976, he briefly thought of running for the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida; he had the support of some local figures in Jacksonville, but was convinced by other Republican Party leaders {{that he did not have}} sufficient political experience, funding, or popular support to defeat longtime Democratic incumbent Charles E. Bennett. [...] Instead, he worked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Ronald Reagan's 1976 Republican primary campaign that his base commander reprimanded him for being too politically active for his naval position.|$|E

6000|$|The {{boundary}} of Society was admittedly {{very close to}} Coote and Kipps, and a leading solicitude of the true gentleman was to detect clearly those [...] "beneath" [...] him, and to behave towards them in a proper spirit. [...] "It's jest there it's <b>so</b> <b>'ard</b> <b>for</b> me," [...] said Kipps. He had to cultivate a certain [...] "distance," [...] to acquire altogether the art of checking the presumption of bounders and old friends. It was difficult, Coote admitted.

500|$|At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, Ballard {{won gold}} medals in the Women's 200m T53 in a {{championship}} record time of 29.33 and the Women's 400m T53. After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This is the one I wanted. I was so nervous coming in, you try and tell yourself that {{the worst thing that}} can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is that}} this matters so much. I was so scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I’ve just worked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> this for so long." [...] She also won a bronze medal in the Women's 800mm T54 behind gold medallist Madison de Rozario.|$|E
500|$|The {{residents}} of Arnhem and Oosterbeek (over 450 {{of whom had}} been killed in the battle) were evicted from their homes which were then systematically looted of anything of value to aid refugees in Germany. [...] The shattered settlements were then turned into strong defensive positions to resist future Allied advances. The Arnhem road bridge that the British had fought <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> was bombed by the Allies in October 1944 to deny its use to the Germans. [...] Arnhem itself was extensively shelled by the Allies over the winter and was even hit by short-falling German-fired V-2 rockets. [...] In retaliation for a Dutch railway workers strike supposed to aid the Allies' September advance, the Germans banned all inland freight movement. [...] This prevented food being grown in the north from reaching the south and west of the country and caused thousands of deaths amongst the Dutch population in the Hongerwinter.|$|E
500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the hell out of the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, Lyautey did {{not wish}} to abandon the inland {{territory}} his men had fought <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for,</b> stating that if he withdrew [...] "such a shock would result immediately all over Morocco... that a general revolt would arise under our feet, on all our points". [...] Left with just 20 battalions of legionnaires (mainly German and Austrian), military criminals of the Infanterie Légère d'Afrique, territorial reservists, Senegalese Tirailleurs and goumiers, he switched from the offensive to a long-term strategy of [...] "active defence". [...] Lyautey withdrew all non-essential personnel from his rear garrisons, brought in elderly reservists from France and issued weapons and elements of military dress to civilians in an attempt to convince the tribes that the French army in Morocco was as strong as before. [...] Lyautey referred to this move as similar to hollowing out a lobster while leaving the shell intact. His plan depended on holding a [...] "living barricade" [...] of French outposts running from Taza in the north through Khenifra, Kasbah Tadla and Marrakesh to Agadir on the Atlantic coast.|$|E
500|$|Häkkinen {{said that}} his race was [...] "over" [...] when the rain started to fall having not {{managing}} to achieve a higher finishing position. Jos Verstappen scored points {{for the first time}} since the 1996 Argentine Grand Prix. Verstappen said that was pleased with the result and praised his team for switching to wet tyres as he kept in contact with his mechanics. Trulli remarked that he had [...] "never had to work <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> one point" [...] after the amount of pressure he came under in the race. Coulthard said that he lost the chance of victory when he stalled his car and admitted it was his mistake. On the other hand, he criticised his penalty as Coulthard believed that the race stewards should have been given more freedom by Formula One's governing body, the FIA, to decide whether a driver gained an advantage. David Tremayne of The Independent noted had Coulthard raised his hand before the start, he might have started from the back of the grid. After the race, Villeneuve and Diniz were penalised 25 seconds–which were added to their total race times–for their collisions with Diniz and de la Rosa respectively.|$|E
500|$|After vanquishing eight {{powerful}} robots under {{allegiance to}} King (Cold Man, Astro Man, Ground Man, Magic Man, Tengu Man, Dynamo Man, Pirate Man, and Burner Man), the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts {{the fight and}} again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans {{are the ones who}} created robots in the first place, which confuses King. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor. When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his [...] "brainwashing level" [...] and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him, but not before the latter teleports Proto Man out of his castle. The castle begins a self-destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King.|$|E

500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|E

The firm's fees could exceed US$300million eventually. Kreindler argued that the fees were justified, since [...] "Over the past seven years we have had a dedicated team working tirelessly on this and we deserve the contingency fee we have worked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for,</b> and I think we have provided the relatives with value for money." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, {{the show}} was {{intended}} to close the hatches of the Old Profanity Showboat on a high note and to provide all those who had worked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the ship’s success a chance on its stage. [...] The ship had opened its doors in early 1983 and in came young singers and actors eager {{to do anything to}} be part of it. [...] Most became barmaids or members of the lighting and maintenance crew watching other talent come and go on the stage. [...] Ki and Vivian wanted them all to achieve that dream before the Old Pro (as it was eventually called) voluntarily folded.|$|E
2500|$|On March 12, {{the morning}} of his {{interview}} on The Daily Show, Cramer appeared as a guest on the syndicated cooking show Martha (distributed by CNBC's parent company, NBCUniversal). [...] Cramer revealed trepidation to Martha Stewart about his upcoming appearance that night: [...] "I'm a little nervous... How bad is it gonna be? Is he gonna kill me?" [...] Cramer continued that he had previously idolized Jon Stewart: [...] "The reason why it's been <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> me, the attacks, is that early on I patterned my show off of his, which {{is that you can}} do an entertainment business show. And then suddenly to be attacked by a guy that's your idol makes it difficult." ...|$|E
2500|$|But in late 1990, {{while driving}} in Arizona {{en route to}} a show in Las Vegas, Nevada, the group's tour bus crashed, and drummer Andy Galeon was {{critically}} injured, needing more than a year to recover. Cavestany said at the time that [...] "n a way, it made perfect sense to have a major accident right now, it really fit the story line. We've been pushing <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> 8 years and just not getting that far, and getting so frustrated with not being where we should be after so long, it was time for something climactic to happen!" [...] Following the accident, Geffen Records and the band's manager pressured the group to hire another drummer and immediately go back to work. The band performed a few shows in Japan with drummer Chris Kontos, but when they declined to hire a long-term replacement, Geffen Records dropped them.|$|E

[...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very much for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey {{argues that}} there is little {{specific}} evidence that Wilson intrigued to replace Murray, simply that he was widely suspected of having done so, and that his pro-French stance was regarded with deep suspicion by other British officers (Haig’s staff officer Charteris likened Wilson's alleged request to the French, to lobby on his behalf for him to replace Murray, to “mental adultery”). When Murray was at last removed as chief of staff BEF in January 1915, his job went to the BEF Quartermaster-General [...] "Wully" [...] Robertson. Robertson refused to have Wilson as his deputy, so Wilson was instead appointed Principal Liaison Officer with the French, and promoted to temporary lieutenant general. French technically had no authority to make this promotion, but told Wilson he would resign if the Cabinet or War Office objected. The French had been lobbying <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Wilson’s appointment that even Sir John thought they should mind their own business. Asquith (letter to Venetia 26 Jan) and Haig (diary 5 Feb) both remarked that this was putting Wilson out of mischief.|$|E
2500|$|Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times said, [...] "By trying <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> authenticity, this Doctor Zhivago drains {{the story}} of much of its lyricism.... Mr. Lean's grander, glossier version was a closer match to the romantic spirit of the novel's hero.... The Davies version is engrossing but more for the {{harrowing}} scenes set {{in the civil war}} after the revolution than for the novel's legendary love triangle. Black-and-white archival photographs - Moscow slums, newspaper shots of soldiers marching off to World War I - are interspersed throughout the film and slowly bleed into a scene of the television show. The visual trick gives the series a quasi-documentary feel and is quite effective. Yet Mr. Davies takes the same liberties with Pasternak's text as the original film did, focusing on the love story and discarding a lot of the politics, secondary plots and literary sidetracks.... This Doctor Zhivago can be watched as a useful history lesson and as a cautionary show business tale: it is a lot easier to adapt a Jane Austen novel than it is to remake a film by David Lean." ...|$|E
