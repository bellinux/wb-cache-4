Her second success came on 9 July when she torpedoed the 7,176 ton American Liberty ship Samuel Heintzelman, loaded with 5,644 tons of ammunition and general cargo.

There were no survivors from the 75 men on board. The ship was reported missing, and was at first believed to have been sunk by a Japanese surface raider. On 30 September, wreckage from the ship was discovered off the Maldives.|$|E

500|$|Ken Barnes from USA Today {{noted that}} major events in Madonna's life were {{repeated}} throughout the book.

Maybe that's because, at least since <b>she</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> mass-culture spotlight in 1983 with 'Holiday' and hijacked it wholesale the next year with 'Like a Virgin' and 'Material Girl', Madonna, now 49, has lived her life in public like few other artists.

[...] Lyn Barber from The Daily Telegraph gave a negative review of the book, calling it far inferior to author J. Randy Taraborrelli's , released in 2002. Like Churchwell, Barber did not understand why over-emphasis was given on the singer's albums, leaving out details about her personal life. The reviewer listed one positive aspect of the book, the info on Madonna's childhood and a detailed insight into her family.

[...] At Paste, Eric Van Allen criticized her outfit by stating [...] "Even by Street Fighter standards, this amount of gratuitous flesh is rather ridiculous." [...] However, this opinion is not shared between all critics, with Nadia Oxford of USgamer finding Mika to be an example of positive female gender representation, writing [...] "I can say that I have nothing against, er, voluptuous women in games.

[...] Beholder moved to Santa Anita Park in October. Because she remained keyed up after the previous race and upset by the stress from shipping, Mandella chose to put her in an easier race than a Grade I to see if she would settle down enough to contest the Breeders' Cup later in the year. She was entered into a six-furlong allowance race and won by eleven lengths despite being eased in the closing stages. On November 2 at Santa Anita, Beholder was one of eight fillies to contest the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies over one mile.

Beholder took the lead from the start and broke clear of the field to open up a three-length advantage on the final turn. She held off the late challenge of Executiveprivilege to win by a length.|$|E
