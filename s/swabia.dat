5|$|Frederick Barbarossa {{departed}} from the Holy Roman Empire in May 1189. The defence of Antioch was a principal aim of his crusade, but he died unexpectedly near Seleucia in Asia Minor (present-day Silifke in Turkey) on 10June 1190. His son, Frederick VI, Duke of <b>Swabia,</b> took over the command of the army, but most crusaders {{decided to return to}} Europe. The remnants of the German crusaders reached Antioch on 21June 1190. Bohemond paid homage to Frederick of <b>Swabia.</b> Barbarossa's body, which had been carried to Antioch, was buried in the cathedral before the duke continued his crusade toward the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|On the Swabian side, similar {{concerns}} existed. For {{the common people}} in <b>Swabia,</b> the independence and freedom of the Eidgenossen was a powerful and attractive role model. Many a baron in southern <b>Swabia</b> feared that his own subjects might revolt and seek adherence to the Swiss Confederacy. These fears were not entirely without foundation: the Swiss had begun to form alliances north of the Rhine river, concluding a first treaty with Schaffhausen in 1454 and then also treaties with cities {{as far away as}} Rottweil (1463) or Mulhouse (1466).|$|E
5|$|Annabel Breuer {{was born}} on 23 October 1992. She lives with her three siblings, her parents and her dog in Birkenhardt, {{a small town in}} <b>Swabia</b> roughly halfway between Lake Constance and Ulm. She became a {{paraplegic}} {{as a result of an}} automotive accident when she was a child.|$|E
5|$|German cuisine {{varies from}} region to region and often {{neighbouring}} regions share some culinary similarities (e.g. the southern regions of Bavaria and <b>Swabia</b> share some traditions with Switzerland and Austria). International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine and doner kebab {{are also popular}} and available, thanks to diverse ethnic communities.|$|E
5|$|Both {{forces were}} {{composed}} of troops from several states and lands, including numerous mercenaries; for example, Bohemian mercenaries fought on each side. The knights also invited guest crusaders. Twenty-two different peoples, mostly Germanic, joined them. Teutonic recruits included soldiers from Westphalia, Frisia, Austria, <b>Swabia</b> and Stettin (Szczecin). Two Hungarian nobles, Nicholas II Garay and Stibor of Stiboricz, brought 200 {{men for the}} Knights, but support from Sigismund of Hungary was disappointing.|$|E
5|$|Historian Gyula Kristó {{says that}} Ladislaus had a first wife, but {{her name and}} family are not known. She {{gave birth to a}} {{daughter}}, whose name is also unknown. Ladislaus's daughter married Prince Iaroslav Sviatopolchich of Volhinia around 1090. Ladislaus married again in 1078, to Adelaide, a daughter of the German anti-king Rudolf of <b>Swabia.</b> Their only known child, Piroska, became the wife of the Byzantine Emperor John II Komnenos in 1105 or 1106.|$|E
5|$|The first Giant Schnauzers {{emerged from}} <b>Swabia</b> in the German state of Bavaria, and Württemberg in the 17th century. These {{original}} Giant Schnauzers were considered a rough-coated {{version of the}} German pinscher breeds, and their hair was thought to help them withstand the harsh German winters and bites from vermin. The origins of the breed are unclear, but sources speculate it originated through some combination of black Great Danes, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard Schnauzer.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it {{was not one of}} the three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in <b>Swabia,</b> Germany, has led to the nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen was {{the first}} person known to have set foot in the {{territory}}, in 1930. On 14 January 1939, the territory was claimed by Norway. From 1939 until 1945, Nazi Germany claimed New <b>Swabia,</b> which consisted of part of Queen Maud Land. On 23 June 1961, Queen Maud Land became part of the Antarctic Treaty System, making it a demilitarised zone. It is one of two Antarctic claims made by Norway, the other being Peter I Island. They are administrated by the Polar Affairs Department of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security in Oslo.|$|E
5|$|The Army of the Danube {{advanced}} on Pfullendorf and Ostrach, {{the former}} an imperial city in Upper (southern) <b>Swabia,</b> {{and the latter}} a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance. Jourdan's objective was simple and direct: cut the Austrian line at {{the border of the}} southwestern German states and Switzerland, preventing the Coalition's use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe. Isolation of the two theaters would prevent the Austrians from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could use these routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Ostrach, {{also called}} the Battle by Ostrach, {{occurred}} 20–23March 1799. In early March, the Army of the Danube pressed forward toward Pfullendorf and Ostrach, the former an imperial city in Upper <b>Swabia</b> and the latter a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem. Their goal was to cut the Austrian line at Switzerland, preventing the Coalition use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe. This would ostensibly isolate the armies of the Coalition in northern Italy and Germany, and prevent them from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|The {{accession}} of Frederick, a {{child who}} would then become also the Holy Roman Emperor FrederickII in 1197, greatly affected the immediate future of Sicily. For a land so used to centralised royal authority, the king's young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle Philip of <b>Swabia</b> moved to secure Frederick's inheritance by appointing Markward von Anweiler, margrave of Ancona, regent in 1198. Meanwhile, Pope InnocentIII had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick's rights. The pope was to see papal power decrease steadily {{over the next decade}} and was unsure about which side to back at many junctures.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} Christian forces that {{marched to the}} Holy Land in {{response}} to Pope Eugene III and Bernard of Clairvaux's call for the Second Crusade were led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. Conrad's force included Bolesław IV the Curly and Vladislaus II of Bohemia, as well as Frederick of <b>Swabia,</b> his nephew who would become Emperor Frederick I. The crusade had been called {{after the fall of}} the County of Edessa on 24 December 1144. The crusaders marched across Europe and arrived at Constantinople in September and October 1147.|$|E
5|$|This {{campaign}} {{focuses on}} {{the expansion of the}} Holy Roman Empire by integrating the squabbling German duchies under the rule of Frederick Barbarossa, the first Holy Roman Emperor. The first campaign missions sees the player establishing Barbarossa's dominance over the Central European powers of Austria, Saxony, Bavaria, Bohemia, Burgundy as well as <b>Swabia</b> by collecting relics. Although having established dominance, Barbarossa still finds rivals to challenge his Empire's power in the form of Poland, as well as Henry the Lion, a respected ally of Barbarossa. Henry is spared his life and titles as long as he promises to fully declare allegiance to Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Theobald III, Count of Champagne, the {{leadership}} of the Crusade passed to Boniface of Montferrat, a friend of the Hohenstaufen Philip of <b>Swabia.</b> Both Boniface and Philip had married into the Byzantine Imperial family. In fact, Philip's brother-in-law, Alexios Angelos, son of the deposed and blinded Emperor Isaac II Angelos, had appeared in Europe seeking aid and had made contacts with the crusaders. Alexios offered to reunite the Byzantine church with Rome, pay the crusaders 200,000 silver marks, join the crusade and provide all the supplies they needed to get to Egypt. Innocent was aware of a plan to divert the Crusade to Constantinople and forbade any attack on the city, but the papal letter arrived after the fleets had left Zara.|$|E
5|$|Crillon served again under d'Harcourt in 1744 {{when the}} latter {{commanded}} the Army of the Moselle during its campaigns along the Rhine. He {{participated in the}} siege of Fribourg and spent the winter in <b>Swabia</b> {{under the command of}} Marshal Coigny as colonel of an infantry regiment. In May 1745, he fought in the major Battle of Fontenoy near Tournai in modern-day Belgium and captured nearly 50 pieces of artillery from the Dutch, British, and Hanoverian alliance opposing the French. The following month he was appointed brigadier. On 10 July, he fought in what the French termed the battle of the Mésle at Dendermonde near Ghent, leading 8,000 men to victory against a British, Austrian and Dutch force. He then took part in the captures of Ghent, Ostend and Nieuwpoort.|$|E
5|$|In the War of the Third Coalition, 1803–1806, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Portugal, Russia, and others fought the First French Empire and its client states. Although several naval battles determined control of the seas, {{the outcome of the}} war was determined on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations. In the Ulm campaign, Klenau's force achieved the single Austrian victory prior to the surrender of the Austrian army in <b>Swabia.</b> In the second determining event, the decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian force forced a final capitulation of the Austrian forces and took the Habsburgs out of the Coalition. This did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.|$|E
5|$|Jan van Eyck's {{use of oil}} as {{a medium}} was a {{significant}} development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated, indicates {{the extent to which}} van Eyck helped disseminate the technique. Van Eyck employed a new level of virtuosity, mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments, and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden. These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from Bohemia and Poland in the east to Austria and <b>Swabia</b> in the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{far left}} wing, under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, guarded the Rhine border from Mannheim to Switzerland. This {{part of the}} army {{included}} the conscripts drafted from the imperial circles. Charles {{did not like to}} use the militias in any vital location and once it seemed clear to him that the French intended to cross at the middle Rhine, the Archduke felt no qualms placing his militia men at Kehl. In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper <b>Swabia,</b> had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands, the occasional journeyman, and day laborers drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. The remainder of the force included experienced troops from the Habsburg frontier troops stationed just north of Rastatt and a cadre of French royalists and a couple hundred mercenaries at Freiburg im Breisgau.|$|E
5|$|In the 1080s, Sélestat was the {{property}} of Hildegard von Eguisheim, mother of Frederick I, Duke of <b>Swabia,</b> {{the first member of}} the House of Hohenstaufen. Hildegard transformed the place into a religious centre when she founded St. Faith's Church, which she gave to the Benedictines of Conques Abbey. Monks from Conques opened a priory next to the church in 1092. The House of Hohenstaufen quickly became the leading dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire, which came to the imperial throne in 1152. Being under their protection, the priory of Sélestat strongly influenced local life. Even though Sélestat constituted a distinct parish, its priest had only limited power and the Benedictine prior was the true head of the municipality. At the end of the 12th century, the Hohenstaufen dynasty gradually lost power and as a result the priory started to decline. The citizens used this opportunity to reduce the prior's dominance and secure the power of their parish. They started to build a new parish church in the 1220s. St. George's Church was designed in Gothic style and was significantly larger than St. Faith's Church, another way to signify the end of Benedictine hegemony.|$|E
5|$|Moreau seemed {{oblivious}} to Jourdan's situation. Still {{far to the}} east of Jourdan, Moreau crossed to the south bank of the Danube on 19 August, leaving only Delmas' division on the north bank. By no later than the 20th Moreau was aware that Charles had recrossed the Danube, heading north, but instead of pursuing him, the French general pressed eastward toward the Lech River. Ferino's right wing, which had been wandering with seeming aimlessness around upper <b>Swabia</b> and Bavaria, finally rejoined the Army of Rhine and Moselle on 22 August, although Delaborde's division remained well to the south. Ferino's only notable action was repulsing a night attack by the 5,0006,000-man Army of Condé at Kammlach on 1314 August. The French Royalists and their mercenaries sustained 720 casualties, while Ferino lost a number of prisoners. In this action, Captain Maximilien Sébastien Foy led a Republican horse artillery battery with distinction. Facing the southern-most wing of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, the combative Latour rashly stood to fight on the Lech near Augsburg on 24 August. Despite rising waters in which some soldiers drowned, Saint-Cyr and Ferino attacked across the river. In the Battle of Friedberg the French crushed an Austrian infantry regiment, inflicting losses of 600 killed and wounded plus 1,200 men and 17 field guns captured. French casualties numbered 400.|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent III {{also began}} preaching {{what became the}} Fourth Crusade in 1200, {{primarily}} in France but also in England and Germany. After gathering in Venice, the Crusade was used by Doge Enrico Dandolo and Philip of <b>Swabia</b> to further their secular ambitions. Dandolo's aim was to expand Venice's power in the Eastern Mediterranean, and Philip intended to restore his exiled nephew, Alexios IV Angelos, along with Angelos's father, Isaac II Angelos, to the throne of Byzantium. This would require overthrowing the present ruler, Alexios III Angelos, the uncle of Alexios IV. When an insufficient number of knights arrived in Venice, the Crusaders were unable to pay the Venetians for a fleet, so they agreed to divert to Constantinople and share what could be looted as payment. As collateral, the Crusaders seized the Christian city of Zara; Innocent was appalled, and promptly excommunicated them. However, the French Crusaders eventually had their excommunications lifted. When the original purpose of the campaign was defeated by the assassination of AlexiosIV Angelos, they conquered Constantinople, not once but twice. Following upon their initial success, the Crusaders captured Constantinople again and this time sacked it, pillaging churches and killing many citizens. The Fourth Crusade never came within 1,000 miles of its objective of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The Division {{crossed the}} Rhine River at Hüningen near Basel, Switzerland, and marched in two columns eastward. The right column, {{commanded}} by Jean Victor Tharreau, moved {{along the northern}} shoreline of the Rhine. The left column, commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jacopin, moved at the northern-most rim of the river valley. From Switzerland, Masséna sent a Demi-brigade of the Army of Helvetia to secure Schaffhausen, part of the Swiss cantons that lie north of the Rhine river. In holding Schaffhausen, Masséna insured the passage of Ferino's forward units. Ferino's orders were to proceed from Schaffhausen along {{the north shore of}} Lake Constance, also called the Bodensee. His left flank was to remain in contact with the II. Division, to prevent the Austrians from piercing the army's forward line. His advance units were to proceed as far as the Imperial Abbey of Salem. From there, he was instructed to prevent any Austrian reinforcements from Switzerland joining with Archduke Charles, whom Jourdan expected to move across the Iller river near Augsburg, and advance into <b>Swabia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The city of Constance and its bishop {{were caught}} in the middle between these two blocks: they held {{possessions}} in <b>Swabia,</b> but the city also still exercised the high justice over the Thurgau, where the Swiss had assumed the low justice since the annexation in 1460. The foundation of the Swabian League prompted the Swiss city states of Zürich and Bern to propose accepting Constance into the Swiss Confederacy. The negotiations failed, though, due to the opposition of the founding cantons of the Confederacy and Uri in particular. The split jurisdiction over the Thurgau was the cause of many quarrels between the city and the Confederacy. In 1495, one such disagreement was answered by a punitive expedition of soldiers of Uri and the city had to pay the sum of 3,000 guilders to make them retreat and cease their plundering. (The Thurgau was a condominium of the Swiss Confederacy, and Uri was one of the cantons involved in its administration.) Finally, Constance joined the Swabian League as a full member on November 3, 1498. Although this did not yet definitively define the position of the cityduring the Reformation, it would be allied again with Zürich and Bern, and only after the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League in 1548 its close connections to the Eidgenossenschaft would be finally severedit was another factor contributing to the growing estrangement between the Swiss and the Swabians.|$|E
