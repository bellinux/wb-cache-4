This emerging field of <b>superconducting</b> <b>quantum</b> microwave circuits has been driven by many new interesting phenomena in microwave photonics and quantum information processing. For instance, the interaction between <b>superconducting</b> <b>quantum</b> circuits and single microwave photons can reach the regimes of strong, ultra-strong, and even deep-strong coupling. Many higher-order effects, unusual and less familiar in traditional cavity quantum electrodynamics with natural atoms, have been experimentally observed, e. g., giant Kerr effects, multi-photon processes, and single-atom induced bistability of microwave photons. These developments may lead to improved understanding of the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics, and speed up applications ranging from microwave photonics to <b>superconducting</b> <b>quantum</b> information processing.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} on <b>superconducting</b> devices, <b>quantum</b> optics, and magnetic resonance. Superconductive quantum circuits (SQC) comprising mesoscopic Josephson junctions can exhibit quantum coherence amongst their macroscopically large degrees of freedom. They feature quantized flux and/or charge states {{depending on their}} fabrication parameters, and the resultant quantized energy levels are analogous to the quantized internal levels of an atom. This thesis builds on the SQC-atom analogy to <b>quantum</b> optical <b>effect</b> associated with atoms, known as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT). An EIT (denoted as S-EIT) based technique has been proposed to demonstrate microwave transparency using a superconductive quantum circuit exhibiting two metastable states (e. g., a qubit) and a third, shorter-lived state (e. g., the readout state). This technique is {{shown to be a}} sensitive probe of decoherence, besides leading to the prospects of observing other interesting <b>quantum</b> optical <b>effects</b> like AC-stark effect in SQCs. (cont.) The second part of this thesis concerns a novel technique for sensitive detection of magnetic resonance using SQC-based resonance circuits. <b>Superconducting</b> <b>quantum</b> circuits are also known to sensitive detectors of magnetic fields. In particular, the effect of electron spin resonance signal on a <b>Superconducting</b> <b>QUantum</b> Interference Device (SQUID) based non-linear resonant circuit is derived. The electron spin resonance signal propagates as a non-linear behavior of the SQUID voltage, that can sensitively detect extremely small (less than 10 - 5 [Phi] 0) electron spin resonance signals. by Kota Murali.
