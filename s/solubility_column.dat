40|$|Ni {{phytoextraction}} processes need further {{understanding of}} the interactions between Ni availability in soils and its absorption by plant roots. The large metal uptake and root exudation by hyperaccumulator species could accelerate the weathering process of Ni-bearing phases in the rhizosphere. The aim of this work was to quantify the weathering of a Ni-bearing mineral phase in the rhizosphere of the Ni-hyperaccumulator Leptoplax emarginata. The studied mineral was chrysotile which was characterized by a low Ni <b>solubility.</b> <b>Column</b> experiments were performed to assess {{the effect of the}} Ni-hyperaccumulator L. emarginata and the contribution of rhizobacteria on the dissolution rate of chrysotile. Mineral weathering was monitored by measuring Ni and Mg transferred to leachates or plants throughout the experiment. Results showed that L. emarginata increased chrysotile dissolution by more than 2 -fold. The hyperaccumulator L. emarginata accumulated 88 % on average of total mobilized Ni. Inoculation with Ni-resistant bacteria in the rhizosphere of L. emarginata had no significant effect on chrysotile dissolution or plant accumulation of Ni in this context. Finally, after 15 weeks of culture, 1. 65 % of total Ni in the system was mobilized in the planted treatments compared with 0. 03 % in the unplanted treatments...|$|E

Sodium chloride solution concentrations ranged from 1 to 7 % (w/v). The solutions were buffered with 0. 1 M sodium acetate buffer with the solubility being measured at pH values in 0. 2 pH unit increments in the range pH 4. 0 to 5. 4, with data also included at pH 4. 5.

Using 1, 2 propane diol/glycerol mixtures, stable density gradient columns for supporting P{alpha}MS beads can be prepared at temperatures as high as 150 {degrees}C. At these temperatures plasticized commercial beads become fluid and spherical, however loss of the plasticizer and very low molecular weight components of the bead due to limited <b>solubility</b> in the <b>column</b> fluid leads to surface finish problems.

40|$|Areas of {{the coastal}} ocean where oxygen is low or absent in bottom waters, {{so-called}} dead zones, are expanding worldwide (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008). Increased inputs of nutrients from land are enhancing algal blooms, and the sinking of this organic matter to the seafl oor and subsequent decay leads to a high oxygen demand in bottom waters. Depending on the physical characteristics {{of the coastal}} system, this may initiate periodic or permanent water column anoxia and euxinia, with the latter term implying the presence of free sulfi de (Kemp et al., 2009). Global warming is expected to exacerbate the situation, through its effects on oxygen <b>solubility</b> and water <b>column</b> stratifi cation. In many modern coastal systems, anthropogenic changes are superimposed on natural variation and {{lack of knowledge of}} such variation makes the prediction of future changes in water column oxygen challenging (e. g., Grantham et al., 2004). That natural drivers alone can be the cause of widespread coastal anoxia is evident from studies of greenhouse periods in Earth’s past, including the oceanic anoxic events of the Cretaceous and Toarcian (Jenkyns, 2010) ...|$|R
40|$|Novel hybrid {{materials}} were prepared through sol-gel reaction of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and c-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTEOS). Solubility and diffusion {{behavior of a}} series of solvents in the PVA/APTEOS hybrid {{materials were}} studied by inverse gas chromatography (IGC) fitted with a packed <b>column.</b> <b>Solubility</b> thermodynamics parameters at infinite dilution, such as the activity coefficient Omega(infinity) (1) and the solubility coefficient S of solvents in the hybrid materials, the partial molar excess free energy of mixture Delta G(m), and the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter chi(infinity) (12) were determined. The infinite dilution diffusion coefficients D-infinity of the solvents in the hybrid materials were also calculated. Effects of APTEOS content in the stationary phase and the column temperature on the solubility and diffusion of solvents in the hybrid materials were investigated. The hybrid material containing 5. 0 wt% APTEOS has the strongest interaction with water, the largest S and D-infinity for water, and the hybrid material has a promising application in membrane separation, such as pervaporation dehydration of alcohol solution. The solubility parameter delta(2) of the hybrid materials was estimated, and it decreased with increasing APTEOS content. The dependence of D-infinity on temperature was in good agreement with the Arrhenius equation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Measurements of in-soil {{diffusion}} coefficients and {{the application}} of an appropri-ate diffusional model can allow for a more accurate prediction of soil gas concentrations and movement to locate subterranean contamination of volatile materials. The present study was undertaken to measure and evaluate the “apparent in-soil diffusion coefficient ” for n-butane through soil columns under non-steady-state conditions. The term “apparent in-soil diffusion coefficient ” refers to a numerical coefficient that primarily describes the movement of the material by diffusion but also contains effects due to other mechanisms (e. g., adsorption and <b>solubility).</b> Six test <b>columns</b> were evaluated at three soil porosity levels ranging from 0. 30 to 0. 43 and at two column temperature conditions, nominally 18 °C and 7 °C. Soil columns measured 25. 4 cm in diameter by 84 cm in height and contained a moist sand/silt/clay mixture. The numerical range for the apparent in-soil diffusion coefficients for n-butane was 0. 447 × 10 – 3 cm 2 /s to 0. 561 × 10 – 3 cm 2 /s. The lower coefficient values were associated with lower soil porosity levels and cooler column conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} protein {{crystals}} {{is important for}} determination of their three-dimensional structure, which relates to their biochemical functions and to the practical goal of designing pharmaceuticals to modify that function. While many proteins have been successfully crystallized {{by a variety of}} methods, there is still limited understanding of the process of nucleation and growth of even the simplest proteins. Chicken egg-white lysozyme (CEWL) is readily crystallized under a variety of conditions, and studies underway at MSFC are designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which the crystals nucleate and grow. We have investigated the effect of buffer choice on the solubility, nucleation and growth of CEWL. CEWL was purified by dialysis against a. 05 M phosphate buffer and chromatographic separation from contaminants in a sepharose <b>column.</b> <b>Solubility</b> studies were made as a function of buffer concentration for phosphate and formate buffers, and the nucleation and growth of crystals at 10 C was studied as a function of pH for oxalate, succinate, formate, butyrate, carbonate, phosphate and acetate buffer solutions. The solubility data support the conclusion that there is a solubility minimum as a function of buffer concentration for amphiphilic molecules, while no minimum is observed for a phosphate buffer. Nucleation is suppressed at pH greater than pKa for all buffers except phosphate. The aspect ratio of the (110) faces is shown to be a function of crystal size, rather than pH...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of dissolved iron and its chemical speciation (organic complexation and redox speciation) were {{studied in the}} northeastern Atlantic Ocean along 23 °W between 37 and 42 °N at depths between 0 and 2000 m, and in the upper-water column (upper 200 m) at two stations further east at 45 °N 10 °W and 40 °N 17 °W {{in the early spring}} of 1998. The iron speciation data are here combined with phytoplankton data to suggest cyanobacteria as a possible source for the iron binding ligands. The organic Fe-binding ligand concentrations were greater than that of dissolved iron by a factor of 1. 5 – 5, thus maintaining iron in solution at levels well above it <b>solubility.</b> The water <b>column</b> {{distribution of}} the organic ligand indicates in-situ production of organic ligands by the plankton (consisting mainly of the cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp.) in the euphotic layer and a remineralisation from sinking biogenic particles in deeper waters. Fe(II) concentrations varied from below the detection limit (< 0. 1 nM) up to 0. 55 nM but represented only a minor fraction of 0 % to occasionally 35 % of the dissolved iron throughout the water column. The water column distribution of the Fe(II) suggests biologically mediated production in the deep waters and photochemical production in the euphotic layer. Although {{there was no evidence of}} iron limitation in these waters, the aeolian iron input probably contributed to a shift in the phytoplankton assemblage towards increased Synechococcus growth. ...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{application}} of small quantities of nitrogen (N) fertiliser has improved cereal yields on low-input farms in semi-arid Zimbabwe, the practice {{is reported to be}} laborious and time-consuming by farmers. In an effort to make micro-dosing less labour-intensive and more precise, an ammonium nitrate (AN) tablet, the equivalent of a micro-dose of prill AN (28 kg N ha− 1) applied per maize plant, was developed by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in collaboration with Agri-Seeds, Zimbabwe. This study characterized the physical stability, chemical (N% and solubility) and agronomic performance of AN tablets compared with prill AN. Only 10 % of tablets broke when dropped from 2 m, showing that they are physically stable and can handle rough treatment. The N content in the tablets (33. 3 %) was comparable to that in prill AN (34. 6 %). However, the tablet formulation took twice as long to dissolve than prill AN when placed on a wet soil. Despite this difference in <b>solubility,</b> simple leaching <b>column</b> experiments suggest that less than 2 % of the total AN applied was lost due to leaching. Agronomic trials were superimposed on the paired-plot demonstrations used to promote micro-dosing and the conservation agriculture tillage technique of planting basins from 2005 to 2008. Each tillage (plough and basins) plot was subdivided into three sub-plots on which no AN, prill AN and tableted AN treatments were superimposed. Maize was planted and management of plots was left to farmers. Micro-dosing with either prill or tableted AN significantly (p < 0. 001) increased maize grain yield by over 40 % in all seasons for planting basins. However, on the ploughed plot there was no yield benefit to using either AN formulation in the season with the lowest rainfall (2006 – 2007). There {{was no significant difference in}} grain yield and agronomic N use efficiency between prill and tableted AN formulations except for the 2005 – 2006 season in planting basins. During this season, in planting basins, tableted AN had significantly (p < 0. 001) higher rainwater productivity than prill AN, which translated into greater grain yield. In addition, the maximum benefit to micro-dosing was observed to accrue when combined with water harvesting techniques such as planting basins. An observation supported by the host farmers, who in the second and third seasons chose to apply available basal soil fertility amendments to the basin plots over the flat plots. Thus, AN tablets if available at an affordable price can be used by smallholder farmers to more precisely apply N fertiliser. Future work should focus on the labour issues of micro-dosing, and making cost-effective tablets available to resource-poor farmers and also addressing other limiting soil nutrient...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe annual {{population}} {{growth rate of}} African cities is on average 5 %. This situation leads to increasing quantities of wastewater generated in most cities. For example, in the Ivorian capital Abidjan, the daily volume of collected wastewater is actually ~ 190 000 m 3. The Abidjan wastewaters only undergo a passive treatment prior to discharge into the Ebrié lagoon. Moreover, excess of orthophosphate is at the origin of eutrophication that leads to strong perturbation of the lagoon biodiversity. Therefore, {{there is a growing}} interest to identify easily available minerals for performing tertiary treatment of dephosphatisation [1]. In this study, samples of shale were collected from Toumodi region (i. e. Lomo North site) in the Center of Ivory Coast. The solid samples were characterized by several techniques including XRD, Mössbauer spectroscopy, SEM-EDX, XPS and ICP-MS. The major minerals of the shale are silicates and phyllosilicates, i. e. quartz, albite, muscovite and clinochlore. Structural Fe III and Fe II species are present in substitution of other cations of the clays minerals and a minor part of the Fe III species is present in goethite -FeOOH. The reactivity of the shale with phosphate (PO 4) was studied in both homogeneous suspension (" batch reactor ") and in hydrodynamic conditions (" column reactors "). A particular attention was devoted to determine both residual phosphate and metal species (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Al 3 + and total iron) released in solution after phosphate sorption. Kinetics experiments in " batch reactors " showed that the saturation of the shale surface by PO 4 occurred after  24 hours of contact time. Adsorption isotherms led to a maximal PO 4 adsorption capacity of  0. 4 mg g- 1 at neutral pH. The PO 4 removal capacity decreased with increasing pH and reached a minimum around pH= 10. In strong alkaline conditions an increase of the PO 4 removal capacity was observed that was linked to an increase of the aluminum <b>solubility.</b> During the <b>column</b> experiments, the phosphate solution circulated continuously during a five days period and then was stop during 2. 7 days to study the effect of residence time on phosphate removal. This sequence was repeated several times in order to reach a quasi-saturation of the column by PO 4. The PO 4 breakthrough of the column was strongly dependent on the contact time. Interestingly, a correlation between the increase of PO 4 removal rate observed at longer contact time with an increase of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + solubility was established. Therefore, these species could play a more important role than iron in the PO 4 removal mechanism of shale. In conclusion the shale of Ivory Cost is an interesting material for PO 4 removal from wastewater. Nevertheless, it should be compared in terms of removal efficiency and cost to other readily available natural compounds, e. g. laterite and sandstone, or recently developed synthetic Fe III nanocomposites [2].
