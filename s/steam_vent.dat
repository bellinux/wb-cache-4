60|$|For {{the same}} cause {{for which a}} molehill is like a cone, though a very rough one; and that the little heaps which the {{burrowing}} beetles make on the moor, or which the ant-lions in France make in the sand, are all something {{in the shape of}} a cone, with a hole like a crater in the middle. What the beetle and the ant-lion do on a very little scale, the steam inside the earth does on a great scale. When once it has forced a vent into the outside air, it tears out the rocks underground, grinds them small against each other, often into the finest dust, and blasts them out of the hole which it has made. Some of them fall back into the hole, and are shot out again: but most of them fall round the hole, most of them close to it, and fewer of them farther off, till they are piled up in a ring round it, just as the sand is piled up round a beetle's burrow. For days, and weeks, and months this goes on; even it may be for hundreds of years: till a great cone is formed round the <b>steam</b> <b>vent,</b> hundreds or thousands of feet in height, of dust and stones, and of cinders likewise. For recollect, that when the steam has blown away the cold earth and rock near the surface of the ground, it begins blowing out the hot rocks down below, red-hot, white-hot, and at last actually melted. But these, as they are hurled into the cool air above, become ashes, cinders, and blocks of stone again, making the hill on which they fall bigger and bigger continually. And thus does wise Madam How stand in no need of bricklayers, but makes her chimneys build themselves.|$|E

25|$|Fumaroles: Fumaroles or <b>steam</b> <b>vents,</b> are {{the hottest}} {{hydrothermal}} {{features in the}} park. They have so little water that it all flashes into steam before reaching the surface. At places like Roaring Mountain, the result is loud hissing of steam and gases.|$|R

50|$|The {{cold water}} release method {{involves}} using slow running cold tap water, {{over the edge}} of the pressure cooker lid, being careful to avoid the <b>steam</b> <b>vent</b> or any other valves or outlets and never immersing the pressure cooker under water, otherwise steam can be ejected from under the lid, which could cause scalding injury to the user; also the pressure cooker lid can be permanently damaged by an internal vacuum if water gets sucked into the pressure cooker, since the incoming water blocks the inrush of air.|$|E

5000|$|After {{learning}} about Festivus from George and Jerry, Kramer becomes {{fascinated with the}} concept, and meets up with George's father, Frank, {{to learn about the}} holiday. Kramer requests to have off of work to celebrate Festivus and is denied, so he goes back on strike, picketing outside the store. While on strike, Kramer sabotages the bagel machine, causing a <b>steam</b> <b>vent</b> to burst inside the store, which causes Elaine to appear unattractive. She goes to meet [...] "Denim Vest" [...] for her sandwich card, and he does not have it on him, but says he can give it to her another time. Being turned off by Elaine's appearance, he gives her a fake phone number.|$|E
50|$|Pressure cookers {{usually have}} two safety valves to prevent explosions. On older designs, {{one is a}} nozzle upon which a weight sits. The other is a sealed rubber grommet which is ejected in a {{controlled}} explosion if the first valve gets blocked. On newer generation pressure cookers, if the <b>steam</b> <b>vent</b> gets blocked, a safety spring will eject excess pressure and if that fails, the gasket will expand and release excess pressure downwards between the lid and the pan. Also, newer generation pressure cookers have a safety interlock which locks the lid when internal pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, to prevent accidents from a sudden release of very hot steam, food and liquid, which {{would happen if the}} lid were to be removed when the pan is still slightly pressurised inside (however, the lid will be very hard or impossible to open when the pan is still pressurised).|$|E
50|$|Early {{pressure}} cookers {{equipped with}} only a primary safety valve risked explosion from food blocking the release valve. On modern pressure cookers, food residues blocking the <b>steam</b> <b>vent</b> or the liquid boiling dry will trigger additional safety devices. Modern pressure cookers sold from reputable manufacturers have sufficient safety features to prevent the pressure cooker itself from exploding. When excess pressure is released by a safety mechanism, debris of food being cooked may also be ejected with the steam‚Äîwhich is loud and forceful. This can be avoided if the pressure cooker is regularly cleaned and maintained {{in accordance with the}} manufacturer's instructions and never overfilled with food and/or liquid: a pressure cooker should never be filled more than two-thirds full with solid food, half full for liquids and foods that foam and froth (e.g., rice, pasta), and no more than one-third full for pulses (e.g., lentils). Adding a tablespoon of cooking oil minimises foaming.|$|E
25|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>vents</b> {{could be}} found in the area of these craters into the 1950s, but their {{activity}} gradually waned, and they are difficult to locate today.

50|$|This {{method is}} {{sometimes}} called a quick release, {{not to be confused}} with the cold water release (mentioned below). It involves the quick release of vapor by gradually lifting (or removing) the valve, pushing a button, or turning a dial. It is most suitable to interrupt cooking to add food that cooks faster than what is already in the cooker. For example, since meat takes longer to cook than vegetables, it is necessary to add vegetables to stew later so that it will cook only for the last few minutes. Unlike the cold water release method, this release method does not cool down the pressure cooker. The user must release the steam with caution to avoid being scalded. This release method is not suitable for foods that foam and froth while cooking; the hot contents might spray outwards due to the pressure released from the <b>steam</b> <b>vent.</b> This release method takes about two minutes to release the pressure before the lid can be opened.|$|E

The next day, when the Millers head to the shop to pick up the RV, the shop owner is found tied up and gagged with duct tape in his office and Chac√≥n and his henchman One-Eye are waiting for them and prepare to execute the family. They immediately tell Chac√≥n that they are not a real family and {{that they did not know}} they were stealing from him. Rose is given a chance to prove that she is a stripper by dancing, and when she gets close, turns a <b>steam</b> <b>vent</b> onto Chac√≥n, allowing the Millers to escape in the RV with Kenny behind the wheel. Due to Kenny's erratic driving, the RV veers off the highway and a Mexican redknee tarantula, hiding in a bowl of fruit, crawls up Kenny's leg and bites his testicle.|$|E

Wanda soon discovers that both {{she and her father}} are believed to be spies planning an invasion of Atlantis. During her adventures, Wanda's appearance changes from nerdy to attractive (by removing her glasses and using a <b>steam</b> <b>vent</b> to clean her skin).
