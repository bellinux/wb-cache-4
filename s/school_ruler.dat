50|$|The {{history of}} school and office {{products}} brand Westcott dates back to 1872, when Henry Westcott, together with his two sons Charles and Frank Westcott, started manufacturing wooden furniture used by printers and trellis units in Seneca Falls, New York. The company expanded rapidly {{and became one of}} the largest manufacturers of desk and <b>school</b> <b>rulers</b> in the world. Throughout its history it remained in Westcott family hands until it was purchased by Acme Shear Co., which later changed its name to Acme United Corporation.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, <b>School</b> <b>Rulers</b> with Castle Vale School created ten artworks in {{collaboration}} with students that addressed those student's concerns around school. The same year, Stan’s Café devised Plague Nation, a spin-off from Of All The People In All The World, initially with four schools in Birmingham, Bristol and Nottingham. In each case, a class of 30 or so school students from Year 9 (13-14 years old) collaborated with their teachers and performers from the company to create an installation out of 989 kg. of rice. This version of the project {{has been written about}} in a number of studies of Theatre-In-Education-Practice. In 2009, Space Steps saw The Steps Series transform Beaumpnt Leys School into a space ship. In 2011, Fruit and Veg Cities saw children from Forestdale Primary School create city scape diorama from fruits and exhibit them in the Birmingham's bullring markets.|$|R
40|$|Learning (‘‘RULER’’) is {{designed}} {{to improve the quality}} of classroom interactions through professional development and classroom curricula that infuse emotional literacy instruction into teaching–learning interactions. Its theory of change specifies that RULER first shifts the emotional qualities of classrooms, which are then followed, over time, by improvements in classroom organization and instructional support. A 2 -year, cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to test hypotheses derived from this theory. Sixty-two urban <b>schools</b> either integrated <b>RULER</b> into fifthand sixth-grade English language arts (ELA) classrooms or served as comparison schools, using their standard ELA curriculum only. Results from multilevel modeling with baseline adjustments and structural equation modeling support RULER’s theory of change. Compared to classrooms in comparison <b>schools,</b> classrooms in <b>RULER</b> <b>schools</b> exhibited greater emotional support, better classroom organization, and more instructional support at the end of the second year of program delivery. Improvements in classroom organization and instructional support at the end of Year 2 were partially explained by RULER’s impacts on classroom emotional support at the end of Year 1. These findings highlight the important contribution of emotional literacy training and development in creating engaging, empowering, and productive learning environments...|$|R
40|$|Time conceptions {{have had}} an {{evolution}} along the time, defining itself as one key element for both social and scientific activities. Nowadays time studies {{does not belong to}} a specific scientific subject, it has a multi-referential status and its study must be based on multidisciplinary perspectives. Even our circadian times are ruled by external entities such as work, and we learn to walk by the (temporal) rhythms at <b>school.</b> Time <b>rulers,</b> like clocks, bells, rings, defines our lives and the way we live them, undertaken by a global synchronism. This synchronic activities oppresses (Freire) our lives because it overrules our inner time and dictates the way we live in the moment that we start going to school...|$|R
5000|$|Sakya Pandita (1182-1251) was a 13th-century {{head of the}} Sakya <b>school</b> and <b>ruler</b> of Tibet. He {{was also}} one of the most {{important}} Buddhist philosophers in the Tibetan tradition, writing works on logic and epistemology and promoting Dharmakirti's Pramanavarttika (Commentary on Valid Cognition) as central to scholastic study. Sakya Pandita's 'Treasury of Logic on Valid Cognition' (Tshad ma rigs pa'i gter) set forth the classic Sakya epistemic anti-realist position, arguing that concepts such as universals are not known through valid cognition and hence are not real objects of knowledge. Sakya Pandita was also critical of theories of sudden enlightenment which was held by some teachers of the [...] "Chinese Great Perfection" [...] in Tibet.|$|R

In September 1957, his father started his law practice as an ace lawyer specializing in criminal law and jurisprudence but amiably graduated to grassroots politics. He was first elected as Managing Director of Central Co-operative Bank, Sangur in 1959-60 and then as Chairman of Panchayat Samiti, Kalayat (now in District Kaithal) in 1961 and again in 1964. Randeep’s father is also a veteran Parliamentarian having been elected to Haryana Legislative Assembly in 1967, 1977, 1982, 1991 and 2005 and to Indian Parliament in 1993.|$|R
5000|$|The Manchu {{people became}} the rulers during the Qing dynasty. The [...] "orthodox" [...] {{historical}} view emphasized {{the power of}} Han Chinese to [...] "sinicize" [...] their conquerors, although more recent research such as the New Qing History <b>school</b> revealed Manchu <b>rulers</b> were savvy in their manipulation of their subjects and from the 1630s through at least the 18th century, the emperors developed a sense of Manchu identity and used Central Asian models of rule as much as Confucian ones. There is however evidence of sinicization. For example, Manchus originally had their own separate style of naming from the Han Chinese, but eventually adopted Han Chinese naming practices.|$|R

500|$|About 17,000 {{cuneiform}} tablet fragments were discovered; when put together, {{they constitute}} 2,500 complete tablets, making the archive of Ebla {{one of the}} biggest from the third millennium BC. About 80% of the tablets are written using the usual Sumerian combination of logograms and phonetic signs, while the others exhibited an innovative, purely phonetic representation using Sumerian cuneiform of a previously unknown Semitic language, which was called [...] "Eblaite". Bilingual Sumerian/Eblaite vocabulary lists were found among the tablets, allowing them to be translated. The tablets provide many important insights into the cultural, economic and political life in northern Mesopotamia around the middle of the 3rd millennium BC. They also provide insight into the everyday lives of the inhabitants, and contain information about state revenues, Sumerian-Eblaite dictionaries, diplomatic exchanges with foreign <b>rulers,</b> <b>school</b> texts, hymns and myths.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the link between}} individual schooling and political participation is affected by country characteristics. We introduce a focus {{on a set of}} variables – namely factor endowments – which influence the relative productivity of human capital in political versus production activities. Using micro data on individual behavior, we find that political participation is more responsive to schooling in land-abundant countries, and less responsive in human capital-abundant countries, even while controlling for country political institutions and cultural attitudes. We develop these ideas in a model where individuals face an allocation decision over the use of their human capital. A relative abundance of land (used primarily in the least skill-intensive sector) or a scarcity of aggregate human capital will increase both the level of political participation and its responsiveness to schooling, by lowering the opportunity cost of production income foregone. In an extension, we further consider the problem of how much <b>schooling</b> a utility-maximizing <b>ruler</b> would choose to provide. An abundanc...|$|R
60|$|But meanwhile--and {{here comes}} the horror of it--our {{technical}} instruction is honest and efficient. The public schoolboy who is carefully blinded, duped, and corrupted as {{to the nature of}} a society based on profiteering, and is taught to honor parasitic idleness and luxury, learns to shoot and ride and keep fit with all the assistance and guidance that can be procured for him by the most anxiously sincere desire that he may do these things well, and if possible superlatively well. In the army he learns to fly; to drop bombs; to use machine-guns to the utmost of his capacity. The discovery of high explosives is rewarded and dignified: instruction in the manufacture of the weapons, battleships, submarines, and land batteries by which they are applied destructively, is quite genuine: the instructors know their business, and really mean the learners to succeed. The result is that powers of destruction that could hardly without uneasiness be entrusted to infinite wisdom and infinite benevolence are placed in the hands of romantic schoolboy patriots who, however generous by nature, are by education ignoramuses, dupes, snobs, and sportsmen to whom fighting is a religion and killing an accomplishment; whilst political power, useless under such circumstances except to militarist imperialists in chronic terror of invasion and subjugation, pompous tufthunting fools, commercial adventurers to whom the organization by the nation of its own industrial services would mean checkmate, financial parasites on the money market, and stupid people who cling to the status quo merely because they are used to it, is obtained by heredity, by simple purchase, by keeping newspapers and pretending that they are organs of public opinion, by the wiles of seductive women, and by prostituting ambitious talent to the service of the profiteers, who call the tune because, having secured all the spare plunder, they alone can afford to pay the piper. Neither the rulers nor the ruled understand high politics. They do not even know {{that there is such a}} branch of knowledge as political science; but between them they can coerce and enslave with the deadliest efficiency, even to the wiping out of civilization, because their education as slayers has been honestly and thoroughly carried out. Essentially the rulers are all defectives; and there is nothing worse than government by defectives who wield irresistible powers of physical coercion. The commonplace sound people submit, and compel the rest to submit, because they have been taught to do so as an article of religion and a point of honor. Those in whom natural enlightenment has reacted against artificial education submit because they are compelled; but they would resist, and finally resist effectively, if they were not cowards. And they are cowards because they have neither an officially accredited and established religion nor a generally recognized point of honor, and are all at sixes and sevens with their various private speculations, sending their children perforce to the schools where they will be corrupted for want of any other <b>schools.</b> The <b>rulers</b> are equally intimidated by the immense extension and cheapening of the means of slaughter and destruction. The British Government is more afraid of Ireland now that submarines, bombs, and poison gas are cheap and easily made than it was of the German Empire before the war; consequently the old British custom which maintained a balance of power through command of the sea is intensified into a terror that sees security in nothing short of absolute military mastery of the entire globe: that is, in an impossibility that will yet seem possible in detail to soldiers and to parochial and insular patriotic civilians.|$|R
