5|$|Gruban appealed {{against the}} {{internment}} order, and was called before a court consisting of Mr Justice Younger and Mr Justice Sankey. After reviewing {{the facts of}} the case and the stories of Gruban and Booth the judges ordered the immediate release of Gruban, and recommended that he seek legal advice to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> regain control of his company. After he was released Gruban found a solicitor, W.J. Synott, who gave the case to Patrick Hastings.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio, a small town in the northeastern part of the state. Both of his parents were Italian immigrants. His father Angelo Lavelli was a {{blacksmith}} who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to catch them when they bounced back. He liked to have friends throw ping-pong balls at him to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> catch them.|$|E
5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend remembered that the plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him much, {{but as soon as the}} lights came on he would rush home to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
60|$|For {{a day or}} {{two after}} that I rested at Jane's, lest I should disturb my brain too much.

5000|$|These {{considerations}} lead Davidson to {{deny that}} the Swampman's utterances can be construed as referring to anything in particular. To take a fairly specific example, suppose {{that at some point}} the previous day Davidson had looked at a glass marble on a shelf; unbeknownst to him there was another, visually identical, glass marble hidden right behind it. When he makes an assertion about [...] "the marble I saw yesterday", we take him to be referring to the one that he did in fact <b>see,</b> even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not supply enough descriptive information to identify it later. Had the marbles been arranged in the other order, therefore, we would take him to be referring to the other marble, yet his internal state would be identical.|$|R
60|$|The house emptied at last, and Matravers {{made his}} way behind, where many of Fergusson's friends had {{gathered}} together, and where congratulations were {{the order of the}} day. A species of informal reception was going on, champagne cup and sandwiches were being handed around and a general air of extreme good humour pervaded the place. Berenice was the centre of a group of men amongst whom Matravers was annoyed to <b>see</b> Thorndyke. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have withdrawn unseen, he would have done so; but already he was surrounded. A little stir at the entrance attracted his attention. He turned round and found Fergusson presenting him to a royal personage, who was graciously pleased, however, to remember a former meeting, and waved away the words of introduction.|$|R
5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi wanted to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.|$|E
5|$|Pritchard {{received}} word from local residents {{that on the}} night before a party, probably including the Confederate President, had crossed the Ocmulgee River just north of Abbeville. Since there were two roads to Irwindale, one of which had been taken by Harnden and his men, Pritchard decided to take the other, to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> capture Davis. He took with him about a hundred and forty men and their horses, while the balance of the Michiganders stayed on the Ocmulgee River near Abbeville. Some seven hours later, at 1 A.M. on May 10, Pritchard arrived at Irwindale. There was no evidence of Harnden's men being there yet.|$|E
5|$|Washbrook and Hutton then {{strode to}} the crease as England faced a short burst of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after {{delivering}} the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> lift and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E

"I {{reckoned}} {{it would}} be dark before we closed with the land," [...] he continued, so low that I had to strain my hearing near as we were to each other, shoulder touching shoulder almost. [...] "So I asked {{to speak to the}} old man. He always seemed very sick when he came to <b>see</b> me--as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not look me in the face. You know, that foresail saved the ship. She was too deep to have run long under bare poles. And it was I that managed to set it for him. Anyway, he came. When I had him in my cabin--he stood by the door looking at me as if I had the halter round my neck already--I asked him right away to leave my cabin door unlocked at night while the ship was going through Sunda Straits. There would be the Java coast within two or three miles, off Angier Point. I wanted nothing more. I've had a prize for swimming my second year in the Conway." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had just}} laid {{ourselves}} {{down on the}} grass mats in the courtyard--for it was too hot {{to go into the}} hut--thoroughly exhausted with our day's work and the heat, when in came two men, each of them dragging a fine indigenous sheep. They were accompanied by Makurupiji, who brought us a message from Secocoeni to the effect that he, the Chief, sent to greet us, the great Chiefs; that he sent us also a morsel to eat, lest we should be hungry in his house. It was but a morsel--it should have been an ox, for great Chiefs should eat much meat--but he himself was pinched with hunger, his belt was drawn very tight by the Boers. He was poor, and so his gift was poor; still, <b>he</b> would <b>see</b> <b>if</b> to-morrow <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find a beast that had something besides the skin on its bones, that he might offer it to us. After this magniloquent address the poor animals were trundled out by the other gate to have their throats cut.|$|R
50|$|By the castle, {{there was}} a brook that was of milk rather than water, which had plenty for everyone, but the new king forbade anyone to take the milk. The guards noticed a gold-bearded man taking buckets of milk {{in the morning and}} then strangely vanishing. The king came to <b>see.</b> <b>He</b> {{wondered}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> ever capture such a man, and many attempts failed. One day, an old soldier told him to leave bread, bacon, and drugged wine for the man; he would eat, drink, and fall asleep. Then they could catch him. The plan succeeded, and the king put the man in a cage. After a month had passed, the king had to go to war. He told his stepson to feed the man but not free him, or his fate would be terrible.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E

5000|$|In Mahaddie's talks he {{stressed}} the importance of navigation to reach the target, the use of special equipment such as Gee, H2S and Oboe and methods being used to confuse and confound the air defenses over Germany. He would always include two missions where the Pathfinder's failed, and in both cases it was Mahaddie who had made the error. The first he called [...] "Hamish's shame" [...] and the second he called [...] "Mahaddie's folly", and he would speak of them not only as a guide as what not to do, but as an encouragement for them to <b>see</b> that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make it in the Pathfinders, then who's to say that they <b>could</b> not? <b>He</b> stated later that he used his lecture tour as a pretext to get onto the airbase to meet the pilots he had already identified. In the evening he would visit the pubs the aircrews frequented, and speak with the pilots individually and privately. Then, if the pilot and crew wished, they would apply to be transferred to the Pathfinder Force. Next would ensue a certain amount of {{back and forth between the}} air wing commander and Mahaddie, but Mahaddie had the support he needed and would inevitably get the transfer secured. The crew would be sent to RAF Warboys and start in on training as a pathfinder. Through this, and other techniques, Mahaddie recruited thousands of the most highly regarded Bomber Command aircrew to the Pathfinders.|$|R
60|$|An immensely complex {{plan had}} {{suddenly}} flashed into Findlayson's mind. He saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight lines and angles - each rope {{a line of}} white fire. But there was one rope which was the master rope. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that rope. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> pull it once, it was absolutely and mathematically certain that the disordered fleet would reassemble itself in the backwater behind the guard-tower. But why, he wondered, was Peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down the bank? It was necessary to put the Lascar aside, gently and slowly, because {{it was necessary to}} save the boats, and, further, to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that looked so difficult. And then - but it was of no conceivable importance - a wire-rope raced through his hand, burning it, the high bank disappeared, and with it all the slowly dispersing factors of the problem. He was sitting in the rainy darkness - sitting in a boat that spun like a top, and Peroo was standing over him.|$|R

Behind them, on lap 45, Piquet passed de Cesaris for sixth. Senna got ahead of Prost on the second chicane with seven laps remaining. Mansell won from Senna, Prost, Berger, Schumacher and Piquet.|$|E
60|$|May we not, {{to begin}} with, accept this great principle--that, as our bodies, {{to be in}} health, must be {{generally}} exercised, so our minds, to be in health, must be generally cultivated? You would not call a man healthy who had strong arms but was paralytic in his feet; nor one who could walk well, but had no use of his hands; nor one who <b>could</b> <b>see</b> well, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not hear. You would not voluntarily reduce your bodies to any such partially developed state. Much more, then, you would not, if you could help it, reduce your minds to it. Now, your minds are endowed with {{a vast number of}} gifts of totally different uses--limbs of mind as it were, which, if you don't exercise, you cripple. One is curiosity; that is a gift, a capacity of pleasure in knowing; which if you destroy, you make yourselves cold and dull. Another is sympathy; the power of sharing in the feelings of living creatures, which if you destroy, you make yourselves hard and cruel. Another of your limbs of mind is admiration; the power of enjoying beauty or ingenuity, which, if you destroy, you make yourselves base and irreverent. Another is wit; or the power of playing with the lights on the many sides of truth; which if you destroy, you make yourselves gloomy, and less useful and cheering to others than you might be. So that in choosing your way of work it should be your aim, as far as possible, to bring out all these faculties, as far as they exist in you; not one merely, nor another, but all of them. And the way to bring them out, is simply to concern yourselves attentively with the subjects of each faculty. To cultivate sympathy you must be among living creatures, and thinking about them; and to cultivate admiration, you must be among beautiful things and looking at them.|$|R

They sell teas and things mostly now but they began as bakers' shops {{and what they did}} was to come into a place and undersell until all the old shops were ruined and shut up. That was what they tried to do and Father hadn't no more chance amongst them than a mouse in a trap.... It was just like being run over. All the trade that stayed with us after a bit was Bad Debts. You can't blame people I suppose for going where they get more and pay less, and it wasn't till we'd all gone right away to Haggerston that they altered things and put the prices up again. Of course Father lost heart and all that. He didn't know what to do, he'd sunk all he had in the shop; he just sat and moped about. Really,--he was pitiful. He wasn't able to sleep; he used to get up at nights and go about downstairs. Mother says she found him once {{sweeping}} out the bakehouse at two o'clock in the morning.

60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Rupert heard a loud squeal of fear, and saw a dark spot {{blotting}} the smoothness of the lake’s frozen surface. The Sheep was struggling helplessly in an ice-hole of his own making. Rupert gave one loud curse, and then dashed full tilt for the shore; outside a low stable building on the lake’s edge he remembered having <b>seen</b> a ladder. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> slide it across the ice-hole before the Sheep went under the rescue would be comparatively simple work. Other skaters were dashing up from a distance, and, with the ladder’s help, they could {{get him out of}} his death-trap without having to trust themselves on the margin of rotten ice. Rupert sprang on to the surface of lumpy, frozen snow, and staggered to where the ladder lay. He had already lifted it when the rattle of a chain and a furious outburst of growls burst on his hearing, and he was dashed to the ground by a mass of white and tawny fur. A sturdy young yard-dog, frantic with the pleasure of performing his first piece of active guardian service, was ramping and snarling over him, rendering the task of regaining his feet or securing the ladder a matter of considerable difficulty. When he had at last succeeded in both efforts he was just by a hair’s-breadth too late to be of any use. The Sheep had definitely disappeared under the ice-rift.|$|R

25|$|Following the Broncos' victory during Super Bowl XXXII the {{previous}} season, many wondered if 15-year veteran quarterback John Elway would retire after finally winning a Super Bowl.
