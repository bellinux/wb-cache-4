40|$|Integration of scalar and vector {{visualization}} {{has been}} an interesting topic. This paper presents a technique to appropriately select and display multiple <b>streamlines</b> while overlaying with isosurfaces, aiming an integrated scalar and vector field visualization. The technique visualizes a scalar field by multiple semitransparent isosurfaces, and a vector field by multiple <b>streamlines,</b> while the technique adequately selects the <b>streamlines</b> considering reduction of cluttering among the isosurfaces and <b>streamlines.</b> The technique first selects and renders isosurfaces, and then generates large number of <b>streamlines</b> from randomly selected seed points. The technique evaluates each of the <b>streamlines</b> according to their shapes on a 2 D display space, distances to critical points of the given vector fields, and occlusion by isosurfaces. It then selects the specified number of highly evaluated <b>streamlines.</b> As a result, we can visualize both scalar and vector fields {{as a set of}} view-independently selected isosurfaces and view-dependently selected <b>streamlines.</b> Comment: TopoInVis 201...|$|R

Since <b>streamlining</b> would increase the cost by £500 per locomotive and increase the weight by approximately 2 lt t, the idea was abandoned, {{especially in light of the}} negligible performance benefit of <b>streamlining</b> at the official maximum 55 mph goods train speeds on Cape gauge and the reduced accessibility of working parts on a <b>streamlined</b> locomotive.|$|R

5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while <b>streamline</b> analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A <b>streamline</b> {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E

5|$|The Nassers and Naify {{contracted}} with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger {{the design of}} the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade trimmed in neon accents, and brought <b>Streamline</b> Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors. The $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to <b>Streamline</b> Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and indirect lighting. Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation, a condition that required channelization and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted amber glass gem lit from within.|$|E

A promising approach for the reconstruction of neural pathways are stream-line based techniques {{commonly referred to as}} ber tracking. However, due to the diverging nature of tract systems, the density of <b>streamlines</b> varies over the domain without control resulting in sparse ar-eas as well as cramped regions. To overcome this problem, we adapted the concept of evenly spaced <b>streamlines</b> to ber tracking providing <b>streamlines</b> equally distributed over the domain. Additionally, we incorporated evenly spaced <b>streamlines</b> into re-gion of interest based tracking.
