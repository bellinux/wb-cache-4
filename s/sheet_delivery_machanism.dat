We hypothesized that intramyocardial injections of myoblasts could enhance inflammatory reactivity and facilitate electrical cardiac abnormalities that can be reduced by epicardial myoblast <b>sheet</b> <b>delivery.</b> In a rat model of ischemic heart failure, myoblast therapy either by intramyocardial injections or epicardial cell sheets was given 2 weeks after occlu-sion of the coronary artery. Ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) were assessed, using an implanted three-lead electrocardiograph at 1, 7, and 14 days after therapy, and 16 -point epicardial electropotential mapping (EEPM) was used to evaluate ventricular arrhyth-mogenicity under isoproterenol stress. Cardiac functioning was assessed by echocardiog-raphy. Both transplantation groups showed therapeutic benefit over sham therapy. However, VPCs were more frequent in the Injection group on day 1 and day 14 after therapy than in animals receiving epicardial or sham therapy (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 01, respectively).

40|$|Direct {{intracardiac}} cell injection {{for heart}} repair is hindered by numerous limitations including: cell death, poor spreading of the injected cells, arrhythmia, needle injury, etc. Tissue-engineered cell sheet implantation {{has the potential}} to overcome some of these limitations. We evaluated whether the transplantation of a muscle-derived stem cell (MDSC) sheet could improve the regenerative capacity of MDSCs in a chronic model of myocardial infarction. MDSC sheet-implanted mice displayed a reduction in left ventricle (LV) dilation and sustained LV contraction compared with the other groups. The MDSC sheet formed aligned myotubes and produced a significant increase in capillary density and a reduction of myocardial fibrosis compared with the other groups. Hearts transplanted with the MDSC sheets did not display any significant arrhythmias and the donor MDSC survival rate was higher than the direct myocardial MDSC injection group. MDSC sheet implantation yielded better functional recovery of chronic infarcted myocardium without any significant arrhythmic events compared with direct MDSC injection, suggesting this cell <b>sheet</b> <b>delivery</b> system could significantly improve the myocardial regenerative potential of the MDSCs.

40|$|Abstract Two Doppler global {{velocimetry}} {{systems were}} applied in parallel {{to assess their}} performance in wind tunnel environments. Both DGV systems were mounted on a common traverse surrounding the glass-walled 1. 4 × 1. 8 m 2 test section of the wind tunnel. The traverse normally supports a three-component forward-scatter laser Doppler velocimetry system. The reproducible vortical flow field generated by the blunt tip of an airfoil was chosen for this investigation and was precisely surveyed by LDA {{just prior to the}} DGV measurements. Both DGV systems shared the same continuous wave laser light source, laser frequency stabilization and fiber optic light <b>sheet</b> <b>delivery</b> system. The principle differences between the DGV implementations are with regard to the imaging configuration. One configuration relied on a single camera that observed three successively operated light sheets. In the second configuration, three camera views simultaneously observed a single light sheet using a four-branch fiber imaging bundle. The imaging bundle system had all three view points in a forward scattering arrangement which increased the scattering efficiency but reduced the frequency shift sensitivity. Since all three light sheet observation components were acquired onto the same image frame, acquisition times could be reduced to a minimum.

Although three separate images had to be recorded in succession, the image quality, spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio was superior to the imaging bundle system. Comparison of the DGV data with LDV measurements shows very good agreement to within 1 - 2 m/s. The remaining discrepancy has a variety of causes, some are related to the reduced resolving power of the fiber imaging bundle system (graininess, smoothing), exact localization of the receiver head with respect to the scene, laser frequency drift or background influences. The extensive data base available allows a more detailed study of the influences of each of these factors...|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{provides an}} overview on the applicability of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and Doppler global velocimetry (DGV) in combustion test facilities and summarizes experiences gained {{in a number of}} applications that were performed in the past 6 years. Emphasis is placed on the experimental aspects of each application rather than the interpretation of the acquired flow field data because many of the encountered problems and chosen solution strategies are unique to this area of planar velocimetry application. In particular imaging configurations, seeding techniques, data acquisition strategies as well as pre- and post-processing methodologies are outlined. The paper describes four similar applications of PIV in atmospheric and pressurized combustors containing single burners that are operated either with kerosene or natural gas. Aside from providing adequate optical access to the respective facilities the most challenging issue has been the reliable supply of non-volatile and non-reacting solid particle seeding. Given the rather large mass flows of up to 1 kg/s inside the combustors, sufficient seeding quantities could best be delivered by fluidized bed particle generators, sometimes even operated in parallel. The devices have been continually improved to allow constant delivery rates only during data acquisition periods, thus preventing unnecessary collection of seeding in the facility. The choice and handling of the seeding particle powder was found to be crucial for the overall success of the measurements. The first application describes initial trials on a swirled kerosene spray fuel nozzle at 3 bars and illustrates problems encountered due to flame luminosity as well as strong light scattering from the fuel droplets. The second application summarizes the challenges faced in obtaining phase-resolved, three-component velocity data from a generic atmospheric gas combustor using stereoscopic PIV. A much larger, swirl stabilized gas burner as utilized in stationary power generation was the subject of the third described application. Here a novel methodology of data acquisition and post-processing provides phase resolved velocity maps even of flows that have non-constant oscillation frequencies. Finally, the fourth application describes how the combination of PIV with DGV can yield three-component velocity data in areas of limited optical access using only one viewing window and one separate window (or probe) for light <b>sheet</b> <b>delivery...</b>|$|R

40|$|Two Doppler global {{velocimetry}} {{systems were}} applied in parallel {{to assess their}} performance in wind tunnel environments. Both DGV systems were mounted on a common traverse surrounding the glass-walled 1. 4 x 1. 8 m 2 test section of the ONERA F 2 wind tunnel. The traverse normally supports a three-component forward-scatter laser Doppler velocimetry system. The reproducible vortical flow field generated by the blunt tip of an airfoil (300 mm chord) was chosen for this investigation and was precisely surveyed by LDA just prior to this investigation. Both DGV systems shared the same continuous wave laser light source (argon ion, 514 nm), laser frequency stabilization and fiber optic light <b>sheet</b> <b>delivery</b> system. The principle differences between the DGV implementations are {{with regard to the}} imaging configuration. The ONERA Configuration relied on a single camera view that observed three successively operated light sheets. The DLR configuration used three camera views simultaneously to observe a single light sheet using a four-branch fiber imaging bundle. In both configurations off-normal viewing arrangements were present, the DGV system of ONERA observed two light sheets in forward scattering and one in back-scattering mode which had a roughly ten times lower signal level. The DLR system had all viewing directions at a similar forward scattering angle, such that all views had approximately the same signal levels at the exit of the fiber imaging bundle. The closed-circuit wind tunnel was seeded globally with sub-micron oil droplets using an oil-based smoke generator. Stream-tube seeding was used in addition to improve the back-scatter signal levels. CCD camera exposures varied from 0. 25 − 2. 0 seconds in forward scattering views to 2 − 5 seconds in back scattering views. The subsequent processing of the multi-view DGV data resulted in improvements of DLR’s DGV software package to deal, for instance, with artifacts introduced by the image fiber bundles. The availability of reproducible reference data from LDA allows a further quantification of error sources in the DGV measurements. Overall the agreement between the DGV and the LDA measurements is on the order of 1 m/s for the DLR system. Residual bias is believed to be caused by scene illumination stemming from the luminous light sheet within the seeded flow which cannot be easily quantified in absence of seeding (i. e. by background image acquisition). Also the spatial averaging imposed by the optical system dampens out velocity gradients such that vortex peaks are underestimated in comparison to the ONERA DGV system which has a higher optical fidelity (see Part II). Nonetheless the DLR system was shown to acquire reliable 3 -C velocimetry data using single recordings of the composite views. In principle the presented configuration would be well suited for pulsed DGV measurements using a single light sheet...|$|R

We used data collected from the control arms of three previously conducted cluster-randomised controlled trials in rural Bangladesh, India, and Nepal to examine the association between clean delivery kit use or clean delivery practices and neonatal mortality among home births. Methods and Findings: Hierarchical, logistic regression models were used to explore the association between neonatal mortality and clean delivery kit use or clean delivery practices in 19, 754 home births, controlling for confounders common to all study sites.
