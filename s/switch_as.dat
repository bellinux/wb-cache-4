5|$|Although Sestak was {{initially}} urged to {{run by the}} Democratic establishment, Specter gained wide support from Democrats after he switched parties. Major political figures like President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell later tried to sway Sestak from continuing the race, fearing he would damage Specter's chances in the general election. Former President Bill Clinton offered Sestak {{a position in the}} Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer Republicans would later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party <b>switch</b> <b>as</b> an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and Specter's support from such individuals as Joe Biden and Harry Reid, and organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power <b>switch</b> (<b>as</b> part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E

5|$|In the Rogue Cut version, Rogue's role is more consequential, and the {{narrative}} is more complex: When seeing Stryker causes Wolverine's consciousness to phase {{between past and}} future—resulting in his claws being extended, injuring Kitty Pryde—the Professor talks {{about the need for}} Wolverine to have more time back in 1973. Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the Professor's school, the one place where the Professor's mind can't reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. With the Professor and Magneto, he does so—at the cost of his own life—and Rogue is taken to where the mutants are making their last stand, where she takes over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the <b>switch</b> <b>as</b> he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels were able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand, which got stuck in the X-Jet after the Sentinel tried to prevent the Professor, Magneto and Rogue from escaping the incinerated remains of the X-Mansion. It also includes a scene where Mystique visits the X-Mansion at night while Charles and Logan are sleeping. She revisits her previous romance with Beast but leaves very early the next morning and breaks Cerebro in order to prevent Charles from finding her.|$|E

25|$|The October 2016 trailer became Nintendo of America's most-viewed {{video on}} YouTube within 24 hours, {{and was the}} top {{trending}} video on YouTube for about a day. Engadget editors were generally impressed with the Switch on reveal, seeing it {{as a means to}} bridge home consoles with portable devices, experiments that Nintendo had tried before with inter-game connectivity between the 3DS and Wii U. The editors potentially see the <b>Switch</b> <b>as</b> a unified console and handheld device, aimed to be a console gamer's second device and where the player does not need the time investment to sit down and play most console games. One editor did express concerns on the hardware's durability given its modular nature.|$|E
25|$|In {{electrical}} controls, {{a stepping}} switch, {{also known as}} a stepping relay, is an electromechanical device which allows an input connection to be connected to {{one of a number of}} possible output connections, under the control of a series of electrical pulses. The major use for these devices was in early automatic telephone exchanges to route telephone calls. It can step on one axis (called a uniselector), or on two axes (a Strowger <b>switch).</b> <b>As</b> the first automated telephone switch using electromagnets and hat pins, stepping switches were invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888. Strowger filed his patent application on March 12, 1889, and it was issued on March 10, 1891.|$|E

25|$|Nintendo Switch offers {{integration}} with third-party social networking services to provide social and sharing features. Unlike the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Nintendo does {{not plan to}} offer first-party social networking services, such as Miiverse or StreetPass, the latter owing to Nintendo's promotion of <b>Switch</b> <b>as</b> primarily being a home console. Players can register friends through Friend Codes as with previous Nintendo systems, searching for friends in the local network, through past multiplayer interactions, or via friends already registered on Nintendo mobile apps such as Miitomo and Super Mario Run linked to the corresponding Nintendo Account profile. Nintendo said it plans to provide other methods for registering friends, including through third-party social media and via Nintendo Network IDs. The Switch has no native support for Nintendo Network IDs, but users can link their Nintendo Network ID credentials on a Switch to a Nintendo Account profile, allowing them to link the system to their account, and accessing benefits such as shared eShop balances between the Switch and the Nintendo 3DS and/or Wii U.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} of these circuits are {{a form of}} rectifier which take an AC voltage as input and outputs a doubled DC voltage. [...] The switching elements are simple diodes and they are driven to switch state merely by the alternating voltage of the input. [...] DC-to-DC voltage doublers cannot switch in this way and require a driving circuit to control the switching. [...] They frequently also require a switching element that can be controlled directly, such as a transistor, {{rather than relying on}} the voltage across the <b>switch</b> <b>as</b> in the simple AC-to-DC case.|$|E
500|$|It was in {{the next}} game of the series which [...] Leaf defenceman Bill Barilko scored {{one of the most}} famous goals in NHL history with a goal in {{overtime}} to win the Stanley Cup. However, without Kennedy's face-off skills Barilko's goal would not have occurred. Montreal had been leading late in the game 2–1 and it appeared that the teams were headed to a sixth game in Montreal. With just 39 seconds remaining, Toronto was able to get a faceoff in the Montreal end. Toronto coach Joe Primeau had pulled the goaltender so they could have six skaters. Primeau had the option of changing his players, but decided to leave Kennedy out to take the faceoff against Canadien Billy Reay. Kennedy's plan on the faceoff was to get the puck to Max Bentley, who was stationed at the point. Then Montreal coach Dick Irvin decided to switch and have his best forwards, the Punch Line, out for this critical faceoff. Kennedy faced Lach instead. Kennedy later recalled he was relieved at the <b>switch</b> <b>as</b> he had trouble with Reay on faceoffs, but when Lach came out he felt [...] "I had a chance," [...] Kennedy won the faceoff from Lach, got the puck to Bentley and from the ensuing scramble around the net Tod Sloan tied the game. The goal dispirited the Montreal team and led to Barilko's famed overtime goal which won another Stanley Cup for the Leafs.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{these issues}} are mathematically significant, even when {{controlling}} for these factors, nearly all people still think {{each of the two}} unopened doors has an equal probability and conclude that switching does not matter (Mueser and Granberg, 1999).
