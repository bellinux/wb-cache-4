After {{receiving}} growth factor signals, they prepare for division by entering G1, where everything within the cell except DNA is doubled. This doubling includes {{the size of}} the cell. The next phase of the cell cycle is <b>S</b> (<b>synthesis)</b> phase. It is the cell cycle phase where the chromosomes (DNA) are duplicated in preparation for cellular division. The transition from G1 to S is a checkpoint. If the cell has damaged DNA or is expressing oncogenes or other inappropriate proteins, specialized checkpoint proteins, tumor suppressors such as p53 or pRB, will interrupt the transition to S phase until the damage is repaired. If the damage cannot be repaired, the cell will initiate apoptosis, often referred to as cellular suicide, which is programmed cell death. If the tumor suppressor genes incur loss-of-function mutations or are knocked out, the damaged cell can continue to divide unchecked — one of the hallmarks of cancer.|$|E
5000|$|The G1/S {{transition}} {{is a major}} checkpoint in the regulation of the cell cycle. S phase: To produce two similar daughter cells, the complete DNA instructions in the cell must be duplicated. DNA replication occurs during this <b>S</b> (<b>synthesis)</b> phase. Depending on levels of nutrients, energy and external factors, cells must decide to enter the cell cycle or move into a non-dividing state known as G0 phase. This transition, as {{with all of the}} major checkpoint transitions in the cell cycle, is signaled by cyclins and cyclin dependent kinase (CDKs). The pulse of G1/S cyclins causes CLN3-Cdk1 to activate Cln1/2 (start point), as well as Clb5/6 at the initiation of S-phase. This pathway contains 2 positive feedback loops, allowing for rapid, unidirectional movement into S-phase.

5000|$|The mitotic {{phase is}} a {{relatively}} short period of the cell cycle. It alternates with the much longer interphase, where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division. Interphase is divided into three phases: G1 (first gap), <b>S</b> (<b>synthesis),</b> and G2 (second gap). During all three parts of interphase, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are replicated only during the S phase. Thus, a cell grows (G1), continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S), grows more and prepares for mitosis (G2), and finally divides (M) before restarting the cycle. All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and other cell cycle proteins. The phases follow one another in strict order and there are [...] "checkpoints" [...] that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to another. Cells may also temporarily or permanently leave the cell cycle and enter G0 phase to stop dividing. This can occur when cells become overcrowded (density-dependent inhibition) or when they differentiate to carry out specific functions for the organism, as is the case for human heart muscle cells and neurons. Some G0 cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle.|$|E

To avoid premature sister chromatid separation, the APC/C is maintained in an inactive state bound to different molecules, which are part of a complex mechanism termed the spindle assembly checkpoint.|$|E

50|$|The {{cell cycle}} {{is a process}} in which an ordered set of events leads to the growth and {{division}} into two daughter cells. The cell cycle is a cycle rather than a linear process because the two daughter cells produced repeat the cycle. This process contains two main phases, interphase, in which the cell grows and synthesizes a copy of its DNA, and the mitotic (M) phase, during which the cell separates its DNA and divides into two new daughter cells. Interphase is further broken down into the G1 (GAP 1) phase, <b>S</b> (<b>Synthesis)</b> phase, G2 (GAP 2) phase and the mitotic phase is broken down into mitosis and cytokinesis. During G1 phase, the cells that come out of mitosis grow larger and monitor the environment so that DNA can be replicated. Once the cells are large enough, the cell transitions into S phase and DNA is replicated in the nucleus. During S phase, the cell also duplicates the centrosome, or microtubule-organizing center, which is critical for DNA separation in the M phase. After complete synthesis of its DNA, the cell enters the G2 phase where it continues to grow in preparation for mitosis. Following interphase, the cell transitions into mitosis, containing four sub stages: prophase, anaphase, metaphase, and telophase. In mitosis, DNA condenses into chromosomes, which are lined up and separated by the mitotic spindle. After duplicate DNA is separated on opposite ends of the cell, the cytoplasm of the cell is split in two during cytokinesis resulting in two daughter cells.|$|E

Via intravital microscopy, we observed that H 2 S donors (NaHS and Na 2 S) inhibited aspirin-induced leukocyte adherence in mesenteric venules (ED 50 of 5. 0 micromol/kg for Na 2 S), likely via activation of ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels.
