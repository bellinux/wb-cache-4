5|$|At 6:35pm, as {{many workers}} in the city were {{finishing}} their shifts, the alarm was <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> gather the troops of the 5th and 6th Regiments.

5|$|The Maya leader {{returned}} {{the following day}} with twelve canoes, as promised. The Spanish could see from afar that the shore was packed with natives. The conquistadors put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats; {{a few of the}} more daring Spaniards boarded the native canoes. The Spanish named the headland Cape Catoche, after some words spoken by the Maya leader, which <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> the Spanish like cones catoche. Once ashore, the Spaniards clustered loosely together and advanced towards the city along a path among low, scrub-covered hillocks. At this point the Maya leader gave a shout and the Spanish party was ambushed by Maya warriors armed with spears, bows and arrows, and stones. Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault, but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed the Maya attack. They advanced to a small plaza bordered by temples upon the outskirts of the city. When the Spaniards ransacked the temples they found a number of low-grade gold items, which filled them with enthusiasm. The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships. Over the following days the Spanish discovered that although the Maya arrows had struck with little force, the flint arrowheads tended to shatter on impact, causing infected wounds and a slow death; two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow-wounds inflicted in the ambush.|$|E

The Ōrākau garrison spotted the attacking force to their west just minutes before the bugle was <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> charge and warriors were ordered by Rewi into the outer trenches. The Kingites held their fire until the attackers were within 50 metres, then fired in two volleys, halting the advance. Two more waves of attack were similarly repulsed, with several casualties, including officers.|$|E

25|$|I {{arranged}} {{meetings with}} my young friends, {{some of whom}} were considerably older than myself, and a few were married persons. A number of them were vain and thoughtless; my experience <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> them like an idle tale, and they did not heed my entreaties.

Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and praying with them.|$|E
25|$|The first score {{came on a}} punt off the toe of Flournoy. Vanderbilt drove {{all the way to}} Tulane's 7-yard line before four {{unsuccessful}} runs at Tulane's line by Rountree {{gave the}} Greenbacks the ball back deep in their territory. On the ensuing punt, Tulane's line was broken by Tom Ryan, Bob Rives, Bo Rowland, and Lynn Bomar. Bomar blocked the kick. In the ensuing scramble, Alf Sharpe dove to recover the football in the end zone. The second came when Lynn Bomar helped Vanderbilt run to the 33-yard line, where Wakefield drop kicked a field goal. After this Tulane drove right down to Vanderbilt's 5-yard line when the whistle <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> end the half.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} on 8 December 65 BC in the Samnite south of Italy. His home town, Venusia, lay on a trade route in the border region between Apulia and Lucania (Basilicata). Various Italic dialects were spoken {{in the area and}} this perhaps enriched his feeling for language. He could have been {{familiar}} with Greek words even as a young boy and later he poked fun at the jargon of mixed Greek and Oscan spoken in neighbouring Canusium. Literary Latin must have <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> him like a semi-foreign language, heard only at school. One of the works he probably studied in school was the Odyssia of Livius Andronicus, crammed into Italian boys with threats and floggings by teachers like the 'Orbilius' mentioned in one of his poems. School was made particularly irksome by a number of his fellow pupils, the overgrown sons of beefy centurions. The army veterans could have been settled there at the expense of local families uprooted by Rome as punishment for their part in the Social War (91–88 BC). Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area. According to a local tradition reported by Horace, a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the Samnites had been driven out early in the third century. In that case, young Horace could have felt himself to be a Roman though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or Sabellus by birth. Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different. Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems.|$|E

New Jersey got underway on the voyage 6 September, departing Long Beach for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

On 17 December 1969 New Jerseys colors were hauled down and she entered the inactive fleet, following the words of her last commanding officer: [...] "Rest well, yet sleep lightly; and hear the call, if again <b>sounded,</b> <b>to</b> provide fire power for freedom." ...|$|E

The bell was sounded after Revere and Dawes arrived, but when no British soldiers appeared, Captain John Parker sent his men home, with instructions to remain ready.

500|$|The wagtail is very [...] "chatty" [...] and has {{a number}} of {{distinct}} vocalisations. Its most-recognised sound is its alarm call which is a rapid chit-chit-chit-chit, although it has more melodious sounds in its repertoire.

John Gould reported that it sounded like a child's rattle or [...] "small cog-wheels of a steam mill". In his book What Bird is That?

The journalist said the song was reminiscent of the 1995 chart-topper [...] "You Are Not Alone", as it <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> him like a track that could have been written by R.

Music journalist Roger Catlin stated that the song leaned toward [...] "neo-gospel". The New York Post said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was [...] "lullaby-like" [...] and the best song on Invincible, and Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Jackson's [...] "long lines and creamy overdubbed choruses [...] weightlessly" [...] in the ballad, that the journalist felt it was a love song to God.|$|E
500|$|The teams {{played an}} intense {{overtime}} period filled with end-to-end rushes and brilliant saves by the goaltenders. [...] At one point, Canada's Guy Lafleur put a shot on net that snuck through the Czechoslovak goaltender, but Ivan Hlinka deliberately shoved the net {{out of place}} before the puck crossed the line. [...] He received a delay of game penalty, but prevented a Canadian win. [...] A few moments later, Guy Lapointe rifled a low shot that again beat Dzurilla, however this goal was also disallowed as the buzzer had <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> end the first ten-minutes of the overtime period one-tenth of a second before it crossed the line. International rules of the time dictated that play was to be stopped at the ten-minute mark of each overtime period and the teams would switch {{the side of the}} ice they defended. [...] During the break, Canadian assistant coach Don Cherry noted to his team that Dzurilla often came far out of his net to defend and could be beaten on a shot from a sharp angle.|$|E

On the evening of the sinking, she was playing bridge (this would have been bridge whist, a predecessor to today's game) in a first-class saloon before retiring to the cabin that she shared with her mother. The game was later credited with saving the lives of the players who had stayed up late to finish it, despite it being (as one American writer put it) [...] "a violation of the strict Sabbath rules of English vessels." [...] The collision with the iceberg at 11:40 pm <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> Gibson like a [...] "long, drawn, sickening scrunch".

According to [...] writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had {{originally}} composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution [...] "off-putting", to which the latter confessed, [...] "On all the collaborations I'd left {{a lot of space}} for him, but for this I wanted to put something on the table and say, 'This is what I think'". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a [...] "vision on how the song should be finished". Orbit did not like the addition since it <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> him that the [...] "DAT's broken". De Vries defended his contribution saying that {{it was supposed to be}} [...] "like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune."
