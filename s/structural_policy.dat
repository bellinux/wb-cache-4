On the other hand, qualitative studies, often inspired by realist approaches, were important to understand how these policies could have achieved the observed impact and why they would succeed in some settings but fail in others.

We show that these gains are systematically unrealized. Indeed, we find a political economy paradox that the larger are the gains from good structura policy, the worse are the policies actually adopted.
