Here, we focus on cesium diffusion and use detailed micro characterisation data, based on micro computed tomography, along with a grain-scale Inter-Granular Network model, to offer a plausible explanation for the anomalously long cesium penetration profiles observed in these in-situ experiments. The sparse distribution of chemically reactive grains (i. e. grains belonging to <b>sorbing</b> mineral phases) is shown to have a strong control on the diffusive patterns of <b>sorbing</b> radionuclides. The computed penetration profiles of cesium agree well with an analytical model based on two parallel diffusive pathways. This agreement, along with visual inspection of the spatial distribution of cesium concentration, indicates that for <b>sorbing</b> radionuclides the medium indeed behaves as a composite system, with most of the mass being retained close to the injection boundary and a non-negligible part diffusing faster along preferential diffusive pathways...|$|E

Under identical loading conditions, the amounts of diesel oil initially loaded on the various sorbents were 178, 288 and 649 mg g(- 1) for BCS, spill <b>sorb</b> and peat <b>sorb,</b> respectively. Total biodegradation of <b>sorbed</b> diesel was comparable for all the sorbents (45 - 52 mg), however, the biodegradation rates were significantly different. Peat <b>sorb</b> demonstrated a distinct initial lag phase, the biodegradation rate in spill <b>sorb</b> was initially slower, whereas biodegradation at a high rate commenced immediately for BCS. The maximum biodegradation rates observed for BCS, spill <b>sorb</b> and peat <b>sorb</b> microcosms were 7. 9, 5, and 2. 9 mg day(- 1), respectively. Thus, the maximum biodegradation rate increased as the diesel oil loading decreased.

Allen Abstract: The loss of nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), in agricultural drainage waters {{is a priority}} conservation concern. Open drainage ditches concentrate runoff and therefore offer opportunities for capturing P in runoff from large areas of land. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the potential to use P <b>sorbing</b> materials in drainage ditches to sequester dissolved P from ditch water. We describe factors affecting the selection of P <b>sorbing</b> materials for use in treating ditch water and review several approaches to their application in ditches. In addi-tion, experiential insight is provided with regard to developing and installing a P removal structure within a ditch that has high concentrations of dissolved P in flow. Preliminary data indicate that such structures have great promise in treating not only dissolved P in ditch flow, but also trace metals (arsenic, copper, nickel, zinc). Key words: drainage ditches—phosphorus removal structure—phosphorus <b>sorbing</b> materials—water quality Concern over accelerated eutrophica-tion in many agricultural watersheds has focused attention on novel manage-ment practices to reduce phosphorus (P) transfers from agricultural fields to down-stream surface waters (Sims et al. 1998; He et al. 2006). Although the existing man-agement practices can successfully reduce particulate P losses to surface waters, rela-tively few management practices have been developed to curtail dissolved P transfers (Sharpley 1992). Increasingly, investigators are turning to the use of phosphorus <b>sorbing</b> materials (PSMs) to decrease the potential for soils and manures to release dissolved...|$|E
40|$|Within the European Union the {{exposure}} of aquatic organisms to pesticides is assessed by simulations with the so-called FOCUS Surface Water Scenarios. Runoff {{plays an important role}} in these scenarios. As little is known about the effect of runoff size on {{the exposure}}, we investigated the effect of runoff size on the concentration in the runoff water and in streams simulated with the PRZM and TOXSWA models for two FOCUS runoff scenarios. For weakly <b>sorbing</b> pesticides (K F,oc - 1) the pesticide concentration in the runoff water decreased exponentially with increasing daily runoff size. The runoff size hardly affected the pesticide concentration in the runoff water of strongly <b>sorbing</b> pesticides (K F,oc ≥ 1000 Lkg- 1). For weakly <b>sorbing</b> pesticides the concentration in the FOCUS stream reached a maximum at runoff sizes of about 0. 3 to 1. mm. The concentration increased rapidly when the runoff size increased from 0 to 0. 1. mm and gradually decreased when runoff exceeded 1. mm. For strongly <b>sorbing</b> pesticides the occurrence of the maximum concentration in the stream is clearly less pronounced and lies approximately between 1 and 20. mm runoff. So, this work indicates that preventing small runoff events (e. g. by vegetated buffer strips) reduces exposure concentrations strongly for weakly <b>sorbing</b> pesticides. A simple metamodel was developed for the ratio between the concentrations in the stream and in the runoff water. This model predicted the ratios simulated by TOXSWA very well and it demonstrated that (in addition to runoff size and concentration in runoff) the size of the pesticide-free base flow and pesticide treatment ratio of the catchment determine the stream concentration to a large extent...|$|E

The experimental studies analysed in the paper encompass column-, lysimeter- and field-scale experiments on glyphosate transport.

40|$|Based on {{the results}} from {{detailed}} structural and petrological characterisation and on up-scaled laboratory values for sorption and diffusion, blind predictions were made for the STT 1 dipole tracer test performed in the Swedish A¨ spo¨ Hard Rock Laboratory. The tracers used were nonsorbing, such as uranine and tritiated water, weakly <b>sorbing</b> 22 Na+, 85 Sr 2 +, 47 Ca 2 +and more strongly <b>sorbing</b> 86 Rb+, 133 Ba 2 +, 137 Cs+. Our model consists of two parts: (1) a flow part based on a 2 D-streamtube formalism accounting for the natural background flow field and with an underlying homogeneous and isotropic transmissivity field and (2) a transport part {{in terms of the}} dual porosity medium approach which is linked to the flow part by the flow porosity. The calibration of the model was done using the data from one single uranine breakthrough (PDT 3). The study clearly showed that matrix diffusion into a highly porous material, fault gouge, had to be included in our model evidenced by the characteristic shape of the breakthrough curve and in line with geological observations. After the disclosure of the measurements, it turned out that, in spite of the simplicity of our model, the prediction for the nonsorbing and weakly <b>sorbing</b> tracers was fairly good. The blind prediction for the more strongly <b>sorbing</b> tracers was in general less accurate. The reason for the good predictions is deemed {{to be the result of}} the choice of a model structure strongly based on geological observation. The breakthrough curves were inversely modelled to determine in situ values for the transport parameters and to draw consequences on the model structure applied. For good fits, only one additional fracture family in contact with cataclasite had to be taken into account, but no new transport mechanisms had to be invoked. The in situ values for the effective diffusion coefficient for fault gouge are a factor of 2 – 15 larger than the laboratory data. For cataclasite, both data sets have values comparable to laboratory data. The extracted Kd values for the weakly <b>sorbing</b> tracers are larger than Swedish laboratory data by a factor of 25 – 60, but agree within a factor of 3 – 5 for the more strongly <b>sorbing</b> nuclides. The reason for the inconsistency concerning Kds is the use of fresh granite in the laboratory studies, whereas tracers in the field experiments interact only with fracture fault gouge and to a lesser extent with cataclasite both being mineralogically very different (e. g. clay-bearing) from the intact wall rock...|$|E

40|$|Vascular {{system in}} all {{vertebrate}} organisms has in charge essential {{functions such as}} to bring nutrients, oxygen and signalling molecules to distant organs. Vascular network is established through sequential and distinct processes. During embryogenesis, angioblasts give rise to differentiated endothelial cells, which form primary vessels through vasculogenesis. Expansion of this primary network is then achieved through a multistep process known as angiogenesis. During angiogenesis, remodelling of endothelial cell shape relies on cytoskeleton dynamics. In this study, {{our goal was to}} investigate the potential role of the SoHo family of adaptor proteins in angiogenesis. The SoHo family comprises three members, <b>Sorbs</b> 1, <b>Sorbs</b> 2 and <b>Sorbs</b> 3. Although accumulative evidence links this protein family to the regulation of cell adhesion and actin cytoskeletal organisation, their expression and potential functions in endothelial cells remain unknown. Using zebrafish loss of function experiments combined with confocal imaging, we show that loss of <b>Sorbs</b> 1 affects caudal vein-derived vessel formation, whereas <b>Sorbs</b> 2 depletion impairs ISV development essentially derived from the dorsal aorta. We then demonstrated that both members impact on EC behaviour via regulation of RhoGTPases activity, leading to the vascular defects observed in vivo. Using a series of in vitro functional assays, we found that <b>Sorbs</b> 1 and <b>Sorbs</b> 2 have opposite effects on adhesives properties of HUVECs related to their ability to regulate different RhoGTPases. <b>Sorbs</b> 1 depleted ECs adhere excessively to the ECM due to decrease in Rac 1 activity. In contrast, loss of <b>Sorbs</b> 2 impaired RhoA activation during adhesion and decreases cell adhesiveness to the matrix. Interestingly, these opposite effects on cell adhesion lead to similar outcome on EC migratory abilities, a decrease in cell migration.

Synthetical solutions containing known concentrations of ligands, EDTA and IDA were titrated separately with aluminium(III) and copper(II), by adding known concentration of titrant metal, and measuring the concentration of metal ion sorbed on the resin, c. The concentration of free metal ion was evaluated from c by the relationship: [M] = cV/K*w. K * is {{the ratio of the}} concentration of metal ion sorbed on the resin to the free metal ion in solution, and strongly depends on the conditions. In the case of the resins used in this investigation it can be calculated since the sorption equilibria of the metal ions are known. The total concentration of the ligands and the conditional stability constants are evaluated by a linearization procedure, previously proposed and widely used for ligand titrations, based on the hypothesis that onlya 1 to 1 metal to ligand complex is formed. Accurate results are always obtained if the titration is properly carried out, i. e. using the appropriate resin, and adding the required excess of titrant. Some criteria are suggested to evaluate the results obtained, which can be useful when solutions of unknown composition are titrated.

Although this effect might be potentially important for predicting the in situ mechanical behavior of coal seams during CH production or CO sequestration, very little understanding exists on the underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we report a single, long-duration mechanical test on a large, cube-shaped coal sample (Ruhr Basin, Germany). The sample was subjected to isostatic loading and unloading; first in the evacuated state (as received), and then each time after exposing it to pressurized, non-adsorbing He, or <b>sorbing</b> N, CH, and CO. We find that exposure to <b>sorbing</b> gases led to swelling, which introduced a hysteresis in the stress-strain trajectory followed during mechanical loading. This hysteresis was almost absent in the evacuated state, and its magnitude depended strongly {{on the amount of}} adsorption-induced swelling exhibited by the sample. The apparent bulk modulus determined here for the CO-equilibrated state was approximately 25 % lower compared to the evacuated state. We qualitatively consider mechanisms that affect the elastic behavior of coal at the matrix and bulk scale, and argue that the observed effects are a combined effect of 1) changes in surface roughness at cleat interfaces and microfractures, and 2) a thermodynamic coupling between stress state, sorption capacity and swelling strain. The changes in stiffness relate to fluid-rock interaction effects, {{as well as to the}} presence of fractures, and hence not to the inherent elastic properties of the solid phase itself.

These proteins share a similar structure with a SoHo domain in N-terminal region and three SH 3 domains in carboxy terminal region. These characteristic domains bind to several signaling molecules involved {{in a variety of}} cytoskeleton-related processes, and SoHo family members are thus thought to function as adaptor proteins. However, the precise role of these proteins in the cytoskeleton regulation and associated biological functions remains unknown. It is well established that cytoskeleton regulation is critical for various developmental events including angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels develop from pre-existing ones, and myogenesis, the process responsible for muscle formation and regeneration. The goal of this project is to identify the developmental function of <b>Sorbs</b> 1 and characterize the underlying molecular events by exploiting a combination of in vivo (Zebrafish) and in vitro models. Phenotype analysis revealed that Morpholino-mediated knock-down of <b>Sorbs</b> 1 induces abnormal development of cardiac, angiogenic and muscles structures. Knock-down zebrafish embryos were unable to form cardiac looping and present a cardiac edema. Also, it was noticed that tail morphology was altered by <b>Sorbs</b> 1 knock-down suggesting that <b>Sorbs</b> 1 plays a role in trunk muscle formation.

Interestingly, <b>Sorbs</b> 1 seems to have a specific role in venous angiogenesis (CVP and SIV), since arterial angiogenic structures, such as Intersegmental vessels, were not affected in <b>Sorbs</b> 1 morphants. In conclusion, these preliminary results of our work highlighted important developmental defects by consequence of <b>Sorbs</b> 1 inactivation in Zebrafish. Some of these defects appear to be regulated by angiogenesis and myogenesis, two developmental processes for which the therapeutic implications are undeniable. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Sorption of {{volatile}} hydrocarbon gases (VHCs) to marine sediments is {{a recognized}} phenomenon {{that has been}} investigated {{in the context of}} petroleum exploration. However, {{little is known about the}} biogeochemistry of <b>sorbed</b> methane and higher VHCs in environments that are not influenced by thermogenic processes. This study evaluated two different extraction protocols for <b>sorbed</b> VHCs, used high pressure equipment to investigate the sorption of methane to pure clay mineral phases, and conducted a geochemical and mineralogical survey of sediment samples from different oceanographic settings and geochemical regimes that are not significantly influenced by thermogenic gas. Extraction of sediments under alkaline conditions yielded higher concentrations of <b>sorbed</b> methane than the established protocol for acidic extraction. Application of alkaline extraction in the environmental survey revealed the presence of substantial amounts of <b>sorbed</b> methane in 374 out of 411 samples (91 %). Particularly high amounts, up to 2. 1 mmol kg**- 1 dry sediment, were recovered from methanogenic sediments. Carbon isotopic compositions of <b>sorbed</b> methane suggested substantial contributions from biogenic sources, both in sulfate-depleted and sulfate-reducing sediments. Carbon isotopic relationships between <b>sorbed</b> and dissolved methane indicate a coupling of the two pools. While our sorption experiments and extraction conditions point to an important role for clay minerals as sorbents, mineralogical analyses of marine sediments suggest that variations in mineral composition are not controlling variations in quantities of <b>sorbed</b> methane. We conclude that the distribution of <b>sorbed</b> methane in sediments is strongly influenced by in situ production...|$|R
