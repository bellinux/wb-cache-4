40|$|Introduction In {{the earlier}} <b>Working</b> <b>Notes,</b> we {{described}} {{the process of}} building concept descriptions from components. Components (unlike frame-slot-value triples or frames 1) encapsulate a single statement about the world, and are the `basic units' from which concept descriptions are built. By including or omitting components, we can selectively represent different aspects of concepts, as required by the particular problem-solving task at hand (eg. explanation, diagnosis). They also provide the `units of retraction' for fixing buggy concept descriptions (<b>Working</b> <b>Note</b> 3). This <b>Working</b> <b>Note</b> extends these ideas to the STRIPS-like representation of actions, ie. actions considered as discrete events with preconditions, add, and delete lists [Fikes et al., 1981]. As with concepts in general, we have to decide what to model and what to ignore when describing actions. Our goal here is to similarly encapsulate each modellable feature of the dynamics of the world a...|$|R
