50|$|In electronics, a {{crossbar}} <b>switch</b> (cross-point <b>switch,</b> matrix <b>switch)</b> is {{a collection}} of <b>switches</b> arranged in a matrix configuration. A crossbar <b>switch</b> has multiple input and output lines that form a crossed pattern of interconnecting lines between which a connection may be established by closing a <b>switch</b> located at each intersection, the elements of the matrix. Originally, a crossbar <b>switch</b> consisted literally of crossing metal bars that provided the input and output paths.

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{features}} description of electronics <b>switches</b> for digital <b>switching</b> arrays and on the design of program for optimal calculation of <b>switching</b> points and the figure of <b>switches</b> in digital <b>switching</b> arrays investigation. The electronics <b>switches</b> types, used for time circuit separation, are described in the preamble. These <b>switches</b> are the base of digital <b>switching</b> arrays and in principal two types are defined: the <b>switch</b> S and <b>switch</b> T. The <b>switch</b> S allows the interconnection only of the same channel intervals from incoming circuit with random outgoing circuit. The <b>switch</b> S is being used in multistage <b>switching</b> arrays in combination with the <b>switches</b> T because it can not be used separately. The <b>switch</b> T allows exchanging the time position of incoming circuit to different time position of outgoing circuit depending on connection needs. The time <b>switch</b> can substitute the space <b>switch</b> under specific work conditions. In practice, the time <b>switch</b> with controlled reading and writing is used. The following part of diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the designs and calculations of optimal <b>switching</b> points of digital <b>switching</b> array which is the executive unit of <b>switching</b> systems. These systems directly interconnect the signals from digital multiplexes and make the basic assumptions for telecommunication networks integration. The digital <b>switching</b> array means the equipment which is able to connect the channels of digital multiplexes carrying the information in encoding form. The multiplexes are the most often with pulse coded modulation or adaptive delta modulation. The digital <b>switching</b> arrays are divided into the time and space one. The <b>switching</b> arrays of digital <b>switching</b> systems can be made by time <b>switching</b> array T whose realization is limited to specific capacity or by the connection of multistage arrays. Single stages sequenced one behind each other are made by the <b>switches</b> T and S. The space array S does not allow making the digital <b>switching</b> array of <b>switching</b> centre. The program which determines possible proposals of <b>switching</b> arrays from defined figure of inputs and calculates the optimal figure of <b>switching</b> points and <b>switches</b> is a part of diploma thesis...|$|R

5|$|After the {{televised}} draft, Joey Styles, the Director of Digital Media Content for WWE's official website, interviewed the draftees on their reactions. The drafted wrestlers generally expressed {{approval of the}} draft and described what they hoped their experiences would be with their new brand. Seven of the wrestlers were champions with their original brand, and as outlined in the draft regulations, they carried their titles over to their new brand; this affected seven of nine championships. Champion draft selections included: Unified Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo), United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter, WWE Champion Triple H, and Divas Champion Maryse from SmackDown to Raw; Women's Champion Melina and Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio from Raw to SmackDown. Since Triple H was drafted to Raw, it left SmackDown without a top contested title, as Raw now featured {{two of the three}} top contested championships in WWE: the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships (although Edge would later brought the World Heavyweight Championship title back to SmackDown as its exclusive-top title following his win against John Cena at Backlash). When Mysterio and Porter <b>switched</b> brands, the two secondary championships <b>switched</b> brands {{for the first time in}} WWE's history. This also occurred when Melina and Maryse <b>switched</b> brands, as the two female contested titles also <b>switched</b> brands for the first time. Though the Unified Tag Team Champions were both drafted over to Raw from SmackDown, the titles were able to be defended on all three brands due to being unified.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that output-buffered <b>switches</b> have better {{performance}} than other <b>switch</b> architectures. However, output-buffered <b>switches</b> also suffer from the notorious scalability problem, and direct constructions of large output-buffered <b>switches</b> are difficult. In this paper, we study the problem of constructing scalable <b>switches</b> that have comparable performance (in the sense of 100 % throughput and first-in first-out (FIFO) delivery of packets from the same flow) to output-buffered <b>switches.</b> For this, we propose a new concept, called quasi-outputbuffered <b>switch.</b> Like an output-buffered <b>switch,</b> a quasi-outputbuffered <b>switch</b> is a deterministic <b>switch</b> that achieves 100 % throughput and delivers packets from the same flow in the FIFO order. Using the three-stage Clos network, we show that one can recursively construct a larger quasi-output-buffered <b>switch</b> with a set of smaller quasi-output-buffered <b>switches.</b> By recursively expanding the three-stage Clos network, we obtain a quasioutput-buffered <b>switch</b> with only 2 × 2 <b>switches.</b> Such a <b>switch</b> is called a packet-pair <b>switch</b> in this paper as it always transmits packets in pairs. By computer simulations, we show that packetpair <b>switches</b> have better delay performance than most loadbalanced <b>switches</b> with comparable construction complexity...|$|R
