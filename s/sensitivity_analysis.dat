Although sampling methods are simple, but the drawbacks are obvious: ① huge computation effort is required particularly if the sample size is very large; ② they produce discrete rather than continuous results, which means additional data processing for sampling results is necessary if the continuous relation is required. For example, <b>sensitivities</b> <b>analysis</b> cannot be carried out directly based on the discrete results.|$|R

For example, a study by Manlik et al. (2016) forecast the viability of two bottlenose dolphin populations in Western Australia and identified reproduction as having the greatest influence on the forecast of these populations. One of the two populations was forecast to be stable, whereas the other population was forecast to decline, if it isolated from other populations and low reproductive rates persist. The difference in viability between the two studies was primarily due to differences in reproduction and not survival. The study also showed that temporal variation in reproduction had a greater effect on population growth than temporal variation in survival.|$|E

40|$|The {{current state}} of the art in {{electromagnetic}} hyperthermia requires a patient to be placed in a specific position and maintain this position during a treatment. As hyperthermia treatments may last an hour or more, this introduces an unpleasant constraint. Also, any deviations from the specified position by the patient may have a large impact on the effectiveness of the treatment. We investigate potentially interesting methods for calibrating the hyperthermic applicator as a first step to accommodating the potential displacement of the patient. Specifically, we examine the use of electromagnetic and power probes placed externally to the patient and investigate a technique by Fokkema and van den Berg [Fokkema and van den Berg(1996) ] that may prove useful in a more advanced phase of calibration research. The probes mentioned are used to calculate the Green 2 ̆ 6 apos;s function matrix relating their values to the applicator settings. This problem is then inverted to find the settings that will restore the original probe values (or a close approximation). The <b>sensitivities</b> <b>analysis</b> of Fokkema and van den Berg [Fokkema and van den Berg(1996) ] uses Lorentz reciprocity and an assumption termed the Born approximation to determine whether (the in our case electromagnetic) sensitivities may be linearized with respect to a contrast - a perturbation from the original situation. We find that external probes equal in number to the number of antennas on the applicator insufficiently represent the fields inside the patient, especially in terms of tumor coverage and hotspots. The <b>sensitivities</b> <b>analysis,</b> however, proves promising on a toy problem and has potential to be expanded to a more complex configuration.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis research introduces the adjoint {{of the data}} assimilation system, which together with the classical adjoint sensitivity problem, represents the two fundamental components of the complete forecast adjoint sensitivity problem. This adjoint of the data assimilation system is then used to investigate {{the sensitivity of the}} forecast aspect J to the observations and background for idealized analysis problems, and finally a real-data case using the NAVDAS adjoint for a situation with unusually large 72 -h forecast errors over the western United States during February 1999. The observation sensitivity is largest when the observations are relatively isolated, assumed to be more accurate than the background, and the <b>analysis</b> <b>sensitivity</b> gradients are large in amplitude and have a spatial scale similar to the background error covariances. The observation sensitivity is considerably weaker for small-scale <b>analysis</b> <b>sensitivity</b> gradients. The large observation sensitivities suggest that adaptive observations near large-scale <b>analysis</b> <b>sensitivity</b> gradients have a greater potential to change the forecast aspect than observations near small- scale <b>analysis</b> <b>sensitivity</b> gradients. Therefore, targeting decisions based on the adjoint of the data assimilation system may be significantly different from targeting decisions based solely on the <b>analysis</b> <b>sensitivity</b> gradients. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for the data assimilation procedures in the adaptive observation-targeting problem. [URL] Naval Research Laborator...|$|R

2500|$|Given the {{uncertainty}} inherent in project forecasting and valuation, analysts will wish {{to assess the}} sensitivity of project NPV to the various inputs (i.e. assumptions) to the DCF model. In a typical <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analysis</b> the analyst will vary one key factor while holding all other inputs constant, ceteris paribus. The sensitivity of NPV {{to a change in}} that factor is then observed, and is calculated as a [...] "slope": ΔNPV / Δfactor. For example, the analyst will determine NPV at various growth rates in annual revenue as specified (usually at set increments, e.g. -10%, -5%, 0%, 5%....), and then determine the sensitivity using this formula. Often, several variables may be of interest, and their various combinations produce a [...] "value-surface", (or even a [...] "value-space",) where NPV is then a function of several variables.
