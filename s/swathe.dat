5|$|Although still young, Henry was {{increasingly}} gaining {{a reputation as}} an energetic and capable leader. His prestige and power increased further when he unexpectedly married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152; Eleanor was the attractive Duchess of Aquitaine and the recently divorced wife of Louis VII of France, and the marriage made Henry the future ruler of a huge <b>swathe</b> of territory across France.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the British Library {{required}} demolition of {{an integral part of}} Bloomsbury – a seven-acre <b>swathe</b> of streets immediately in front of the Museum, so that the Library could be situated directly opposite. After a long and hard-fought campaign led by Dr George Wagner, this decision was overturned and the library was instead constructed by John Laing plc on a site at Euston Road next to St Pancras railway station.|$|E

5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense <b>swathe</b> of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
5|$|Described as a {{large and}} {{physically}} imposing character {{with a reputation for}} womanising, Le Gris was a liege man (feudal retainer) of Count Pierre d'Alençon and a favourite at his court, governing a large <b>swathe</b> of his liege lord's territory in addition to his own ancestral holdings. Le Gris' insistence on defending his case by chivalric trial by combat rather than opting for the safer church trial (to which as a cleric in minor orders he was entitled) attracted widespread support for his cause amongst the French nobility, and controversy continues to this day as to where the real guilt lies in the case.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} year, the RPF waged a classic {{hit-and-run}} style guerrilla war, capturing some border areas but not making significant {{gains in the}} war against the Rwandan army. Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large <b>swathe</b> of land across the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|In early 1396, {{following}} {{the peace treaty}} with England, the French army mobilised against another pressing threat; that of the Turks to the east {{as part of a}} new crusade. As a leader of the original party to investigate events in Hungary, it was natural that Jean de Carrouges would return with his followers in the service of his old commander, Admiral Jean de Vienne. The army crossed Central Europe, united with the Hungarians and marched south, burning the city of Vidin and massacring the inhabitants before {{following the}} course of the Danube southeast, cutting a <b>swathe</b> of destruction through Ottoman territory. On the 12 September, the army arrived at the city of Nicopolis but were repulsed from its walls and settled into a siege.|$|E
5|$|This system brought {{widespread}} rains {{to a wide}} <b>swathe</b> of India {{during its}} existence. Some heavy rains in West Bengal flooded vast areas of many districts and resulted in some fatalities, whilst in parts of neighbouring Orissa the floodwaters damaged fields. 390mm (15inches) of rain fell on Bardhaman over two days as the depression passed overhead. Several thousand people were made homeless in West Bengal. Both the Narmada and Tapti Rivers inundated parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The floods in Gujarat took many lives and caused severe damage to crops and other properties. Between 300 and 400people were washed away in two villages in Bharuch district. 260mm (10inches) of rain fell on Surat on July 7 and a further 80mm (3inches) on Kutch District as the cyclone moved out to sea.|$|E

5|$|A broad <b>swathe</b> {{of western}} Chiapas {{was held by}} the Zoques, {{covering}} the Depresión Central, the middle Grijalva basin, the Chimalapas {{and parts of the}} Pacific coastline. The main Zoque settlements in the Depresión Central were Copainalá, Mezcalapa, Quechula and Tecapatán. Their settlements on the western side of the Grijalva River included Citalapa, Jiquipilas, Ocozocuautla and the Corzos valley. Coyatocmó was a small Zoque settlement that grew into the modern state capital, Tuxtla Gutiérrez. The Aztecs exacted tribute from the Zoques, and dominated trade routes running through their territory. In pre-Columbian times, the Depresión Central featured two of the largest cities in the region, Chiapa and Copanaguastla. The area around Chiapa de Corzo was occupied by the Chiapanecas, whose ethnicity and language are unknown. The Chiapanecas were militarily powerful before the Spanish conquest; they had forced a number of important Zoque settlements to pay them tribute, and had successfully resisted being incorporated into the Aztec Empire. The Chiapaneca territory lay between the territories of the Zoques and the Tzotzil Maya, in the upper and middle Grijalva basin; their main settlements were Acala, Chiapa, Ostuta, Pochutla and Suchiapa.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} weeks scouts were {{sent out to}} try to make contact with local Mopan and Ch'ol communities, including Chok Ajaw, AjMay, IxB'ol and Manche without success – most of the natives had fled, leaving the forest deserted. At San Pedro Mártir he received news of AjChan's embassy to Mérida in December 1695 and the formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men at Lake Petén Itzá, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned the unfinished fort. Friar Cano recommended to the new Guatemalan president that the Ch'ol be moved to Verapaz where they could be properly administered. As a result of the failed expedition, Cano's recommendation was accepted, the fort was dismantled and any Maya that could be captured across a wide <b>swathe</b> of southern Petén was forcibly relocated to Belén near Rabinal in Verapaz. This relocation was brutal and ruthless and was condemned by several high-ranking colonial officials, including oidor José de Escals and even by Amésqueta.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{built their}} cities with Neolithic technology; they built their {{structures}} from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad <b>swathe</b> of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available. The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety {{in the quality}} of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality. Volcanic tuff was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed sandstone. In Comalcalco, where suitable stone was not available locally, fired bricks were employed. Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco. Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.|$|E

5|$|The {{manpower}} problem {{was compounded by}} the supply crisis which was affecting the entire nation, with the fleet going unpaid and largely unfed for months at times. In August 1793, these problems {{came to a head}} in the fleet off Brest, when a lack of provisions resulted in a mutiny among the regular sailors. The crews overruled their officers and brought their ships into harbour in search of food, leaving the French coast undefended. The National Convention responded instantly by executing a <b>swathe</b> of senior officers and ship's non-commissioned officers. Hundreds more officers and sailors were imprisoned, banished or dismissed from naval service. The effect of this purge was devastating, seriously degrading the fighting ability of the fleet by removing at a stroke many of its most capable personnel. In their places were promoted junior officers, merchant captains and even civilians who expressed sufficient revolutionary zeal, although few of them knew how to fight or control a battle fleet at sea.|$|E
5|$|After its {{removal from}} Operation Varsity, the {{division}} remained in reserve as the Allied armies advanced even further into Germany, moving to Oise, France, on 3 April for supply and administrative tasks. The division {{was scheduled to}} participate in several other airborne operations; however, these were all cancelled before they could take place. The first of these was Operation Arena, which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a 'strategic airhead' in the Kassel region of Northern Germany; the planners of the operations envisioned that the operation would deny a large <b>swathe</b> of territory to the German defenders and give the Allied armies a staging area for further advances into Germany. The 13th was chosen to participate, along with the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th and 1st Airborne Divisions. A preliminary date for 1 May was set for the operation once all of the required airborne and air-landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied, but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 March due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces negating {{the need for the}} operation. Two other airborne operations were planned to include the 13th. Operation Choker II was to be an airborne landing on the east bank of the Rhine near Worms, Germany; planning for the operation got to an advanced stage, and the division was only hours from taking off from airfields in France when the operation was cancelled due to Allied ground forces overrunning the proposed landing areas. Operation Effective was designed to land the 13th south of Stuttgart, seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near the Black Forest. The operation was scheduled for 22 April, but was cancelled on 18 April due to Allied units encircling the Black Forest region and making it unnecessary.|$|E
