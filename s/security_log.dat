5000|$|The <b>Security</b> <b>Log,</b> in Microsoft Windows, is a log that {{contains}} records of login/logout activity or other security-related events {{specified by the}} system's audit policy. Auditing allows administrators to configure Windows to record operating system activity in the <b>Security</b> <b>Log.</b> The <b>Security</b> <b>Log</b> {{is one of three}} logs viewable under Event Viewer. Local Security Authority Subsystem Service writes events to the log. The <b>Security</b> <b>Log</b> is one of the primary tools used by Administrators to detect and investigate attempted and successful unauthorized activity and to troubleshoot problems; Microsoft describes it as [...] "Your Best and Last Defense". The log and the audit policies that govern it are also favorite targets of hackers and rogue system administrators seeking to cover their tracks before and after committing unauthorized activity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — As {{security}} monitoring grows {{both more}} complicated and more sophisticated, there is an increased demand for outsourcing these tasks to Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs). However, the core problem of sharing private <b>security</b> <b>logs</b> creates a barrier to the widespread adoption of this business model. In this paper we analyze the <b>logs</b> used for <b>security</b> analysis with the concern of privacy and propose the constraints on anonymization of <b>security</b> monitor <b>logs.</b> We believe if the anonymization solution fulfills the constraints, MSSPs can detect the attacks efficiently and protect privacy simultaneously.

2500|$|According to Pagliano, <b>security</b> <b>logs</b> of Clinton's {{email server}} showed no {{evidence}} of successful hacking.

5000|$|Another way {{to defeat}} the <b>Security</b> <b>Log</b> would be for a user to log in as Administrator and change the {{auditing}} policies to stop logging the unauthorized activity he intends to carry out. The policy change itself could be logged, depending on the [...] "audit policy change" [...] setting, but this event could be deleted from the log using Winzapper; and from that point onward, the activity would not generate a trail in the <b>Security</b> <b>Log.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Winzapper {{creates a}} backup <b>security</b> <b>log,</b> [...] "dummy.dat," [...] at %systemroot%\system32\config. This file may be undeleted after an attack {{to recover the}} {{original}} log. Conceivably, however, a savvy user might copy a sufficiently large file over the dummy.dat file and thus irretrievably overwrite it. Winzapper causes the Event Viewer to become unusable until after a reboot, so an unexpected reboot may be a clue that Winzapper has recently been used. Another potential clue to a Winzapper-based attempt would be corruption of the <b>Security</b> <b>Log</b> (requiring it to be cleared), since {{there is always a}} small risk that Winzapper will do this.|$|E
5000|$|After a {{predefined}} {{number of}} unsuccessful logon attempts, <b>security</b> <b>log</b> entries and (where appropriate) security alerts must be generated and user accounts must be locked out {{as required by}} the relevant Information Asset Owners.|$|E

50|$|Aspect-oriented {{programming}} allows cross-cutting {{concerns to}} be addressed as secondary concerns. For example, most programs require some form of <b>security</b> and <b>logging.</b> <b>Security</b> and <b>logging</b> are often secondary concerns, whereas the primary concern is often on accomplishing business goals. However, when designing a program, its security must be built into the design from the beginning instead of being treated as a secondary concern. Applying security afterwards often results in an insufficient security model that leaves too many gaps for future attacks.|$|R
50|$|The {{sheer number}} of loggable events means that <b>security</b> <b>log</b> {{analysis}} can be a time-consuming task. Third-party utilities {{have been developed to}} help identify suspicious trends. It is also possible to filter the log using customized criteria.|$|E
50|$|Prior to Winzapper's creation, Administrators {{already had}} the ability to clear the <b>Security</b> <b>log</b> either through the Event Viewer or through {{third-party}} tools such as Clearlogs. However, Windows lacked any built-in method of selectively deleting events from the <b>Security</b> <b>Log.</b> An unexpected clearing of the log would likely be a red flag to system administrators that an intrusion had occurred. Winzapper would allow a hacker to hide the intrusion by deleting only those log events relevant to the attack. Winzapper, as publicly released, lacked the ability to be run remotely without the use of a tool such as Terminal Services. However, according to Arne Vidstrom, it could easily be modified for remote operation.|$|E

50|$|Randy Franklin Smith's Ultimate Windows Security {{points out}} that given the ability of administrators to {{manipulate}} the <b>Security</b> <b>Log</b> to cover unauthorized activity, separation of duty between operations and security-monitoring IT staff, combined with frequent backups of the log to a server accessible only to the latter, can improve security.|$|E
