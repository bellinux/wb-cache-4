40|$|Firstly, {{this paper}} makes {{analyses}} on the geographical visualization and mapping functionality in GIS software which have some shortcomings. So, {{the idea of}} geographical information cartographic representation is presented {{to improve the quality}} of the geographical information visualization and to satisfy rules of traditional cartography. The digital cartographic representation, which tries to make a model of the mapping procedure based on traditional cartographic knowledge, creates a template-mapping model for cartographic symbols. This template-mapping model achieves the transformation from cartographic specifications to products. Meanwhile, it can well consider characteristics of respective geographical feature, the relations between this feature and other features, the relations between this feature and cartographic region. These three kinds of relations are described with quantity parameters which can be used to map a symbol template to a <b>symbol</b> <b>instance</b> responding to some one geographical feature. With this template-mapping model for cartographic symbol, we can visualize the respective feature’s property in detail and improve the quality of geographical visualization. Hydrology and transportation features are taken as two examples to verify the availability of this cartographic representation model. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Non-contiguous {{subsequence}} pattern queries {{search for}} <b>symbol</b> <b>instances</b> {{in a long}} sequence that satisfy some soft temporal constraints. In this paper, we propose a methodology that indexes long sequences, in order to efficiently process such queries. The sequence data are decomposed into tables and queries are evaluated as multiway joins between them. We describe non-blocking join operators and provide query preprocessing and optimization techniques that tighten the join predicates and suggest a good join order plan. As opposed to previous approaches, our method can efficiently handle {{a broader range of}} queries and can be easily supported by existing DBMS. Its efficiency is evaluated by experimentation on synthetic and real data. ...|$|R

30|$|A key {{advantage}} {{is the fact}} that extra-repair symbols can be produced incrementally, on demand, rather than all at once (unlike LDPC-Staircase repair <b>symbols</b> for <b>instance).</b> Their number can also be rather high since it is only limited by the finite field size, usually GF(28).

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a way of}} interactive manipulation of structured objects by interaction rules. Symbols are used as graphical representation of object states. State changes lead to different visual <b>symbol</b> <b>instances.</b> The manipulation of symbols using interactive devices lead to an automatic state change of the corresponding structured object without any intervention of the application. Therefor, interaction rules are introduced. These rules describe the way a symbol may be manipulated and the effects this manipulation has on the corresponding structured object. The rules are interpreted by the visualization and interaction service. For each symbol used, a set of interaction rules can be defined. In order to be the more general as possible, all the interactions on a symbol are defined as a triple, which specifies the preconditions of all the manipulations of this symbol, the manipulations themselves, and the postconditions of all the manipulations of this symbol. A manipulation is a qu [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Instead of {{an unusual}} name or an uninterned symbol, the macro simply uses a private symbol from the package in which the macro is defined.
