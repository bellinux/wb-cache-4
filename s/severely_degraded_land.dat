The rainwater was controlled, grass began to grow, and seedling survived. The farmers learned that the watershed improvement activities were a good investment toward the future. Similarly, in Dilamo micro-watershed, Kota Kombola kebele, the previously degraded area containing a network of gullies and exposed parent materials, was hardly suitable for humans even to cross. Intensively managed since 2010, significant rehabilitation has occurred characterized by abundant grass, controlled water runoff, suitable micro-climates, and improved soil fertility. A farmer reported ‘the fertility and land cover is improved {{in such a way}} that people who knew this area previously, but have been gone for a while, may hesitate/get confused on accepting the improved situation’. Areas like this help to develop awareness and serve as a real-live demonstration.|$|E

40|$|The Amazon Basin, home to {{approximately}} half of the world’s tropical forests and a quarter of global biodiversity, has experienced alarming rates of deforestation, land degradation, and loss of ecosystem services since the 1960 s. These processes have largely been driven by unsustainable, low-productivity agriculture, which has left a legacy of persistent rural poverty and over 30 million hectares of abandoned or <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> <b>land.</b> The vast deforested and degraded regions of the Amazon are in great need of restoration by ‘eco-efficient’ land use alternatives that efficiently utilize resources to produce sustainable livelihood benefits while also providing environmental services. Promising examples of eco-efficient agriculture that have the potential to restore Amazonian landscapes include production systems such as improved fallows, multistory agroforestry systems, silvo-pastoral systems, and improved pastures. Although uptake of these strategies in the Amazon remains low, opportunities to promote these more sustainable land uses are quickly emerging, as concern for environmental issues increases, new markets for environmental services open up, consumer interest in niche and novel products rises, and market access improves.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the role of {{spectral}} and spatial resolutions in mapping land degradation from space-borne imagery using Landsat ETM + and ASTER data as examples. Land degradation in the form of salinization and waterlogging in Tongyu County, western Jilin Province of northeast China was mapped from an ETM + image of 22 June 2002 and an ASTER image recorded on 24 June 2001 using supervised classification, together with several other land covers.

The spatial resolution of the ASTER data exerts only a negligible effect on the mapping accuracy. The 30 m ETM + outperforms the ASTER image of both 15 m and 30 m resolution in consistently generating a higher overall accuracy as well as a higher user's accuracy for barren land. The inferiority of ASTER data is attributed to the highly repetitive spectral content of its six shortwave infrared bands.

These land covers have been mapped at an overall accuracy of 80 % from the TM image with the accuracy for individual covers ranging from 75 % to 100 % except settled areas. At 80. 0 %, the accuracy for barren land is higher than that for degraded farmland. The overall classification accuracy was achieved at 75. 3 % from the ASTER data.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of organic amendment on the germination and growth patterns of Jatropha curcas L. on completely barren and <b>degraded</b> <b>land</b> in the Sahelian area of Burkina Faso. Prior to the field trials, laboratory germination tests were undertaken to explore the impact of different pre-treatments on germination of Jatropha seeds. Seeds soaked in water for 24 h had the highest mean rate of germination (86 %) while seeds that were pre-treated with sulphuric acid did not germinate. The results of the field experiment showed that plant growth and biomass development were significantly enhanced by organic amendment compared to the control. With direct seeding, 20 % of the plants treated with organic manure survived after 2 years, while all seedlings of the control plot perished. In the plantations, 30 % of the untreated seedlings remained alive whereas only 5 % of the plants survived with amendment. The trials in unfenced plots were decimated by livestock grazing and trampling 2 months after the beginning of the experiment. This emphasizes the need to protect Jatropha plants at an early stage of their development from roaming animals. Organic amendment attracted humivorous termites, which were destructive to the seedlings. The use of pesticides may be necessary to control this problem. When directly seeded, plants of the control plots demonstrated poor growth and became rapidly diseased, further accelerating their decline. The low survival rates (5 - 30 %) and meagre seedling performance, even for the amended plots, may be an indication that Jatropha is unsuited to <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> like the zippele´, and cannot be expected to give good yields and the claimed environmental and socio-economic benefits. However, we recommend that the performance of Jatropha on the zippele´ should be further tested with other soil and water conservation techniques (half-moon, tillage, etc.) that have been shown to enhance crop production and yield on <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> in the Sahelo- Sudanian zone of West Africa. The impact of seed provenance on the outcome of this study is unknown. Therefore, further experiments should embrace seeds from different sources, including genotypes that are more adapted to dry conditions and might therefore show improved performance.

40|$|Degradation of land health – the {{capacity}} of land, relative to its potential, to sustain delivery of ecosystem services – is recognized as a major global problem in general terms, but remains poorly quantified, resulting in a lack of specific evidence to focus action. Land health surveillance and response is designed to overcome limitations of current assessment approaches. It is modelled on science principles and approaches used in surveillance in the public health sector, which {{has a long history}} of evidence-informed policy and practice. Key elements of the science framework are: (i) repeated measurement of land health and associated risk factors using probability based sampling of well defined populations of sample units; (ii) standardized protocols for data collection to enable statistical analysis of patterns, trends, and associations; (iii) case definitions based on specific diagnostic criteria; (iv) rapid low cost screening tests to permit detection of cases and non-cases in large numbers of samples; (v) cost-effectiveness evaluation of interventions based on projected reduction in risks and problem incidence; (vi) design of statistically analysable studies to evaluate interventions in the real-world; (vii) meta-analysis of these data to guide design of public policy and intervention programmes; and (viii) integrating surveillance and the communication and use of results into operational systems as part of regular policy and practice. The scientific rigour of land health surveillance has potential to provide a sound basis for directing and assessing action to combat land degradation. Specialized national surveillance units should be established to harness and realign existing resources to provide integrated national land health systems. An international unit is needed to provide science and technology support to governments and develop standards, whereas an international agency should coordinate land health surveillance globally.

Biomass, soil chemical properties {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) of six levels of degraded lands (D 1 –D 6, according {{to the number of}} rodent holes and coverage) were investigated {{to examine the effects of}} rodent-induced land degradation on an alpine meadow ecosystem. Soil organic carbon (SOC), labile soil carbon (LC), total nitrogen (TN) and inorganic nitrogen (N) were obtained by chemical analysis. Soil respiration (R s), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were measured by a Li-Cor 6400 XT. Gross ecosystem production (GEP) was the sum of NEE and ER. Aboveground biomass (AGB) was based on a linear regression with coverage and plant height as independent variables. Root biomass (RB) was obtained by using a core method. Soil respiration, ER, GEP and AGB were significantly higher in slightly degraded (D 3 and D 6, group I) than in <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> <b>land</b> (D 1, D 2, D 4 and D 5, group II).

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Pili grass (Heteropogon contortus (L.) P. Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult.) is a {{culturally}} and ecologically important native species in Hawaiʻi {{that has been}} used for re-vegetation of <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> <b>land.</b> Currently, it is being evaluated for expanded use on roadside and streambank stabilization, water efficient landscaping and agricultural buffer strip plantings. Despite efforts to increase its use on a variety of re-vegetation applications, planting materials such as seeds are still in limited supply. In order to develop large scale seed production protocols, studies on seed dormancy and seed harvest timing need to be conducted. The three main objectives of this dissertation were to: 1) elucidate the mechanisms involved in pili grass seed dormancy loss through the use of scarification and germination stimulants (i. e., gibberellic acid [GA], fluridone, food grade liquid smoke [FGLS], pili grass smoke infused water, xylose smoke infused water, karrikinolide and cyanide); 2) assess the effect of storage factors (i. e., seed moisture content and temperature) on pili grass seed dormancy loss and viability; and 3) determine an average cumulative growing degree unit (ACGDU) correlated indicator which has potential use for determining the optimum seed harvest timing. Studies on seed scarification, germination with stimulants and dormancy loss under different storage conditions support the placement of pili grass under the non-deep physiological dormancy class of seeds. The observed partial germination with scarification (i. e., exposure of the embryo) suggests the presence of both physical and physiological dormancy controls. Germination assays with the plant growth regulators, fluridone and GA, as well as with FGLS suggests that the abscisic acid (ABA) :GA balance {{plays an important role in}} pili grass seed dormancy. Seed germination response to chemical stimulants across a gradient in dormancy relief supports the theory of increased effective levels of GA as storage duration increases. Short term seed storage studies (i. e., 1 year or less) show that dormancy and seed viability loss is affected by storage temperature and equilibrium relative humidity (eRH) (i. e., seed moisture content). Storage at 10 °C, regardless of eRH, maintained seed dormancy and viability for one year. To optimize dormancy loss while maintaining seed viability, fresh seeds must be stored at either 12 % eRH (6 % seed moisture content, dry weight basis) at 30 °C for 12 months or at 50 % eRH (11 % seed moisture content, dry weight basis) at 30 °C for 9 months. As storage temperature was increased from 20 to 30 °C and storage relative humidity was increased from 50 to 75 % eRH (11 to 14 % seed moisture content, dry weight basis), loss in seed viability became more pronounced over time. The viability of pili grass seeds, relieved of dormancy, can be maintained for at least 6 months with storage at 12 % eRH (6 % seed moisture content, dry weight basis) and 5 °C. FGLS, pili grass smoke infused water and xylose smoke infused water were effective in stimulating germination of dormant pili grass seeds. FGLS and pili grass smoke infused water provided consistent germination stimulation in two batches of seed that represented two levels of dormancy relief. Xylose infused smoke water was less effective since its ability to stimulate germination was not consistent across the two seed batches. Assays which evaluated two bioactive compounds found in smoke (i. e., karrikinolide and cyanide) indicated that only cyanide stimulated germination (20 to 29 % germination) of dormant pili grass seeds. Cyanide stimulated germination suggests the role of reactive oxygen species in dormancy loss of pili grass seeds under warm, dry conditions. The presence of cyanide was confirmed in pili grass smoke, but not in FGLS or xylose smoke infused water. Germination observed in these non-cyanide containing smoke sources indicates the presence of other bioactive compounds in smoke. Germination assays conducted throughout this dissertation indicated differences in depth of dormancy with time of year harvest. March seeds exhibited the lowest levels of dormancy compared to seeds harvested in June, July and October. Seasonal dormancy in pili grass seeds can be attributed to differences in growing conditions during seed development. Finally, harvest timing studies identified ACGDU, spike moisture content and the onset of seed head tangling as useful harvest timing indicators for pili grass seed production. Results indicate that maximum seed harvests can be obtained between 768 to 778 ACGDUs (79 to 82 days after cutting) under irrigated conditions. Spike moisture for optimum seed harvest timing was determined to be between 0. 68 to 0. 72 grams H 2 O per gram of dry weight. The onset of seed head tangling provided a visual cue which coincided with the optimum seed yield and range of spike moisture content. A decline in seed production over four harvest cycles (spanning two years) was recorded with possible causal factors such as stand age, cutting height and thatch accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Degradation of {{vegetation}} and soil erosion {{has contributed to}} loss of biological productivity and land degradation in Iceland. This thesis focuses on spatial and temporal patterns of land degradation in Iceland from a geographical perspective both along short and long timescales. The activity of current degradational processes has been assessed by studying farmers' perception {{of the problem and}} comparing it with a spatial analysis of the distributional pattern of <b>severely</b> <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> in NE Iceland. Classification of Landsat TM satellite data and an analysis using a digital elevation model in a GIS showed that erosion patches and degraded vegetation had a greater relative distribution at higher elevations, and were more frequent on slopes with a N and NW aspect. These results are interpreted as indicative of the influence of climate on vegetation cover occurring in climatically marginal highland areas. The long-term temporal aspect of land degradation during the Holocene period was investigated using tephrachronological and stratigraphic approaches. Major degradation phases identified occurred c. 5000 BP, c. 2500 BP and from roughly AD 1500 - 1900 when degradation accelerated to a catastrophic scale. A spatial-temporal picture showing the Holocene vegetational marginal upland areas as highly fluctuating further emerged. So as to assess the long-term influence of climate on the spatial distribution of the vegetation cover, and thus indirectly on the susceptibility of the land to degradation, a temperature-driven dynamic model was developed. The model was used to determine and map the extent {{of vegetation}} and birch forest cover for the whole of Iceland throughout the course of the Holocene. Previous assumptions of an extensive forest cover {{at the time of the}} Norse settlement in the late 800 s were not supported by the model results. Modeling showed that the vegetation and forest cover was already in significant decline prior to the settlement. Anthropogenic influence presumably accelerated and increased a natural decline in vegetation cover and an associated erosion of soils in Iceland...|$|R

Within these plots, dominant species were ranked by cover in six structural classes along 105 line-intercept transects and species canopy cover and ground cover was estimated at 525 2 m x 2 m sub-plots in 2001 and 2002 to determine vegetation type composition and condition. Twenty–two vegetation types were delineated by cluster analysis and Indicator Species Analysis (ISA). Based on species composition and dominance, cluster analysis and Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling (NMS) wer...|$|R
