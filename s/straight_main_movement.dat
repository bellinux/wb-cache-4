The <b>main</b> <b>movement</b> of the numerical control system {{is driven by the}} traditional power, such as hand wheel or hydraulic power, the movement is detected by an grating detector, or other detect devices and the displacement of the <b>main</b> <b>movement</b> is input to a computer simultaneously. finally the computer drives the other axis to move immediately, according to the preset program or rule. In this way, the NC system, for example, NC machining tool, can realize any kind of complex and powerful cutting or manufacturing at higher maching speed than other machines. With the higher power and speed servomotor or servo system expansiving, this system will fulfill working task with higher productivity and lower cost...|$|R
