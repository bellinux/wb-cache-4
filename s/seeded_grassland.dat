40|$|Structure and {{composition}} of vegetation and abundance of breeding birds in grasslands seeded to Old World bluestem (Bothriochloa ischmaeum) were compared to native mixed prairie in the southern Great Plains of North America. Abundance of birds was determined using fixed-radius point counts. Detrended correspondence {{analysis was used to}} compare plant community composition and canonical correspondence analysis was used to examine the relationships between plant species composition and vegetation structure with the bird community. Plant species composition differed distinctly between <b>seeded</b> <b>grassland</b> and native mixed prairie, but the differences were not reflected in habitat structure, bird community composition, or abundance of bird species. <b>Seeded</b> <b>grassland</b> was inferior to native mixed prairie in terms of diversity of plant species, but that difference did not translate into meaningful differences in structure that drove habitat selection by breeding birds. Conservation programs that promote establishment of <b>seeded</b> <b>grassland</b> and do not allow for suitable disturbance regimes will selectively benefit a narrow suite of birds regardless of plant species composition...|$|E
40|$|Ecological theory {{predicts that}} the {{arrangement}} of seedlings in newly restored communities may influence future species diversity and composition. We test the prediction that smaller distances between neighboring seeds in drill <b>seeded</b> <b>grassland</b> plantings would result in lower species diversity, greater weed abundance, and larger conspecific patch sizes than otherwise similar broadcast seeded plantings. A diverse grassland seed mix was either drill seeded, which places seeds in equally spaced rows, or broadcast seeded, which spreads seeds across the ground surface, into 24 plots in each of three sites in 2005. In summer 2007, we measured species abundance in a 1 m 2 quadrat in each plot and mapped common species within the quadrat by recording the most abundant species in each of 64 cells. Quadrat-scale diversity and weed abundance were similar between drilled and broadcast plots, suggesting that processes that limited establishment and controlled invasion were not affected by such fine-scale seed distribution. However, native warm-season (C 4) grasses were more abundant and occurred in less compact patches in drilled plots. This difference in C 4 grass abundance and distribution may result from increased germination or vegetative propagation of C 4 grasses in drilled plots. Our findings suggest that local plant density may control fine-scale heterogeneity and species composition in restored grasslands, processes {{that need to be}} further investigated to determine whether seed distributions can be manipulated to increase diversity in restored grasslands...|$|E
30|$|While in Schlabendorf Nord {{afforestation}} {{was replaced}} by afforestation of pine trees and deciduous afforestation, in Schlabendorf Süd afforestation {{was replaced by}} only afforestation of pine trees (as forest land) and mixed grassland and trees. In Schlabendorf Süd, it was more common for forest to be lost to grassland, but in the Schlabendorf Nord this was less common. In Schlabendorf Süd, all the forest lands were lost to grassland, but in Schlabendorf Nord, only afforestation was lost to grassland, suggesting more reverse succession in Schlabendorf Süd (Figures  11 and 13). Until recently, in Schlabendorf, <b>seeded</b> <b>grassland</b> were used as primary colonizers to reclaim the mine-damaged land. On the other hand, reverse succession occurred in both landscapes. An interesting trend of reverse succession was the frequent change of dry vegetation/dry grassland/sparse pioneer grassland to open sand, open sand to wetland; and wetland to lake (Figures  11 and 12). Felinks (2000) described plant succession in a post-mining landscape as having stages of stochastic regression instead of web-like stages of succession. Reverse succession {{in this context is}} defined as change from a particular LCT after a period of vegetation growth back to the initial or a characteristically comparable LCT via natural or artificial processes. Another notable difference in LC distribution between Schlabendorf Nord and Schlabendorf Süd was that, while in the North there was no recorded transition between open sand and pioneer grassland, in the Süd this transition was clearly visible. This suggests that vegetation growth in the Nord was not from the primary level {{as was the case with}} the Süd.|$|E

It also evaluated how soil seed banks would contribute to forest regeneration or degeneration. Two soil seed bank types were identified in the study area: those of the forest and the grassland. In between these two, there was a narrow transitional zone, a forest-grassland ecotone, which contained large numbers of <b>seeds</b> of <b>grassland</b> species and <b>seeds</b> of some forest pioneer and agricultural weed species. These soil seed banks are highly heterogeneous, and clumping of seeds occured frequently.

40|$|ABSTRACT. — This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} the potential role of persistent soil seedbanks in restoring grassland and heathland communities in sites {{that have been}} afforested or are currently cultivated. To do so, we used the results of 16 case studies and {{an analysis of the}} database of Thompson et al. (1997). Generally, there is a decrease in total seed density with increasing age since abandonment or transformation. This decline is much faster for species of calcareous or alluvial grasslands than for heathland and grassheath species. During succession, seeds of target species disappear from the seedbank, owing to seed senescence. In many cases, the seed density of nontarget species increases with time. These species are often ruderal or competitive species, typical of arable land and other disturbed sites, with long-term persistent <b>seeds.</b> <b>Grassland</b> species have a low seed longevity index and low densities in the soil. Moreover, a few years after abandonment, almost all species have disappeared from the soil seedbank. Hence, restoration of species-rich grasslands cannot rely on the seedbank. Where the colonization by target species is hampered because of the isolation of the site, seed introduction is necessary. Heathland species, especially Calluna vulgaris, and grassheath species have a higher seed longevity index and can survive for a long period in the soil. However, the density of their seeds also declines with time and restoration of heathland on sites abandoned or forested for longer than 40 years is also seed limited. If the former heathland was converted to arable land, the decline of heathland species in the seedbank is much faster owing to ploughing. Moreover, high nutrient levels in the soil favour competition from nontarget species after germination. In that case, restoration of heathland or grassheath is expected to be problematic...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{variation}} in seed bank size and species composition of five selected habitat types within the Tembe Elephant Park. South Africa, was investigated. At three-month intervals, soil samples were randomly collected from five different habitat types: a, Licuati forest; b, Licuati thicket; c, a bare or sparsely vegetated zone surrounding the forest edge, {{referred to as}} the forest/grassland ecotone; d, grassland; and e, open woodland. Most species in the seed bank flora were either grasses, sedges, or forbs, with hardly any evidence of woody species. The Licuati forest and thicket soils produced the lowest seed densities in all seasons.   Licuati forest and <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> banks showed a two-fold seasonal {{variation in}} size, those of the Licuati thicket and woodland a three-fold variation in size, whereas the forest/grassland ecotone maintained a relatively large seed bank all year round.

40|$|Open savannas and wet grasslands {{are present}} {{under the same}} {{seasonal}} macro-climate in central Brazil. However, in open savannas, temperatures during fires are higher than in wet grasslands. Grasses dominate both ecosystems and exhibit large variation in seed dormancy. We hypothesise that seeds of grass species from open savannas are more tolerant to heating than those of wet grasslands. Also, assuming that dormant seeds remain longer in the soil than non-dormant seeds - thus being more likely to burn - we expect that dormant seeds are more tolerant to heating than non-dormant seeds. We tested the effects of heating at 80 and 110 °C for 2. 5 and 5. 0 min on the survival of seeds of 14 species, seven from each community, containing dormant and non-dormant species. Seeds of most species survived at 80 °C, but seeds from open savannas maintained greater survival for 5 min than <b>seeds</b> from wet <b>grasslands.</b> <b>Seeds</b> of most species died at 110 °C, but dormant seeds survived more than non-dormant seeds.

Because the response of these species was observed in the laboratory, their response in less controlled conditions, such as when sown in soil, is unknown.

40|$|ABSTRACT- This {{research}} {{aimed to}} determine the soil seed bank and its relationship with environmental factors that have an influence {{in the distribution of}} the vegetation above the ground in an excluded area of natural grassland in the South of Brazil. Most of the 122 identified species in the seed bank were perennials. Data analysis indicated three distinct community groups, according to the size and composition of the soil seed bank in lowlands with permanent wet soils, in lowlands and in other areas. In general, lowlands were characterized by low-fertility soils, high moisture and aluminum contents, being spatially homogeneous habitats and, therefore, more restricted to vegetation heterogeneity than other parts of the relief. Environmental factors most associated with soil seed bank size and composition were relief position and their co-related soil variables such as: soil moisture content, potassium content, organic matter, basic saturation of cation exchange soil capacity, exchangeable basics sum of the soil and clay soil content. According to that, relief position, associated with combined effects of soil chemical properties related to it, determines the observed variation pattern of the soil seed bank, as a reflection of the vegetation above the area.

40|$|AbstractEnvironmental {{conditions}} {{experienced by}} mother plants determine germination patterns. Here, we investigated the germination ecology of Miconia albicans (Melastomataceae), a widespread apomictic shrub, along a soil fertility gradient in the Brazilian Cerrado (a Neotropical savanna). The mosaic of vegetations in the Cerrado ranges from grasslands to woodlands, which present different conditions for seedling establishment. Cerrado grasslands are a more unpredictable environment {{because they are}} more prone to disturbances such as fires and prolonged droughts than closed woodlands. We expect lower reproductive investment but increasing germinability, germination speed and synchrony in areas with more dense vegetation, due to prolonged droughts in grasslands and higher soil properties in woodlands. Seeds of M. albicans were collected in grasslands, shrublands and woodlands for three years in a Cerrado area in southeastern Brazil. Seeds collected in all vegetations were set to germinate under identical experimental conditions. According to our prediction, we found a consistent pattern of increasing germinability, mean germination time and synchrony in areas with more closed vegetation. Both slower and asynchronous germination in <b>seeds</b> from <b>grassland</b> plants are likely to increase seedling survival under a more unpredictable environment. On the other hand, seeds from plants in the woodlands germinated at higher rates and germination was more synchronous, thus increases the chances of survival under a more competitive light-limited environment. This pattern was found in all three years of study. Our study suggests that stressful environmental conditions experienced by mother plants in the Cerrado may act as cues signalizing unfavourable conditions for seed germination and help explain functional divergence in germination traits within species.

The germination response to heat shock (80 °C – 5 min), smoke (60 min), the combination of both factors and no heat no smoke (control) was studied in six native species (two dominant grasses, two dominant shrubs and two annual fugitive herbs) of northwestern Patagonian <b>grasslands.</b> <b>Seeds</b> of the grasses Festuca pallescens and Stipa speciosa and the shrub Senecio bracteolatus (Asteraceae) germinated when they were exposed to heat shock, whereas seeds of the other shrub, Mulinum spinosum (Apiaceae), were killed by this fire cue. In grasses, probably the glume of caryopsis protected embryos from heat. Possibly, the seed size could explain the different responses of the two shrubs. Heat combined with smoke reduced seed germination for S. speciosa and S. bracteolatus. The heat could have scarified seeds and the longer exposure to smoke could have been toxic for embryos. The same treatment increased germination of the annual fugitive herb Boopis gracilis (Calyceraceae).

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} invasion resistance in plant communities, but few have explored the mechanisms of invasion and how subsequent community reassembly affects community functioning. Using natural dispersal and deliberate <b>seed</b> addition into <b>grassland</b> communities with different compositional and richness histories, we show that invaders establish in a nonrandom manner due to negative effects of resident functional groups on invading species from the same functional group. Invaders hence complement communities with originally low richness levels. Consequently, communities converge toward similar levels of species richness, high functional richness, and evenness, but not always maximum productivity. Invasion processes are faster but qualitatively similar when the effect of chance, {{in the form of}} dispersal stochasticity, is reduced by seed addition. Thus, dispersal limitation may influence community assembly, but it does not override functionally predictable assembly mechanisms. Some of the most productive communities prior to invasion are unstable in the face of invasion, leading to decreased productivity following invasion. We suggest that invasion into such communities occurs possibly because a pathogen-free niche is available rather than a resource niche. Thus, pathogens in addition to resource niches may be important biological drivers of community assembly...|$|R
40|$|Grazing mammals are {{regarded}} as major vectors in <b>seed</b> dispersal of <b>grassland</b> plants, through <b>seed</b> ingestion and subsequent excretion (endozoochory). The (evolutionary) ecology underlying this dispersal mode is relatively poorly understood because there are limited data, among others, on how seed attributes perform in this process (and could thus be selected for). For seed mortality following ingestion, contrasting patterns described {{for the role of}} simple seed traits seem partly due to inadequate comparative analytical methods. We conducted a feeding experiment in which controlled seed quantities from 48 grassland herb and grass species were fed to cattle. Seed mass, length and shape measurements were related to seed mortality rate using phylogenetically independent contrasts, which account for taxonomic interdependence. The proportion of seeds surviving the digestive tract was generally low, but it reached 100 %, with increased germination for some species. Neither seed size nor shape correlated significantly with mortality. Structural traits are likely to overrule these simple seed traits, as illustrated by high survival of species having water-impermeable seeds.

Two study areas were selected, one at Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory, a site near Buxton, and the other at Wardlow Hay-Cop, in Cressbrook Dale National Nature Reserve, both located in the Derbyshire, UK. This study is organized in the following four sections. I. Chapter 11 examines the impact of the long-term management and changes in precipitation on calcareous <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> banks. More than two decades of dereliction have had the largest effects followed by the effects of more than ten years of summer drought. Both changed species composition and, declined seed abundance.

More than one decade of N deposition caused shifts in species composition. decrease richness, seed density and. the abundance of functional groups. Moreover, seed bank populations were unable to recover after more than 4 years of ceasing N deposition. 4. Chapter IV explores the effects of soil pH on seed persistence. Seed density, grasses seed abundance the probability that Hypericum pulchrum seeds persist declined as soil pH increased. 5. Chapter V investigates {{the extent to which the}} intraspecific trait variation in the same community differs between the components of mature plant population and seed bank, arising from a possible trade-off between investment in seed banks and vegetative growth. Seed bank were not representative of mature plant population. Overall, larger individuals invested more in sexual reproduction than the smaller and, per unit of total biornass, seed- originating individuals invested more in vegetative than in reproductive traits. Therefore, there is no evidence of the potential trade-off between investment in seed banks (via seed production) and vegetative growth in the calcareous grassland species at Buxton. We concluded that the potential of seed banks to assist the restoration is lower in calcareous than acid grass lands. Moreover, the relevance of seed banks is lower in those affected by dereliction and summer drought and, in acid grass lands affected by N deposition the potential is very limited. In addition, the genetic diversity of calcareous grassland species cannot be recovered by using seed banks. Therefore, the recovery of seed banks and above-ground vegetation should be integrated together into restoration programmes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Phalaris arundinacea had the highest DM yield (12, 89 t/ha) in 2002. followed by Bromus inermis and Dactylis glomerata cultivars with 20 % lower DM yield than Phalaris arundinacea, and Lolium westerwoldicum and Phleum pratense cv. Bilbo which had 24 % lower DM yield, while both Lolium perenne cultivars had about 30 % lower DM yield in comparison with Phalaris arundinacea. Significant differences (P< 0. 05) were observed between cultivars for all the chemical parameters investigated except fort nitrogen free extract (NFE). The highest crude protein (CP) concentration was observed in Bromus inermis, Lolium multiflorum cv. Bofur, Dactylis glomerata cultivars, Phalaris arundinacea, Festuca pratensis, Lolium westerwoldicum, Phleum pratense cv. Bilbo (24, 78 % in average). Significantly the lowest crude fibre (CF) was determined in Lolium westerwoldicum (18, 07 %), Festuca pratensis, Lolium multiflorum and Phalaris arundinacea (19, 7 % in average). The highest ground cover and the lowest variations over the investigation period were determined for Lolium perenne cv. Pimpernel, both Phleum pratense cultivars and Dactylis glomerata cv. Amba and Okay...|$|R
40|$|The {{success or}} failure of many organisms to respond to the {{challenges}} of habitat destruction and a warming climate lies in the ability of plant species to disperse between isolated habitats or to migrate to new ranges. European semi-natural grasslands represent one of the world's most species-rich habitats at small scales, but agricultural intensification during the 20 th century has meant that many plant species are left only on small fragments of former habitat. It is important that these plants can disperse, both for the maintenance of existing populations, and for the colonisation of target species to restored grasslands. This thesis investigates the ecological, geographical and historical influences on seed dispersal and connectivity in semi-natural grasslands, and the mobility of plants through time and space. Seed dispersal by human activity has played a large role in the build-up of plant communities in rural landscapes, but patterns have shifted. Livestock are the most traditional, and probably the most capable seed dispersal vector in the landscape, but other dispersal methods may also be effective. Motor vehicles disperse seeds with similar traits to those dispersed by livestock, while 39 % of valuable grasslands in southern Sweden are connected by the road network. Humans are found to disperse around one-third of available grassland species, including several protected and red-listed species, indicating that humans may have been valuable seed dispersers in the past when rural populations were larger. Past activities can also affect seed mobility in time through the seed bank, as <b>seeds</b> of <b>grassland</b> plant species are shown to remain in the soil even after the grassland had been abandoned. Today however, low seed rain in intensively grazed semi-natural <b>grasslands</b> indicates that <b>seed</b> production may be a limiting factor in allowing seeds to be dispersed in space through the landscape. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Accepted. Paper 4 : In press. Paper 5 : Manuscript. </p...|$|R
40|$|Provision of an {{adequate}} mineral {{supply in the}} diets of ruminants fed mainly on grassland herbage can present a challenge if mineral concentrations are suboptimal for animal nutrition. Forage herbs may be included in <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> mixtures to improve herbage mineral content, although there is limited information about mineral concentrations in forage herbs. To determine whether herbs have greater macro- and micromineral concentrations than forage legumes and grasses, we conducted a 2 -year experiment on a loamy-sand site in Denmark sown with a multi-species mixture comprised of three functional groups (grasses, legumes and herbs). Herb species included chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), caraway (Carum carvi L.) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor L.). We also investigated the effect of slurry application on the macro- and micromineral concentration of grasses, legumes and herbs. In general, herbs had greater concentrations of the macrominerals P, Mg, K and S and the microminerals Zn and B than grasses and legumes. Slurry application indirectly decreased Ca, S, Cu and B concentrations of total herbage because {{of an increase in}} the proportion of mineral-poor grasses. Our study indicates that including herbs in forage mixtures is an effective way of increasing mineral concentrations in herbage...|$|R
40|$|From 2013 2015, {{the release}} and {{establishment}} of predatory mites {{for the control}} of two-spotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae, was conducted in five hop gardens of The species compared were the autochthonous mites Typhlodromus pyri, Amblyseius andersoni and a mix of the two allochthonous species Neoseiulus californicus and phytoseiulus persimilis. Main objective was {{the establishment of a}} permanent population of T. pyri in a hop garden by providing the predators with structures for their hibernation by undersown crops. We chose seeding of tall fescue Festuca arundinacea, a <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> mixture and strawberries as an intercrop in the wheel lanes. During the three project years, 15 trials were conducted of which however only two yielded meaningful results. We found that the cheapest and most effective way to release T. pyri in hops is the transfer of vine cuttings gathered during the pruning of vines in late winter. Besides, the mixture of P. persimilis and N. californicus proved to be very effective. During samplings of the undersown crop of tall fescue in spring, predatory mites were recorded in low numbers. This is evidence that tall fescue can serve as a hibernation quarter for predatory mites. More studies are however needed to give more detailed answers to this thematic constellation...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two main}} methods for {{estimating}} seed density and species composition of soil seed banks: manual seed extraction and seedling emergence. These methods {{were used to determine}} and compare seed density and species composition in the soil of a natural grassland in Patagonia. Additionally, known amounts of seeds of different sizes from Patagonian grassland species were mixed with soil to evaluate the efficiency of the seed extraction method, and determine their recovery percentage. Seed density found in the grassland soil with the extraction method was four times higher than that found with the seedling emergence method. Through the use of these two methods, there was very little overlap found in species composition. Small seeds (< 1 mm) were only found with the seedling emergence method, whereas the seeds of species with specific germination requirements were found with the seed extraction method. <b>Seed</b> recovery of <b>grassland</b> species varied from 2. 5 % for smaller seeds (Erophila verna) to 100 % for larger seeds (Rumex acetosella) with the seed extraction method. This method was more effective in detecting seeds of large-seeded species. Discrepancies in seed detection between both methods may be related to seed dormancy, specific germination requirements, seed size and mass. These two methods are necessary to describe seed density and seed bank composition...|$|R
40|$|Hong Kong is {{an extreme}} example of {{tropical}} landscape degradation, with no substantial remnants of the original forest cover and a highly impoverished disperser fauna. Seed availability is a potential limiting factor in vegetation recovery in such landscapes. To assess {{the quantity and quality}} of the seed rain of woody taxa, seed traps were placed in the major upland vegetation types: fire-maintained grassland, shrubland, and secondary forest. Within the grassland site, traps were placed under isolated trees, isolated male and female shrubs of Eurya chinensis, and in the open. Seeds were collected every 2 weeks for 2 years. The seed rain was highest under female shrubs in <b>grassland</b> (6455 <b>seeds</b> m - 2 year - 1), where it was almost entirely confined to their fruiting period. Next highest were isolated trees (890 seeds), followed by male isolated shrubs (611 seeds), shrubland (558 seeds), forest (129 <b>seeds)</b> and open <b>grassland</b> (47 <b>seeds).</b> The number of seed taxa was highest in shrubland (59), followed by isolated trees (42), forest (42), female isolated shrubs (28), male isolated shrubs (15), and open <b>grassland</b> (9). The <b>seed</b> rain differed in species composition between the forest, shrubland, and grassland sites, while the differences within the grassland site were largely in terms of quantity.
