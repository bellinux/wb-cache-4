5000|$|Snow {{crystals}} {{form when}} tiny supercooled cloud droplets (about 10 μm in diameter) freeze. Once a droplet has frozen, it {{grows in the}} supersaturated environment.

This process is known as the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapour causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.

40|$|Molecular {{processes}} {{on solid}} surfaces are of fundamental and technological importance. This work focuses on various reactive processes on a carbon (graphite(0001)) surface, {{and on the}} initial oxygen interaction with an aluminium (Al(111)) surface. In the former case, the interaction of pure K and H 2 O overlayers, and coadsorbed K+H 2 O overlayers have been addressed, while {{in the latter case}} the energy dependent dissociation probability of O 2 has been investigated. The methods employed in these studies include high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), work function mea-surements, and molecular beam techniques. At low cover-ages and low temperatures (T~ 83 K), potassium is found to adsorb in a two-dimensional overlayer that consists of mobile, ionic K adatoms. At higher coverages, K is forced to condense into 2 x 2 islands with metallic-like character at. THÄTA. # 126; 0. 3. The bind-ing energy is estimated to be between 1 - 1. 3 eV for the different K submonolayer phases. The data analysis is complicated by intercalation, even at low temperatures. Photon irradiation (hv> 3 eV) of the K/graphite(0001) system leads to desorption and intercalation of K atoms. The wavelength, photon power and polarization dependencies indicate a substrate mediated des-orption process. The coverage dependence of the photodesorption shows that only the ionic (but not the metallic) K adatoms are photoactive. A model has been developed, which explains the observed K photodes-orption quantitatively. The key ingredients include photoexcitation of electrons in the graphite bulk by a pi. -pi. * interband transition. The primary photoexcited electrons are elastically or weakly inelastically scattered to-wards the surface and attach to the K 4 s-derived resonance, which results in a neutralization of the K ions. The neutral K atoms are thereby repelled from the surface and may, during the excited state motion escape from the surface as neutrals, before they decay back to the ionic ground state. Recaptured K atoms may intercalate before the excitation energy is dissipated. Water adsorbs as low coordinated, two-dimensional clusters on graphite at low temperatures and low cov-erages, but transforms into three-dimensional structures by mild annealing. The bind-ing energy of the H 2 O molecules is 0. 45 eV per molecule, close to the sublimation energy of ice. Coadsorption of H 2 O and K on graphite(0001) at low temperatures (T~ 83 K) and low K coverages leads to disruption of the two-dimensional H 2 O clusters, and to formation of hydrated-ion like complexes. Water dissociates at a K cov-erage threshold at. THÄTA. # 126; 0. 3, which corresponds to the critical coverage for K condensation to a metallic phase on the bare graphite surface. At elevated temperatures, H 2 O and K react to yield KH, KOH, and K-O com-plexes on the sur-face. H 2 and H 2 O is released into vacuum, and successively more oxygen-rich surface complexes are formed, as identified by HREELS. The graphite surface itself gasifies at T? 750 K, to yield carbon dioxide. The initial steps of aluminium oxidation has been studied in a newly constructed molecular beam apparatus. The O 2 sticking on Al(111) is found to be an activated event, which does not depend on the surface tem-perature. By preparing O 2 molecules with high translational energy, or in vibrationally excited states, an enhanced sticking is ob-served. The sticking coefficient shows a maximum at an incident angle of # 126; 25 degree;. The results are in-terpreted as a direct <b>sticking</b> <b>mechanism</b> (no precursor), which depends sensitively on molecule-surface impact parameters and surface corrugation...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of solid {{particles in the}} solar nebula (or other circumstellar disk) is described. Motions of bodies less than about 1 km in size were dominated by gas drag rather than gravity. An original population of microscopic grains had to produce greater than km-sized planetesimals before gravitational accretion of planets could begin. Planetesimals probably formed by coagulation of grain aggregates that collided due to differential settling, turbulence, and drag-induced orbital decay. Growth of such aggregates depended on <b>sticking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and their mechanical properties, which are poorly understood. Their growth was aided by concentration of larger bodies toward the central plane of the disk. The nebula could remain optically thick during this process. It is unlikely that a particle layer formed by settling would undergo gravitational instability, as {{a small amount of}} turbulence would keep the particle layer from reaching the critical density.

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} noise regulations concerning automotive vehicles {{particularly in}} Europe are forcing Tyre manufacturers {{as well as}} the automotive manufacturers to reduce radiated noise. With the future moving towards electric/hybrid vehicles, the ever present tyre noise will become more dominant. Even in the case of automotive engines running on fossil fuels, tyre noise dominates above speeds of 40 Km/h. Understanding the causes of tyre noise is the first step towards finding engineering solutions to reduce it. Numerical modelling can help the tyre engineer in understanding the causes of tyre-road noise with a design tool. In the present work, the noise radiated by the tyre surface is computed numerically using three different computational techniques. Both the time domain approach and the frequency domain approaches are used and the results are compared. The input structural vibrations are computed in ABAQUS (Ref. 1) and the results are then imported to LMSVirtual. Lab (Ref. 2) for further acoustic computations. As the main focus of this work is on the acoustic computations, only {{a brief description of the}} process involved in the structural vibration calculations is provided. In the present work, the “Horn effect” is inherently captured in the acoustic simulations. Two model tyres, viz., with tread pattern and with circumferential grooves is evaluated. The presence of tread leads to the phenomenon of stick slip and <b>stick</b> snap <b>mechanisms</b> contributing to the overall tyre noise. In addition, the motion of air through the grooves causes air pumping noise. It is to be noted that the structural vibration computations were performed on a rotating tyre that translated on a stationary road. In other words, the tyre underwent rotational as well as translational displacement. The acoustic computations are however performed on a stationary tyre model. One of the challenges addressed in the present work is the conversion of transient vibration results on a stationary acoustic mesh. The surface accelerations, required as boundary conditions, are converted to the frequency domain by the Fast Fourier Transformation for the Harmonic computations.

40|$|The adsorption, {{reaction}} and decomposition {{of a series}} of molecules (oxygen, ethene, acetic acid, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate) associated with vinyl acetate synthesis were investigated using a combination of ultra-high vacuum surface science techniques, including molecular beam sticking and temperature programmed desorption. The catalysts were annealed single crystal Pd (110) surfaces and bimetallic Au/Pd (110) surfaces prepared by metal vapour deposition and annealing. All the molecules investigated adsorbed well to Pd (110) with a high <b>sticking</b> probability, and <b>mechanisms</b> for the reactions of each with the surface were suggested. The carbonaceous organic molecules all decomposed to deposit carbon at the surface at room temperature and above, blocking active sites to adsorption. Above a specific temperature, this carbon went subsurface and no longer inhibited subsequent adsorption of molecules. A residual carbon layer was often characterised by low energy electron diffraction and spectroscopy techniques, the exact structure varied with incident molecule type. The deposited carbon could often be removed in a facile manner by oxygen treatment. In the case of acetic acid, an acetate species was formed at room temperature and decomposed at higher temperatures with autocatalytic decomposition kinetics. Vinyl acetate reacted in a similar way to acetaldehyde under most conditions investigated, suggesting vinyl acetate decomposes primarily via a cleavage that produces acetyl groups under these conditions. An exceptional case occurred at 300 - 323 K at high coverages, where the formation of a template structure on the surface may stabilise acetate formation from vinyl-acetate cleavage. On Au/Pd (110) surfaces after annealing, the Au was determined to be partly subsurface in most cases. The uptake and sticking probability of each molecule were reduced often in a manner approximately proportional to Au content, in broad agreement with structural data on Au/Pd(110) published elsewhere...|$|R

All of them applied Beta-carotene lotion daily, morning and evening to the affected areas. Twenty six of them, completed regular 8 weeks treatment. Nine of them continued same treatment for 16 more weeks. All cases were evaluated clinically using melasma intensity (MPI) index (Grade I, II, III) {{and size of the}} lesion. Clinical photograph was taken for each case at 0 week, 8 th week and 24 th week. Initial 8 weeks treatment revealed that the single case with grade-I pigmentation included in this study recovered completely. Two out of 13 cases with grade-II pigmentation, showed no change, in 10 cases, pigmentation became lighter to grade-I (76. 9 &#x 0025;) and one case recovered completely. Out of 12 grade-III cases, one did not show any change, 10 (83. 3 &#x 0025;) converted to grade-II and one to grade-I. At the end of 24 weeks, all the nine cases (2 grade-II and 7 grade-III) showed further clearing of the pigmentation to the next lower grade. Side effects like mild erythemo and local irritation were observed in two cases each, who were advised to discontinue treatment as per the protocol.

40|$|Defence date: 20 November 2012 First made {{available}} on 21 October 2015. Examining Board: Professor Sven Steinmo (EUI Supervisor); Professor Stefano Bartolini (EUI); Professor Mark Blyth (Brown University); Professor Wolfgang Streeck (Max Planck Institute). This thesis investigates {{the influence of}} political Catholicism and Catholic social doctrine {{on the evolution of}} the continental European welfare regimes. Paradoxically it finds that the doctrine had less influence on the formation of welfare regimes in countries where Catholicism was strong in contrast to countries where it was in a weak minority position. This finding does not only challenge many of the accounts that have perceived and analyzed religious influences on welfare state formation as a static and quantifiable variable but also addresses and rivals most postulations of mainstream welfare state theories such as Logic of Industrialism, Power Resource, Class Coalition and Employer Centered Approaches. In contrast to these postulations this thesis finds that welfare in continental Europe evolved during the 19 th century and most of the 20 th century {{as the result of a}} battle over ideas and worldviews between different societal groups and their political outlets. Which idea and worldview makes its way into institutional implementation is not primarily connected to the mere numerical strength or power resources of its societal and political representation but is a function of the performance of the programmatic ideas themselves. Decisive is how they strive in competition with other programmatic ideas. Two <b>mechanisms</b> <b>stick</b> out that determine whether programmatic ideas are successful: the performance and evolution of the idea in a process of ideational competition and the degree of ideational compatibility of a programmatic idea other ideas that enables the formation of ideational and political coalitions. The programmatic ideas and hence the worldview that performs these two tasks best wins its way into institutional implementation. Though, ideational competition, evolution and implementation is not solely endogenous to the battle of ideas but structured through a variety of exogenous factors such as the institutional (election system, mode of governance, degree of enfranchisement) and structural-material environment (pace of industrialization, spatial diffusion of economic development, number of ideational competitors). The thesis will show against the backdrop of the Italian and German welfare state development, from the end of the 19 h century to the present, that these battles of ideas and worldviews were a major driver in how continental European political economies were structured during the 20 th century...|$|R
40|$|The devastation {{caused by}} Hurricane Ike in the Galveston Bay area (Texas, United States of America) proved the {{necessity}} of an improved water defense. Multiple flood risk reduction studies were undertaken. The Texas A&M University of Galveston proposed the Ike Dike, a fortification of the coastal spine to prevent a storm surge from entering the Galveston Bay. It includes construction of a storm surge barrier at the Bolivar Roads inlet (3 km) consisting of a navigational section to close of the Houston Ship Channel and a wide shallow environmental section. For the environmental section a preliminary design was made by De Vries (2014). For the navigational section (span of 220 m) the project group (IV-infra, DUT and Royal HaskoningDHV) concluded that a barge gate with a length of 240 m, width of 40 m and height of 20 m seems a suitable solution. The barge is stored parallel to the channel and connected to the shore by a hinge. Approximately 30 hours before landfall of a hurricane, the barge is set afloat and swings 90 degrees around a hinge to two concrete abutments and is immersed. The barge will now act as a simple supported beam and a 1 m high gap is present below the barge. Once the hurricane has passed the barge is set afloat {{and returned to the}} storage area. A structural design with static loads has been developed by IV-infra. The dynamic behavior and response to wave and current excitation is not included in this structural design, which is essential information to determine the technical feasibility of this design. This dynamic behavior is investigated in this report. To do so the following phases of a complete closing cycle are distinguished which are assessed separately: Swing operation, immersion operation, landing, closed position and occurrence of a negative head (a bayside water level exceeding the seaside water level). Next to these phases it is assessed if a concrete or steel barge is preferable. First a wave study was completed to determine the governing closing wave conditions and hurricane wave conditions. Swing operation: The barge is closed in one hour with anchor lines connected to the abutment and storage area. During the swing operation the roll motion is governing. But can be reduced by introducing ballast water in the outer compartments of the barge or a different configuration of the anchor lines. Immersion operation and landing: The barge is immersed with pumps and valves in one hour. During the immersion operation the <b>stick</b> slip <b>mechanism</b> will occur but the duration will be limited and will not result in problems. For increasing drafts the heave, sway and roll response will increase slightly but stay within acceptable limits. Closed position: The overall motion of the simple supported barge will consist of a combined torsion, vertical bending and horizontal bending motion. Due to the high underflow velocity the barge is prone to self-excitation in vertical, horizontal and torsion direction. The impact is expected to be limited due to outflow of water in the longitudinal direction and the influence of turbulence but substantial research is required into this topic. The first natural frequency in vertical bending is close to the peak of the wave spectrum. The bayside water level may exceed the seaside water level, a stop block is required to ensure the barge does not slide off the abutment. A concrete barge has been compared to a steel barge. For a first estimate the dynamic response of a concrete barge is slightly better. For future research it is recommended assess the self-excitation in closed position with a scale model.

Apesar de medusas de Rhizostomeae, causarem os mais intensos blooms recentemente reportados, quase nada se conhece sobre seu papel ecológico. O objetivo desta tese foi descrever as bases morfológicas e funcionais da alimentação de Lychnorhiza lucerna Haeckel, 1880 (Rhizostomeae), para se compreender seu papel predatório e suas interações tróficas. O projeto investigou (i) o desenvolvimento inicial de medusas de L. lucerna, com foco nos mecanismos locomotor-alimentar (ii) a dieta, seletividade alimentar e os potenciais impactos predatórios da espécie e (iii) a estrutura trófica de um sistema estuarino conservado, para compreender o papel ecológico e relações tróficas entre organismos gelatinosos e peixes. A abordagem metodológica envolveu: i- métodos videográficos em alta velocidade, para a quantificação de parâmetros biomecânicos em animais de diferentes estágios de desenvolvimento; ii- coletas de animais e plâncton na superfície da água para a quantificação de conteúdos estomacais no estudo de dieta, seletividade e taxas alimentares ao longo do litoral do estado São Paulo e Paraná; e iii- a análise de isótopos estáveis (δ 13 C e δ 15 N) de tecidos de consumidores (mesozooplâncton, gelatinoso, outros invertebrados e peixes) do estuário de Cananéia, São Paulo. A ontogenia inicial de éfiras de L. lucerna envolve mudanças na umbrela e o desenvolvimento dos braços orais filtradores.

In adults bell pulsations produce vortices that induce flows through oral arms, which retain particles by <b>sticking</b> and sieving <b>mechanisms.</b> Rhizostomeae jellyfish {{have the most}} robust bell pulsations among scyphomedusae, but maximum velocities of the vortices (∼ 10 cm s- 1) of L. lucerna (< 70 mm) are still 3 to 5 times slower than escape velocity of calanoid copepods. Although this difference may suggest success for copepods to escape, both video sequences, and gut contents revealed that these prey can be captured and eaten at similar proportions as their field density. Copepods may fail to detect the predator, being transported against prey capture structures, even if they perform velocities that usually allow escaping. The interaction of prey with vortices is complex and prey may jump at angles that result in captures by oral arms. Through the analysis of gut contents (N= 40) 43 taxa were found composing the diet of L. lucerna, of which, copepods comprised ∼ 80...|$|R
