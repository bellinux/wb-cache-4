40|$|This chapter {{will focus}} on G protein-coupled {{receptor}} structure-based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> and ligand design. A generic <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> workflow and its individual elements will be introduced, covering amongst others the use of experimental data to steer the <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> process, ligand binding mode prediction, <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> for novel ligands, and rational structure-based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> hit optimization. An overview of recent successful structure-based ligand discovery and design studies shows that receptor models, despite structural inaccuracies, can be efficiently used to find novel ligands for GPCRs. Moreover, the recently solved GPCR crystal structures have further increased the opportunities in structure-based ligand discovery for this pharmaceutically important protein family.

50|$|The aim of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is to {{identify}} molecules of novel chemical structure that bind to the macromolecular target of interest. Thus, success of a <b>virtual</b> <b>screen</b> is {{defined in terms of}} finding interesting new scaffolds rather than the total number of hits. Interpretations of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> accuracy should therefore be considered with caution. Low hit rates of interesting scaffolds are clearly preferable over high hit rates of already known scaffolds.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{describes}} {{a computer program}} named Dockres {{that is designed to}} analyze and summarize results of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> of small molecules. The program is supplemented with utilities that support the screening process. Foremost among these utilities are scripts that run the <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> of a chemical library on a large number of processors in parallel.

At the same time, ensemble methods are nowadays frequently used to overcome the limitations of employing a single model in ligand-based drug design. However, many applications of ensemble methods to this area do not consider important aspects related to both <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> and the modeling process. During the application of ensemble methods to <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> the proper validation of the models in <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> conditions is often neglected.

Most commonly these papers compare a number of docking tools for their performance in cognate re-docking (pose prediction) and/or <b>virtual</b> <b>screening.</b> Related papers have been published on ligand-based tools: pose prediction by conformer generators and <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> {{using a variety of}} ligand-based approaches. The reliability of these comparisons is critically affected by a number of factors usually ignored by the authors, including bias in the datasets used in <b>virtual</b> <b>screening,</b> the metrics used to assess performance in <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> and pose prediction and errors in crystal structures used...|$|R
40|$|Pressure is {{mounting}} on {{the pharmaceutical industry}} to reduce both the cost of drugs and the time to market. The large number of targets made available {{in the last decade}} has created a new area for technologies that can rapidly identify quality lead candidates. <b>Virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is one such technology that is gaining increasing importance in the drug discovery process. <b>Virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is a reliable and inexpensive method currently being employed as a complementary approach to high-throughput <b>screening.</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>screening</b> can be adopted irrespective of the structural information of the target receptor. In the absence of structural data, <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> using pharmacophore-based search is a major in silico tool. However, when the structure of the receptor is available, <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> using both pharmacophore-based and docking techniques can be employed. Both of these methods can be synergistically integrated to improve the drug design and development process. In this article, we provide an overview of methods for <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> - in particular, docking and pharmacophore-based - along with commercial algorithms implementing these methods, and a successful example in this arena. Further, we enumerate the potential for patenting such kind of studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{screening}} of chemical libraries {{is an important}} step in the drug discovery process. The existing chemical libraries contain up to millions of compounds. As the screening at such scale is expensive, the <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is often utilized. There exist several variants of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> and ligand- based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is one of them. It utilizes the similarity of screened chemical compounds to known compounds. Besides the employed similarity measure, another aspect greatly influencing the performance of ligand-based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is the chosen chemical compound representation. In this thesis, we introduce a fragment-based representation of chemical compounds. Our representation utilizes fragments to represent a compound. Each fragment is represented by its physicochemical descriptors. The representation is highly parameterizable, especially in the area of physicochemical descriptors selection and application. In order to test the performance of our method, we utilized an existing framework for <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> benchmarking. The results show that our method is comparable to the best existing approaches and on some datasets it outperforms them...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{the present}} work, {{we aim to}} {{transfer}} {{to the field of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> the predictiveness curve, a metric that has been advocated in clinical epidemiology. The literature describes the use of predictiveness curves to evaluate the performances of biological markers to formulate diagnoses, prognoses and assess disease risks, assess the fit of risk models, and estimate the clinical utility of a model when applied to a population. Similarly, we use logis‑ tic regression models to calculate activity probabilities related to the scores that the compounds obtained in <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> experiments. The predictiveness curve can provide an intuitive and graphical tool to compare the predic‑ tive power of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> methods. Results: Similarly to ROC curves, predictiveness curves are functions of the distribution of the scores and provide a common scale for the evaluation of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> methods. Contrarily to ROC curves, the dispersion of the scores is well described by predictiveness curves. This property allows the quantification of the predictive performance of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> methods on a fraction of a given molecular dataset and makes the predictiveness curve an efficient tool to address the early recognition problem. To this last end, we introduce the use of the total gain and partial total gain to quantify recognition and early recognition of active compounds attributed to the variations of the scores obtained with <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> methods. Additionally to its usefulness in the evaluation of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> methods...|$|R
40|$|Ligand docking is {{a widely}} used {{approach}} in <b>virtual</b> <b>screening.</b> In recent years {{a large number of}} publications have appeared in which docking tools are compared and evaluated for their effectiveness in <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> against a wide variety of protein targets. These {{studies have shown that the}} effectiveness of docking in <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is highly variable due to a large number of possible confounding factors. Another class of method that has shown promise in <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is the shape-based, ligand-centric approach. Several direct comparisons of docking with the shape-based tool ROCS have been conducted using data sets from some of these recent docking publications. The results show that a shape-based, ligand-centric approach is more consistent than, and often superior to, the protein-centric approach taken by docking...|$|R

From the simplest techniques, as the similarity search or molecular docking, to more complex strategies, including statistical methods and machine learning, the main goal of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> {{is to improve the}} searching for molecules with the desired features required for becoming drug candidates, thus accelerating the continuous process of drug design.

In this investigation, a hybrid protocol of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> methods, comprising of pharmacophore model-based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> (PB-VS) and docking-based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> (DB-VS), is used for retrieving new FAK inhibitors from commercially available chemical databases. This hybrid <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> approach was then applied to screen several chemical databases, including the Specs (202, 408 compounds) database.

40|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is {{a central}} {{technique}} in drug discovery today. Millions of molecules can be tested in silico with the aim to only select the most promising and test them experimentally. The topic of this thesis is ligand-based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> tools which take existing active molecules as starting point for finding new drug candidates. One goal of this thesis was to build a model that gives the probability that two molecules are biologically similar as function {{of one or more}} chemical similarity scores. Another important goal was to evaluate how well different ligand-based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> tools are able to distinguish active molecules from inactives. One more criterion set for the <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> tools was their applicability in scaffold-hopping, i. e. finding new active chemotypes. In {{the first part of the}} work, a link was defined between the abstract chemical similarity score given by a screening tool and the probability that the two molecules are biologically similar. These results help to decide objectively which <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> hits to test experimentally. The work also resulted in a new type of data fusion method when using two or more tools. In the second part, five ligand-based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> tools were evaluated and their performance was found to be generally poor. Three reasons for this were proposed: false negatives in the benchmark sets, active molecules that do not share the binding mode, and activity cliffs. In the third part of the study, a novel visualization and quantification method is presented for evaluation of the scaffold-hopping ability of <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> tools...|$|R
40|$|The key {{motivation}} {{for the study of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is to reduce the time and cost requirement of the drug discovery process. <b>Virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is a computational method for finding an efficient drug molecule from pool of potential candidates. There are two different methods for <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> 1) structure based 2) ligand based. In the structure based method, 2 D or 3 D structure of a target molecule is used to screen the ligands which do not bind to the target molecule. Ligand based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is {{based on the fact that}} ligands similar to an active drug molecule might be active. The amount of information required is different in both the case. Structure based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is computationally intensive and complex while a few active ligand information is enough to start ligand based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening.</b> Based on the type of information, ligand based <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> can be performed in different ways. The machine learning approach using molecular graphs has been found to be very effective. Graph kernel is the similarity measure used to screen molecular graphs based on the structure. It is based on the fact that structurally similar molecules will have same property. In this review we have summarized the recent development in graph kernel for chemical molecule and elaborated upon the need of more accurate and efficient graph kernel with less computational complexity. The accuracy of different methods have been compared using standard dataset. The review shows the current state of art in the ongoing research in the design of efficient walk kernels...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Virtual</b> <b>screening</b> {{of small}} {{molecules}} using molecular docking {{has become an}} important tool in drug discovery. However, large scale <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> is time demanding and usually requires dedicated computer clusters. There {{are a number of}} software tools that perform <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> using AutoDock 4 but they require access to dedicated Linux computer clusters. Also no software is available for performing <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> with Vina using computer clusters. In this paper we present MOLA, an easy-to-use graphical user interface tool that automates parallel <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> using AutoDock 4 and/or Vina in bootable non-dedicated computer clusters. Implementation MOLA automates several tasks including: ligand preparation, parallel AutoDock 4 /Vina jobs distribution and result analysis. When the <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> project finishes, an open-office spreadsheet file opens with the ligands ranked by binding energy and distance to the active site. All results files can automatically be recorded on an USB-flash drive or on the hard-disk drive using VirtualBox. MOLA works inside a customized Live CD GNU/Linux operating system, developed by us, that bypass the original operating system installed on the computers used in the cluster. This operating system boots from a CD on the master node and then clusters other computers as slave nodes via ethernet connections. Conclusion MOLA is an ideal <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> tool for non-experienced users, with a limited number of multi-platform heterogeneous computers available and no access to dedicated Linux computer clusters. When a <b>virtual</b> <b>screening</b> project finishes, the computers can just be restarted to their original operating system. The originality of MOLA lies on the fact that, any platform-independent computer available can he added to the cluster, without ever using the computer hard-disk drive and without interfering with the installed operating system. With a cluster of 10 processors, and a potential maximum speed-up of 10 x, the parallel algorithm of MOLA performed with a speed-up of 8, 64 × using AutoDock 4 and 8, 60 × using Vina. </p...|$|R
