40|$|Electronic noses combine {{an array}} of cross-selective gas sensors with a pattern {{recognition}} engine to identify odors. Pattern recognition of multivariate gas sensor response is usually performed using existing statistical and chemometric techniques. An alternative solution involves developing novel algorithms inspired by information processing in the biological olfactory system. The objective of this dissertation {{is to develop a}} neuromorphic architecture for pattern recognition for a chemosensor array inspired by key signal processing mechanisms in the olfactory system. Our approach can be summarized as follows. First, a high-dimensional odor signal is generated from a chemical sensor array. Three approaches have been proposed to generate this combinatorial and high dimensional odor signal: temperature-modulation of a metal-oxide chemoresistor, a large population of optical microbead sensors, and infrared spectroscopy. The resulting high-dimensional odor signals are subject to dimensionality reduction using a self-organizing model of chemotopic convergence. This convergence transforms the initial combinatorial high-dimensional code into an organized spatial pattern (i. e., an odor image), which decouples odor identity from intensity. Two lateral inhibitory circuits subsequently process the highly overlapping odor images obtained after convergence. The first <b>shunting</b> lateral <b>inhibition</b> circuits perform gain control enabling identification of the odorant across a wide range of concentration. This <b>shunting</b> lateral <b>inhibition</b> is followed by an additive lateral inhibition circuit with center-surround connections. These circuits improve contrast between odor images leading to more sparse and orthogonal patterns than the one available at the input. The sharpened odor image is stored in a neurodynamic model of a cortex. Finally, anti-Hebbian/ Hebbian inhibitory feedback from the cortical circuits to the contrast enhancement circuits performs mixture segmentation and weaker odor/background suppression, respectively. We validate the models using experimental datasets and show our results are consistent with recent neurobiological findings...|$|R

To examine mechanisms used to integrate sensory signals elicited by both external stimuli and motor activity, we trained rats to perform an active search task with a single vibrissa. We recorded neuronal activity in primary somatosensory cortex, along with vibrissa position and touch signals, as rats rhythmically swept their vibrissa {{in search of a}} target. A majority of neurons respond to touch and, critically, ̃ 20 % are transiently excited only when contact occurs at a cell- specific phase in the whisk cycle. This response arises from a nonlinear interaction, consistent with gating by <b>shunting</b> synaptic <b>inhibition,</b> between vibrissa touch and a motion-derived signal that dynamically labels each neuron with a preferred phase.

50|$|In ionotropic GABAA receptors, binding of GABA {{molecules}} {{to their}} binding {{sites in the}} extracellular part of the receptor triggers opening of a chloride ion-selective pore. The increased chloride conductance drives the membrane potential towards the reversal potential of the Cl¯ ion which is about -65 mV in neurons, inhibiting the firing of new action potentials.

In this state, the gate is closed.

40|$|Homeostatic {{regulation}} {{in the brain}} {{is thought to be}} achieved through a control of the synaptic strength by close interactions between excitation and inhibition in cortical circuits. We recorded in a layer 5 pyramidal neuron of rat cortex the composite response to an electrical stimulation of various layers (2 - 3, 4 or 6). Decomposition of the global conductance change in its excitatory and inhibitory components permits a direct measurement of excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance. Whatever the stimulated layer was, afferent inputs led to a conductance change consisting of 20 % excitation and 80 % inhibition. Changing synaptic strengths in cortical networks by using a high-frequency of stimulation (HFS) protocol or a low-frequency of stimulation (LFS) protocol (classically used to induce long-term potentiation or long-term depression at the synaptic level) were checked in order to disrupt this balance. Application of HFS protocols in layers 2 - 3, 4 or 6, or of LFS protocols in layer 4 induced, respectively, long-term paralleled increases or long-term paralleled decreases in E and I which did not change the E-I balance. LFS protocols in layers 2 - 3 or 6 decreased E but not I and disrupted the balance.

40|$|Alkene monooxygenase (AMO) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous (formerly Nocardia corallina) B- 276 {{belongs to}} a family of {{multicomponent}} nonheme binuclear iron-centre oxygenases that includes the soluble methane monooxygenases (sMMOs) found in some methane-oxidizing bacteria. The enzymes catalyse the insertion of oxygen into organic substrates (mostly hydrocarbons) {{at the expense of}} O- 2 and NAD(P) H. AMO is remarkable in its ability to oxidize low molecular-mass alkenes to their corresponding epoxides with high enantiomeric excess. sMMO and other well-characterized homologues of AMO exhibit two adventitious activities: (1) turnover-dependent inhibition by alkynes and (2) activation by hydrogen peroxide in lieu of oxygen and NAD(P) H (the peroxide shunt reaction). Previous studies of the AMO had failed to detect these activities and opened the possibility that the mechanism of AMO might be fundamentally different from that of its homologues. Thanks to improvements in the protocols for cultivation of R. rhodochrous B- 276 and purification and assay of AMO, it has been possible to detect and characterize turnover-dependent inhibition of AMO by propyne and ethyne and activation of the enzyme by hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate a similar mechanism to that found in sMMO and also, unexpectedly, that the enantiomeric excess of the chiral epoxypropane product is significantly reduced during the peroxide <b>shunt</b> reaction. <b>Inhibition</b> of the oxygen/NADH-activated reaction, but not the peroxide shunt, by covalent modification of positively charged groups revealed an additional similarity to sMMO and may indicate very similar patterns of intersubunit interactions and/or electron transfer in both enzyme complexes...|$|R

Their work showed that spatial summation of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials caused attenuation of the excitatory response during the inhibitory response most of the time. They also noted a temporary augmentation of the excitatory response occurring after the attenuation. As a control they tested for attenuation when voltage-sensitive channels were activated by a hyperpolarization current. They concluded that attenuation is not caused by hyperpolarization but by an opening of synaptic receptor channels causing conductance variations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Shunting</b> <b>inhibition,</b> {{also known}} as {{divisive}} inhibition, {{is a form of}} postsynaptic potential inhibition that can be represented mathematically as reducing the excitatory potential by division, rather than linear subtraction. This form of inhibition is termed [...] "shunting" [...] because of the synaptic conductance short-circuit currents that are generated at adjacent excitatory synapses. If a shunting inhibitory synapse is activated, the input resistance is reduced locally and, following Ohm's law, the amplitude of subsequent excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is reduced. This simple scenario arises if the inhibitory synaptic reversal potential is identical to the resting potential.|$|E
5000|$|GABAA receptors are ligand-activated {{chloride}} channels: when {{activated by}} GABA, they allow {{the flow of}} chloride ions across the membrane of the cell. Whether this chloride flow is depolarizing (makes the voltage across the cell's membrane less negative), shunting (has {{no effect on the}} cell's membrane potential), or inhibitory/hyperpolarizing (makes the cell's membrane more negative) depends on the direction of the flow of chloride. When net chloride flows out of the cell, GABA is depolarising; when chloride flows into the cell, GABA is inhibitory or hyperpolarizing. When the net flow of chloride is close to zero, the action of GABA is shunting. <b>Shunting</b> <b>inhibition</b> has no direct effect on the membrane potential of the cell; however, it reduces the effect of any coincident synaptic input by reducing the electrical resistance of the cell's membrane. <b>Shunting</b> <b>inhibition</b> can [...] "override" [...] the excitatory effect of depolarising GABA, resulting in overall inhibition even if the membrane potential becomes less negative. It was thought that a developmental switch in the molecular machinery controlling concentration of chloride inside the cell changes the functional role of GABA between neonatal and adult stages. As the brain develops into adulthood, GABA's role changes from excitatory to inhibitory. However, this theory of excitatory GABA in the developing brain has been questioned and subsequent studies in live neonatal rodents have directly shown GABA to be inhibitory in its action (see next section).|$|E
40|$|How {{does the}} visual cortex learn {{invariant}} object categories {{as an observer}} scans a depthful scene? Two neural processes that contribute to this ability are modeled in this thesis. The first model clarifies how an object is represented in depth. Cortical area V 1 computes absolute disparity, which is the horizontal difference in retinal location of an image in {{the left and right}} foveas. Many cells in cortical area V 2 compute relative disparity, which is the difference in absolute disparity of two visible features. Relative, but not absolute, disparity is unaffected by the distance of visual stimuli from an observer, and by vergence eye movements. A laminar cortical model of V 2 that includes <b>shunting</b> lateral <b>inhibition</b> of disparity-sensitive layer 4 cells causes a peak shift in cell responses that transforms absolute disparity from V 1 into relative disparity in V 2. The second model simulates how the brain maintains stable percepts of a 3 D scene during binocular movements. The visual cortex initiates the formation of a 3 D boundary and surface representation by binocularly fusing corresponding features from the left and right retinotopic images. However, after each saccadic eye movement, every scenic feature projects to a different combination of retinal positions than before the saccade. Yet the 3 D representation, resulting from the prior fusion, is stable through the post-saccadic re-fusion. One key to stability is predictive remapping: the system anticipates the new retinal positions of features entailed by eye movements by using gain fields that are updated by eye movement commands. The 3 D ARTSCAN model developed here simulates how perceptual, attentional, and cognitive interactions across different brain regions within the What and Where visual processing streams interact to coordinate predictive remapping, stable 3 D boundary and surface perception, spatial attention, and the learning of object categories that are invariant to changes in an object's retinal projections. Such invariant learning helps the system to avoid treating each new view of the same object as a distinct object to be learned. The thesis hereby shows how a process that enables invariant object category learning can be extended to also enable stable 3 D scene perception...|$|R

The work presented in this thesis evaluates the role of ANF in rats with chronic moderate high-output heart failure by (1) characterizing plasma and tissue ANF levels, hemodynamics and renal function at different stages of the development of heart failure; (2) assessing the contribution of the atria and ventricles to plasma ANF levels; and (3) investigating the role of ANF and renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) in rats with aorto-caval (A-C) shunts. Chronically increased cardiac filling pressure stimulated not only ANF release but also ANF synthesis in each cardiac chamber. This in turn contributed to elevated plasma ANF levels in A-C shunt rats. An attenuated renal response to endogenous ANF and sodium and water retention were apparent in A-C <b>shunt</b> rats. Under <b>inhibition</b> of RAS, plasma ANF may exert its actions more effectively. Thus, chronic ACE inhibition and ANG II receptor antagonism improved hemodynamic conditions, diminished water retention, reversed cardiac hypertrophy, and restored plasma and tissue ANF to more "normal" levels in rats with moderate high-output heart failure. Taken together, elevated plasma ANF levels may {{play an important role in}} maintaining hemodynamic and body fluid homeostasis by opposing the neurohormonal vasoconstrictor systems in A-C shunt rats. However, a relative deficiency of plasma ANF and/or an attenuated response to endogenous ANF, mediated by activated neurohormonal vasoconstrictor systems, may contribute to the pathophysiology and development of heart failure at different stages.

40|$|Background Kynurenine 3 -monooxygenase (KMO) {{converts}} kynurenine to 3 -hydroxykynurenine, and its <b>inhibition</b> <b>shunts</b> the {{kynurenine pathway}} - which is implicated as dysfunctional in various psychiatric disorders - towards enhanced synthesis of kynurenic acid (KYNA), an antagonist of both α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine and NMDA receptors. Possibly {{as a result}} of reduced KMO activity, elevated central nervous system levels of KYNA have been found in patients with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ). Methods In the present study, we investigated adaptive – and possibly regulatory – changes in mice with a targeted deletion of Kmo (Kmo-/-) and characterized the KMO-deficient mice using six behavioral assays relevant for the study of SZ. Results Genome-wide differential gene expression analyses in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of these mice identified a network of SZ- and psychosis-related genes, with more pronounced alterations in cerebellar tissue. KYNA levels were also increased in these brain regions in Kmo-/-mice, with significantly higher levels in the cerebellum than in the cerebrum. Kmo-/-mice exhibited impairments in contextual memory and spent less time than controls interacting with an unfamiliar mouse in a social interaction paradigm. The mutant animals displayed increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and in a light-dark box. After a D-amphetamine challenge (5 mg/kg, i. p.), Kmo-/- mice showed potentiated horizontal activity in the open field paradigm. Conclusions Taken together, these results demonstrate that the elimination of Kmo in mice is associated with multiple gene and functional alterations that appear to duplicate aspects of the psychopathology of several neuropsychiatric disorders.

When expressed in nerve cells, anion-conducting channelrhodopsins act as light-gated chloride channels. Their effect on the activity of the neuron is comparable to GABAA receptors, ligand-gated chloride channels found in inhibitory synapses: As the chloride concentration in mature neurons is very low, illumination results in an inward flux of negatively charged ions, clamping the neuron at the chloride reversal potential (- 65 mV). Under these conditions, excitatory synaptic inputs are not able to efficiently depolarize the neuron. This effect is known as <b>shunting</b> <b>inhibition</b> (as opposed to inhibition by hyperpolarization).

Averaged over several interspike in-tervals, the spiking mechanism effectively clamps the somatic membrane potential to a value significantly above the resting potential, so that the current through the shunting conductance is approximately independent of the firing rate. This leads to a subtractive rather than a divisive effect. In addition, at distal synapses, <b>shunting</b> <b>inhibition</b> will also have an ap-proximately subtractive effect if the excitatory conductance is not small compared to the inhibitory conductance.

Synaptic rise time promotes synchrony by delaying the effect of inhibition, providing an opportune period for interneurons to spike together. <b>Shunting</b> <b>inhibition,</b> through its voltage dependence, inhibits interneurons that spike out of phase more strongly (delaying the spike further), pushing them into phase (in the next cycle). We characterize the interneuron, which consists of soma (cell body) and synapse circuits, fabricated in a 0. 25 -µ...|$|E
40|$|Newly {{generated}} young neurons in {{the adult}} hippocampus receive GABAergic synaptic inputs, which are crucial for activity-dependent survival and functional maturation between 1 - 3 weeks after mitosis. We found synaptically driven action potential (AP) firing in these newborn young cells in adult mice. Although glutamatergic synaptic inputs remained subthreshold, activation of GABAergic synaptic inputs depolarized young neurons and reliably evoked APs. Furthermore, pairing of subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials or somatic current injection with brief bursts of GABAergic inputs revealed efficient GABAergic excitation at conductances of ∼ 1. 5 nS, corresponding to the activity of {{only three or four}} interneurons. Stronger GABAergic inputs (> 4 nS) effectively blocked AP firing via <b>shunting</b> <b>inhibition,</b> which might be important to dynamically control spiking output in both directions. Taken together, GABAergic interneurons differentially recruit newborn young granule cells by supporting either AP generation or <b>shunting</b> <b>inhibition</b> dependent on hippocampal network activity...|$|E
