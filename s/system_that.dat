40|$|Abstract. Classical formalizations {{of systems}} and {{properties}} are bool-ean: given a {{system and a}} property, the property is either true or false of the system. The classical view partitions the world into “correct ” and “incorrect ” systems, offering few nuances. In reality, of several <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> satisfy a property in the boolean sense, often some are more desir-able than others, and of the many <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> violate a property, usually some are less objectionable than others. For instance, among the <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> satisfy the response property that every request be granted, we may prefer <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> grant requests quickly (the quicker, the better), or we may prefer <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> issue few unnecessary grants (the fewer, the better); and among the <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> violate the response property, we may prefer <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> serve many initial requests (the more, the bet-ter), or we may prefer <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> serve many requests {{in the long run}} (the greater the fraction of served to unserved requests, the better). Formally, while a boolean notion of correctness is given by a preorder on systems and properties, a quantitative notion of correctness is defined by a distance function on systems and properties, where the distance be-tween a system and a property provides a measure of “fit ” or “desirabil-ity. ” In this article, we explore several ways how the simulation preorder can be generalized to a distance function. This is done by equipping the classical simulation game between a system and a property with quan-titative objectives. In particular, for <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> satisfy a property, a quantitative simulation game can measure the “robustness ” of the sat-isfaction: how much can the system deviate from its nominal behavior while still satisfying the property? For <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> violate a property, a quantitative simulation game can measure the “seriousness ” of the vi-olation: how much does the property have to be modified so that it is satisfied by the system?...|$|R

Introduction In this paper we consider controller synthesis for <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> are distributed spatially and potentially time varying. Our general motivation is to develop tools for dealing with physical <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> are inherently distributed, as well as the increasing number of <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> are distributed because they are comprised of distributed interacting subsystems. The specific motivation for this paper is to develop synthesis methods which can be applied to <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> are spatially varying.
