40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to create {{opportunities}} for an efficient interchange of information between humans and technology, especially for the skilled user, and put the designprincipal for informative <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> features into practice. Informative <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> features in {{a large number of}} information items helps the peripheral visual system to automatically capture knowledge through logical patterns. A field experiment was done to evaluate if informative <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> features, implicate efficient human information-processing, even in a small study. The results was ambiguous because the quantitative part of the investigation didn’t show any significant differences, whereas the qualitative showed that people prefer a dynamic document {{with a high degree of}} informative <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> features over a dynamic document with a low degree of informative <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> features. Even if this study was inconsistent, probably because to few subjects where used, the implication of the research that’s behind it is solid. The field of application of informative <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> features are the design of user interfaces fit for skilled users...|$|R
