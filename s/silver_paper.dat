25|$|The law of {{treasure}} trove in the United States varies {{from state to}} state, but certain general conclusions may be drawn. To be {{treasure trove}}, an object must be of gold or <b>silver.</b> <b>Paper</b> money is also deemed to be treasure trove since it previously represented gold or silver. On the same reasoning, it might be imagined that coins and tokens in metals other than gold or silver are also included, but this {{has yet to be}} clearly established. The object must be concealed for long enough so {{it is unlikely that the}} true owner will reappear to claim it. The consensus appears to be that the object must be at least a few decades old.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} staff encountered {{difficulties in}} realising a {{scene at the}} start of the film depicting an international teleconference being conducted using high-resolution viewing monitors. Due to both the limited use of colour TV at the time of production, and the need to avoid black-and-white so as to honour the futuristic setting of Doppelgänger, it was decided to position the actors playing the conference delegates behind the set and cut the [...] "screens" [...] out of the set wall. <b>Silver</b> <b>paper</b> was added to reflect the studio lighting, producing a realistic impression of a high-resolution image. Altered eyelines strengthen the audience's perception that each delegate is facing a camera rather than the other actors in the scene, and are in different locations around the world. Archer and Hearn promote the teleconference scene as an example of how Anderson [...] "proved once again that his productions were ahead of their time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1918 {{watercolor}} painting Einst dem Grau der Nacht enttaucht, a compositional implemented poem, possible {{written by}} Klee, he incorporated letters in small, {{in terms of}} color separated squares, cutting off the first verse from the second one with <b>silver</b> <b>paper.</b> At {{the top of the}} cardboard, which carries the picture, the verses are inscribed in manuscript form. Here, Klee did not lean on Delaunay's colors, but on Marc's, although the picture content of both painters does not correspond with each other. Herwarth Walden, Klee's art dealer, saw in them a [...] "Wachablösung" [...] (changing of the guard) of his art. Since 1919 he often used oil colors, with which he combined watercolors and colored pencil. The Villa R (Kunstmuseum Basel) from 1919 unites visible realities such as sun, moon, mountains, trees and architectures, as well as surreal pledges and sentiment readings.|$|E

In order to grow graphene with flat surface and low resistance, variety of paper (PC print paper, PC photo <b>paper,</b> drawing <b>paper,</b> <b>silver</b> halide print <b>paper)</b> and lead pencil (graded by hardness, blackness and fineness) combinations were investigated. The Raman peaks, related to graphene G and D bands, were clearly observed on <b>silver</b> halide <b>paper</b> and 10 B lead pencil combination in both states, before and after femtosecond laser irradiation. Furthermore, among the all combinations the multi-graphene grown by combination of <b>silver</b> halide print <b>paper</b> and 10 B lead pencil performed relatively flat surface with 1 μm thickness and low resistance after femtosecond laser irradiation...|$|R

I had the control panel in front of me, it's old hat now but we were the first to do it. There were pieces of rubber with <b>silver</b> <b>paper</b> on the back with a silver coil that moved up and down inside a magnet that produced a signal, so it was touch sensitive. I had 5 snares across the top and then ten tom-toms and then a whole octave of bass drums underneath my feet and then four lots of 16 sequencers, two on each side. There was a gap — to play a space — a tambourine, ebony stick, snare and three tom-toms. This was pre-chip days, back then you did it all with transistors. So it had something like 500 transistors. The electronic drums inside looked something like spaghetti. When it worked it was superb, but it was before its day, because it was so sensitive..." ...|$|E

All of the 95 prints on view, whether they are on commercially prepared <b>silver</b> <b>papers</b> or more exotic, handmade emulsions, can be justly described as beautiful. At the same time, however, the exhibition gives evidence of a serious bifurcation in Tice's work, of which neither he nor his substantial following seems aware. There are, it would seem, two photographers at work here: one, a skeptical documenter of the urban environment; the other, a romantic and oftentimes sugary pictorialist.|$|R
