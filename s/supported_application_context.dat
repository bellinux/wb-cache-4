When multiple Clive processes share a single address space, a process exit must close automatically its input and output channels (to let others know).

40|$|Abstract. Middleware {{support is}} a major topic in {{pervasive}} computing. Existing studies mainly address the issues {{in the organization of}} and the collaboration amongst devices and services, but pay little attention to the design support of context-aware pervasive applications. Most of these applications are required to be adaptable to dynamic environments and self-managed. However, most context-aware pervasive applications nowadays have to carry out tedious tasks of gathering, classifying and processing messy context information due to lack of the necessary middleware support. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach based on ontology technology, and apply it in our Cabot project. Our approach defines a context ontology catered for the pervasive computing environment. The ontology acts as the context information agreement amongst all computing components to <b>support</b> <b>applications</b> with flexible <b>context</b> gathering and classifying capabilities. This allows a domain ontology database to be constructed for storing the semantics relationship of concepts used in the pervasive computing environment. The ontology database <b>supports</b> <b>applications</b> with rich <b>context</b> processing capabilities. With the aid of ontology technology, Cabot further helps alleviate the impact of the naming problem, and support advanced user space switching. A case study is given to show how Cabot assists developers in designing context-aware pervasive applications. ...|$|R

Contexts, the pieces of information that capture the characteristics of environments, are often error-prone and inconsistent due to noises. Various strategies have been proposed to enable automatic context inconsistency resolution. They are formulated on different assumptions that may not hold in practice. This causes applications to be less context-aware to different extents. In this paper, we investigate such impacts and propose our new resolution strategy. We conducted experiments to compare our work with major existing strategies. The results showed that our strategy is both effective in resolving context inconsistencies and promising in its <b>support</b> of <b>applications</b> using <b>contexts...</b>|$|R

In particular, the handwriting identification area, which also includes the handwritten signature verification, is a topic continuously investigated since the freehand writing of a manuscript, {{as well as the}} appending of a personal signature on a paper document, are still the most widespread ways to certify documents in legal, financial and administrative fields. The rapid diffusion of devices that enable user interaction by means of freehand or capacity pen based writing, and the growing successes obtained in processing the digital handwriting, are allowing us to extend more and more the boundaries of this fascinating area. The automatic handwriting identification is an engaging matter that <b>supports</b> several <b>application</b> <b>contexts</b> including the personal identification. In this paper we present a novel on-line handwriting identification algorithm based on the computation of the static and dynamic features of the strokes composing an handwritten text.

40|$|Context {{awareness}} {{is a necessary}} feature for mobile collocated collaborative learning. In this paper we describe how requirements for contextaware cooperative learning activities are derived from the jigsaw technique augmented {{with the use of}} mobile devices, <b>applications</b> to <b>support</b> the activities of groups, and tools to provide context-awareness to detect group formation. The emergence of groups is detected based on the location of the students within the classroom, but this information has to be careful filtered to evaluate the degree of uncertainty and protect from erroneous estimations. A three-phase strategy to manage uncertainty by identifying possible sources of uncertainty, representing uncertain information, and determining how to proceed under the presence of uncertainty is used for this propose. These requirements are validated and confirmed in experiments with students working together in the classroom, measuring neutral or positive effects on learning and the usefulness of introducing mobile devices, group <b>support</b> <b>applications,</b> and <b>context</b> awareness. The ratio of unwanted interruptions to users made by the system is used to evaluate the utility of the system. Results show that by managing uncertainty, location estimation becomes more reliable, thus increasing the usefulness of the learning application. Postprint (published version...|$|R

As the access to and analysis of information is becoming increasingly important anywhere and at any time, researchers have begun to investigate the role of interactive displays as data analysis platforms.

We contribute a systematic and quantitative assessment of the literature from 10 different venues, an open repository of papers, and a code-set that can be used to categorize the research space.
