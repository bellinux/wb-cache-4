40|$|This {{study is}} a {{preliminary}} investigation towards the design of effective colour spaces and colour tools to allow users to quickly and accurately select a given colour in a digital-display environment. It {{has been shown that}} many non-expert users find the RGB colour space to be non-intuitive. The choice of colour space on various visual tasks has also been shown to be an important factor and that experts show greater precision in colour-matching experiments than non-expert observers. We propose that non-experts find manipulation and selection in an RGB colour space to be difficult because they do not possess an appropriate internal model for additive colour mixing. On the other hand, observers from a young age may develop a useful internal model of <b>subtractive</b> <b>colour</b> mixing processes as they experiment with inks and paints. The purpose of this work is to determine whether it is indeed the case that observers possess more useful internal models for <b>subtractive</b> <b>colour</b> mixing than for additive colour mixing. The work reported in this study describes only an assessment of <b>subtractive</b> <b>colour</b> mixing. Three experiments are described whereby expert and naïve observers select matches from a library of colours for individual samples or for imagined subtractive mixtures of paint samples. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are presented to measure the ability of observers to make predictions of subtractive mixing processes. When mixing the subtractive primaries (e. g. cyan with magenta) the performance of expert and naïve observers are the same but in general the expert performance far exceeds that of the naïve observer for other colours...|$|R

The piece explores the move from the 4 : 3 screen ratio to 16 : 9, which is now effectively the standard for broadcast television and video. In the construction of New Ratio each colour was assigned a particular tone: white was attributed a standard 1 KHz test tone; the pitch of the tone attributed to blue was half that of the test tone; and each of the colours in between (in descending order of luminance) were attributed tones at intervals between these values. The video comprises two simple repeating sequences, which are fundamentally the same duration. However, one sequence includes an additional frame of black that throws them out of synch causing a phasing that effects different mixtures of colour and a range of tone combinations. In commenting on this piece Sean Cubitt has suggested that the equal mixture of additive and <b>subtractive</b> <b>colours</b> is effectively a 'democratisation of colour'...|$|R
5000|$|The {{brothers}} {{stated that}} [...] "the cinema is an invention without any future" [...] and declined {{to sell their}} camera to other filmmakers such as Georges Méliès. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, {{their role in the}} history of film was exceedingly brief. In parallel with their cinema work they experimented with colour photography. They worked on a number of colour photographic processes in the 1890s including the Lippmann process (interference heliochromy) and their own 'bichromated glue' process, a <b>subtractive</b> <b>colour</b> process, examples of which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. This last process was commercialised by the Lumieres but commercial success had to wait for their next colour process. In 1903 they patented a colour photographic process, the Autochrome Lumière, which was launched on the market in 1907. Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following merger with Ilford. They also invented the colour plate, which really got photography on the road.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} new smart {{pigments}} {{with a strong}} colour change in a given temperature (T) range {{turns out to be}} often very time-consuming and costly. Based on this observation, we propose here a cheap solution consisting in the mixing in appropriate amounts of a semiconductor and a d-d transition based pigment. The former exhibits a strong temperature dependence of its optical gap while the second presents a null or moderate evolution of the positioning of its absorption band with T. This results in the generation of various reversible thermochromic effects with control of both the temperaturetransition and the hue in the low and high temperature stages. An example will be devoted to the reproduction of the Al 2 −xCrxO 3 corundum behaviour in the 20 - 200 °C domain with a Bi 2 O 3 -LiCoPO 4 blend. The proposed recipe, easily extrapolated {{to a wide range of}} colour changes, is only based on the well known <b>subtractive</b> <b>colouring</b> model, and the evolution of the chromatic coefficients of each ingredient with T.

Lee undertakes to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to show that Albers' system of perceptual education is fundamentally misleading (Albers 'places practice before theory'). Four topics in Albers' account of colour are examined critically: additive and <b>subtractive</b> <b>colour</b> mixture, the tonal relations of colours, the Weber-Fechner Law and simultaneous contrast. In each case Albers is shown to have made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his general claims about colour and his pedagogical method. It is suggested that Albers' belief {{in the importance of}} colour deception is related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). It is suggested that the scientific colour hypothesis of Edwin H. Land should be considered in lieu of the concepts held by Albers. Finally, there are implications for a reassessment of Albers' artworks that might follow a loss of faith in his colour concepts that seem to have been their foundation.|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} the {{importance}} of colour as a design, marketing and sales tool for industry is outlined {{to substantiate the need}} for a strong knowledge of colour and the need to work confidently and proficiently with colour. The chapter is designed in a manner that promotes knowledge development and inspiration, and for the more proactive reader a rich experience of colour can be gained by working through the chapter activities, initially at a computer and later with pigments (paints, dyes), which is highly encouraged and recommended. This workshop approach enables you to experiment with colour mixing and colour schemes to better appreciate colour and its application, without which the theories become just a concept; there really is little substitute for experimentation. A short history of colour is given that focuses on the building of the scientific underpinning of the most predominant theories of colour used today in relation to textile-based products (fashion). Insight is also given into colour psychology in relation to creating colour-ways, colour ranges and colour themes and to colour forecasting. Colour terminology is given and discussed throughout the chapter and the following fundamental theories and colour characteristics are also discussed: •	The principles of additive <b>colour</b> mixing and <b>subtractive</b> <b>colour</b> mixing •	The six-hue colour wheel and the twelve-hue colour wheel •	Colour schemes and colour combinations •	Metamerism •	Colour deficiency (colour blindness) •	Colour measuremen...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Studies {{have been carried out}} investigating the photochemical and photophysical properties of pyrazolotriazole azomethine dyes. Such compounds can be used as magenta images in the <b>subtractive</b> <b>colour</b> photographic process. This work has been carried out both in dilute fluid solution and in high concentration, high viscosity systems designed to mimic the photographic product. Picosecond pump-probe laser flash photolysis studies have provided the first observation of photoinduced transient absorption changes attributable to the excited states of this class of dyes, and have allowed assignment of the excited singlet state lifetime as being in the range 1 to 3 ps at room temperature, with little dependence upon solvent properties or the pattern of substituents on the dye skeleton. Using picosecond laser flash photolysis it has also been possible to observe evolution of the population along the ground state potential surface to the two isomeric forms, the rate of this process showing some solvent dependence. Nanosecond and picosecond laser flash photolysis studies have been used to investigate the process of syn-anti and anti-syn isomerisation about the azomethine linkage. The syn-anti photoisomerisation occurs on picosecond timescales, the anti isomer so produced relaxing thermally back to the syn form on timescales ranging from microseconds to milliseconds. The rate constant for this process is a complex function of solvent properties as well as being dependent upon steric factors within the molecule, and the reasons for this are discussed. Triplet energy sensitisation studies have demonstrated that a pathway exists for this isomerisation process via the triplet manifold, and has allowed determination of minimum isomerisation quantum yields from the triplet state. Such studies have also allowed estimation of limits for the molar decadic absorption coefficients of the anti isomer. The photographic product dyes have been demonstrated to be efficient quenchers of singlet molecular oxygen, the quenching mechanism being predominantly physical in nature. The quantum yields of singlet oxygen production are too small to be measured using time resolved techniques. These factors are used to explain in part the resistance of such compounds to oxidative photodegradation. Steady state irradiation of azomethine dyes in systems designed to simulate the photographic product by a high intensity source of known spectral profile has allowed determination of the quantum yields of photodegradation, which in combination with the results obtained in fluid solution provide a basis for explaining the behaviour of image dyes in the photographic product environment...|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} this study have shed light on key aspects of the artists’ {{painting}} technique as reflected in the close ‘stratigraphic’ relation of the two paintings. Preliminary observations suggest that the existence of the almost completed portrait on the canvas affected the execution of the Ecce Homo composition. Details of the underlying work seem to have influenced what was painted over it. An instructive example of the relation between underpainting and overpainting can be observed in the Ecce Homo painting area of the tied hands of Christ, which was painted over the face of the underlying composition. Future art historical analysis of the work will provide a better and more detailed understanding of the relation of the two paintings. A particularly interesting aspect of this relation will be the study of the ways the pigment scheme of the underlying portrait was used or simply influenced the <b>colouring</b> <b>synthesis</b> of the Ecce Homo. From an art historical point of view, the systematic comparison of the painterly composition and colouring schemes of the two paintings promises exciting results related to the history, dating, technique and attribution of the works. As mentioned above, the elemental analysis of the two paintings has provided results showing that the pigments used are compatible with those used by artists in the period of Titian’s artistic activity in the 16 th century. In addition, the further study of the work will offer {{a better understanding of the}} process of the reuse of canvases in Renaissance workshops, which was seemingly common practice. Hence, the comparative study of the two paintings has great potential for art historical analysis and will be pursued as the next step of our study.|$|R

In modern weaving, great convenience and efficiencies were established in both production and design process through digitalisation, while the colour adoption has been constrained as the applicable number of figuring yarns were limited. The enhancement toward colour realisation is traditionally related to weaving capability. Surface colour display is dominated by additive, subtractive or optical mixing (Mathur, 2007). An additive colour system offers the largest gamut among output models yet, the light mixing principle is not suitable to apply to weave colour creation. Pre-dyed opaque yarns are used and juxtaposed; small particles of yarn colours reflect lights and they were observed as a certain form of colour. The common and crucial criterial pertinent to an optical mixing of weave colours were aligned more with the subtractive mixing principle. A weave pattern was designed by <b>subtractive</b> primary <b>colour</b> classification and a multi-weft figuring method. Secondary colours are theoretically produced when coupled CMY layers are mixed(i. e., cyan + magenta = blue, cyan + yellow = green, magenta + yellow = red) and black is generated when all CMY primaries are mixed (Berns, 2000);however, non-bendable colours of threads are employed for colour reproduction in weaving {{and there is a}} limit to adopt a pigment mixing principle in the woven form. Therefore, each weave pattern required a modification to redefine primary colour regions and densities once an original artwork was separated and presented in greyscales levels. The weave patterns in an original subtractive scheme were altered by applying region-based segmentation to maximise the accessible colour gamut. In this study, the weaving application developed for the multi-coloured image was introduced and the design process was explained based on a practical experiment proceeded with a newly developed weaving application...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{contemporary}} method of continuous tone colour printing {{based upon the}} Nineteenth Century printing process of Woodburytype as developed by Walter Bentley Woodbury in 1865. Woodburytype was the only truly continuous tone printing process yet invented, and died out {{in the late nineteenth}} century as more expedient and cost effective methods of printing prevailed, thus laying the path for current CMYK print technologies. Digital print itself, since its development as a range of colour printing technologies, has followed a route based on the half-tone dot and four colour separation predicated around CMYK. In recent years stochastic algorithms and dithering have allowed the lay down of multiple passes and colour sets to create a near continuous tone image. The downside of this approach is that in order to create a full <b>colour</b> <b>subtractive</b> image, the resultant prints have very little surface topography and a mechanical uniformity that demonstrates none of the surface characteristics, tactile qualities and rich tonal warmth of the 19 th century photo-mechanical processes.

It presents {{part of an ongoing}} work, the aim of which is to formulate a spatially based colour knowledge. Our scientific approach is holistic and mainly directed towards colour and light phenomena as such, not towards underlying physiological processes. Earlier research has discussed lightness perception in colours very near neutral grey, with so low chromaticness that you can ignore the hue. In our research we have found that surfaces with nominally chromatic colours under special circumstances can be perceived as white and thus serve as anchors for perception of other colours in the field of vision. We also discuss how distinctions are made between perceived colours caused by on the light colour and such caused by the surface qualities. What we call adaptation is not limited to basic perception. Experience of colour in space is both perceptive and cognitive, as part of interaction between the individual and the world on many levels.  SYN-TES: Human <b>colour</b> and light <b>synthesis.</b> Towards a coherent field of knowledge.

Design is the art of using knowledge – implicit or explicit – about how humans perceive, experience, and relate to the world around. In design all senses are involved, but when dealing with colour and light we can confine ourselves to vision; designers must understand the conditions of visual perception. Human experience of colour and light has many sources; the given cultural context (conventional meanings of colour and light), the direct experience of the world around (colour and light expressions) and the basic perceptual functions (formal aspects of colour and light).

Analysing almost the complete coding region of the Oryctolagus cuniculus MC 1 R gene, we recently identified two mutations associated with red (recessive allele e of the Extension locus) or black (ED or ES, dominant black or steel, weaker version of ED) coat colours in different European rabbit breeds. Here we completed the sequence of the 953 bp coding region of the MC 1 R gene in O. cuniculus excluding the presence of additional common disrupting or functional mutations. Agouti locus encodes for the agouti signalling protein (ASIP). In European rabbit, classical studies have suggested the presence of three alleles at the Agouti locus: A (wild type allele), at (black and tan) and a (non-agouti). We sequenced the O. cuniculus ASIP exon 2 region and identified three mutations. Two were synonymous substitutions and one was an insertion of 1 bp. This insertion causes a frameshift of the translatio...|$|R
