5|$|However, {{others argue}} that the Sun is {{currently}} close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's <b>spiral</b> <b>arms.</b> <b>Spiral</b> <b>arms</b> are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect {{their potential for}} habitability. <b>Spiral</b> <b>arms,</b> for example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.|$|E

5|$|Later {{studies with}} the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope showed how Andromeda Galaxy's spiral {{structure}} in the infrared appears to be composed of two <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> that emerge from a central bar and continue beyond the large ring mentioned above.

5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined <b>spiral</b> <b>arms.</b> The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E
5|$|Galaxies have {{magnetic}} fields of their own. They {{are strong enough}} to be dynamically important: they drive mass inflow into the centers of galaxies, they modify the formation of <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> and they can affect the rotation of gas in the outer regions of galaxies. Magnetic fields provide the transport of angular momentum required for the collapse of gas clouds and hence the formation of new stars.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} a location in the galaxy as {{being a part of}} the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for. These include the distribution of stars and <b>spiral</b> <b>arms,</b> {{the presence or absence of}} an active galactic nucleus, the frequency of nearby supernovae that can threaten the existence of life, the metallicity of that location, and other factors. Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies, {{like the}} Milky Way, produce new generations of stars {{as long as}} they have dense {{molecular}} clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their <b>spiral</b> <b>arms.</b> Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation will come to an end.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System's {{location}} in the Milky Way {{is a factor in}} the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Its orbit is close to circular, and orbits near the Sun are at roughly the same speed as that of the <b>spiral</b> <b>arms.</b> Therefore, the Sun passes through arms only rarely. Because <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae, gravitational instabilities, and radiation that could disrupt the Solar System, this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to evolve. The Solar System also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre. Near the centre, gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the Oort cloud and send many comets into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on Earth. The intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life. Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.|$|E
40|$|N-body {{simulations}} {{conducted for}} kinematic analysis of stellar disk component -high number of disk particles, small time step and few parsecs spatial resolution - reveal two different behaviors for the <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> angular velocity. Whereas subdominant disk cases present transient <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> features corotating with particles, Milky Way like galaxies with higher disk/halo ratio develop {{a bar and}} transient spiral compatible with a pattern speed constant in radius. Both cases significantly depart from the TWA steady <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> density wave theory. Such results may have potential {{to be applied to}} arqueological studies of the Milky Way disks and high implication to the secular evolution of galaxies...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{relationship}} between <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> pitch angle (a measure of the tightness of spiral structure) and the mass of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the nuclei of disk galaxies. We argue that this relationship is expected {{through a combination of}} other relationships, whose existence has already been demonstrated. The recent discovery of AGN in bulgeless disk galaxies suggests that halo concentration or virial mass {{may be one of the}} determining factors in BH mass. Taken together with the result that mass concentration seems to determine <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> pitch angle, one would expect a relation to exist between <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> pitch angle and supermassive BH mass in disk galaxies, and we find that this is indeed the case. We conclude that this relationship may be important for estimating evolution in BH masses in disk galaxies out to intermediate redshifts, since regular <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> structure can be seen in galaxies out to z ≃ 1...|$|R
40|$|We have {{observed}} {{a snapshot of}} our N-body/Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulation of a Milky Way-sized barred spiral galaxy {{in a similar way}} to how we can observe the Milky Way. The simulated galaxy shows a co-rotating <b>spiral</b> <b>arm,</b> i. e. the <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> rotates with the same speed as the circular speed. We observed the rotation and radial velocities of the gas and stars {{as a function of the}} distance from our assumed location of the observer at the three lines of sight on the disc plane, (l, b) = (90, 0), (120, 0) and (150, 0) deg. We find that the stars tend to rotate slower (faster) behind (at the front of) the <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> and move outward (inward), because of the radial migration. However, because of their epicycle motion, we see a variation of rotation and radial velocities around the <b>spiral</b> <b>arm.</b> On the other hand, the cold gas component shows a clearer trend of rotating slower (faster) and moving outward (inward) behind (at the front of) the <b>spiral</b> <b>arm,</b> because of the radial migration. We have compared the results with the velocity of the maser sources from Reid et al. (2014), and find that the observational data show a similar trend in the rotation velocity around the expected position of the <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> at l = 120 deg. We also compared the distribution of the radial velocity from the local standard of the rest, V_LSR, with the APOGEE data at l = 90 deg as an example.

5|$|The {{cluster is}} slowly {{moving in the}} {{direction}} of the feet of what is currently the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds and the <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> of our galaxy also hastening its demise.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common {{during the early}} epoch, {{and the majority of}} galaxies were peculiar in morphology. Given the distances between the stars, the great majority of stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the interstellar gas and dust that makes up the <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails. Examples of these formations can be seen in NGC 4676 or the Antennae Galaxies.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E
40|$|Two {{dimensional}} Fourier {{spectra of}} near-infrared images of galaxies provide a powerful diagnostic {{tool for the}} detection of <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> modulation in stellar disks. <b>Spiral</b> <b>arm</b> modulation may be understood in terms of interference patterns of outgoing and incoming density wave packets or modes. The brightness along a <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> will be increased where two wave crests meet and constructively interfere, but will be decreased where a wave crest and a wave trough destructively interfere. <b>Spiral</b> <b>arm</b> modulation has hitherto only been detected in grand design spirals (such as Messier 81). <b>Spiral</b> <b>arm</b> amplitude variations have the potential to become a powerful constraint for the study of galactic dynamics. We illustrate our method in two galaxies: NGC 4062 and NGC 5248. In both cases, we have detected trailing and leading m= 2 waves with similar pitch angles. This suggests that the amplification mechanism is the WASER type II. In this mechanism, the bulge region reflects (rather than refracts) incoming waves with no change of pitch angle, but only a change of their sense of winding. The ratio between the amplitudes of the leading and the trailing waves is about 0. 5 in both cases, wherein the higher amplitude is consistently assigned to the trailing (as opposed to leading) mode. The results are particularly significant because NGC 5248 is an optically grand design galaxy, whereas NGC 4062 is optically flocculent. NGC 4062 represents the very first detection of <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> modulation in the stellar disk of an optically flocculent galaxy.

5|$|NGC 7424 is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with an {{apparent}} magnitude of 10.4. located around 4 degrees west of the Grus Triplet.

5|$|The Solar System {{is located}} in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a {{diameter}} of about 100,000 light-years containing about 100 billion stars. The Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer <b>spiral</b> <b>arms,</b> known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm or Local Spur. The Sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the Galactic Centre, and its speed within the Milky Way is about 220km/s, so that it completes one revolution every 225–250 million years. This revolution is known as the Solar System's galactic year. The solar apex, the direction of the Sun's path through interstellar space, is near the constellation Hercules {{in the direction of the}} current location of the bright star Vega. The plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about 60° to the galactic plane.|$|E
5|$|The typical average equipartition {{strength}} for spiral galaxies is about 10 μG (microGauss) or 1 nT (nanoTesla). For comparison, the Earth's magnetic field has an average strength of about 0.3 G (Gauss or 30 μT (microTesla). Radio-faint galaxies like M 31 and M 33, our Milky Way's neighbors, have weaker fields (about 5 μG), while gas-rich galaxies with high star-formation rates, like M 51, M 83 and NGC 6946, have 15 μG on average. In prominent <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> the field strength can {{be up to}} 25 μG, in regions where cold gas and dust are also concentrated.

M85 is interacting with the spiral galaxy NGC 4394 and the elliptical galaxy MCG-3-32-38. M88 (NGC 4501) is a multi-arm spiral galaxy seen at about 30° from edge-on. It has a highly-regular shape with well-developed, symmetrical arms. Among the first galaxies recognized as spiral, it has a supermassive black hole in its center. M91 (NGC 4548), a barred spiral galaxy with a bright, diffuse nucleus, is the faintest object in Messier's catalog at magnitude 10.2. M98 (NGC 4192), a bright, elongated spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on, appears elliptical because of its unusual angle. The magnitude-10 galaxy has no redshift. M99 (NGC 4254) is a spiral galaxy seen face-on. Like M98 it is of magnitude-10 and has an unusually long arm on its west side.

5|$|In 2006, it was {{hypothesized}} that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×108y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium. This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since hassium is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.|$|E
