5|$|The {{prosecution}} realized {{early on}} that issues relating to time would be {{an essential part of}} its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15p.m. A prosecution witness, Monteen <b>Stover,</b> said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that <b>Stover</b> did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that <b>Stover</b> arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} held {{scoreless}} before a record crowd at M Bank Stadium until a Baltimore field goal gave the Ravens a 3–0 lead at 12:34 {{of the second}} quarter. Pittsburgh tied the game on a Jeff Reed field goal; Matt <b>Stover</b> converted a second time to give the Ravens a three-point lead at halftime. <b>Stover</b> kicked his third field goal {{of the game in}} the third quarter, extending their lead to six points. In the final quarter, Reed kicked his second field goal of the game to put the Steelers within three points. On the Steelers final drive of the game, the offense drove 92yards over 2:53, with Ben Roethlisberger completing a touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes with 50seconds remaining. The Ravens embarked on one more drive, but the Steelers second interception of the game prevented them from scoring. With the victory the Steelers won their second consecutive AFC North title and clinched a first round bye and became the first AFC franchise to amass 550wins.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} a 4 x 4 Latin square design with four cow-calves {Holstein Friesian, aged' 6 - 8 months) to investigate the effect of supplementing molasses-urea block {MUB) to untreated or ammoniated maize <b>stovers</b> on feed intake and in viva digestibility of nutrients. Each period consisted of 10 days adaptation, followed by five days data collection. The four diets were untreated maize <b>stovers</b> {Diet A), untreated maize <b>stovers</b> with MUB {Diet B), ammoniated maize <b>stovers</b> {Diet 'C) and ammoniated maize <b>stovers</b> with MUB {Diet D). Daily consumption of maize <b>stovers</b> and total feed by the calves were higher {P< 0. 01) on the diets containing ammoniated maize <b>stovers</b> than those containing untreated maize <b>stovers.</b> Ammoniation increased the intake of maize <b>stovers</b> by 61 %. Supplementary feeding of MUB did not change the daily intake of both untreated and ammoniated maize <b>stovers.</b> Calves receiving untreated maize <b>stovers</b> consumed more MUB {P< 0. 01) than those given ammoniated maize <b>stovers</b> { 496. 40 vs 180. 20 g DM/d). Daily water consumption was affected {P< 0. 01) by diets and was lowest on Diet A. Calves receiving ammoniated maize <b>stovers</b> consumed more water than those given untreated maize <b>stovers.</b> MUB increased {P< 0. 01) the water consumption only on untreated maize <b>stovers.</b> Mean water consumption was 13. 93, 15. 91, 15. 07 and 15. 60 lit/d on diet A, B, C and D, respectively. In vivo digestibility of dry matter, organic matter and crude protein were Influenced {P< 0. 01) by diet composition. I Among the four diets, dry matter digestibility was minimum (P< 0. 01) on Diet A and remained the same on diets B, C and D { 55. 82, 58. 02 and 58. 14 %, respectively). Organic matter and crude protein digestibility {{were higher in the}} claves receiving ammoniated maize <b>stovers.</b> Supplementation of MUB increased (P< 0. 01) the digestibility of all the three nutrients in untreated maize <b>stovers</b> but did not affect the digestibility of ammoniated maize <b>stovers.</b> The results demonstrated that MUB supplementation might not be required when calves are fed ammoniated maize <b>stovers...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the AFC Divisional Round {{against the}} Baltimore Ravens, Manning threw two {{touchdown}} passes {{late in the}} first half to build a 17–3 halftime lead. He completed 30 passes for 246 yards in leading his eighth straight victory over the Ravens. In the AFC Championship against New York Jets, Manning overcame a 17–6 deficit late in the second quarter to lead the Colts to 24 unanswered points in a 30–17 win. The 11-point comeback was the third largest in a championship game. Manning set a playoff record with his seventh 300-yard passing game in the postseason. In Super Bowl XLIV against New Orleans Saints, Manning led the Colts to a 10–0 lead after their two first quarter drives, throwing a touchdown pass to wide receiver Pierre Garçon to cap off a 96-yard drive (tied for longest in Super Bowl history). After running just six plays in the second quarter, the Colts led 10–6 at halftime. The Saints recovered an onside kick to start the second half and took their first lead, 13–10. Manning led a go ahead touchdown drive to regain the lead. Leading 17–16 {{at the start of the}} fourth quarter, placekicker Matt <b>Stover</b> missed a 51-yard field goal for the Colts. The Saints scored the go ahead touchdown and two-point conversion to take a 24–17 lead with 5:42 left. Manning took over and moved the Colts to the Saints' 31-yard line. Facing a 3rd & 5 with 3:24 left, his pass intended for Reggie Wayne was intercepted by Tracy Porter, who returned it 74 yards for a critical touchdown and a 31–17 Saints lead. Manning drove the Colts down to the 5-yard line in the last minute, but his 4th & goal pass was dropped by Reggie Wayne at the goal line. The Saints won their first Super Bowl in franchise history, dropping Manning to 9–9 in the postseason and a 1–1 record in the Super Bowl.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a 4 x 4 Latin square design involving four adult crossbred (Kaghani x Rambouillet) weather kept in individual metabolic crates and four experimental diets viz: maize <b>stovers</b> (Diet A), maize <b>stovers</b> with 150 g/d molasses-urea block (Diet B), lucerne hay (Diet C) and lucerne hay with 150 g/d molasses-urea block (Diet D). The forage intake was restricted to 2 % of body weight. Each experimental period consisted 10 days of adaptation followed by five days of data collection. Total dry matter intake on molasses-urea block (MUB) supplemented diets was higher (p< 0. 05) than unsupplemented diets. The daily quantity of total dry matter and water consumed by weathers was higher (p < 0. 001) on MUB supplemented diets. Water consumption was positively co-related to nitrogen intake (r 2 0. 66 : p< 0. 00 I) and varied due to diets (p < 0. 00 I). in vivo dry matter digestibility (DMD) and organic matter digestibility (OMD) of lucerne hay-based diets were greater (P< 005) than those containing maize <b>stovers.</b> Supplementation of MUB did not affect the DMD or OMD of the diets. The interaction of MUB and forage (P = 0. 06) revealed that MUB was effective in increasing (P< 0. 05) the nitrogen digestibility of maize <b>stovers</b> from 30, 59 % on diet A to 51. 33 % on diet B but did not affect the nitrogen digestibility in animals fed lucerne hay. The wethers receiving lucerne hay-based diets retained more nitrogen (p< 0. 001) than those given maize <b>stovers</b> (8. 50 's 3, 12 g/d). Molasses-urea block supplementation on both forages increased (p < 0. 05) the nitrogen retention. Mean nitrogen retention was I 82. 4. 41, 7. 19 and 9. 82 gld in wethers receiving diets A. B. C and D. respectively. Mean rumen ammonia concentration (mg N/lOO ml) in wethers receiving maize <b>stovers.</b> was 10. 52. which increased (p< 0, 05) to 17. 87 in response to MUB supplementation. On lucerne hay. the rumen ammonia concentrations did not change due to MUB and the mean values on diets C and D were 24, 24 and 29. 88 mg N/ 100 ml. rcspectively. It was concluded that MUB supplementation did not affect in vivo dry matter or organic matter digestibility of the experimental diets. but was effective in supporting higher nitrogen retention. Diets based on lucerne hay supported higher nitrogen retention in wethers than those fed maize <b>stovers.</b> Feeding of MUB increased the demand for drinking water...|$|R

40|$|Straws and <b>stovers</b> {{are often}} called `by-products` of grain {{production}} {{even though they}} are increasingly important, e. g. for animal feed, thatching, soil improvement, mushroom production and industrial use. As a result, plant breeders, agronomists, economists and animal nutritionists have to pay more attention than before to the total value of crops, i. e. whole plant value in which straws and grain both play a part. This paper reviews literature about the technical potential of breeding and/or management for more or better straw. It then discusses issues of the economic value (EV) and nutritional value (NV) of straw and <b>stovers</b> for livestock feed to guide research and development in cereal breeding and management. It is mainly based on experiences from the Indian subcontinent and semi-arid regions of the Near and Middle East. The paper shows that {{the quantity and quality of}} straw produced has changed considerably over recent decades as a result of breeding policies, new cultivation patterns and choice of cultivars. Both EV and NV depend on type of grain, animal production system and access to other feeds. A classification of these factors is provided and suggests that the EV of straw is particularly important in low-input systems with <b>stovers</b> from coarse grains...|$|R
