60|$|As in {{the case}} of the {{fertilization}} of flowers, so in that of the dispersal of seeds, there are two main ways in which the work is effected--by animals and by wind-power. I will not insult the intelligence of the reader at the present time of day by telling him that pollen is usually transferred from blossom to blossom in one or other of these two chief ways--it is carried on the heads or bodies of bees and other honey-seeking insects, or else it is wafted on the wings of the wind to the <b>sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> of a sister-flower. So, too, seeds are for the most part either dispersed by animals or blown about by the breezes of heaven to new situations. These are the two most obvious means of locomotion provided by nature; and it is curious to see that they have both been utilized almost equally by plants, alike for their pollen and their seeds, just as they have been utilized by man for his own purposes on sea or land, in ship, or windmill, or pack-horse, or carriage.|$|E
60|$|Here as elsewhere, however, Darwin's {{principle}} {{does not}} spring spontaneous, like Athene {{from the head}} of Zeus, a goddess full-formed, uncaused, inexplicable: it arises gradually by a slow process of development and modification from the previous investigations of earlier biologists. At the close of the last century, in the terrible year of upheaval 1793, a quiet German botanist, Christian Konrad Sprengel by name, published at Berlin his long unheeded but intensely interesting work on the 'Fertilisation of Flowers.' In the summer of 1789, while all Europe was ablaze with the news that the Bastille had been stormed, and a new era of humanity begun, the calm and peaceful Pomeranian observer was noting in his own garden the curious fact that many flowers are incapable of being fertilised without the assistance of flying insects, which carry pollen from the stamens of one blossom to the <b>sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> or ovary of the next. Hence he concluded that the secretion of honey or nectar in flowers, the contrivances by which it is protected from rain, the bright hues or lines of the corolla, and the sweet perfume distilled by the blossoms, are all so many cunning devices of nature to ensure fertilisation by the insect-visitors. Moreover, Sprengel observed that many flowers are of one sex only, and that in several others the sexes do not mature simultaneously; 'so that,' said he, 'nature seems to intend that no flower shall be fertilised by means of its own pollen.' Indeed, in some instances, as he showed by experiments upon the yellow day lily, plants impregnated from their own stamens cannot be made to set seed at all. 'So near,' says his able successor, Hermann Müller, 'was Sprengel to the distinct recognition of the fact that self-fertilisation leads to worse results than cross-fertilisation, and that all the arrangements which favour insect-visits are of value to the plant itself, simply because the insect-visitors effect cross-fertilisation!' As in most other anticipatory cases, however, it must be here remarked that Sprengel's idea was wholly teleological: he conceived of nature as animated by a direct informing principle, which deliberately aimed at a particular result; whereas Darwin rather {{came to the conclusion that}} cross-fertilisation as a matter of fact does actually produce beneficial results, and that therefore those plants which varied most in the direction of arrangements for favouring insect-visits were likely to be exceptionally fortunate in the struggle for existence against competitors otherwise arranged. It is just the usual Darwinian substitution of an efficient for a final cause.|$|E

40|$|NASA s {{activities}} {{to prepare for}} Flight LF 1 (STS- 114) included development of a method to repair the Thermal Protection System (TPS) of the Orbiter s leading edge should it be damaged during ascent by impacts from foam, ice, etc. Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) {{is used for the}} leading edge TPS. The repair material that was developed is named Non- Oxide Adhesive eXperimental (NOAX). NOAX is an uncured adhesive material that acts as an ablative repair material. NOAX completes curing during the Orbiter s descent. The Thermal Protection System (TPS) Detailed Test Objective 848 (DTO 848) performed on Flight LF 1 (STS- 114) characterized the working life, porosity void size in a micro-gravity environment, and the on-orbit performance of the repairs to pre-damaged samples. DTO 848 is also scheduled for Flight ULF 1. 1 (STS- 121) for further characterization of NOAX on-orbit performance. Due to the high material outgassing rates of the NOAX material and concerns with contamination impacts to optically <b>sensitive</b> <b>surfaces,</b> ASTM E 1559 outgassing tests were performed to determine NOAX condensable outgassing rates as a function of time and temperature. <b>Sensitive</b> <b>surfaces</b> of concern include the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) visor, cameras, and other sensors in proximity to the experiment during the initial time after application. This paper discusses NOAX outgassing characteristics, how the amount of deposition on optically <b>sensitive</b> <b>surfaces</b> while the NOAX is being manipulated on the pre-damaged RCC samples was determined by analysis, and how flight rules were developed to protect those optically <b>sensitive</b> <b>surfaces</b> from excessive contamination where necessary...|$|R

40|$|High Technology Systems (HTS) with <b>sensitive</b> <b>surfaces,</b> such as superconducting radio {{frequency}} (SRF) accelerating cavities, polarized electron sources (PES) for accelerators and many others, {{are prone to}} degradation when subjected to particulate or hydrocarbon contaminants. Particulate contamination control of SRF cavity surfaces and vacuum components have been discussed by several authors at this contamination workshop. Hydrocarbon contamination mainly results from prolonged evacuation with conventional oil lubricated pumping systems and/or prolonged leak detection with conventional leak detectors. The sensitivity of the conventional leak detectors suffers due to the back-streaming of atmospheric helium (5 x 10 {sup {minus} 1 } Pa) through the pumping systems and/or the trapping of helium in the O-rings and oils of the pumping systems. This reduced sensitivity leads {{to the use of}} the leak detectors over long periods of time for detecting small (1 x 10 {sup {minus} 10 } atm. cc s{sup {minus} 1 }) leaks in HTS thereby exposing the <b>sensitive</b> <b>surfaces</b> to contamination.

5000|$|Color {{photography}} was attempted {{beginning in}} the 1840s. Early experiments were directed at finding a [...] "chameleon substance" [...] which would assume {{the color of the}} light falling on it. Some encouraging early results, typically obtained by projecting a solar spectrum directly onto the <b>sensitive</b> <b>surface,</b> seemed to promise eventual success, but the comparatively dim image formed in a camera required exposures lasting for hours or even days. The quality and range of the color was sometimes severely limited mainly to primary colors, as in the chemically complicated [...] "Hillotype" [...] process invented by American daguerreotypist Levi Hill around 1850. Other experimenters, such as Edmond Becquerel, achieved better results but could find no way to prevent the colors from quickly fading when the images were exposed to light for viewing. Over the following several decades, renewed experiments along these lines periodically raised hopes and then dashed them, yielding nothing of practical value.|$|E
50|$|The most <b>sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> is the {{high-pressure}} turbine {{nozzle guide vanes}} (NGVs), situated immediately downstream of the combustor. The gas flow is choked through the NGVs, and so the flow area through the NGVs is a controlling area for the engine. If this area is reduced due to an accretion of ash, a smaller mass flow rate of gas passes through the engine core. Reduced mass flow leads to the turbine doing less work. The turbine drives the compressor, which accordingly also does less work compressing the air. If the compressor can no longer contain the high pressure gas in the engine core, the gas flow can reverse and flow {{out of the front}} of the engine. This is known as an engine surge or a compressor surge, and is often accompanied by a ball of flame that bursts out the front of the engine. This surge is likely to extinguish the flame in the engine combustor, known as a 'flame-out'.Once the high pressure in the core dissipates, the engine should be free to restart. Restarting an engine at altitude can be difficult, due to the lower temperatures and pressures of the ambient gas, but is not normally a problem. The reduced flow area of the NGVs can make it harder to restart the engine.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to charging effects, AES {{data can be}} obscured {{by the presence of}} characteristic energy losses in a sample and higher order atomic ionization events. Electrons ejected from a solid will generally undergo multiple scattering events and lose energy in the form of collective electron density oscillations called plasmons. If plasmon losses have energies near that of an Auger peak, the less intense Auger process may become dwarfed by the plasmon peak. As Auger spectra are normally weak and spread over many eV of energy, they are difficult to extract from the background and in the presence of plasmon losses; deconvolution of the two peaks becomes extremely difficult. For such spectra, additional analysis through chemical <b>sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> techniques like x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is often required to disentangle the peaks. Sometimes an Auger spectrum can also exhibit [...] "satellite" [...] peaks at well-defined off-set energies from the parent peak. Origin of the satellites is usually attributed to multiple ionization events in an atom or ionization cascades in which a series of electrons is emitted as relaxation occurs for core holes of multiple levels. The presence of satellites can distort the true Auger peak and/or small peak shift information due to chemical bonding at the surface. Several studies have been undertaken to further quantify satellite peaks.|$|E

Brazilian real estate firm Engetécnica, who were previously hired as a subcontractor for the venue in February, were hired to replace Tecnosolo and finish construction of the velodrome.
