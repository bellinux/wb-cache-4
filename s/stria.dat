40|$|Abstract Background <b>Striae</b> gravidarum is a {{physiological}} skin change that many pregnant women experience during pregnancy. The <b>striae</b> are {{often accompanied by}} a reddish purple color during pregnancy, and then lose pigmentation and become atrophic {{in the long term}} after pregnancy. <b>Striae</b> gravidarum seems to be undesirable to many pregnant women. However, the impact of <b>striae</b> gravidarum on pregnant women who experience it has not been clarified. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of <b>striae</b> gravidarum on the generic and dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) of pregnant women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at three private clinics in a typical urban area in Japan. We recruited 447 pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation; One hundred and ninety-nine pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation participated in the study and 179, consisting of 94 primiparae and 85 multiparae, were analyzed. We used and assessed Davey’s score for <b>striae</b> gravidarum, World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment questionnaire for generic QOL, and Skindex- 29 for dermatology-specific QOL. Results The prevalence of <b>striae</b> gravidarum was 39. 1 % (27. 7 % in primiparae, and 51. 8 % in multiparae). Although there were no differences in generic QOL scores between the presence and absence of <b>striae</b> gravidarum and with their severity, the whole group of pregnant women and the multiparae group showed significant differences in scores on emotion of Skindex- 29 between the presence and absence of <b>striae</b> gravidarum (p [*]=[*] 0. 012 and p [*]=[*] 0. 011). Pregnant women with severe <b>striae</b> gravidarum showed significantly higher scores on emotion of Skindex- 29 compared with those with absent or mild <b>striae</b> gravidarum (p [*] p [*]=[*] 0. 005). Conclusions There was no difference in generic QOL of pregnant women between the presence and absence of <b>striae</b> gravidarum, although the occurrence and severity of <b>striae</b> gravidarum influenced their dermatology-specific QOL. Multiparae women were especially impaired by <b>striae</b> gravidarum and it is considered important to prevent or reduce the severity of <b>striae</b> gravidarum of the multiparae group. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{uncover the}} {{significance}} of a previously unappreciated structural feature in corneal stroma, important to its biomechanics. Vogt <b>striae</b> are a known clinical indicator of keratoconus, and consist of dark, vertical lines crossing the corneal depth. However we detected stromal <b>striae</b> in most corneas, not only keratoconus. We observed <b>striae</b> with multiple imaging modalities in 82 % of 118 human corneas, with pathology-specific differences. <b>Striae</b> generally depart from anchor points at Descemet’s membrane in the posterior stroma obliquely in a V-shape, whereas in keratoconus, <b>striae</b> depart vertically from posterior toward anterior stroma. Optical coherence tomography shear wave elastography showed discontinuity of rigidity, and second harmonic generation and scanning electron microscopies showed undulation of lamellae at <b>striae</b> locations. <b>Striae</b> visibility decreased beyond physiological pressure and increased beyond physiological hydration. Immunohistology revealed <b>striae</b> to predominantly contain collagen VI, lumican and keratocan.

The lateral wall of the cochlear duct is formed by the spiral ligament and the <b>stria</b> vascularis, which produces the endolymph.

25|$|In the hypothalamus, {{oxytocin}} {{is made in}} magnocellular neurosecretory {{cells of}} the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and is stored in Herring bodies at the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary. It is then released into the blood from the posterior lobe (neurohypophysis) of the pituitary gland. These axons (likely, but dendrites have not been ruled out) have collaterals that innervate neurons in the nucleus accumbens, a brain structure where oxytocin receptors are expressed. The endocrine effects of hormonal oxytocin and the cognitive or behavioral effects of oxytocin neuropeptides {{are thought to be}} coordinated through its common release through these collaterals. Oxytocin is also produced by some neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that project {{to other parts of the}} brain and to the spinal cord.

40|$|Linear {{abrasion}} {{features on}} rock surfaces {{are produced by}} interacting rock particles in relative motion. The most common examples are <b>striae</b> produced by temperate glaciers, and as a consequence, <b>striae</b> have long {{been used as a}} means of identifying the passage of past glaciers. However, there are many non-glacial processes that can produce <b>striae.</b> These have been sporadically documented in the geological literature but have failed to make a lasting impression on the wider Earth Sciences community. These non-glacial processes include tectonic deformation, meltwater flow, non-glacial ice, wind action, volcanic blasting, mass movements of rock debris, among many others. Many produce coarse-grained deposits similar in character to glacial tills and there are several instances where non-glacial deposits and <b>striae</b> have been misinterpreted as glacial in origin. This thesis examines linear abrasion features (mostly <b>striae)</b> from five different environments, three glacial (temperate, polythermal and cold) and two non-glacial environments (mass movement and tectonic) to characterise the <b>striae</b> from different origins. The aim was to assess if there are readily observable and measurable differences in <b>striae</b> character between environments and to develop field-based criteria that allow a sound judgement of their origin in the geological record. Over 760 measurements of individual <b>striae</b> were made (orientation and size) on around 20 representative clasts and characteristic features of about 50 striated clasts from the various environments are illustrated in an "Atlas of linear abrasion features". In addition clast shape and <b>striae</b> occurrence were measured on 1260 clasts from deposits and about 100 bedrock linear abrasions from a cold-based glacier were recorded. The results show that some <b>striae</b> are diagnostic of certain environments but a combination of clast shape and <b>striae</b> characteristics is the most reliable method of correctly interpreting coarse-grained deposits with striated clasts. Results also highlight the wide range of <b>striae</b> characteristics within each environment and the importance of lithology in <b>striae</b> generation. This is evident even within the well-known temperate glacial environment where there is a marked contrast between <b>striae</b> formed within a thick debris layer and those formed in thin debris-rich basal ice. There appears to be little difference in <b>striae</b> formed by temperate and polyhermal glaciers, but glacial <b>striae</b> are readily distinguishable from <b>striae</b> found in various mass movement deposits or tectonically deformed conglomerates. Glacial <b>striae</b> tend to be sub-parallel to the clast long axes and show a high density on individual surfaces, whereas those in non-glacial origin typically show a lower density of slightly shorter, wider <b>striae</b> and show either no preferred orientation or weak grouping. The survivability of glacial abrasion features of clasts once they have entered a fluvial system has been assessed in a small South Island glacier fed river. This has provided a basis for estimating the proximity of a glaciofluvial deposit to the glacier front. <b>Striae</b> are found to survive only 1 to 2 km and glacial facets are mostly removed within 6 km. The study has also documented previously undescribed linear abrasion features from a cold-based glacier in Antarctica. This discovery is a significant advance in understanding cold glacial processes, and has provided new criteria for recognising the passage of cold-based glaciers in polar areas or regions where cold-based ice may have existed in the past...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Colours of <b>striae</b> distensae {{are often}} {{different}} from that of the surrounding skin. A close look using dermoscopy discloses distinct patterns of melanized networks at these sites. The aim of the study was to design a method of high- analytical analysis of the skin colours using the combination of photographic dermoscopy and small field reflectance colorimetry. METHODS: Clinical photographs were taken from <b>striae</b> distensae and their surrounding skin using a Dermaphot (Heine Optotechnik, Hersching, Germany). A final magnification of 125 x was obtained on paper photographs. The reflectance colorimeter Visi-Chroma VC- 100 (Biophotonics, Lessines, Belgium) was used to measure colours of the pigmentary networks in the L*a*b* system. Differential colour parameters (deltaE*ab, deltaL*, deltaa*, deltab*) were calculated for each case between the lesional and the surrounding normal skin, and between the melanized reticulated pattern and the enclosed lighter areas. RESULTS: Objective colorimetric assessments distinguished four distinct types, namely <b>striae</b> albae, <b>striae</b> rubrae, <b>striae</b> caeruleae and <b>striae</b> nigrae. The latter peculiar hyperpigmented type of <b>striae</b> distensae was specifically identified by epiluminescence examination in dark-skinned subjects. The fine-melanized honeycomb network present on the adjacent intact skin was reshaped inside <b>striae</b> in a streaky pattern perpendicular to the <b>striae</b> axis. Strong linear correlations were found between all combinations of deltaL* and deltab* evaluating colours of the reticulated and the honeycomb alveolar patterns both inside and outside the <b>striae</b> distensae. By contrast, no correlations were found between deltaa* and the other colorimetric parameters. CONCLUSION: The direct and/or indirect influences of melanocyte mechanobiology appear to have a prominent effect on the various colours of <b>striae</b> distensae. Peer reviewe...|$|R
500|$|Cyathus striatus, {{commonly}} known as the fluted bird's nest, is a common saprobic bird's nest fungus with a widespread distribution throughout temperate regions of the world. This fungus resembles a miniature bird's nest with numerous tiny [...] "eggs"; the eggs, or peridioles, are actually lens-shaped bodies that contain spores. C.striatus can be distinguished from most other bird's nest fungi by its hairy exterior and grooved (...) inner walls. Although most frequently found growing on dead wood in open forests, it also grows on wood chip mulch in urban areas. The fruiting bodies are encountered from summer until early winter. The color and size of this species can vary somewhat, but they are typically less than a centimeter wide and tall, and grey or brown in color. Another common name given to C.striatus, splash cups, alludes to the method of spore dispersal: the sides of the cup are angled such that falling drops of water can dislodge the peridioles and eject them from the cup. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin <b>stria,</b> meaning [...] "with fine ridges or grooves".|$|E

Objective: We compared {{the efficacy of}} 1064 nm long pulse (LP) Nd: YAG laser and 2940 nm variable square pulse (VSP) erbium: YAG laser {{in the treatment of}} <b>striae</b> distensae. Methods: Twenty female volunteers (Fitzpatrick skin types II-V) aged between 20 and 40 years with <b>striae</b> (3 patients with the rubra type and 17 with the alba type) were enrolled in the study. The duration of <b>striae</b> ranged from 4 months to 12 years. Lesions were located on the abdomen in all patients except one patient who had <b>striae</b> on the arms and two patients with <b>striae</b> in the lumbar region. Treatments were randomly allocated to both sides of the body in each patient, one side being treated with VSP erbium: YAG laser and the opposite side with LP Nd: YAG laser. All subjects were treated monthly for a total of three treatments. Two 3 -mm punch biopsies were obtained from six subjects, both of the same <b>striae,</b> one before the first treatment and one 4 weeks after the last session. Results: Response was evaluated clinically by photographic comparison and was found to be poor in 17 subjects, both on the LP Nd: YAG laser treated side and VSP erbium YAG laser treated side. All these patients had mature lesions (<b>striae</b> distensae alba). Three subjects had a moderate response on both sides; these patients′ <b>striae</b> were immature (<b>striae</b> distensae rubra).
