50|$|Remote {{field testing}} (RFT) is an {{electromagnetic}} method of nondestructive testing whose main application is finding defects in <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes.</b> RFT may {{also referred to}} as RFEC (remote field eddy current) or RFET (remote field electromagnetic technique). An RFT probe is moved down the inside of a pipe and is able to detect inside and outside defects with approximately equal sensitivity (although it can not discriminate between the two). Although RFT works in nonferromagnetic materials such as copper and brass, its sister technology eddy-current testing is preferred.|$|E

40|$|Welded tubular {{products}} play a {{vital role}} in virtually every industrial segment supporting our daily lives. Stainless <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes</b> have good to excellent corrosion resistance and high quality surface finish characteristics, and are for these reasons used in demanding applications such as food processing and pharmaceutical production, for the conveyance and processing of liquids, gases and semi-solids in solution. Their high strength makes them ideally suitable for pressure applications within the oil & gas, petrochemical, chemical, energy, pulp & paper industries, etc. Initially all stainless steel tubular products were of seamless construction, but with improved metallurgy and welding processes, the benefits of welded products have diminished the use of seamless. Most tubes are produced from strip material or plate and can be 100 % non-destructive tested (NDT) to ensure best possible weld quality. By choosing the optimum welding procedure followed by heat treatment and chemical cleaning (pickling) the corrosion resistance of the weld equals that of the base metal. The main advantages of welded <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipes</b> are their lower inherent cost, narrower tolerances for wall thickness, concentricity (OD/ID) and internal surfaces that can be checked prior to manufacture. They also allow larger diameters and longer lengths to be produced. Although welde...|$|R
