5|$|After {{her high}} school graduation, she planned to attend Alcorn State University, which {{did not have a}} women's {{basketball}} team. However, she was asked by Melvin Hemphill, the recruiter for coach Margaret Wade, who was restarting a collegiate women's team, if she would attend Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. This was before Title IX, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no sports scholarships for women. She attended school on a combination of academic scholarships and work study funds.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two main}} engagements, the fighter losses had been about equal. The big {{difference}} was the bombers losses. Fighter Command had had greater success against the afternoon attack rather than the morning assault, which it out numbered 2:1. The ratio of German fighters to bombers had been 3:1 in the morning but 5:1 in the afternoon, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> more targets. The more bombers Kesselring sent, the more were lost.|$|E
5|$|Under him the Buyid kingdom flourished. His {{policies}} were liberal <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no riots during his reign. He embellished Baghdad with numerous public buildings. He also built a famous public hospital {{known as the}} al-'Adudi Hospital. It was the largest hospital of that time, and was destroyed during the Mongol conquests. Many prominent figures worked at the hospital, such as 'Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi and Ibn Marzuban.|$|E

5|$|Also around 1995, Kontsevich {{analyzed}} {{the results of}} Candelas, which gave a general formula for the problem of counting rational curves on a quintic threefold, and he reformulated these results as a precise mathematical conjecture. In 1996, Alexander Givental posted a paper that claimed to prove this conjecture of Kontsevich. Initially, many mathematicians found this paper hard to understand, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> doubts about its correctness. Subsequently, Bong Lian, Kefeng Liu, and Shing-Tung Yau published an independent proof {{in a series of}} papers. Despite controversy over who had published the first proof, these papers are now collectively seen as providing a mathematical proof of the results originally obtained by physicists using mirror symmetry. In 2000, Kentaro Hori and Cumrun Vafa gave another physical proof of mirror symmetry based on T-duality.|$|E
5|$|At that meeting, held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay's Hupmobile {{showroom}} in Canton, {{representatives of}} the Rock Island Independents, the Muncie Flyers, the Decatur Staleys, the Racine Cardinals, the Massillon Tigers, the Chicago Cardinals, and the Hammond Pros agreed to join the league. Representatives of the All-Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting, but sent letters to Hay asking {{to be included in}} the league. Team representatives changed the league's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers, installing Jim Thorpe as president. Under the new league structure, teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no minimum or maximum number of games needed to be played. Also, representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 National Football League draft {{took place}} at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York, on April 28 and April 29, 2007. The draft was {{televised}} for the 28th consecutive year on ESPN and ESPN2. The NFL Network also broadcast coverage of the event, its second year doing <b>so.</b> <b>There</b> <b>were</b> 255 draft selections: 223 regular selections (instead of the typical 224) and 32 compensatory selections. A supplemental draft was also held after the regular draft and before the regular season. This was the first draft presided over by new NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.|$|E
25|$|The vertex {{figure of}} the 24-cell {{honeycomb}} is a tesseract (4-dimensional cube). <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 16 edges, 32 triangles, 24 octahedra, and 8 24-cells meeting at every vertex. The edge figure <b>is</b> a tetrahedron, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 4 triangles, 6 octahedra, and 4 24-cells surrounding every edge. Finally, the face figure <b>is</b> a triangle, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 3 octahedra and 3 24-cells meeting at every face.|$|R

5|$|The {{producers}} {{worked hard}} to keep {{the ending of the}} episode a secret. While it was in production, David Silverman was the only animator who knew who the culprit was. Wes Archer, director of the episode, was initially unaware of the solution and directed the episode up until the conclusion. When it was time to animate the ending of the show, Silverman and Archer waited {{until the end of the}} summer of 1995 to work on it. They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators small parts to work on without telling them who the culprit was. The table read for the episode also ended before the third act. The writers had wanted the clues that were animated to be just right, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> many animation retakes.|$|E

Representatives of the Buffalo All-Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting, but sent letters to Hay asking {{to be included in}} the league. Team representatives changed the league's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers, installing Thorpe as president, Cofall as vice-president, Ranney as secretary-treasurer. Under the new league structure, teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no minimum or maximum number of games needed to be played. Also, representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{are often}} based on a single European {{political}} party such as the socialist group (before 2009). However, they can, like the liberal group, include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents. For a group to be recognised, it needs 25 MEPs from seven different countries. Once recognised, groups receive financial subsidies from the parliament and guaranteed seats on committees, creating an incentive {{for the formation of}} groups. However, some controversy occurred with the establishment of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty (ITS) due to its ideology; the members of the group were far-right, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> concerns about public funds going towards such a group. There were attempts to change the rules to block the formation of ITS, but they never came to fruition. The group was, however, blocked from gaining leading positions on committeesâ€” traditionally (by agreement, not a rule) shared among all parties. When this group engaged in infighting, leading to the withdrawal of some members, its size fell below the threshold for recognition causing its collapse.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Woodruff {{moved to}} Dunedin {{to take up}} a {{position}} as the Chair of Surgery at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, New Zealand's only medical school at that time. Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and St Andrews University in Edinburgh. While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance for allografts in rats. This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in the city, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease (graft versus host disease). Although Woodruff had been productive in four years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> not enough people in the region to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere.|$|E
