40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of calcium carbonate and <b>slip</b> <b>agent</b> on linear medium density polyethylene (LMDPE) processed by rotational molding was evaluated. LMDPE was dry blended with different CaCO 3 masterbatch ratios, erucamide <b>slip</b> <b>agent</b> and then extruded, micronized and rotomolded. The powder samples were characterized using MFI (Melting flow index), dry flow and bulk density. The characterization of rotomolded samples properties was performed by DSC (Differential scanning calorimetry), microscopy analysis, izod impact and tensile test. The results {{pointed out that the}} CaCO 3 addition modifies the bulk density compared to neat LMDPE, but did not significantly affect the dry flow and MFI. The erucamide addition decreased the dry flow and increased the bulk densities. The porosity degree data showed that CaCO 3 addition in the LMDPE increased the quantity of pores. The DSC results showed {{no significant difference in the}} crystallinity degree. The behavior of porosity led to a decrease in the mechanical properties of LMDPE with the CaCO 3 addition...|$|R

5000|$|The {{most stable}} of {{plastics}} used in photo preservation, polyester, does not generate any harmful chemical elements, but {{nor does it}} have any capability to absorb acids generated by the photograph itself. Polyester sleeves and encapsulation have been praised {{for their ability to}} protect the photograph from humidity and environmental pollution, slowing the reaction between the item and the atmosphere. This is true, however the polyester just as frequently traps these elements next to the material it is intended to protect. This is especially risky in a storage environment that experiences drastic fluctuations in humidity or temperature, leading to ferrotyping, or sticking of the photograph to the plastic. [...] Photographs sleeved or encapsulated in polyester cannot be stored vertically in boxes because they will slide down next to each other within the box, bending and folding, nor can the archivist write directly onto the polyester to identify the photograph. Therefore, it is necessary to either stack polyester protected photographs horizontally within a box, or bind them in a three ring binder. Stacking the photos horizontally within a flat box will greatly reduce ease of access, and binders leave three sides of the photo exposed to the effects of light and do not support the photograph evenly on both sides, leading to slumping and bending within the binder. The plastic used for enclosures has been manufactured to be as frictionless as possible to prevent scratching photos during insertion to the sleeves. Unfortunately, the slippery nature of the enclosure generates a build-up of static electricity, which attracts dust and lint particles. The static can attract the dust {{to the inside of the}} sleeve, as well, where it can scratch the photograph. [...] Likewise, these components that aid in insertion of the photo, referred to as <b>slip</b> <b>agents,</b> can break down and transfer from the plastic to the photograph, where they deposit as an oily film, attracting further lint and dust. At this time, there is no test to evaluate the long-term effects of these components on photographs. In addition, the plastic sleeves can develop kinks or creases in the surface, which will scratch away at the emulsion during handling.|$|E

The <b>slip</b> <b>agents</b> used {{to reduce}} {{coefficient}} of friction of polypropylene(PP) film, but it migrate brought the issue of food safety, to reduce of the corona effect and the peel strength of flexible film. We try another method to reduce the coefficient of friction. The result shown that the nano-modification not only reduces the coefficient of friction of PP, but also reduces the adsorption of volatile organic solvent in PP. The coefficient of friction of modified polypropylene was reduced by 50 % when the concentration of nano-silica is between 1 ~ 2 %. The final residues toluene in modified polypropylene was reduced to zero when the concentration of nano-silica in PP is between 1 ~ 3 %.

40|$|A Masters Dissertation, {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the award of Master of Science of Loughborough University. Melt capillary flow has been employed to characterise some low density polyethylene grades, differing in degree of an incorporated <b>slip</b> <b>agent</b> (Olemide Commercial). The same grades were processed into blown film under different extrusion conditions by varying screw speed, blow-up ratio and haul-off rate. The rheological properties affected by the <b>slip</b> <b>agent</b> were, namely, the melt viscosity and the critical shear-rate, after which fracture (turbulence) of the given extrudate occurred. Ease of draw-down property was found to be lower for the low slip grades and increased significantly with increasing degree of slip. (ASTM) and (B. S.) methods were used to test the mechanical properties of the films produced from the film-blowing process under the same above extrusion variables. The effect of these variables on tensile, tear and impact strengths of each grade were analysed. Orientation of the molecular structure, during its passage through the die and immediately after extrusion, as a result of longitudinal or transverse direction drawing strongly affected these properties. Increasing the extrusion variables, generally, resulted in a balanced orientation in both machine and transverse directions (balanced film) and an optimum blow-up ratio was found for a film of balanced strength properties. An attempt was made to correlate characteristics of flow of the different polyethylenes with the above extrusion variables and, hence, with the mechanical properties of the consequent films...|$|R

40|$|Hypothesis The {{amount and}} {{distribution}} of <b>slip</b> <b>agents,</b> erucamide, and behenamide, {{on the surface of}} high-density polyethene, is determined by integral characteristics of slip agent structure and polymer morphology. A suite of surface analysis techniques was applied to correlate physicochemical properties with slip-additive migration behaviour and their surface morphology. The migration, surface morphology and physicochemical properties of the slip additives, crystallinity and orientation of polyethene spherulites and interaction between slip additives and high-density polyethene influence the surface characteristics. Experimental The high-density polyethene closures were produced with erucamide and behenamide separately and stored until they produced required torque. Surface composition was determined employing spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The distribution of additives was observed under optical, scanning electron and atomic force microscopes. The surface energy, crystallinity and application torque were measured using contact angle, differential scanning calorimeter and a torque force tester respectively. Results and discussion Each slip additive produced a characteristic amide peak at 1645 cm - 1 in infrared spectroscopy and peaks of oxygen and nitrogen in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, suggesting their presence on the surface. The erucamide produced placoid scale-like structures and behenamide formed denticulate structures. The surface erucamide and behenamide responsible for reducing the torque was found to be 15. 7 µg/cm 2 and 1. 7 µg/cm 2...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Weathering {{degradation}} of thermally stabilized recycled and reprocessed high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was monitored by nat-urally exposing the HDPE dumbbells on the aluminum exposure racks. The HDPE dumbbells were prepared in the injection-molding machine using {{small percentage of}} anti-oxidants and <b>slip</b> <b>agent</b> to protect the thermo-oxidative {{degradation of}} the material. Four types of HDPE material were used under this study such as: virgin HDPE, 50 / 50 mix-ture of recycled and fresh HDPE, virgin HDPE with thermal stabilizers and recycled HDPE with thermal stabilizers. The performance charac-teristics of the weathered recycled HDPE material was monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the mechanical properties. The results clearly revealed the deterioration of virgin and recycled mixed HDPE formu-lations as compared to thermally stabilized recycled HDPE material under the hostile outdoor weather conditions of Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. A significant drop in the mechanical, thermal and the chemical prop-erties was observed for all the exposed HDPE formulations in terms of drop in elongation, increase in the percent crystallinity and percent carbonyl index. The photo-stability of recycled and reprocessed HDPE materials can be enhanced by incorporating appropriate amount of photo stabilizers in the base formulations...|$|R

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that polymer brushes reduce friction between surfaces. Several industrial applications {{take advantage of this}} fact, such as those in plastic bag production, where the brushes act as slip agents; however, the complex mechanisms that give rise to such reduction of friction are not yet fully understood. In this work we report coarse grained, dissipative particle dynamics simulations carried out for surfaces functionalized with erukamide brushes, a polymer commonly used in the plastics industry as a <b>slip</b> <b>agent</b> between surfaces. We calculate their rheological properties, such as the coefficient of friction (COF) and the viscosity, η, as functions of the number of chains grafted on the surfaces under the influence of stationary, Couette flow. Moreover, we consider also the case when a fraction of the erukamide chains is not adsorbed and moves freely between the surfaces. We show that the COF reaches an equilibrium value of about 0. 29 in these two cases, in agreement with experimental results. On other hand, the viscosity grows monotonically, {{as a result of the}} increasing collisions when the erukamide content is increased. The force between brushes is found to be in agreement with predictions from scaling theories. We find that the addition to free chains helps stabilize the film formed by the brushes and the solvent, as others have found experimentally. The mechanisms that give rise to these phenomena are studied in detail. Comment: 34 pages, 9 figures. To appear in Journal of Molecular Liquid...|$|R

40|$|The {{lack of a}} widely-accepted {{quantitative}} {{methodology for}} evaluating the scratch behavior of polymeric materials {{has resulted in the}} development and establishment of a new methodology recently standardized as ASTM D 7027 - 05. Using a custom-built instrumented scratch machine, it is possible to produce controlled, repeatable scratches on polymer surfaces under constant or linearly increasing loading conditions at constant or increasing scratch rates. Software-aided digital image analysis along with material science tools (SEM, OM, FTIR, etc.) allows polymer scratch behavior to be analyzed without the ambiguity inherent in the past. The current work will serve to describe the motivation for the development of this methodology as well as illustrate the effectiveness of the increasing load/constant rate test mode in three case studies. First, it will be shown that an acrylic coating on a steel system exhibits three zones of scratch damage: adhesive delamination, transverse cracking and finally buckling failure. It will be discussed how increases in ductility and thickness serve to improve the scratch resistantance of this coating/substrate system. Improvements in the scratch behavior of thermoplastic olefins (TPOs) through the use of surface-treated talc fillers and the <b>slip</b> <b>agent</b> erucamide will be shown in the second case. It was found that the surface-treatment of the talc likely allows for enhanced migration of the erucamide to the TPO surface, thus lowering the surface friction and greatly increasing scratch resistance. Finally, the effects of processing conditions, namely injection molding, on the scratch behavior of neat i-polypropylene will be represented by the results of scratch tests conducted where the scratch direction was oriented both along and transverse to the polymer melt flow direction. Based on the findings of the study, {{there appears to be a}} high degree of surface anisotropy introduced to injection-molded polymers due to complex fluid flow regimes as well as non-uniform cooling properties...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 75) The epidemiology of pupil recordable accidents {{has been}} investigated in a junior high school by examining relationship among selected variables. The data were obtained from pupil recordable accident reports {{over a period of}} three years. The greatest number of accidents occurred among thirteen year old boys in the physical education department. Ninth grade pupils had the greatest number of accidents. The months of highest incidence were October, November, and May. Tuesday closely followed by Wednesday were the days of the week when most accidents occurred. Second period, from 9 : 00 a. m. to 10 : 00 a. m., was the period of highest incidence. Boys had twice as many accidents as girls. Forty percent of the accidents resulted in one-half day lost from school while one-fourth of the accidents required the pupil to see a doctor but did not cause absence. The most common injuries were sprains followed by fractures, bruises, dislocations, cuts and concussions. The majority of pupils who had recordable accidents visited a private physician and even more visited the school nurse. Data revealed that the sources predisposing to the injuries were: (1) being struck by a falling or moving object, (2) falls, and (3) tripped or <b>slipped.</b> The causative <b>agent</b> known as 'working surfaces' accounted for thirty percent of the injuries closely followed by 'caused by other persons', twenty-nine percent...|$|R

The final materials are intended for contact with foodstuffs other than fatty foods for long-term storage at room temperature including short heating. No thermal degradation of the substance is expected under manufacturing process conditions of polyolefins. Specific migration from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) made with 0. 37 % of the substance into 3 % acetic acid and 10 % ethanol was up to 0. 68 mg/kg. Based on negative results in a bacterial mutation test and in an in vivo micronucleus test, {{there was no evidence of}} a genotoxic potential of the substance. Impurities were determined and the main ones were tested in a bacterial mutation test giving negative results. Along with the negative results from the in vivo micronucleus test on the substance containing the impurities, there was no evidence of a genotoxic potential of the impurities. Based on a 28 -day study on the substance, the Panel noted that there is sufficient margin of safety between the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and the maximum exposure of consumers that could occur at a migration level of 5 mg/kg food, to cover uncertainties about toxic effects due to potential accumulation of slowly hydrolysed branched amide species of the substance during chronic exposure. The CEF Panel concluded that the substance is not of safety concern for consumers if it is used in the manufacture of polyolefin articles intended for contact with all foodstuffs other than fatty foods and the migration does not exceed 5 mg/kg food.
