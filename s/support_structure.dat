40|$|A {{fastener}} {{system is}} provided for securing a component to <b>supporting</b> <b>structure.</b> The fastener system comprises {{a pair of}} cooperating fastener modules. The first module includes a first stationary member attached to the <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> and a first bolt member threadedly engaged with the first stationary member. The second module includes a second stationary member also attached to the <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> and a second bolt member threadedly engaged with the second stationary member. The second bolt member also extends freely through a longitudinal bore in the first bolt member. Head members on {{the first and second}} head members are mutually engaged for their unitary rotation and the first head member engages the component. When the head members are rotated in one direction, they are advanced toward the <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> thereby drawing the component toward the <b>supporting</b> <b>structure.</b> Rotation in the opposite direction is effective to cause the head members to retract from the <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> and thereby separate the component from the <b>supporting</b> <b>structure.</b> With this construction, upon fracture either of the first fastener means at a location away from the first head member or of the second fastener means at a location away from the second head member, upon rotation of the first head member in the one direction, the first head member nevertheless continues to advance toward the <b>supporting</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{development}} of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water. This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned <b>support</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractAdditive Manufacturing (AM) is {{the process}} of part {{building}} by stacking layers of material on top of each other. Various challenges for a metal powder based process include reducing the staircase effect which leads to poor surface finish of the part, and minimal use of <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> for regions with overhangs or internal hollow volumes. Part build orientation is a crucial process parameter which affects part quality, in particular, Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T) errors on the part, the energy expended and the extent of <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> required. This paper provides an approach to identify an optimal build orientation which will minimize the volume of <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> while meeting the specified GD&T criteria of the part for a DMLS based process. Siemens PLM NX API is used to extract the GD&T callouts and associated geometric information of the CAD model. The regions requiring <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> are identified and a Quadtree decomposition is used to find the volume of <b>support</b> <b>structures.</b> The mathematical relationships between build orientation and GD&T are developed as part of a combined optimization model to identify best build orientations for minimizing <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> while meeting the design tolerances. The feasible build orientations along with the corresponding <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> are depicted using a visual model...|$|R

5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb <b>support</b> <b>structure,</b> are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katrina {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and was heading towards Louisiana. For precaution, Six Flags closed down the New Orleans theme park during mid-season {{to prepare for}} the storm. Due to {{substantial}} flooding, many of the park's rides were damaged beyond repair causing the park to remain closed until the floods retrieved. Many of the park rides were destroyed as the park's drainage system failed and were submerged in water {{for a long period of}} time, long after the hurricane. Anything found in the park still in good use was removed and moved to other parks in the company as Six Flags had no plans on reopening the theme park. Batman: The Ride survived, mainly because of its elevated station and corrosion-resistant <b>support</b> <b>structure,</b> which caused it to make it through Hurricane Katrina relatively unscathed.|$|E

Also on 17 September 2011, the DC Super Heroes Store opened adjacent to , Batwing Spaceshot and Green Lantern Coaster. By early October, most of the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> and the lift hill were complete. By the end of October, the ride's construction was complete and work had begun on the entrance pathway. In early November, six trains arrived on site. Another was showcased by S Worldwide at the 2011 IAAPA Attractions Expo. Kevin Rohwer, an S Worldwide spokesman, stated that the ride would be ready on 15 December 2011. On 28 November 2011, testing began.

5|$|Renovations began almost {{immediately}} and involved {{the removal of}} all of the wooden track and modifications to some of the <b>support</b> <b>structure.</b> On March 3, 2010, Six Flags Over Texas and Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) unveiled the steel I-Box track which would be used on the refurbished ride. The track was developed over the course of three years by RMC owner Fred Grubb, and Ride Centerline, LLC engineers Alan Schilke and Dody Bachtar. The steel track was designed to be a replacement for any existing wooden track structure, with the rail shape, approximate weight, and dimensions remaining the same. Schilke designed the modifications to the layout, giving specifications to Grubb for manufacturing at RMC's Idaho plant. There, two-dimensional plates of steel were machine-welded to form the three-dimensional track parts. The redevelopment saw much of the track get reprofiled; the lift hill was increased by , the first drop was steepened to 79 degrees, and several overbanked turns (ranging from 90° to 115°) were added. The renovated ride, dubbed the New Texas Giant, reopened on April 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} fish {{is divided}} into a head, trunk and tail, {{although}} the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine {{and there are no}} limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which {{with the exception of the}} caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.|$|E
5|$|Tokyo Tower's {{two main}} revenue sources are antenna leasing and tourism.

Since then, attendance has been rising, and it has recently been attracting approximately 3million visitors per year. The first area tourists must visit upon reaching the tower is FootTown, a four-story building stationed directly under the tower. Here, visitors can eat, shop and visit several museums and galleries. Elevators that depart from {{the first floor of}} FootTown can be used to reach the first of two observation decks, the two-story Main Observatory. For the price of another ticket, visitors can board another set of elevators from {{the second floor of the}} Main Observatory to reach the final observation deckthe Special Observatory.|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} to have two or more {{vibratory}} machines of the same type mounted on the same <b>supporting</b> <b>structure.</b> These vibratory machines transmit structure-borne sound to adjacent walls or floors and the structure-borne sound is eventually emitted as noise into indoor spaces. The interactions of the mounting points among coherent machines increase the structure-borne sound power transmission significantly at some frequencies and decrease it considerably at some other frequencies. However, {{there is still no}} general design frameworks of <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> optimization strategy that target on minimizing structure-borne sound power transmission by utilizing the interactions of the mounting points among coherent machines properly. This paper for the first time develops a practical design framework to obtain an optimal set of geometrical parameters for a <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> by using a genetic algorithm with parametric finite element models. A steel-made <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> with two coherent fans installed on were analyzed. Experiments were conducted to obtain the source mobilities and free velocities of the coherent fans that are required for the calculation of structure-borne sound power transmission. Parametric finite element analysis was conducted to obtain the receiver mobility of the <b>supporting</b> <b>structure.</b> A genetic algorithm solved the optimal solution. The results shown that the proposed approach is sufficiently capable of minimizing the structure-borne sound power transmission on a <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> with coherent machines mounted on a <b>supporting</b> <b>structure.</b> Department of Building Services Engineering 2016 - 2017 > Academic research: refereed > Publication in refereed journalbcr...|$|R
