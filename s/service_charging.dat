40|$|A web {{study of}} nearly 500 U. S. -based {{respondents}} compared three possible formats for presenting the <b>service</b> <b>charges</b> for a prix fixe meal, namely, {{as a percentage}} added to the meal price, as a dollar amount added to the meal price, and as an unknown amount obscured by inclusion in the full meal price. For those who received a single price only (with an unstated <b>service</b> <b>charge),</b> the respondents estimated a mean <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> just over 13 percent, which is reasonably close to inferring the commonly applied 15 -percent <b>service</b> <b>charge.</b> The respondents thought that a 12 -percent added charge was good value, but when the stated <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> was higher than the conventional 15 percent they viewed the meal as a bad deal compared to the meal with the unknown <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> included. Survey participants regarded the dollar-amount <b>service</b> <b>charges</b> similarly, but this format also may serve to obscure the service-charge calculation. The chief implication for restaurants is that even with a prix fixe menu, guests are making value calculations at all times, and the <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> {{is one of those}} value issues—one that seems to stick out in customers’ minds...|$|R

40|$|As {{certain types}} of {{property}} has become more complex and both customer and occupier expectations have changed; the services provided by the owners have increased in scope. A modern <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> may therefore include provision for the recovery of a multiplicity of services.

40|$|Mass {{customization}} (MC) {{service is}} a pertinent industrial practice in the fashion industry. To foster trust and enhance demand, some brands now allow dissatisfied customers to return the MC fashion product for a full refund minus a <b>service</b> <b>charge.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> is a measure to avoid the abuse of the return right and to subsidize the operations cost (e. g., shipping) and loss from the return. Motivated by this observed industrial practice, this paper analytically examines the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> policy. We separate the study into two cases?those of risk-neutral and those of risk-averse MC companies, respectively. For each case, we derive the closed-form expression of the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge,</b> and we conduct analytical sensitivity analysis to illustrate how different important parameters in the model affect the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge.</b> In addition, by comparing the two cases, we reveal how the MC service provider's level of risk aversion affects the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> policy. Finally, we derive {{the conditions under which}} it is optimal to offer a zero return <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> (i. e., free return with a full refund). These conditions provide insight on the real-world practice in which some fashion companies offer free return service to their registered members but not to every customer.

After recovering, Jake comes across the original Punisher's war journal, stolen from the archives of the Public Eye. The last page bore the challenge: [...] "You who find this, I charge you to carry on my work." [...] Soon after, he became the new Punisher. Jake would get revenge against Kron Stone, or so he believed. Kron, after threatening the lives of several children, confronts Jake with a device that stops all high-speed projectiles, such as bullets. Jake pulls a knife and slowly stabs Kron, who seemingly dies. Kron would later take on the mantle of Venom in the pages of Spider-Man 2099.|$|E
40|$|Companies {{have been}} aware of the {{benefits}} of developing Cluster Supply Chains (CSCs), and they are spending {{a great deal of time}} and money attempting to develop the new business pattern. Yet, the traditional techniques for identifying CSCs have strong theoretical antecedents, but seem to have little traction in the field. We believe this is because the standard techniques fail to capture evolution over time, nor provide useful intervention measures to reach goals. To address these problems, we introduce an agent-based modeling approach to evaluate CSCs. Taking collaborative procurement as research object, our approach is composed of three parts: model construction, model instantiation, and computational experiment. We use the approach to explore the <b>service</b> <b>charging</b> policy problem in collaborative procurement. Three kinds of <b>service</b> <b>charging</b> polices are compared in the same experiment environment. Finally, “Fixed Cost” is identified as the optimal policy under the stable market environment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{wastewater}} {{construction projects}} {{are needed for}} meeting the environment regulatory and compliance, preserving the sewer system and treatment infrastructure and reducing the sewer spills. However, most business owners {{do not understand the}} fundamental of the sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> program and the current sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> adjustment guideline only provides very basic information for the program. These business owners end up with significant amount of money and time wasted since they often fall short of qualification for sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> adjustment. More importantly, no sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> evaluation or cost benefit analysis is conducted for new construction projects. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate wastewater charge saving strategies through two case studies that include hospital buildings and large residential complex buildings having more than 100 units. Detailed cost comparative analysis is presented to show if the saving strategies are achievable for each case. Lastly, this paper recommends the best property management approach for the review of sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> so that the significant amount of long term sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> saving can be achieved for larger commercial project...|$|R

40|$|Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) {{provide new}} {{opportunities}} {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and exhaust emission. PEVs need to draw and store energy from an electrical grid to supply propulsive {{energy for the}} vehicle. As a result, {{it is important to know}} when PEVs batteries are available for charging and discharging. Furthermore, battery energy management and control is imperative for PEVs as the vehicle operation and even the safety of passengers depend on the battery system. Thus, scheduling the grid power electricity with parking lots would be needed for efficient charging and discharging of PEV batteries. This paper aims to propose a new intelligent battery energy management and control scheduling <b>service</b> <b>charging</b> that utilize Cloud computing networks. The proposed intelligent vehicle-to-grid scheduling service offers the computational scalability required to make decisions necessary to allow PEVs battery energy management systems to operate efficiently when the number of PEVs and charging devices are large. Experimental analyses of the proposed scheduling service as compared to a traditional scheduling service are conducted through simulations. The results show that the proposed intelligent battery energy management scheduling service substantially reduces the required number of interactions of PEV with parking lots and grid as well as predicting the load demand calculated in advance with regards to their limitations. Also it shows that the intelligent scheduling <b>service</b> <b>charging</b> using Cloud computing network is more efficient than the traditional scheduling service network for battery energy management and control...|$|E
