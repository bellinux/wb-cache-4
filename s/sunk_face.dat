60|$|They {{had almost}} {{finished}} with the loading. Outside stood the Optus, his arms folded, his <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> in gloom. Captain Franco walked leisurely down the gangplank, grinning.|$|R
6000|$|Millicent {{had changed}} {{since the last time}} Geoffrey saw her. She had lost her fresh cream and rose prettiness, but had gained {{something}} in place of it, and though her pale blue eyes were too deeply <b>sunk,</b> her <b>face</b> had acquired strength and dignity. She was, as he had always found her, perfectly self-possessed. With a quick glance, which expressed appeal and warning, she said: ...|$|R
60|$|She rose, and {{throwing}} herself {{down upon the}} prie-dieu <b>sunk</b> her <b>face</b> in her hands for some few minutes, during which the object of her devotions stood in some perplexity {{in the middle of}} the room, hardly knowing whether such an attention should be regarded as an insult or as a favour. A tap at the door brought the lady back to this world again, and her devoted attendant answered her summons to enter.|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} {{that she did not}} {{understand}} the word. Heyst produced his playful smile, which contrasted oddly with the worried character of his whole expression. His temples seemed to have <b>sunk</b> in, his <b>face</b> looked a little leaner.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps for {{an instant}} there came upon the stern priest some premonition of that dreadful morning when, as he {{crouched}} {{in a corner of}} 'his burning home, fifty daggers were to rasp against each other in his body. He <b>sunk</b> his <b>face</b> in his hands, and a shudder passed over his gaunt frame. Then he rose, and folding his arms, he resumed his impassive attitude. Louis took up the pen from the table, and drew the paper towards him.|$|R
60|$|They {{all turned}} round. Mary Scott was coming slowly towards {{them across the}} thick rugs, into which her feet <b>sunk</b> noiselessly. Her <b>face</b> was very pale, and her large eyes were full of nervous apprehension. But about her mouth were certain rigid lines which spoke of determination.|$|R
60|$|Our visitor's {{face had}} turned ashen gray {{as he listened}} to the words of his accuser. Now he sat for some time in thought with his <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> in his hands. Then with a sudden {{impulsive}} gesture he plucked a photograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table before us.|$|R
60|$|We {{had taken}} {{refuge in the}} dining-room, and shut the heavy oak door. We laid the {{senseless}} woman upon the sofa, and as we did so, Moir, the hard man of business, drooped and fainted across the hearth-rug. Harvey Deacon was as white as a corpse, jerking and twitching like an epileptic. With a crash we heard the studio door fly to pieces, and the snorting and stamping were in the passage, up and down, shaking the house with their fury. The Frenchman had <b>sunk</b> his <b>face</b> on his hands, and sobbed like a frightened child.|$|R
40|$|In US vaccine markets, {{competing}} producers {{with high}} fixed, <b>sunk</b> costs <b>face</b> relatively concentrated demand. The resulting price and quality competition {{leads to the}} exit of all but one or very few producers per vaccine. Our empirical analysis of exits from US vaccine markets supports the hypothesis that high fixed costs and both price and quality competition contribute to vaccine exits. We find no evidence that government purchasing has significant effects, possibly because government purchase tends to increase volume but lower price, with offsetting effects. Evidence from the flu vaccine market confirms that government purchasing is not {{a necessary condition for}} exits and the existence of few suppliers per vaccine in the US. ...|$|R

60|$|We held {{a council}} round our dismal breakfast-table, to which Mr. Berkeley Craven was invited {{as a man}} of sound wisdom and large {{experience}} in matters of sport. Belcher was half frenzied by this sudden ending of all the pains which he had taken in the training, and could only rave out threats at Berks and his companions, with terrible menaces as to what he would do when he met them. My uncle sat grave and thoughtful, eating nothing and drumming his fingers upon the table, while my heart was heavy within me, and I could have <b>sunk</b> my <b>face</b> into my hands and burst into tears as I thought how powerless I was to aid my friend. Mr. Craven, a fresh-faced, alert man of the world, {{was the only one of}} us who seemed to preserve both his wits and his appetite.|$|R
40|$|Firms may <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> costs when {{entering}} {{an export}} market. Previous {{studies have focused}} on global or country-specific sunk export costs. This study analyses the importance of market-specific sunk export costs (defining ‘market’ as a product-country combination). We also study how market-specific export costs can be affected by various kinds of learning and spillover effects. We use firm-level panel data for Norwegian seafood exports distributed on products and countries. The results lend support to the hypothesis of market-specific sunk costs. We also find evidence of learning and spillover effects, particularly within the same product group...|$|R
60|$|The {{room into}} which we passed was a long, narrow one. There were two windows at one side, but the {{curtains}} {{had been drawn}} almost across, so that the light was not very good. At the further door was Roustem the Mameluke, and beside him, with arms folded and his <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> downwards in an attitude of shame and contrition, there was standing the very man of whom we had been talking. He looked up with scared eyes, and started with fear {{when he saw the}} Emperor approaching him. Napoleon stood with legs apart and his hands behind his back, and looked at him long and searchingly.|$|R
60|$|And {{this was}} what a single day brought about; and yet years pass away so often without a change. Just think of the {{alteration}} in that four-and-twenty hours. De Lissac was gone. Edie was gone. Napoleon had escaped. War had broken out. Jim Horscroft had lost everything, and he and I were setting out {{to fight against the}} French. It was all like a dream, until I tramped off to the coach that evening, and looked back at the grey farm steading and at the two little dark figures: my mother with her <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> in her Shetland shawl, and my father waving his drover's stick to hearten me upon my way.|$|R
60|$|I bethought {{myself to}} go upstairs {{and see how}} the dying woman sped, who lay there almost unheeded: the very {{servants}} paid her but a remittent attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of the room whenever she could. Bessie was faithful; but she had her own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on me, and then I moved away to the window.|$|R
60|$|Only {{once was}} the long vigil broken. A woman came {{forth from the}} house and walked up and down, with her <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> upon her breast. She was tall and slender, but her {{features}} could not be seen for a wimple over her head. Weary sadness could be read in her bowed back and dragging steps. Once only they saw her throw her two hands up to Heaven as one who is beyond human aid. Then she passed slowly into the house again. A moment later the door of the hall was flung open, and a shouting stumbling throng came crowding forth, with whoop and yell, into the silent night. Linking arms and striking up a chorus, they marched past the peat-cutting, their voices dwindling slowly away as they made for their homes.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the {{determinants}} of the U. S. dollar real exchange rate fluctuation. We focus our analysis on a nominal exchange rate effect on tradable prices. We explicitly consider the effects of profit maximizing foreign firms’ entry decisions on the domestic tradable prices through the supply changes after a large appreciation. If firms <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> entry costs when breaking into foreign markets, the extent of pass-through will depend on the expected changes of nominal exchange rate. Typically, exchange rate uncertainty is determined as a volatility of continuos time series process. We enlarge the discussion to consider also possible jumps in the expected exchange rate time path. Finally, an interesting perspective is provided by a real option approach that emphasize dynamic supply effects through sunk costs and uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{missions}} are one instrument of Earth observation targeted at obtaining information for improved {{decision making in}} sustainable development. But satellite {{missions are}} expensive undertakings involving large <b>sunk</b> costs and <b>facing</b> uncertain benefit streams. In the area of avoiding damages through, for example, better weather forecasts or better-informed rescue missions, the benefits are high, but also difficult to quantify. Using real options to optimize {{the timing of the}} launch of a satellite enables us not only to optimize the timing of the mission, but also to derive the value that such information conveys when {{it can be used to}} reduce the extent of the damage from disasters and their consequences: with low benefit expectations or large uncertainty, launching will be postponed, so ex ante Earth observation benefit assessment is an important task...|$|R
60|$|Abbot John rose {{to stretch}} his cramped limbs. He {{looked out at}} the greensward of the cloister, and at the graceful line of open Gothic arches which skirted a covered walk for the brethren within. Two and two in their {{black-and-white}} garb with slow step and heads inclined, they paced round and round. Several of the more studious had brought their illuminating work from the scriptorium, and sat in the warm sunshine with their little platters of pigments and packets of gold-leaf before them, their shoulders rounded and their <b>faces</b> <b>sunk</b> low over the white sheets of vellum. There too was the copper-worker with his burin and graver. Learning and art were not traditions with the Cistercians as with the parent Order of the Benedictines, and yet the library of Waverley was well filled both with precious books and with pious students.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{memorials}} to the Rough Riders were {{erected in}} Cuba {{shortly after the}} Spanish–American War ended. One, erected by Brigadier General Wood out of general funds provided for Cuba's military occupation, was erected next to the Spanish Army blockhouse atop San Juan Hill. This memorial stood on a square concrete base, on {{the four corners of}} which were placed artillery shells. A square plinth with sunk, blank panels on all four sides stood on the base. On the plinth rose a tapered square column with a flat top. <b>Sunk</b> into the <b>face</b> of this column was a bronze plaque, which read: [...] "In memory of the officers and men of the United States army, who were killed in the assault and capture of this ridge, July 1, 1898, and in the siege of Santiago, July 1 to July 16, 1898.

60|$|There was a half moon shining, and, as I {{came up to}} our trysting-place, I {{saw that}} I {{was not the first}} to arrive. The Emperor was pacing up and down, his hands behind him and his <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> {{somewhat}} forward upon his breast. He wore a grey great-coat with a capote over his head. I had seen him in such a dress in our winter campaign in Poland, and it was said that he used it because the hood was such an excellent disguise. He was always fond, whether in the camp or in Paris, of walking round at night, and overhearing the talk in the cabarets or round the fires. His figure, however, and his way of carrying his head and his hands were so well known that he was always recognized, and then the talkers would say whatever they thought would please him best.|$|R

60|$|For an hour {{of utter}} misery, chilled in body and soul, I sat upon a pile of fagots, my <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> upon my hands and my mind full of the saddest thoughts. It was cold enough within those four walls, but I thought of the sufferings of my poor troopers outside, and I sorrowed with their sorrow. Then. I paced up and down, and I clapped my hands {{together}} and kicked my feet against the walls {{to keep them from}} being frozen. The lamp gave out some warmth, but still it was bitterly cold, and I had had no food since morning. It seemed to me that everyone had forgotten me, but at last I heard the key turn in the lock, and who should enter but my prisoner of the morning, Captain Alexis Barakoff. A bottle of wine projected from under his arm, and he carried a great plate of hot stew in front of him.|$|R

60|$|It {{was a cold}} December {{night when}} Captain Baumgarten marched out of Les Andelys with his twenty Poseners, and took the main road to the north west. Two miles out he turned {{suddenly}} down a narrow, deeply rutted track, and made swiftly for his man. A thin, cold rain was falling, swishing among the tall poplar trees and rustling in the fields on either side. The captain walked first with Moser, a veteran sergeant, beside him. The sergeant's wrist was fastened {{to that of the}} French peasant, and it had been whispered in his ear that in case of an ambush the first bullet fired would be through his head. Behind them the twenty infantrymen plodded along through the darkness with their <b>faces</b> <b>sunk</b> to the rain, and their boots squeaking in the soft, wet clay. They knew where they were going, and why, and the thought upheld them, for they were bitter at the loss of their comrades. It was a cavalry job, they knew, but the cavalry were all on with the advance, and, besides, it was more fitting that the regiment should avenge its own dead men.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{aggregate}} fluctuations in which monopolistic firms <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> costs to enter the production process and labor markets are characterized by search and matching frictions. Entrants post vacancies and are matched to idle workers. Our specification of sunk costs {{gives rise to a}} countercyclical net present value of a vacancy; it is always zero in models where entry is free. The model displays a strong degree of amplification and propagation. The time-varying value of a vacancy has implications for the surplus division between firms and workers over business cycle. In the data, we proxy this division using the ratio of corporate profits to output and workers' compensation to output. We document the cyclical behavior of profit's and labor's shares: Profit's share leads the cycle and is procyclical and more volatile than output. Labor's share inversely leads the cycle and is weakly countercyclical and smoother than output. Our model is consistent with the cross-correlations of both shares and the higher volatility of the share of profits. Regarding propagation and amplification, the model matches the persistence of vacancy creation and two-thirds of the observed volatility of market tightness relative to output. Labor market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theory and}} empirical evidence on that a forward-looking potential importer <b>facing</b> <b>sunk</b> costs {{will respond to}} expectation of future exchange rate fluctuations. It indicates the importance of sunk costs in firms' decisions to import goods. Building upon a heterogeneous-firm framework, the model makes a variety of predictions {{about the effect of}} anticipated fluctuations in the domestic currency exchange rate. First, changes in the expectation of future exchange rates lead to entry/exit of marginally productive firms, reshaping the extensive margin of imports and inducing significant changes in aggregate import values. Second, the firm level marginal benefit/loss of importing diminishes as expected appreciation/depreciation continues, due to the impact of continued entry/exit on markups. This changing marginal benefit/loss consequently weakens the adjustment of the extensive margin in the long run. Third, firms present heterogeneous responses to forward exchange rate fluctuations in the presence of sunk costs, which are related to their accessibility to credit and other firm-level characteristics including the size of sunk costs. Using disaggregated transaction level data of Chinese imports from the United States, combined with data on the US dollar-RMB future rates on the non-deliverable forward market, this paper confirms that the extensive margin of import significantly responds to forward exchange rate premiums. This paper also finds evidence on firms&apos...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relevance}} of traditional trade-exchange rate theo- rem for developing countries <b>facing</b> <b>sunk</b> entry costs in international markets. First the theorems analysing pricing of tradable goods and the trade balance dynamics following exchange rate shocks are accounted for. Second the sunk cost hysteresis model of foreign trade is described, including the possibility for hysteresis both at the microeconomic and at the macroeconomic level. Third the implications of sunk cost hysteresis for the predictions of the traditional trade-exchange rate theorems are discussed, focusing on both pricing of trad- able goods as well as short and long run trade balance dynamics following exchange rate shocks. The paper argues that the sunk cost model provides a microeconomic basis for trade dynamics that allows for non-linearities and regime switches, something often seen in empirical anlysis. The predictions of structural adjustment programs are however drawn from the traditional theorems, lacking the possibility for non-linearity. The sunk cost model is argued to push both pricing rules and trade balance dynamics closer towards the empirical record, mainly by allowing for a state-dependent relationship between exchange rates and foreign trade. When it comes to policy implica- tions the paper argues in favour of context speci. c policy interventions and against the one size. ts all approach of structural adjustment programs...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had done}} a marvellous thing--almost incredible. I have had horses bolt with me and have seen horses bolt with others many times; and every person who has seen such a thing and who knows a horse--its power and the blind mad terror it is seized with on occasions--will agree with {{me that it is}} only at the risk of his life that even a strong and agile man can attempt to stop a bolting horse. We all said that she had saved her sister's life and were lost in admiration of her deed, but {{presently}} it seemed that she would pay for it with her own life. She recovered from the faint, but from that day began a decline, until in about three months' time she appeared to me more like a ghost than a being of flesh and blood. She had not strength to cross the rooms--all her strength and life were dying out of her because of that one unnatural, almost supernatural, act. She passed the days lying on a couch, speaking, when obliged to speak, in a whisper, her eyes <b>sunk,</b> her <b>face</b> white even to the lips, seeming the whiter for the mass of loose raven-black hair in which it was set. There were few doctors, English and native, who were not first and last called into consultation over the case, and still no benefit, no return to life, but ever the slow drifting towards the end. And at the last consultation of all this happened. When it was over and the doctors were asked into a room where refreshments were placed for them, the father of the girl spoke aside to a young doctor, a stranger to him, and begged him to tell him truly if there was no hope. The other replied that he should not lose all hope if--then he paused, and when he spoke again it was to say, [...] "I am, you see, a very young man, a beginner in the profession, with little experience, and hardly know why I am called here to consult with these older and wiser men; and naturally my small voice received but little attention." ...|$|R
40|$|Models {{in which}} {{heterogeneous}} plants <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> export entry costs are standard {{tools in the}} in-ternational trade literature. How well do these models account for the observed dynamics of new exporters? We document that new exporters initially export small amounts and — conditional on continuing in the export market — grow gradually over several years. New exporters {{are most likely to}} exit the export market in their first few years. We construct a dynamic discrete choice model of exporting and find that the standard model cannot replicate the behavior of new ex-porters: New exporters grow too large too quickly and live too long. We assess the quantitative importance of accounting for new exporter dynamics by extending the model to account for these facts. In this model, the present value of exporting falls relative to the baseline model. As a result, the entry costs needed to account for the data are three times smaller than in the baseline model. We would like to thank George Alessandria, Costas Arkolakis, Roc Armenter, and Timothy J. Kehoe for helpful com-ments. We thank Mark Roberts and Jim Tybout for allowing us access to the Colombian plant data. This work was undertaken {{with the support of the}} National Science Foundation under grant SES- 0536970.

60|$|I was {{determined}} to wait up for his return, so I piled some coals upon the fire and took down a novel from the shelf. My thoughts proved {{more interesting than the}} book, however, and I threw it on one side. An indefinable feeling of anxiety and depression weighed upon me. Twelve o'clock came, and then half-past, without any sign of my friend. It was nearly one when I heard a step in the street outside, and then a knocking at the door. I was surprised, as I knew that my friend always carried a key--however, I hurried down and undid the latch. As the door flew open I knew in a moment that my worst apprehensions had been fulfilled. Barrington Cowles was leaning against the railings outside with his <b>face</b> <b>sunk</b> upon his breast, and his whole attitude expressive of the most intense despondency. As he passed in he gave a stagger, and would have fallen had I not thrown my left arm around him. Supporting him with this, and holding the lamp in my other hand, I led him slowly upstairs into our sitting-room. He sank down upon the sofa without a word. Now that I could get a good view of him, I was horrified to see the change which had come over him. His face was deadly pale, and his very lips were bloodless. His cheeks and forehead were clammy, his eyes glazed, and his whole expression altered. He looked like a man who had gone through some terrible ordeal, and was thoroughly unnerved.|$|R

Then he rose, and paced slowly {{up and down the}} room, his chin sunk upon his breast. Every now and then he would pluck at his hair, or shake his clenched hands in the air; and I saw the moisture glisten upon his brow. For a time I lost sight of him, and I heard him opening drawer after drawer, as though he were in search of something. Then he stood over by his dressing-table again, with his back turned to me. His head was thrown a little back, and he had both hands up to the collar of his shirt, as though he were striving to undo it. And then there was a gush as if a ewer had been upset, and down he sank upon the ground, with his head in the corner, twisted round at so strange an angle to his shoulders that one glimpse of it told me that my man was slipping swiftly from the clutch in which I had fancied that I held him. I slid my panel, and was in the room in an instant. His eyelids still quivered, and it seemed to me, as my gaze met his glazing eyes, that I could read both recognition and surprise in them. I laid my knife upon the floor, and I stretched myself out beside him, that I might whisper in his ear one or two little things of which I wished to remind him; but even as I did so, he gave a gasp and was gone.|$|R
