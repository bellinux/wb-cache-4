5|$|Howard {{arranges}} a {{game with}} wealthy William Jefferson <b>Slade,</b> who secures Shooter's services as dealer. Howard wins $6,000 from <b>Slade</b> over a 30-hour game, angering <b>Slade</b> and wounding his pride. That night at Slade's home, he tries to bribe Shooter into cheating in the Kid's favor when the two players meet. Shooter declines, but <b>Slade</b> calls in Shooter's markers worth $12,000, and blackmails him by threatening to reveal damaging information about Shooter's wild wife, Melba. Shooter agonizes over his decision, having spent the last 25 years building a reputation for integrity.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, the band's web site removed Rudd as the band's drummer and replaced him with <b>Slade.</b> On 9 July 2015 Rudd was denied a discharge without conviction and sentenced to eight months' home detention.|$|E

5|$|John <b>Slade</b> was a grain merchant, {{who claimed}} that Humphrey Morley had agreed to buy a crop of wheat and rye from him, paying £16, and had reneged on the agreement. He brought the case before the Assizes in 1596, where it was heard by two judges; one of the Common Pleas, {{and one of the}} King's Bench. It was heard under assumpsit, and the jury found that Morley indeed owed <b>Slade</b> money. Before a {{judgment}} could be issued, Popham had the case transferred to an older version of the Court of Exchequer Chamber, which, sitting in Serjeant's Inn, allowed the King's Bench judges to sit.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson {{studied at}} the <b>Slade</b> School of Art under Henry Tonks and {{alongside}} Stanley Spencer and Mark Gertler. When he left the <b>Slade,</b> Nevinson befriended Marinetti, {{the leader of the}} Italian Futurists, and the radical writer and artist Wyndham Lewis, who founded the short-lived Rebel Art Centre. However, Nevinson fell out with Lewis and the other 'rebel' artists when he attached their names to the Futurist movement. Lewis immediately founded the Vorticists, an avant garde group of artists and writers from which Nevinson was excluded.|$|E

5|$|In early 2009, {{before the}} release of , Summit {{confirmed}} that they would begin production on The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. Since Weitz would be in post-production for New Moon when The Twilight Saga: Eclipse began shooting, {{he would not be}} directing the third film. Instead, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse was helmed by director David <b>Slade,</b> with Melissa Rosenberg returning as screenwriter. Filming began on August 17, 2009 at Vancouver Film Studios and finished in late October, with post-production beginning early the following month. In April 2010, it was revealed that re-shoots of the film were needed. <b>Slade,</b> who previously said he would not be around for them, was seen, along with Stephenie Meyer, on set. The three main stars were also present.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records {{changed its}} name to Rockville Records. The band's first album for Rockville No Depression, was {{recorded}} over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in Boston, Massachusetts. The album's thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential Persian Gulf War military draft. Impressed by their previous work on Dinosaur Jr.'s Bug, the band wanted Paul Kolderie and Sean <b>Slade</b> to produce the album. <b>Slade</b> let Farrar play on the same 1961 Gibson Les Paul SG Junior that J. Mascis originally played on Bug. The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero's for two nights.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months before}} signing a full {{contract}} with Giant/Rockville, Uncle Tupelo recorded the tracks for No Depression over ten days in January 1990 at Fort Apache South, a musician-run {{studio in the}} Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. As the trio could not afford the cost of recording at a twenty-four track studio in nearby Cambridge, they settled on the cheaper Fort Apache studio. The album cost US$3,500 to produce, $1,000 of which went to in-house producers Sean <b>Slade</b> and Paul Q. Kolderie. The band was interested in working with <b>Slade</b> and Kolderie after hearing their production of Dinosaur Jr.'s album Bug. The producers allowed Farrar {{to use the same}} 1961 Gibson Les Paul guitar that J. Mascis used on Bug, which gave the power chords on No Depression a richer tone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Slade</b> {{tells the}} Kid that Shooter will {{continue}} to cheat for him and confronts him with a menacing thug, but the Kid flatly refuses.

50|$|When Bournemouth Council {{eventually}} {{purchased the}} land, proposals were drawn up for around 400 new dwellings ranging from bedsits {{for the elderly}} to three-bedroomed houses, the nucleus {{of which would be}} the newly-cut <b>Slade's</b> Farm Road.

5|$|Thomas <b>Slade,</b> the Surveyor of the Navy {{and former}} Master Shipwright at Deptford Dockyard, was the {{designer}} of the Venus-class of 36-gun frigates. Alongside their smaller cousin, the 32-gun Southampton class, the Venus-class represented an experiment in ship design; fast, medium-sized and heavily-armed, capable of overhauling smaller craft and single-handedly engaging enemy cruisers or large privateers. As a further innovation, <b>Slade</b> borrowed from contemporary French ship design by removing the lower deck gun ports and locating the ship's cannons solely on the upper deck. This permitted the carrying of heavier ordinance without the substantial increase in hull size {{that would have been}} required to keep the lower gun ports consistently above the waterline. The lower deck carried additional stores, enabling Venus-class frigates to remain at sea for longer periods without resupply.|$|E

She was constructed using timber sourced from the surrounding New Forest. The total cost of her construction was £38,303 15s 4d. She was commissioned on 28 March 1781 under Captain Benjamin Caldwell—a full 13 days before her launch on 10 April.|$|E

Within Tiverton, which {{acts as the}} primary town serving Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, traffic must turn to remain on Highway21.

The remaining AC/DC members finally decided on ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson.|$|E
