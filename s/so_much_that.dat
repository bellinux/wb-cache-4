5|$|According to Diddy, {{the song}} is about loving someone <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> you forget about yourself.

5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E

5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for the explosion of vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central.

5|$|Sergeant's {{books and}} David Lawson's Paul Morphy The Pride and Sorrow of Chess (New York, 1976) make {{extensive}} use of Edge's book, but note Edge's strong anti-Staunton bias.

5|$|Several {{species have}} been reintroduced to the gorge. White-tailed deer were {{imported}} from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish {{what had once been}} a thriving population. The current population of deer in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced beginning in 1906, after the lumberman had moved out of the area. The deer population has grown <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite the fears of anglers, their diet is only 5percent trout.|$|E
