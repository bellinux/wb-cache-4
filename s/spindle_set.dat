40|$|Abstract. High speed {{machining}} is {{a promising}} technology for significantly increasing productivity and reducing production costs. Development of high-speed spindle technology is strategically {{critical to the}} implementation of high speed machining. Compared to conventional spindles, and motorized spindles are equipped with built-in motors for better power transmission and balance to achieve high-speed operation. However, the built-in motor introduces additional mass to the spindle shaft, besides, since its very high working speed, some high-speed rotational effects, including centrifugal forces and gyroscopic moments on the spindle shaft can not be neglected in the analysis as is done in conventional spindle, thus complicating its mechanical-dynamic behaviors. In this paper, the FEM model of motorized <b>spindle</b> is <b>set</b> up to research on its dynamic characteristics in theory with an eye to high-speed rotational effects, including centrifugal forces and gyroscopic moments on the motorized spindle shaft.

Our first problem is due to Erdős and Szekeres, who, in 1935, made the conjecture that in a set S of 2 k− 2 + 1 points in the Euclidean plane, if no three points of S lie on the same line, then there are k points in convex position. In 2006, a computer-based proof of this conjecture for k = 6 was given by Peters and Szekeres.

40|$|To {{assemble}} mitotic spindles, cells nucleate microtubules from {{a variety}} of sources including chromosomes and centrosomes. We know little about how the regulation of microtubule nucleation contributes to spindle bipolarity and spindle size. The Aurora A kinase activator TPX 2 is required for microtubule nucleation from chromosomes as well as for spindle bipolarity. We use bacterial artificial chromosome–based recombineering to introduce point mutants that block the interaction between TPX 2 and Aurora A into human cells. TPX 2 mutants have very short spindles but, surprisingly, are still bipolar and segregate chromosomes. Examination of microtubule nucleation during spindle assembly shows that microtubules fail to nucleate from chromosomes. Thus, chromosome nucleation is not essential for bipolarity during human cell mitosis when centrosomes are present. Rather, chromosome nucleation is involved in spindle pole separation and <b>setting</b> <b>spindle</b> length.

40|$|Motorized {{high speed}} {{spindles}} with angular contact ball bearings and minimum oil lubrication may suddenly fail due to thermal problems, {{for which the}} exact reason is unknown. Currently, internal temperatures, internal heat flow, thermal preload and stiffness changes {{in this type of}} spindle cannot be predicted with sufficient accuracy, and there are observations that cannot be fully explained by previous models. It is believed that the understanding of thermal and mechanical interactions between different spindle components in a practical spindle system is the key to improving spindle performance and reliability. This research proposes to develop an integrated thermo-mechanical model to account for all heat sources, heat transfer paths, heat sinks, and relative thermal expansions of the spindle system. The temperature field of the entire spindle is predicted by an axisymmetric finite difference model. The model includes linear heat conduction and nonlinear convection and can efficiently solve for the temperature growth of each element. The model accuracy is then validated by comprehensive experiments through accurate temperature and heat flux measurements. Finally, the predicted temperature field is used to determine the mechanical behavior changes in component fit conditions, stiffness, bearing preload, natural frequency, etc. Quantitative relations for temperatures, internal heat flow, thermal preload and spindle stiffness as functions of <b>spindle</b> speed, <b>set</b> cooling conditions and the rigidity of the preloading mechanism have been established. Sensitivity to changes of speed and cooling conditions was also investigated. These results reveal some new observations of spindle behavior that were not reported before. Temperatures of the spindle shaft at high speed are strongly dependent on convective heat flow to surrounding fluids. Also, it was possible to identify temperature oscillations of the bearings under certain operating conditions. The model can be used for diagnosis or design and aims at helping to reduce premature spindle failure and to avoid changing bearing stiffness during machining. ...|$|R
40|$|In humans, some {{evidence}} {{suggests that there are}} two different types of spindles during sleep, which differ by their scalp topography and possibly some aspects of their regulation. To test for the existence of two different spindle types, we characterized the activity associated with slow (11 - 13 Hz) and fast (13 - 15 Hz) spindles, identified as discrete events during non-rapid eye movement sleep, in non-sleep-deprived human volunteers, using simultaneous electroencephalography and functional MRI. An activation pattern common to both spindle types involved the thalami, paralimbic areas (anterior cingulate and insular cortices), and superior temporal gyri. No thalamic difference was detected in the direct comparison between slow and fast spindles although some thalamic areas were preferentially activated in relation to either spindle type. Beyond the common activation pattern, the increases in cortical activity differed significantly between the two spindle types. Slow spindles were associated with increased activity in the superior frontal gyrus. In contrast, fast <b>spindles</b> recruited a <b>set</b> of cortical regions involved in sensorimotor processing, as well as the mesial frontal cortex and hippocampus.

40|$|SummaryJust as {{the size}} of an {{organism}} is carefully controlled, {{the size of}} intracellular structures must also be regulated. The mitotic spindle is a supramolecular machine that generates the forces which separate sister chromatids during mitosis [1]. Although spindles show little size variation between cells of the same type, spindle length can vary at least 10 -fold between different species [2]. Recent experiments on spindle length showed that in embryonic systems spindle length varied with blastomere size [3]. Furthermore, a comparison between two Xenopus species showed that spindle length was dependent on some cytoplasmic factor [4]. These data point toward mechanisms to scale spindle length with cell size. Centrosomes {{play an important role in}} organizing microtubules during spindle assembly [5]. Here we use Caenorhabditis elegans to study the role of centrosomes in <b>setting</b> <b>spindle</b> length. We show that spindle length correlates with centrosome size through development and that a reduction of centrosome size by molecular perturbation reduces spindle length. By systematically analyzing centrosome proteins, we show that spindle length does not depend on microtubule density at centrosomes.

40|$|Authors: Bryan Zimdahl, Jeevisha Bajaj & Tannishtha Reya ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{describes a}} strategy to image spindle orientation during cell division in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in real time. This live imaging method was a modification of a method previously used to visualize the spindle using epithelial cell lines (reference 1). This protocol also describes {{a strategy to}} track {{the orientation of the}} mitotic spindle coordinately with inheritance of the cell fate determinant Numb in real time. ### Introduction During asymmetric cell division, a dividing cell asymmetrically segregates fate determinants (i. e. Numb) so that the daughter cells inherit different levels, thus generating daughter cells that adopt distinct cell fates. To facilitate differential inheritance of fate determinants into the two incipient daughters cells, the dividing mother cell must orient the mitotic spindle precisely along the axis of asymmetry. To determine whether a gene may be involved in this process, it may be useful to test whether gain- or loss-of-function of the gene affects spindle orientation during cell division in real time. ### Materials 1. Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Gibco, Life Technologies) - Fetal Bovine Serum (Gemini Bio-Products) - FACS Antibodies: 145 - 2 C 11 (CD 3 ε), GK 1. 5 (CD 4), 53 - 6. 7 (CD 8), RB 6 - 8 C 5 (Ly- 6 G/Gr 1), M 1 / 70 (CD 11 b/Mac- 1), TER 119 (Ly- 76 /TER 119), 6 B 2 (CD 45 R/B 220), MB 19 - 1 (CD 19), 2 B 8 (CD 117 /c-kit), D 7 (Ly- 6 A/E/Sca- 1). All antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmigen, eBioscience or BioLegend. - RBC Lysis Buffer (eBioscience) - X-Vivo 15 (Lonza) - 2 -Mercaptoethanol (Gibco) - Stem Cell Factor (SCF; 100 ng/ml, R&D; Systems) - Thrombopoietin (TPO; 20 ng/ml, R&D; Systems) - Iscove’s modified medium-based methylcellulose medium (Methocult M 3434, StemCell Technologies). - 4 -OH tamoxifen (Sigma) - Chambered coverglass slides (Lab-Tek II®, Thermo Scientific) - Retronectin® (Takara Bio Inc.) ### Procedure Determining Numb inheritance in hematopoietic stem cells in real time. 1. Isolate and sort bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) -enriched cells (c-kit+ Lin- Sca- 1 +; KLS) from adult mice. - Culture cells overnight (~ 16 hrs) in X-Vivo™ 15 media (Lonza) supplemented with 50 μM 2 -mercaptoethanol, 10 % (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum, SCF (100 ng/ml, R&D; Systems) and thrombopoietin (20 ng/ml, R&D; Systems). - Infect cells with retroviruses: Numb:CFP and mCherry-α-tubulin; 48 hours after infection, harvest cells and re-sort for CFP+ mCherry+ cells. Note: Numb:CFP is specifically used since it allows clear detection of distinct levels of Numb. In contrast, we found that Numb-YFP leads to highly saturated expression of YFP and does not allow easy identification of low and high expressing daughter cells. 4. To prepare cells for imaging, plate cells in Iscove’s modified medium-based methylcellulose medium (Methocult M 3434, StemCell Technologies) supplemented with 4 -OH tamoxifen (Sigma). - Note: 4 -OH tamoxifen (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol at 1 mg/ml (1000 X), and a 1 X solution was made immediately before treatment. Note: Tamoxifen is needed only if the CreER-LoxP system is being used. - Imaging: Using an Axio Observer. Z 1 microscope with the LSM 700 scanning module (Zeiss), collect images every 3 - 4 minutes with xyzt acquisition mode. Maintain cultures at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2 using a Heating Insert P Lab-Tek S 1 with an Incubator PM S 1 (Zeiss). - Note: If 405 laser is used to excite Numb::CFP, identify cells with a mitotic <b>spindle</b> before starting <b>setting</b> up time-lapse imaging. This is essential since primary hematopoietic stem cells die upon prolonged exposure to this laser. - Determining Numb inheritance: - a. Identify dividing cells in movie replay. - b. Visualize cells in spectrum color format (where red indicates pronounced α-tubulin expression and centrosome location) to readily identify the centrosomes. - c. Using ImageJ software, draw a line connecting the two centrosomes of a cell (Line 1). Subsequently, draw an additional line perpendicular to Line 1, which marks the cleavage furrow and partitions the mother cell into incipient daughter cell 1 (D 1) and daughter cell 2 (D 2). - d. Using ImageJ software, determine fluorescence intensity of Numb for D 1 and D 2. - Note: In fixed cell-based experiments, Numb was found to be ~ 1. 8 -fold higher in progentiors than in HSCs. Thus, incipient daughters that expressed at least a 1. 8 -fold difference in Numb expression were scored as an asymmetric Numb inheritance. Real time imaging strategy to determine spindle orientation in dividing hematopoietic stem cells. 1. Isolate and sort bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) -enriched cells (c-kit+ Lin- Sca- 1 +; KLS) from adult mice. - Culture cells overnight (~ 16 hrs) in X-Vivo™ 15 media (Lonza) supplemented with 50 μM 2 -mercaptoethanol, 10 % (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum, SCF (100 ng/ml, R&D; Systems) and thrombopoietin (20 ng/ml, R&D; Systems). - Infect cells with retroviruses: MSCV-H 2 B-GFP and mCherry-α-tubulin; 48 hours after infection, harvest cells and re-sort for GFP+ mCherry+ KLS cells. - Culture cells in 96 -well U-bottomed plates (BD Biosciences) for 48 hrs with 4 -OH tamoxifen (Sigma) - Note: 4 -OH tamoxifen (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol at 1 mg/ml (1000 X), and a 1 X solution was made immediately before treatment. Note: Tamoxifen is needed only if the CreER-LoxP system is being used. - To prepare cells for imaging, place cells on chambered coverglass slides (Lab-Tek II®, Thermo Scientific) coated with 0. 1 μg/μl Retronectin® (Takara Bio Inc.) in the continual presence of 4 -OH tamoxifen. - Imaging: Using an Axio Observer. Z 1 microscope with the LSM 700 scanning module (Zeiss), collect images every 3 - 4 minutes with xyzt acquisition mode. Maintain cultures at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2 using a Heating Insert P Lab-Tek S 1 with an Incubator PM S 1 (Zeiss). - Measuring spindle orientation: - a. Identify mitotic cells in movie replay. To measure spindle angle, generate a concatenation of Z-stack images of each cell at every measured time point from the start of metaphase to early telophase and display all images in orthogonally view using Zen 2010 software. - b. Using ImageJ software, measure the angle formed between the substratum plane (Retronectin base) and the virtual line passing through spindle poles. ### References 1. Toyoshima, F. & Nishida, E.
