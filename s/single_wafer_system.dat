Backside particle removal efficiency (PRE) of> 95 % at ≥ 65 nm for Si 3 N 4 particles was achieved with DIW only, demonstrating enhanced particle removal at both smaller and larger particle sizes with full coverage megasonics.

Process development and comprehensive investigations of operating and etching behaviour have been undertaken for this machine. In this paper, the influence of different cathode cover materials on the etching performance will be presented. In the case of silicon etching with pure SF 6 emission spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry have been applied to reveal densities of neutral particles and ions in the etch plasma under various operating conditions and for commonly used cathode cover materials (i. e. coated alumina, stainless steel, quartz, ARDEL, MACOR). On the other hand etched structures have been investigated by SEM to comment on anisotropy of the etch process, and etchrate measurements have been performed. The results elucidate {{the important role of}} non-inert cathode cove ring materials, as supplier of etch species and as a consumer of them as well. Consequently a strong loading effect is found, depending on both the size of the etched areas and cover material.

40|$|Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) {{processes}} {{constitute an}} important unit operation for micro electronic device fabrication in the semiconductor industry. Simulators of the deposition process are powerful tools {{for understanding the}} transport and reaction conditions inside the deposition chamber {{and can be used}} to optimize and control the deposition process. This thesis discusses the development of a set of object-oriented modular simulation tools for solving lumped and spatially distributed models generated from chemical process design and simulation problems. The application of object-oriented design and modular approach greatly reduces the software development cycle time associated with designing process systems and improves the overall efficiency of the simulation process. The framework facilitates an evolutionary approach to simulator development, starting with a simple process description and building model complexity and testing modeling hypothesis in a step-by-step manner. Modularized components can be easily assembled to form a modeling system for a desired process. The framework also brings a fresh approach to many traditional scientific computing procedures to make a greater range of computational tools available for solving engineering problems. Two examples of tungsten chemical vapor deposition simulation are presented to illustrate the capability of the tools developed to facilitate an evolutionary simulation approach. The first example demonstrates how the framework is applied for solving systems assembled from separate modules by simulating a tungsten CVD deposition process occurring in a <b>single</b> <b>wafer</b> LPCVD <b>system</b> both at steady-state and dynamically over a true processing cycle. The second example considers the development of a multi-segment simulator describing the gas concentration profiles in the newly designed Programmable CVD reactor system.

The <b>single</b> <b>wafer</b> approach allows for faster wafer processing and better control of process parameters on the wafer. As feature sizes become smaller, and wafer uniformity demands become more stringent, there is an increased demand from rapid thermal (RT) equipment manufacturers to improve control, uniformity and repeatability of processes on wafers.
