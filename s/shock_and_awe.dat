5000|$|Tharpes {{appearances}} {{with the}} jazz artist Cab Calloway at Harlems Cotton Club in October 1938 and in John Hammonds [...] "Spirituals to Swing" [...] concert at Carnegie Hall on December 23, 1938, gained her more fame, along with notoriety. These performances, which both <b>shocked</b> <b>and</b> <b>awed</b> the crowds, were controversial {{as well as}} revolutionary in several respects. Performing gospel music for secular nightclub audiences and alongside blues and jazz musicians and dancers was unusual, and in conservative religious circles a woman playing the guitar in such settings was frowned upon. For these reasons, Tharpe fell out of favor with segments of the gospel community. Her recordings of [...] "This Train" [...] and [...] "Rock Me", which combined gospel themes with bouncy up-tempo arrangements, were hits in the late 1930s with audiences having little previous exposure to gospel music.|$|R
5000|$|Rob O'Connor of Spin wrote: [...] "Michael Gira still {{explores the}} drones and {{grinding}} rhythms that he recorded with legendary art-punk band Swans, {{but on this}} album with collective Angels of Light, the singer/songwriter focuses on whiplash juxtapositions of sound and style," [...] while also adding that [...] "he cuts and pastes his skewed vision of a Nick Cave-flavored Americana where mandolin and hammer dulcimer rumble with a devilish mariachi band down a dark backstreet." [...] Mike Schiller of PopMatters stated: [...] "Despite all of the <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> the <b>awe,</b> once We Are Him does settle into repeated listening, it never quite reaches the consistent, memorable heights of ...Other People." [...] Andrew Gaerig of Stylus described the record as [...] "an album once again stuffed with villainous, masochistic glee." ...|$|R
60|$|Malcolm {{could not}} rest. He was feverish with the <b>shock</b> of grief <b>and</b> <b>awe,</b> <b>and</b> {{absorbed in the}} thought which had {{mastered}} him, and which was much dwelt on in the middle ages:--the monastic path, going towards heaven straight as a sunbeam; the secular, twining its way through a tortuous difficult course--the 'broad way,' tending downward to the abyss. To his terrified apprehension, he had abandoned the direct and narrow path for the fatal road, and there might at any moment be captured, and whirled away by the grisly phantom Death, who had just snatched the mightiest in his inevitable clutch; and with something of the timidity of his nature, he was in absolute terror, until {{he should be able}} to set himself back on the shining road from which he had swerved, and be rid of the load of transgression which seemed ready to sink him into the gulf.|$|R
25|$|Moore's law has {{affected}} the performance of other technologies significantly: Michael S. Malone wrote of a Moore's War following the apparent success of <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> {{in the early days}} of the Iraq War. Progress in the development of guided weapons depends on electronic technology. Improvements in circuit density and low-power operation associated with Moore's law also have contributed to the development of technologies including mobile telephones and 3-D printing.|$|E
25|$|Before the invasion, many {{observers}} had expected a lengthy campaign of aerial bombing before any ground action, taking as examples the 1991 Persian Gulf War or the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to decapitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see <b>Shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe),</b> attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The {{assumption was that}} superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces {{would allow them to}} attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{acknowledges}} that Avatar implicitly criticizes the United States' {{role in the}} Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference {{to the use of}} the term <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> in the film, Cameron said, [...] "We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] He said in later interviews, [...] "...I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled..." [...] and, [...] "The film is definitely not anti-American." ...|$|E
60|$|I am growing an old fellow, {{and have}} seen many great {{folks in the}} course of my travels and time: Louis Philippe coming out of the Tuileries; his Majesty the King of Prussia and the Reichsverweser accolading each other at Cologne at my elbow; Admiral Sir Charles Napier (in an omnibus once), the Duke of Wellington, the immortal Goethe at Weimar, the late benevolent Pope Gregory XVI., and a score more of the famous in this world--the whom {{whenever}} one looks at, one has a mild <b>shock</b> of <b>awe</b> <b>and</b> tremor. I like this feeling and decent fear and trembling with which a modest spirit salutes a GREAT MAN.|$|R
30|$|As {{would be}} expected, admiration, adoration, <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> {{overlapped}} substantially. Therefore, I determined whether {{some of the}} reported associations were unique to admiration, adoration, or awe by computing partial correlations controlling for the other two emotions (e.g., partial correlations of admiration controlling for adoration <b>and</b> <b>awe).</b> As {{can be seen in}} TableÂ  1 (above the diagonal), differences between admiration and adoration became more evident when looking at their unique associations. After controlling for adoration <b>and</b> <b>awe,</b> admiration showed a unique positive association with envy (Hypothesis 6). Adoration was negatively related to envy once admiration <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> were partialled out. Admiration demonstrated a unique positive association with personal growth (Hypothesis 7). Adoration demonstrated a unique positive association with purpose in life (Hypothesis 8).|$|R

500|$|The {{performance}} of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] {{at the very}} first MTV Video Music Awards is considered by MTV as one of [...] "one of the most iconic pop performances of all time". Christina Garibaldi from the channel noted that the performance [...] "helped make the Video Music Awards a household name... and simultaneously set the bar for every other performer to come after her. From that point forward, every artist, {{when they hit the}} VMA stage, wanted to have a performance you would forever be talking about." [...] According to Joe Lynch from Billboard, the song's performance at the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour [...] "opened the gates for everyone from Marilyn Manson to Miley Cyrus to <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> on stage in the decades to come." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} {{was met with}} polarized reviews. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph named it [...] "inarguably another fantastic display of showbiz <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> from a mistress of the form." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times named it [...] "the show's blasphemy quota", while Michael Hamersly of Miami Herald called it an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance. Lindsay Zoladz of Vulture opined that it was [...] "ne of the most disappointing moments of the night". Jordan Zivitz of The Montreal Gazette opined: [...] "Twenty-six years after 'Like a Prayer' video scandalized the Vatican and parents who relied on MTV as a cheap babysitter, the sight of dancers twisting down steel crucifixes while Madonna snapped 'bitch, get off my pole' in 'Holy Water' was hopefully intended to be comical".|$|E
500|$|On tour {{following}} {{the release of}} Dog Beats, Insane Clown Posse was scheduled to perform at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan, but were delayed by a blizzard. After they arrived, the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss. Bruce remembers that [...] "e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people were staring at us in amazement and bewilderment. They {{must have been in}} <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe.</b> We finished our two-song set, and the crowd...didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned"; they later learned that the concert was supposed to occur earlier in the evening, and that they were performing in the wrong building.|$|E

40|$|Simulations and {{experiments}} on {{three kinds of}} Si tip fabrication techniques had been done, which are Anisotropic Dry Etching (ADE), Anisotropic Wet Etching (<b>AWE)</b> <b>and</b> <b>AWE</b> combining with bonding. The simulation {{results showed that the}} parameters applied in the ADE <b>and</b> <b>AWE</b> should be controlled much more precisely than AWE combining with bonding to get expected tips. The experiments prove that the parameters of fabricating silicon tip by ADE <b>and</b> <b>AWE</b> have little tolerance. The conclusions on AWE combining with bonding drew from simulations are verified in the detail experiments. From the simulations and experiments, excellent reliability and controllability are witnessed in AWE combining with bonding and a tip with top diameter within 23. 44 nm had been achieved...|$|R
500|$|Also seeing {{improvement}} was Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad, commenting [...] "Tonight's episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science, {{and this is}} the first time I can really say I'm looking forward to the next episode. It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment." [...] Less impressed was Noel Murray of The Onions A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, [...] "'The Arrival' was the weirdest episode of Fringe yetâa deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't think of any questions that [...] "The Arrival" [...] satisfactorily answeredânot even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> factor of [...] "The Arrival" [...] was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and hardly the satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tim Stack {{analyzed}} it as [...] "breathy with a propulsive beat" [...] and [...] "exactly how I like my Jsquared," [...] calling Jackson [...] "the comeback {{story of}} 2008." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club considered it [...] "a slight digital jam" [...] which masks Jackson among [...] "uncertain vocal tones and incongruous lines about guitars." [...] IGN called Jackson's vocals a [...] "metallic mess" [...] but {{goes on to}} say that the song is saved by a [...] "mediocre hook" [...] and a [...] "fuzzy dance beat." [...] The New York Times referred to the track as [...] "blippy and propulsive," [...] stating that it offers [...] "more proof that for Ms. Jackson, sex really doesnât sell." [...] PopMatters called it [...] "energetic" [...] and a [...] "club-ready track perfect for both Janet's celebrated choreography and flirty vocal stylings," [...] adding [...] "she opts to forgo any <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> moments," [...] repeating the lines, [...] "sexy, sexy, sexy" [...] to grab your interests, versus a full onslaught of visceral come on's." [...] The Boston Globe called it [...] "droid-like," [...] built on [...] "metaphors and analogies." ...|$|E
500|$|Jack Foley of IndieLondon {{rated the}} first episodes four stars out of five, stating that it [...] "made for {{exciting}} viewing {{even if the}} politics and the script sometimes proved laughably gung-ho and naive." [...] On review {{on the first two}} episodes, Jane Simon of The Mirror has said that between the cast, [...] "there's enough <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> to make you very glad they're showing this in a double bill." [...] Gerard Gilbert of The Arts Desk dubbed Strike Back as [...] "thin and lightweight next to [...] Spooks", and although [...] "not unexciting", Gilbert did not find the series interesting. Andrea Mullaney of The Scotsman was positive about the casting, and the changes in storyline from the original novel, though the series was aimed [...] "squarely at the blokey viewer who'd rather watch paint dry than a costume drama." [...] Whilst also reviewing Luther and Lewis, John Lloyd of The Financial Times called it [...] "fine for tension," [...] "good on sub-Bond dialogue" [...] and that the story lines make Spooks look true to life. Lloyd also called Richard Armitage [...] "one of the best action men on television." ...|$|E

500|$|Ranaut is {{considered}} a sex symbol and a style icon in India. Analysing Ranaut's off-screen persona, Hindustan Times published that she was initially written off by Indian journalists due to her [...] "funny accent" [...] and the negative publicity generated by her troubled relationships; however, her defining fashion choices and her unconventional film roles eventually established her as a star. Ranaut has frequently featured in listings of the most attractive and stylish celebrities in India. She ranked among the top 10 on The Times of Indias listing of the [...] "Most Desirable Woman" [...] in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015. Ranaut was featured on Verves listing {{of the most powerful}} women of 2010 and in 2012 she was named the [...] "Best Dressed Personality" [...] by the Indian edition of People magazine. In 2013, Ranaut featured as one of the best-dressed women celebrities by Vogue India. The journalist Jagmeeta Thind Joy credits the actress for her [...] "quirky, almost non-Bollywood take on personal style", adding that she [...] "likes to <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> with her choices".

Brooks' criticism is that <b>Shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>Awe</b> tactics are essentially a relic of Cold War strategies for fighting the Soviet Union in the Fulda Gap of West Germany, and are not effective for combating guerrilla fighters in protracted insurgencies. Particularly, Brooks' point is that the entire concept of <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> is rendered moot when one is facing enemy combatants who have no fear of death, be they zombies, kamikaze pilots, or suicide bombers.|$|E
