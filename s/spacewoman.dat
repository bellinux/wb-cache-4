Humans have explored many worlds {{in a number of}} different galaxies. Their quest is for knowledge and to be helpful: there is a strict rule against 'interference'.|$|E
50|$|MacArthur's tearful video diaries {{recording}} the sailing adversities she faced inspired the caricature of {{her on the}} BBC satirical comedy show Dead Ringers. In Episode 5 of Series 1 of a BBC Sci-fi sitcom, Hyperdrive, a MacArthur-like character, Clare Winchester, a round-the-galaxy solo <b>spacewoman</b> played by Sally Phillips, is parodied with references to video diaries, a diminishing grip on reality and friendlessness.|$|E
50|$|When {{the evil}} alien Zanon comes to enslave Earth, all hope seems lost. The Earth's {{resident}} superheroes, the <b>Spacewomen,</b> are powerless to stop him. They must enlist {{the help of}} a young boy who has a special connection with the giant turtle Gamera. The Friend of All Children then battles Gyaos (a huge vampire bat/pterosaur hybrid), Zigra (an alien shark), Viras (a alien squid), Jiger (a female giant prehistoric dinosaur), Guiron (a knife-headed alien monster) and finally Barugon (an enormous lizard whose tongue sprays a freezing gas that can freeze things solid and whose back spines emit a powerful rainbow ray that can melt or dissolve any solid object). Gamera sacrifices his life in the end to destroy Zanon once and for all and protect Earth.|$|R

They must clear eight worlds of increasing difficulty (each one is composed of five regular floors and one boss floor) by using their wave guns to destroy all the enemies populating them.

50|$|Planet Comics was the {{foremost}} purveyor of good girl art in comic {{books of the}} period, and is considered highly collectible by modern fans of comics' Golden Age. It specialized in colorful and lurid stories of interstellar action, ingenuous and attractive heroes and heroines, breezy dialogue, and the “barest smattering of sense and substance” (Benton 1992, p. 27). Its covers usually featured a beautiful, scantily-attired <b>spacewoman</b> with long bare legs being menaced by a frightful alien monster, while a sleek, heroic spaceman comes to her rescue.|$|E
50|$|Later works {{included}} more historical novels The Bull Calves (1947) about the Jacobite rising of 1745 and The Young Alexander the Great (1960). She also turned to fantasy such as Graeme and the Dragon (1954) (Graeme Mitchison was her grandson through Denis); science fiction such as Memoirs of a <b>Spacewoman</b> (1962) and Solution Three (1975); fantasy {{such as the}} humorous Arthurian novel To the Chapel Perilous (1955), non-fiction such as African Heroes (1968), together with children's novels, poetry, travel and a three-volume autobiography. She was never certain of {{the actual number of}} books she had written (often claiming there were about 70). The articles were uncountable, from book reviews for the old Time and Tide magazine and the New Statesman to practical essays on farming, campaigning articles, recollections and reflections.|$|E
