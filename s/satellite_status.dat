50|$|Scheliha {{was born}} in Zessel, Oels, Silesia (now Cieśle, Gmina Oleśnica, Poland), {{as the son of}} a Prussian squire. He served as an army officer in World War I, studied law and joined the German Foreign Service in 1922. As a member of the German Embassy in Warsaw he became aware of the atrocities {{committed}} {{in the name of the}} Third Reich under the Nazi regime. In 1937, Scheliha who by this time had risen to become the First Secretary at the German embassy in Warsaw began working for the Soviet secret police, the NKVD. Scheliha's motivation for espionage were entirely financial as he had a lifestyle beyond his salary as he liked to keep several mistresses at once, and he found that selling state secrets to the Soviet Union was the best way of providing the additional income he needed. Scheliha had no ideological opposition to the National Socialist regime, and the only reason why he spied for the Soviet Union was entirely due to his greed. Scheliha was well paid for his work, and in February 1938, an Soviet agent deposited $6, 500 U.S. dollars in his bank account in Zurich, making him the best paid Soviet agent in the world. It was due to intelligence sold by Scheliha that the Soviet Union was very well informed about the state of German-Polish relations in 1937-39 and that starting in October 1938 that the Reich wanted to reduce Poland down to a <b>satellite</b> <b>status.</b> Starting in March 1939, Scheliha sold documents to the NKVD showing that since Poland refused to sign the Anti-Comintern pact, that Germany was planning on invading Poland later that year. Most crucially, Scheliha provided the Soviets with documents showing that the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop had ordered the German ambassador to Poland, Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke not to engage in talks about the status of the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdansk, Poland) as the Danzig issue was merely a pretext for a war, and Ribbentrop was afraid if talks began, the Poles might give in. After the outbreak of World War II, he tried to help his Polish and Jewish friends and attempted to make the world aware of the impending systematic murder of the Jewish people. Suspected by the Gestapo for his critical attitude, he was charged with being a member of the Red Orchestra, sentenced to death by hanging, and executed in Plötzensee Prison.|$|E

40|$|We map the coseismic {{deformation}} of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake {{with data from}} three descending Envisat/ASAR tracks and six ascending ALOS/PALSAR tracks that cover most of northeastern Japan. Due to the inaccurate estimation of the <b>satellite</b> <b>status,</b> orbital ramps commonly exist in the coseismic interferograms, which resulted in inconsistency among the deformation maps released by several research groups. In this letter, calibration has been performed to accurately remove these ramps by a 2 -D quadratic-phase model derived based on GPS measurements from the ARIA team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech. The average RMS of the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements, as compared with GPS measurements at the validation stations, has decreased from 17. 8 to 7. 7 cm after the orbital ramp correction is made, indicating that much more accurate InSAR measurements are achieved. The corrected coseismic deformation from the InSAR measurements is consistent with not only the GPS observations at the individual GPS stations {{but also with the}} coseismic deformation interferogram from interpolated GPS observation in the SAR viewing directions.

40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} {{role played by}} {{satellite}} cells in the adaptive response to exercise in human skeletal muscle has just begun. The development of reliable markers for the identification of <b>satellite</b> cell <b>status</b> (quiescence/activation/proliferation) {{is an important step}} towards the understanding of satellite cell behaviour in exercised human muscles. It is hypothesised currently that exercise in humans can induce (1) the activation of satellite cells without proliferation, (2) proliferation and withdrawal from differentiation, (3) proliferation and differentiation to provide myonuclei and (4) proliferation and differentiation to generate new muscle fibres or to repair segmental fibre injuries. In humans, the satellite cell pool can increase as early as 4 days following a single bout of exercise and is maintained at higher level following several weeks of training. Cessation of training is associated with a gradual reduction of the previously enhanced satellite cell pool. In the elderly, training counteracts the normal decline in satellite cell number seen with ageing. When the transcriptional activity of existing myonuclei reaches its maximum, daughter cells generated by satellite cell proliferation are involved in protein synthesis by enhancing the number of nuclear domains. Clearly, delineating the events and the mechanisms behind the activation of satellite cells both under physiological and pathological conditions in human skeletal muscles remains an important challenge...|$|R
