5000|$|<b>Split</b> leather is leather {{created from}} the fibrous {{part of the}} hide left once the top-grain of the rawhide has been {{separated}} from the hide. During the <b>splitting</b> operation, the top-grain and drop <b>split</b> are separated. The drop <b>split</b> can be further <b>split</b> (thickness allowing) into a middle <b>split</b> and a flesh <b>split.</b> In very thick hides, the middle <b>split</b> can be separated into multiple layers until the thickness prevents further <b>splitting.</b> <b>Split</b> leather then has an artificial layer applied {{to the surface of}} the <b>split</b> and is embossed with a leather grain (bycast leather). <b>Splits</b> are also used to create suede. The strongest suedes are usually made from grain <b>splits</b> (that have the grain completely removed) or from the flesh <b>split</b> that has been shaved to the correct thickness. Suede is [...] "fuzzy" [...] on both sides. Manufacturers use a variety of techniques to make suede from full-grain. A reversed suede is a grained leather that has been designed into the leather article with the grain facing away from the visible surface. It is not considered a true suede.|$|R
40|$|Stock <b>splits</b> are a {{relatively}} new phenomenon in the Indian context. This paper examines the market effect of stock <b>splits</b> on stock price, return, volatility, and trading volume around the <b>split</b> ex-dates for a sample of stock <b>splits</b> undertaken in the Indian stock market over the period 1999 – 2005. The traditional view of stock <b>splits</b> as cosmetic transactions that simply divide the same pie into more slices is inconsistent with the significant wealth effect associated with the announcement of a stock <b>split.</b> However, the empirical evidence confirms {{a negative effect on}} price and return of stock <b>splits.</b> The overall cumulative abnormal returns after the <b>split</b> are negative. These results suggest that stock <b>splits</b> have induced the market to revise its optimistic valuation about future firm performance, rejecting signaling hypothesis to which <b>splits</b> convey positive information to markets. Hence, stock <b>splits</b> have reduced the wealth of the shareholders. The results also show that presence of a positive effect on volatility and trading volume following the <b>split</b> events, thus suggesting that <b>split</b> events enhance liquidity.

40|$|Background: Control of {{the medium}} {{osmolarity}} and temperature during long or short time sperm manipulation is essential. Objective: The objectives {{of the present study}} were to find the effects of different osmolarities of modified Tyrode's solution and milk on the bull sperm during incubation at above zero temperatures. Materials and Methods: Semen samples were collected twice from five Najdi bull. Centrifuged and most parts of seminal plasma were removed. First experiment: The concentrated semen were <b>splited</b> into nine aliquots to incubate in three different osmolarities (200, 300 and 400 mOsm) at three temperatures (5, 25 and 39 °C) for 15 and 60 min of incubation. Second experiment: The semen samples were <b>splited,</b> mixed with the same volume of whole cow milk (5 and 25 °C) and milk with 7 % glycerol (5 °C) and incubated for 15 and 60 min. Results: Sperm motility severely affected (p 0. 05) by increasing temperature during 1 h of incubation. Milk can protect the sperm viability and motility at cool conditions and there is no beneficial effect of glycerol in combination of milk on sperm incubation at above zero temperatures (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Iso- and hyper-osmotic solutions protect bull sperm motility and viability at 25 and 39 °C, while milk can be used for protecting sperm at 5 °C...|$|E
