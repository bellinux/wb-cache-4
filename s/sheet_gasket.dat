5000|$|When a {{sheet of}} {{material}} has the gasket shape [...] "punched out" [...] of it, it is a <b>sheet</b> <b>gasket.</b> This {{can lead to a}} crude, fast and cheap gasket. In previous times the material was compressed asbestos, but in modern times a fibrous material such as graphite is used. These gaskets can fill various different chemical requirements based on the inertness of the material used. Non-asbestos gasket sheet is durable, of multiple materials, and thick in nature. Material examples are mineral, carbon or nitrile synthetic rubber. Applications using sheet gaskets involve acids, corrosive chemicals, steam or mild caustics. Flexibility and good recovery prevent breakage during installation of a <b>sheet</b> <b>gasket.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Sheet</b> <b>gaskets</b> are simple, {{they are}} {{cut to size}} either with bolt holes or without holes for {{standard}} sizes with various thickness and material suitable to media and temperature pressure of pipeline.|$|R
40|$|Bolted flange {{connections}} with metal gasket {{have been used}} at higher pressure under higher temperature condition. Assembly procedures and tightening methods the connections including some types of metal gasket is empirically. Generally, {{it is known that}} the bolt preload which is required for satisfying an indicated leak rate in the connections including the metal gasket is not higher than that of the connections including <b>sheet</b> <b>gaskets</b> and spiral wound gaskets. However, no research for the evaluating the sealing performance in the bolted {{flange connections}} with metal gaskets has been conducted. In this paper, the leakage tests for the bolted flange connections with the metal flat gasket were conducted in the case where the maximum internal pressure of 7 MPa and a bending moment are applied, where the leak rate is measured using the pressure dro...|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea behind}} solid {{material}} {{is to use}} metals which cannot be punched out of sheets but are still cheap to produce. These gaskets generally have a much higher level of quality control than <b>sheet</b> <b>gaskets</b> and generally can withstand much higher temperatures and pressures. The key downside is that a solid metal must be greatly compressed {{in order to become}} flush with the flange head and prevent leakage. The material choice is more difficult; because metals are primarily used, process contamination and oxidation are risks. An additional downside is that the metal used must be softer than the flange [...] - [...] {{in order to ensure that}} the flange does not warp and thereby prevent sealing with future gaskets. Even so, these gaskets have found a niche in industry.|$|R
50|$|Silicone foam is a {{synthetic}} rubber product used in <b>gasketing,</b> <b>sheets</b> and firestops. It {{is available in}} solid, cured form {{as well as in}} individual liquid components for field installations.|$|R
50|$|During his teens, John {{constructed}} various devices {{including a}} spark-gap device, a batteryless crystal radio, a six-inch telescope, and an underwater 'diving helmet' constructed of a cookie can with plastic <b>sheet</b> bolted and <b>gasketed</b> for vision, {{powered by a}} garden hose and three tire pumps ganged together.|$|R
50|$|The {{company and}} its {{subsidiaries}} make a range of sealing products, including <b>gaskets,</b> <b>gasket</b> <b>sheets,</b> high-tech O-rings, molded packings and seals for reciprocating pumps, hydraulics, mechanical seals, braided packings, and custom rubber-molded products. They also offer repairs for mechanical seals. Most of the company's products have short product lifecycles so must be replenished periodically to prevent tools from not working.|$|R
40|$|Leakage in Gasketed Flanged Joints (GFJs) {{have always}} been a great problem for the process industry. The sealing {{performance}} of a GFJ depends on its installation and applied loading conditions. This paper aims to finding the leak rate through ANSI class# 150 flange joints using a compressed asbestos <b>sheet</b> (CAS) <b>gasket</b> under combined structural and thermal transient loading conditions using two different leak rate models and two different bolt-up levels. The first model is a Gasket Compressive Strain model in which strains are determined using finite element analysis. The other model is based on Porous Media Theory in which gasket is considered as porous media. Leakage rates are determined using both leak rate models and are compared against appropriate tightness classes and the effectiveness of each approach is presented...|$|R
