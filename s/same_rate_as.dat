5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} {{held the}} office of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence {{for this is that}} after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire at the <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> <b>as</b> his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held {{the office of}} forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E

5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle at the <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> <b>as</b> before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators {{for at least another}} year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.|$|E
5|$|In {{locations}} where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> <b>as</b> the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being {{at the side of}} the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed from a tropical wave approximately 1,000mi (1,609.3km) east of Barbados on August 24. After forming, the depression moved westward {{and on the}} next day intensified into a tropical storm on the following day. After becoming a tropical storm, Gustav continued to intensify as it headed west-northwestward. Intensification into a hurricane occurred on August 26, as the storm began slowly curving northward under the influence of a trough. After reaching Category 2 intensity, Gustav was affected by wind shear, and weakened, but eventually re-intensified. The hurricane ultimately peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on August 31, and was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, in addition to being the only major hurricane in the Atlantic that year. Around the time of attaining peak intensity, Gustav began a fujiwhara interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Hortense. After attaining peak intensity on August 31, Gustav weakened back, at nearly the <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> <b>as</b> it had intensified, and deteriorated to a tropical storm on September 2. By September 3, Gustav transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, 230mi (370km) south of Iceland.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus {{are known}} from both large adult {{specimens}} and small larvae, showing an extreme change in body shape. In these species, {{the shape and}} proportions of skull bones change {{in the early stages}} of development. The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small, regularly spaced pits are the first to form, followed by larger ridges. As development continues, the external gills disappear. Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost. The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> <b>as</b> the skull, with ossification (the replacement of cartilage by bone) happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed, ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages, and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached, most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks, possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons. Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity. The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci.|$|E
5|$|The Forest Service {{and other}} {{scientists}} are currently studying the biological effects from the fire. There were 45 California spotted owl breeding sites within the Rim Fire perimeter on Forest Service land, and one year post-fire they had the highest-ever recorded occupancy rate for California spotted owls. Spotted owl sites with 100% high-severity burn were occupied by pairs at the <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> <b>as</b> unburned sites. The Rim Fire contains many populations of rare California endemic flowers such as Clarkia australis and Clarkia biloba ssp. australis in places where plantation trees burned; these areas, however, are to be disturbed by planned thinning. Researchers estimate that the Rim Fire burned nearly one-fifth of known great gray owl nesting sites, but post-fire surveys found {{no significant difference in}} owl detection at burned versus unburned sites. A study of how pre-fire forest conditions affected fire severity found that weather, time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity, and that under extreme weather conditions, {{as is often the case}} with fires that escape initial attack, large areas of high-severity fire are created even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008–2009, this narrowly-defined demographic-based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for the chain declined; Burger King's same-store {{comparable}} sales in the United States and Canada declined 4.6% in the three months ended September 30, while McDonald's posted same-store comparable sales growth of 2.5% within the United States. The Stacker line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting the top layer of cheese and changing the amount of bacon in the sandwiches, and moving the sandwiches from the core section of its menu to the company's value menu. The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale at the <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> <b>as</b> increasing numbers of burger patties. Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker. The Stacker line and other related calorie-heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing on a broader demographic base.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{work for}} single-relay {{channels}} shows that quantize-forward (QF) with long-message encoding achieves the <b>same</b> reliable <b>rates</b> <b>as</b> compress-forward (CF) with short-message encoding. It is shown that short-message QF with backward or pipelined (sliding-window) decoding also achieves the <b>same</b> <b>rates.</b> Similarly, for many relays and sources, short-message QF with backward decoding achieves the <b>same</b> <b>rates</b> <b>as</b> long-message QF. Several practical advantages of short-message encoding are pointed out, e. g., reduced delay and simpler modulation. Fur-thermore, short-message encoding lets relays use decode-forward (DF) if their channel quality is good, thereby enabling multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) gains {{that are not}} possible with long-message encoding. Finally, one may combine the advantages of long- and short-message encoding by hashing a long message to short messages. I...|$|R
