50|$|Calcium looping {{technology}} offers several technical advantages over amine scrubbing for carbon capture. Firstly, both carbonator and calciner can use fluidized bed technology, {{due to the}} good gas-solid contacting and uniform bed temperature. Fluidized bed technology has already been demonstrated at large scale: large (460MWe) atmospheric and pressurized systems exist, {{and there is not}} a need for intensive scaling up as there is for the solvent <b>scrubbing</b> <b>towers</b> used in amine scrubbing.|$|R
50|$|Calcium looping {{already has}} an energy {{advantage}} over amine scrubbing, {{but the main}} problem is that amine scrubbing is the more market-ready technology. However, the accompanying infrastructure for amine scrubbing include large solvent <b>scrubbing</b> <b>towers,</b> {{the likes of which}} have never been used on an industrial scale. The accompanying infrastructure for calcium looping capture technologies are circulating fluidized beds, which have already been implemented on an industrial scale. Although the individual technologies differ in terms of current technological viability, the fact that the infrastructure needed to properly implement an amine scrubbing system has yet to be developed keeps calcium looping competitive from a viability standpoint.|$|R

Such odour causing gases are identified in nature and are identified mostly as ammonia, Hydrogen sulfide and Volatile organic compounds. These gases, evolving from tanning drums, were experimentally quantified and analysed. Techniques for the abatement of odorous gases are designed using chemical methods. <b>Scrubbing</b> <b>towers</b> based on absorption of gases by liquid are designed and fabricated to evaluate {{the performance of the}} system in laboratory scale. Those gases were reduced in the concentration by absorbing through the packed bed vapour phase absorption using the activated carbon as the adsorbent. Results are helpful to conclude that the absorption technique presented here to reduce these toxic emission loads, seems to be simpler and economically cheaper...|$|R

40|$|La désodorisation physico-chimique en {{stations}} d'épuration s'effectue généralement par lavage basique oxydant pour piéger les espèces soufrées réduites telles que H 2 S ou CH 3 SH. L'utilisation du peroxyde d'hydrogène n'est pas encore répandue en comparaison de celle du chlore. Cette étude a été menée afin de déterminer le comportement de H 2 O 2 {{en fonction}} de la composition de l'eau de lavage. L'influence des paramètres : concentration en métaux (fer, manganèse, cuivre et zinc), pH, [H 2 O 2], [CO 32 -], [HS-] a été étudiée en utilisant un plan d'expériences. La décomposition de H 2 O 2 et la concentration de radicaux libres ont été mesurées pour chaque expérience. En présence de métaux, un pH élevé et une forte concentration en peroxyde sont les deux paramètres principalement responsables d'une forte décomposition. Cette décomposition serait accompagnée d'une production de radicaux avec [HO°]max = 10 - 13 M. Cette valeur mesurée de radicaux dans le milieu n'explique qu'une petite part de la décomposition de peroxyde observée. Par conséquent, la majorité de la décomposition est due à des réactions soit à la surface des oxydes, soit en solution avec les cations dissous. Le mélange de métaux et de carbonates à pH 10, 5 présente un effet de synergie sur la décomposition de H 2 O 2. Ces résultats démontrent que malgré le pouvoir oxydant des radicaux HO° formés, l'utilisation de H 2 O 2 en désodorisation ne sera possible qu'avec l'ajout de stabilisant. Deodorization of {{wastewater treatment plants}} involves the elimination of molecules such as NH 3, amines and sulphur compounds like H 2 S and mercaptans. In classical physico-chemical processes, NH 3 and amines are trapped in acid solution by washing air in a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>tower,</b> while sulphides are eliminated in basic oxidising solutions. The oxidant usually used is sodium hypochlorite. Elimination of sulphides and organosulphides generally demands two scrubbers: one at pH 9 and the other at pH 11. Because chlorine in deodorization generates the formation of organochlorinated species, it should soon become necessary to replace this oxidant {{in order to avoid}} the formation of such compounds. The present study follows the behaviour in wash conditions not of chlorine, but hydrogen peroxide, in order to discover the deodorization capacity of this molecule. The kinetics of H 2 S oxidation by H 2 O 2 are well known; the constant is given by log k = 12. 04 - (2641 /T) - 0. 186 x pH (Millero et al., 1989). Unfortunately H 2 O 2 shows strong decomposition in alkaline medium, due to the presence of metals and carbonates in the solution. Initiating a homolytic reaction results in the decomposition of peroxide. However, increasing the concentration of free radicals may improve H 2 S oxidation and consequently, the efficiency of the process. To better understand the behaviour of H 2 O 2 in wash conditions, various parameters were studied, namely pH (9 and 10. 5), [H 2 O 2] (1 and 5 g L- 1), metal concentrations (iron, manganese, copper and zinc) (20 and 200 µg L- 1), [CO 32 -] (0 and 100 mg L- 1) and [HS-] (0 and 2 mg L- 1). Four experimental designs, one for each metal, were employed to reduce the number of experiments and benefit from statistical laws. H 2 O 2 decomposition and HO° concentration were measured and empirical equations established. All experiments were performed in closed-batch reactors with ultra-pure reactants and water. Measurements of HO° concentrations necessitated the addition of atrazine to the solution. The oxidation of this pesticide by HO° is well known. Using atrazine concentrations measured through time, the HO° concentrations were calculated according to the equationln ([Atz] 0 /[Atz]) = k[HO∘]twith k= 2. 1 × 109 M- 1 s- 1 (De Laat et al., 1997). Oxidation of atrazine was halted by extraction onto a Ct 18 Sep-Pack resin and samples were analysed by liquid chromatography. The results showed that in the presence of metals H 2 O 2 decomposition was maximal at high pH and with high peroxide concentrations. The decomposition was accompanied by HO° production. However, the presence of metals generated the decomposition of H 2 O 2 with a reduced production of free radicals compared with ultra-pure water, which indicates that metal oxides were not only decomposition catalysts, but also radical inhibitors. Comparison of simplified radical decomposition, calculated according to the equation([H 2 O 2]/[H 2 O 2] 0) =e-k[HO∘]t,and observed decomposition showed that under these conditions H 2 O 2 consumption was mainly due to metal reactivity. Nonetheless, increasing iron and copper concentrations from 20 to 200 µg L- 1 did not modify the decomposition rate of H 2 O 2. For this reason we postulate a Fenton-like reaction between H 2 O 2 and dissolved metals in which concentrations are determined by solubility products. It follows that the kinetics of H 2 O 2 decomposition can be summarised by r=-k 1 [oxide][H 2 O 2] - k 2 [Mn+][H 2 O 2] - k 3 [HO°][H 2 O 2], with [metal]Tot =[Mn+] + [oxide] and, in the case of Cu and Fe, k 1 [oxide][H 2 O 2] << k 2 [Mn+][H 2 O 2]. To conclude, the addition of four metals with [CO 32 -]= 1 g L- 1 at pH 10. 5 produces a synergetic effect, resulting in a much faster decomposition. These conditions, unfortunately, resemble deodorization conditions. The use of a stabiliser that inhibits not only free radicals but also decomposition catalysts is therefore necessary for deodorization...|$|E
5000|$|Calcium looping is {{considered}} as potential promising solutions to reduce CO2 [...] capture energy penalty. There are many advantages from the calcium looping methods. Firstly, the method {{has been proved}} to yield a low efficiency penalties (5-8% points) while other mature CO2 [...] capture systems yield a higher efficiency penalties (8-12.5%). Moreover, the method is well suited {{for a wide range}} of flue gases. Calcium looping is applicable for new builds and retrofits to existing power stations or other stationary industrial CO2 sources because the method can be implemented using large-scale circulating fluidized beds while other methods such as amine scrubbing is required a vastly upscale solvent <b>scrubbing</b> <b>towers.</b> [...] In addition, crushed limestone used in calcium looping as the sorbent is a natural product, which is well distributed all over the world, non-hazardous and inexpensive.

40|$|At {{space vehicle}} launch {{sites such as}} Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB), Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), toxic vapors and {{hazardous}} liquid wastes result from the handling of commodities (hypergolic fuels and oxidizers), most notably from transfer operations where fuel and oxidizer are transferred from bulk storage tanks or transfer tankers to space launch vehicles. During commodity transfer at CCAFS and KSC, wet chemical scrubbers (typically containing four <b>scrubbing</b> <b>towers)</b> are used to neutralize fuel saturated vapors from vent systems on tanks and tanker trailers. For fuel vapors, a citric acid solution is used to scrub {{out most of the}} hydrazine. Operation of both the hypergolic fuel and oxidizer vapor scrubbers generates waste scrubber liquor. Currently, scrubber liquor from the fuel vapor scrubber is considered non-hazardous. The scrubber liquor is defined as spent citric acid scrubber solution; the solution contains complexed hydrazine I methylhydrazine and is used to neutralize nonspecification hypergolic fuel generated by CCAFS and KSC. This project is a collaborative effort between Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Space and Missile Center (SMC), the CCAFS, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to evaluate microwave destruction technology for the treatment of non-specification hypergolic fuel generated at CCAFS and KSC. The project will capitalize on knowledge gained from microwave treatment work being accomplished by AFSPC and SMC at V AFB. This report focuses on the costs associated with the current non-specification hypergolic fuel neutralization process (Section 2. 0) as well as the estimated costs of operating a mobile microwave unit to treat non-specification hypergolic fuel (Section 3. 0), and compares the costs for each (Section 4. 0). The purpose of this document is to assess the costs associated with waste hypergolic fuel. This document will report the costs associated with the current fuel neutralization process and also examine the costs of an alternative technology, microwave destruction of waste hypergolic fuel. The microwave destruction system is being designed as a mobile unit to treat non-specification hypergolic fuel at CCAFS and KSC...|$|R
40|$|This book {{is written}} during the LRET Summer Collegium 2011 {{held in the}} University of Southampton. In {{recognition}} {{to the need to}} reduced CO 2 emission from coal or fuel fired power plant, research project on an engineering system for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in ocean space utilisation is proposed in the collegium. This book is written to address the engineering challenges in our proposed CCS engineering system. It is recognised that the public perception is the main key to successful CCS project and an engineering system that involves public engagement in the CCS project in the early stage is proposed. The proposed project is known as the “Green Town” where it comprises of an air <b>scrubbing</b> <b>towers</b> that has the ability to capture CO 2 from the air. The selected site for the case study would then be free of anthropogenic CO 2. The captured CO 2 will then be transported by pipelines and stored in depleted oil/gas field for a geological time scale. Hamburg in Germany is selected as the case study city since it is a port city and is close to available geological formations for CO 2 storage. The K 12 -B gas field has also been identified as the proposed sequestration site. The CO 2 pipelines will tie-in to existing gas pipelines when they are no longer in use in the near future and the CO 2 injection system for the CO 2 will be retrofitted to gas platform when the gas field is no longer in use. The cost, risk and legal issues for the proposed “Green Town” idea are also addressed as well. This project also designed and conducted specific surveys in Southampton and Hamburg to investigate the public perception towards the “Green Town” idea and CCS. Unique findings are found and presented in this book. This book makes an important contribution in addressing the need to engage the public at the early stage of the CCS project. The designed surveys successfully proved that the proposed “Green Town” idea could act as an effective ‘door opener’ to future CCS project. We hope that this book would be useful to engineers and scientists working on the areas of CCS and are looking forward to share our views on the unique findings about the public’s perception of CCS...|$|R
