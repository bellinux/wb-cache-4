25|$|Sun Quan {{considered}} that Cao Cao {{was still a}} threat in the north, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would be better}} for him to have more allies instead of creating hostility between him and Liu Bei. Besides, he was also worried that Liu Bei's men might not submit to him, so he rejected Zhou Yu's idea.|$|E
25|$|When Sheridan {{discovered}} the Confederates were pulling back, he sent Custer's division, mostly dismounted, in pursuit {{on the left}} and Devin's mounted division in pursuit on the right. A few artillery pieces and Gregg's brigade from Crook's corps moved forward in support. As noted in the previous section, Sheridan had received wrong information <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the V Corps was in the rear and almost on the flank of the Confederates and therefore he mistakenly thought V Corps could launch an early, severe attack on Pickett's force. Without infantry support, Sheridan did not press his divisions to carry the attack by themselves.|$|E

25|$|Sheridan had {{received}} wrong information <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the V Corps {{was in the}} rear and almost on the flank of the Confederates and therefore he mistakenly thought V Corps could launch an early, severe attack on Pickett's force. Warren had to carefully move Griffin's and Crawford's divisions because {{of the possibility of}} attack from the Confederates as they withdrew from the White Oak Road Line and at positions near Dinwiddie where Confederates were earlier positioned and he carefully supervised this in person, putting him {{at the end of the}} column when they troops moved. At 6:00a.m., Meade's Chief of Staff Alexander S. Webb sent an order to Warren to report to Sheridan for orders. Two divisions had done so within the hour, and before Warren {{had received}} the order, but Warren did not personally meet with Sheridan until 11:00a.m.|$|E
25|$|The {{degenerated}} Lê dynasty, which endured {{under six}} rulers between 1497 and 1527, {{in the end}} was {{no longer able to}} maintain control over {{the northern part of the}} country, much less the new territories to the south. The weakening of the monarchy created a vacuum that the various noble families of the aristocracy were eager to fill. Soon after Lê Chiêu Tông fled south with the Trịnh and the Nguyễn in 1522, Mạc Đăng Dung proclaimed the Emperor's younger brother, Le Xuan, as the new Emperor under the name Lê Cung Hoàng. In reality, the new Emperor had no power. Three years after Mạc's forces killed his older brother, Lê Chiêu Tông, Mạc Đăng Dung ended the fiction that Lê Cung Hoàng actually ruled by killing him (in 1527). Mạc Đăng Dung, being a scholar-official who had effectively controlled the Le for a decade, then proclaimed himself the new Emperor of Vietnam in 1527, ending (<b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought)</b> the Lê dynasty (see Mạc dynasty for more details).|$|E
25|$|Sun Quan was {{not only}} unhappy with Zhang Wen for praising the Shu government, but also jealous of his growing popularity. He feared that Zhang Wen would win over {{the hearts of the}} people and {{eventually}} take over his throne, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of ways to depose Zhang Wen. His opportunity arrived when Zhang Wen was implicated in an incident involving Ji Yan, an official whom Zhang Wen recommended to serve in the Wu government. Ji Yan incurred much resentment from his colleagues when he came up with radical ideas to reform the bureaucracy – a move that would affect over 90 percent of all Wu officials. In 224, Ji Yan and his colleague Xu Biao (徐彪) were arrested and removed from office based on allegations of unprofessional conduct. They committed suicide later. Zhang Wen was implicated in this incident because he not only recommended Ji Yan, but was also a close friend of both Ji Yan and Xu Biao. Like them, he was removed from office, arrested and imprisoned.|$|E

500|$|Though saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan {{had seen}} Tom deposit his pistol after his beating by Earp {{and before the}} gunfight, none of the Earps had any {{way of knowing that}} Tom had left his {{revolver}} at the saloon. Hotel keeper Albert [...] "Chris" [...] Billickie, whose father Charles owned the Cosmopolitan Hotel, saw Tom McLaury enter Bauer's butcher shop about 2:00p.m. He testified that Tom's right-hand pants pocket was flat when he went in but protruded, as if it contained a pistol (<b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought),</b> when he emerged. Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom's pants. However, the bulge in Tom's pants pocket may have been the nearly $3,300 in cash and receipts found on his body, perhaps in payment for stolen Mexican beef purchased by the butcher.|$|E
500|$|Rose {{wrote the}} {{editorial}} which accompanied the cartoons {{in which he}} argued there had been several recent cases of self-censorship, weighing freedom of speech against the fear of confronting issues about Islam, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it was legitimate news story. Among the incidents he cited were: the translators of a book critical of Islam did not want their names published; the Tate gallery in London withdrew an installation by the avant-garde artist John Latham depicting the Quran, Bible and Talmud torn to pieces, and comedian Frank Hvam {{said in an interview}} with Jyllands-Posten that he would hypothetically dare to urinate on the Bible on television, but not on the Quran. Rose also mentioned the case of a Danish imam who had met with Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and [...] "called on the prime minister to interfere with the press in order to get more positive coverage of Islam." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1990s, Neo, Lee and Thia became {{well known}} in Singapore for their {{performances}} in the Channel 8 television show Comedy Night (Wade-Giles: Kao hsiao hsin tung). Neo then acted in the 1997 Eric Khoo film 12 Storeys, and saw potential in the then virtually nonexistent local film industry. He wrote a screenplay about expatriates in the advertising industry, but decided the concept would not appeal to most Singaporeans, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of writing a story about Ah Bengs (uneducated Chinese men), drawing on the humble backgrounds of Lee, Thia and himself. Inspired, he contacted Tay Teck Lock, a former producer for Channel 8, and suggested they collaborate. They decided on a plot about three Singaporean men facing financial difficulties. Neo spent eight months writing the script, while Tay helped develop the characters and jokes. Despite the Speak Mandarin Campaign, Neo chose to use Hokkien dialogue to [...] "reflect real life" [...] and [...] "reach a different audience".|$|E

500|$|On 16October, {{during the}} Battle of Leipzig, Merveldt's forces were arrayed {{on the right}} flank of the French center, {{commanded}} by Napoleon. [...] On his own right stood Wittgenstein's Corps, and beyond that, Johann von Klenau's. [...] His troops were interspersed among several wooded sections and surrounding several small villages: Dölitz, Mark-Kleeburg and Gautsch. Opposite him were the forces of Józef Antoni Poniatowski and Pierre Augereau. He rode out to view the battlefield and to direct the disposition of his force. Near Dölitz, which lay close to the French line, he wandered into a troop of Hungarians, or <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> but they were actually a mixed group of Saxons and Poles, whom he mistook for Hungarians, and was captured. Most of the action, on the first day, occurred to the north, where Blücher's Prussians repelled Michel Ney's cavalry, but when Napoleon heard that Ney and Marmont had been forced back, he sought a cease-fire from the Allied monarchs. [...] He called for Merveldt, and, after a meeting, Merveldt carried Napoleon's proposal to the allied monarchs, which they refused.|$|E
500|$|Dalton {{estimated}} the atomic weights {{according to the}} mass ratios in which they combined, with the hydrogen atom taken as unity. However, Dalton did not conceive that with some elements atoms exist in molecules—e.g. pure oxygen exists as O2. He also mistakenly believed that the simplest compound between any two elements is always one atom of each (<b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> water was HO, not H2O). This, {{in addition to the}} crudity of his equipment, flawed his results. For instance, in 1803 he believed that oxygen atoms were 5.5 times heavier than hydrogen atoms, because in water he measured 5.5grams of oxygen for every 1gram of hydrogen and believed the formula for water was HO. [...] Adopting better data, in 1806 he concluded that the atomic weight of oxygen must actually be 7 rather than 5.5, and he retained this weight {{for the rest of his}} life. [...] Others at this time had already concluded that the oxygen atom must weigh 8 relative to hydrogen equals 1, if one assumes Dalton's formula for the water molecule (HO), or 16 if one assumes the modern water formula (H2O).|$|E
500|$|The game's fifth episode, [...] "Rise {{from the}} Ashes", was not {{included}} in the original version of the game; it was created four years later, as part of the Nintendo DS version of the game. The fifth episode was produced by Minae Matsukawa, under supervision of Inaba and Mikami. New music pieces for [...] "Rise from the Ashes" [...] were composed by Naoto Tanaka. When writing the episode, Takumi wanted it to link up with Edgeworth's disappearance in the second game, , <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> about what would be the thing that would be the most damaging to Edgeworth's psyche. He decided on corruption and betrayal from within the prosecutor's office, despite the seriousness of the topic. The character Jake Marshall was created as a parallel to Godot, in an analogy between the Skye sisters and the Fey sisters. The idea to include the use of the Nintendo DS system's microphone came from American Capcom staff members; the Japanese staff did not like the idea of adding unnecessary features, but Takumi thought it was important to make the American audience happy, so it was included as an optional feature.|$|E

2500|$|At the Reds spring {{training}} camp in late March, murmurs started to surface {{that he was the}} [...] "hottest thing" [...] in camp. Landrith was a star in the sandlots of Detroit and at Michigan State University. He desperately wanted to play professional baseball with the Detroit Tigers, crying when his father convinced him to sign with Cincinnati. The Tigers offered Landrith a two-year minor league deal worth $8,000. However, Cincinnati offered him a four-year major league contract at $6,000 per year, totaling $24,000. Landrith learned that the Tigers had paid a $75,000 bonus to catcher Frank House, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the Tigers had too much money tied up in House that he would never be given much of a chance. Landrith played in {{spring training}} games for the Reds before being assigned to the minor league baseball Class A Charleston Senators of the Central League. He had a [...]250 batting average with 111 total bases in 110 games played.|$|E
2500|$|Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly {{noticed a}} {{connection}} between Daniel and Imogen in their first scenes together and Phillipps told him that something could happen between them in the future. He continued, [...] "Imogen gets into twists and gets very worked up about things and Daniel just doesn't get it. He finds it really funny and thinks that Imogen is super sweet. He doesn't get why she finds stuff so frustrating, but he really loves that about her as well." [...] Daniel and Imogen clashed again when she dropped her birthday dress after he ran into her on his skateboard. Daniel bought her a new dress, {{but it was too}} big for Imogen and she refused to accept it. Later that day, Imogen accidentally crushed Daniel's skateboard during a driving lesson, but Daniel believed it was her way of getting revenge for the dress. Imogen developed feelings for Daniel after they teamed up for a community project. Phillipps commented that Daniel and Imogen had developed [...] "a great chummy friendship", <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> Daniel would {{be surprised to learn that}} Imogen has feelings for him.|$|E
2500|$|In late 211, Liu Zhang {{invited the}} warlord Liu Bei, who {{was based in}} {{southern}} Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), to lead his troops into Yi Province to help him counter the threat of another warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. Zhang Yu accompanied Liu Zhang when he met Liu Bei for a reception banquet in Fu County (涪縣; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan). During the banquet, Liu Bei saw that Zhang Yu had a thick beard, so {{he came up with}} a joke to make fun of Zhang Yu: [...] "When I was in Zhuo County (涿縣), there were many people with the family name Mao. They were everywhere, be it north, south, east or west. The Prefect even remarked, 'Zhuo County is surrounded by Maos!'" [...] Zhang Yu also cracked a joke to get back at Liu Bei: [...] "Once upon a time, there was a certain Prefect of Lu County (潞縣) who was later reassigned to Zhuo County. After he retired, someone wanted to write him a letter but didn't know how to address him in a way that reflected the two appointments he held, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of the term 'Gentleman of Lu-Zhuo' (潞涿君)." [...] Zhang Yu's joke was meant to mock Liu Bei, who had no beard.|$|E

2500|$|The Tejano {{people of}} El Paso County were outraged. They {{effectively}} {{put a stop}} to all county government, replacing it with community juntas and daring the sheriff to take any action against them. In response to pleas from a frightened Anglo community (numbering fewer than 100 residents out of 5,000 in the county), Governor Richard B. Hubbard answered by sending to El Paso Major John B. Jones, commander of the Texas Rangers' Frontier Battalion. Arriving on November 5, Jones met with the junta leaders, negotiated their agreement to obey the law (or <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought)</b> and arranged Howard's return, arraignment, and release on bail. Jones also recruited 20 new Texas Rangers, the Detachment of Company C, under the command of Lieutenant John B. Tays, a native Canadian. Traditionally, Tays has been described as an uneducated handyman, but later research indicated he was a mining engineer, El Paso land speculator, and smuggler of Mexican cattle. His appointment to command the local Ranger detachment was approved by leading Anglos. The Ranger detachment recruited by Jones and Tays was [...] mixed, composed of Anglos and a few Tejanos, including an old Indian fighter, several Civil War veterans, an experienced lawman, at least one outlaw, and a few community pillars. Individually, they included some capable men, but the unit lacked tradition or cohesion.|$|E
