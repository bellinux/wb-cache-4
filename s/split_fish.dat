The central Himalayan rivers often rise in Tibet from lakes full of fish, but have none (at least during the rains) in that rapid part of their course from 10,000 to 14,000 feet elevation: below that fish abound, but I believe invariably of different species from those found at the sources of the same rivers. The nature of the tropical ocean into which all the Himalayan rivers debouche, is no doubt the proximate cause of the absence of Salmonidae.

40|$|Objective echoes {{identification}} {{is not possible}} nowadays when several species are present in an area. Mid-water trawl catches are usually used to <b>split</b> <b>fish</b> schools into species during acoustic surveys. Moreover it is weIl known that because of a lively behaviour {{of these types of}} species, the catchability may vary a lot from one species to another. Therefore, in order to verify the reliability of identification by trawling, 68 hauls carried out during 4 acoustic surveys (1991 - 1994) have been analysed. Five pelagic species (anchovy, mackerel, horse-mackerel, sprat and sardine), observed during these surveys in Bay of Biscay were considered. On the one hand, taking into account the vertical echo-sounder data and the vertical course of the trawl from nets onde data, a theoretical weight was calculated, and compared with the real catch. The results showed that catchability varied a lot between species and within species according to school structure. On the other hand, a vertical avoidance of fish was simulated by changing the vertical trawl position to approach the real catch and study specific behaviours which could bias the identification. As a result, it seems that trawl species compositions could be used with a better precision by applying a correcting factor according to specific catchabilities if completed by an aggregation classification...|$|E

Accordingly, only 31 % of the cases positive for rearrangement on FISH also scored positive using RT-PCR.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many {{clinically}} important oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes {{have been}} identified through analysis of recurrent chromosomal rearrangements in acute leukemia. The contribution of sporadic rearrangements to malignancy is less clear and few have been mapped in detail. In this study we investigated the significance of novel translocations and inversions of 6 q in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN-AND-METHODS: Breakpoints of balanced 6 q rearrangements were mapped in sequential fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with BAC and PAC clones in 11 patients. RESULTS: Six of seven breakpoints in ALL and two in a single case of AML were localized to within a 10. 5 Mb hotspot at 6 q 22 -q 23 with five analyzed {{to the level of}} a single probe. In two cases of childhood T-ALL, both carrying a t(6; 7) (q 23;q 32 through 36), <b>split</b> <b>FISH</b> signals were produced by adjacent PAC, mapping the breakpoints to within an approximately 150 Kb region containing the genes c-MYB and AHI 1. Five similar rearrangements, four also in pediatric T ALL were identified in the literature.

The involvement of MLL was demonstrated in one case with t(6; 11) (q 15;q 23).

Plate 1 :Geologic map {{of southeastern}} Vallecito Mountains, Split Mountain and Fish Creek MountainsSedimentation styles and {{patterns}} for lower Neogene continental sedimentary rocks exposed in the Vallecito, <b>Split,</b> <b>Fish</b> Creek, and Superstition Mountains are examined. These rocks {{are part of}} a previously unrecognized strati-graphic sequence that includes locally intercalated, lower to middle Miocene, predominantly basaltic, volcanic rocks. The sequence rests on an older (Paleocene?) pediment surface cut across crystalline basement rocks of the Southern California Batholith: locally, however, this low-relief surface has been deeply incised by early Neogene drainage. In turn, the sequence is unconformably overlain by upper Neogene marine and continental strata associated with opening of the Gulf of California. Formal stratigraphic terminology proposed to date is controversial and inadequate. Therefore, it is recommended the name Anza Formation be used to encompass the lower Neogene stratigraphic sequence; other nomenclatural recommendations are also offered. 	Lower Neogene continental sedimentary rocks consist of three environmental facies: (1) braided stream, (2) alluvial fan, and (3) landslide. The braided stream facies is typified by lenses of conglomeratic sandstone. Vertical sedimentary sequences, paleocurrent indicators, and clast populations indicate that a Platte-type braided stream drained westward off a pediment surface cut into a "back-tipped" basement block and joined a Donjek-type axial drainage system that flowed northward. The alluvial fan facies consists of debris flow, sheetflood, and channel-fill deposits with subfacies defined by the distribution of these deposits along with bedding geometry. Proximal subfacies is characterized by debris flow and channel-fill deposits with numerous internal erosional contacts and laterally discontinuous beds. Midfan deposition below the intersection point is marked by laterally continuous, regularly interbedded, very thick debris flow and thinner-bedded sheetflood deposits. Distal subfacies is represented by interbedded debris flow and sheetflood deposits that are thinner bedded and less organized than the midfan subfacies. Stratigraphic relationships and paleocurrent data suggest that alluvial fans were deposited along a down-faulted western basin margin and eventually prograded eastward over the axial braided stream system. The upper facies is a massive, laterally continuous, sedimentary megabreccia containing clasts up to 15 feet in diameter. This facies is thought to represent a catastrophically emplaced, air-cushioned landslide. 	Palinspastic removal of 230 miles of northwestward translation along faults of the San Andreas system, and 90 degrees of clockwise rotation, restore the early Neogene half-graben basins of the western Salton Trough to north-western Sonora, Mexico. Furthermore, these basins align with the Basin-and-Range tectonic trends of southwestern North America, suggesting early Neogene continental sedimentation may have occurred in a Basin-and-Range basin...|$|E

40|$|The {{fisheries}} and fish processing industries have high labor costs. In part, {{this is due}} to visual inspection tasks, which are found in these industries, being so complex that humans are needed to do the inspection. One large class of inspection tasks is defect detection. This involves discerning whether a part or product is defective. Machine vision is a technology with the potential for solving many visually-based defect detection tasks, and has been successfully applied in automation systems in many industries (Hirano et. al. 2006). In this dissertation, machine vision is used successfully for defect detection in a number of specific applications in the {{fisheries and}} fish processing industries, and the particular challenges of applying machine vision, to these types of applications, are highlighted. Methods and approaches for meeting these challenges are discussed, with reference to their successful use the applications presented in this dissertation. A brief summary of each of the applications is presented in the following sections. The first application that was addressed, and the initial topic of this dissertation, was automatic sorting of cod viscera. Cod viscera are a valuable byproduct, containing different fractions. When the cod viscera is sorted into separate fractions, such as liver, roe and stomach, its value increases substantially. Sorting of cod viscera is done manually, and is a laborious process in the cod fisheries. This was the motivation for developing a method for automatic sorting of cod viscera, using machine vision and a robot. We developed and implemented hand-eye coordination algorithms for a 5 -DOF robot with a stereo camera platform. Assuming that a viscera fraction could be identified in images from both cameras, we thus had a method of directing the robot tool to the fraction. The remaining challenge was to identify the fraction in the images. Towards this end, we tested several approaches, culminating in a combination of color and texture features together with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. We found the fraction detection, in visible light images, to be a very difficult problem to solve, and it was not solved adequately to be useful for automatic sorting of the cod viscera within the time-frame given. In light of this, the focus of this dissertation was changed – to encompass machine vision for defect detection in a number of specific fisheries and fish processing applications. The second application is a cod fisheries application – detecting nematodes and skin remnants, in cod fillets, using multi-spectral images in the visible and near-infrared. A combination of contrast-invariant Gabor texture features and linear discriminant analysis showed promising results for detecting both nematodes and skin remnants. The pixel-wise detection rate and false-alarm rate for nematode detection was on the order of 99 % and 1 % respectively, and for skin remnant detection approximately 90 % and 10 %. Combining this with multi-spectral features gave even better results. The data set was not large enough to draw any definitive conclusions in terms of detection rate and false-alarm rate in an industrial setting, but the results are promising enough to merit further investigation into the use of Gabor texture features for detecting nematodes and skin remnants in cod fillets. The third application is a fish processing application, and involves quality sorting of whole Atlantic salmon into the classes ‘superior/ordinary’ and ‘production’, in which case the ‘production’ are seen as being defective with respect to the ‘superior/ordinary’. Salmon characterized as ‘production’ may have several deviations from ‘superior/ordinary’ salmon, including a humpback or short tail. The approach taken, to solve the sorting problem described here, was to first segment the image in order to extract the salmon silhouette and orient it properly, independent of its original orientation. From this silhouette image, specific geometrical descriptive parameters were extracted. In the feature-space spanned by these descriptors, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was done to maximally discriminate between ‘production’ and ‘superior/ordinary’. This performance of this approach was analyzed using a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation procedure, and this showed that approximately 90 % of salmon could be correctly classified as ‘superior/ordinary’ or ‘production’. This machine vision system was further developed to discriminate between the more similar classes ‘superior’ and ‘ordinary’, and tested on a larger data set. The sorting accuracy for this system was also approximately 90 %. Thus, the system is well suited as part of automated system for quality sorting of whole Atlantic salmon. The fourth application is in the longline fisheries, and the task here is to detect defective longline hooks. In longline fishing, lines of up to 50 - 60 kilometers are used, each containing up to 40 000 hooks. Today, baiting, shooting (setting the line out in the sea) and hauling (pulling it back on board after soaking for some time in the sea) is almost completely automated. Between each hauling and the next shooting, the gear (line and hooks) is manually inspected, and any defective hooks are corrected or replaced. This manually-executed maintenance task is extremely labor-intensive. A machine vision system is presented, that can potentially automate this task. Combining knowledge from the fishermen, on what denotes a ‘defective’ hook, and machine vision knowledge, a set of features were automatically extracted from images of the hooks. Thousands of classifiers were automatically explored, and each classifier was plotted in the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) plane. From all of these, the classifiers on the ROC convex hull (ROCCH) were selected. On tests with more than 400 hooks, the classifiers on the ROOCH were found capable of detecting 97. 4 % of ‘defective’ hooks with zero false positives. Together with an automatic and mechanized hook replacement and repair system, this machine vision approach can automate the maintenance phase of longline fishing. The fifth application is in the pelagic fisheries and fish processing, and is the task of weight and quality grading of whole pelagic fish. In this work, the goal was to develop a single machine vision system {{that could be used to}} automatically perform both weight and quality grading – a labor-intensive task that is done manually today. This involved finding the optics, illumination and imaging modalities that could be used to weigh the fish automatically and detect most of the important defect types that could occur. The types of defects that occur in whole pelagic fish are many, including: <b>split</b> <b>fish,</b> superficial wounds, such as cuts scrapes, and deformations due to pressure and injuries. An imaging and illumination system, that combined 3 D range imaging, laser scatter imaging and diffuse gloss imaging, was developed and implemented in a prototype sorting station. Experiments showed that these imaging modalities could be used to detect all the defect types at a high processing speed. The prototype machine vision system was integrated with a conveyor belt and robot, and demonstrated the feasibility of using machine vision to automatically weigh whole pelagic and detect those fish that are defective. The main focus of this work was to develop the optical, imaging and illumination part of the machine vision system, and demonstrate proof-of-concept machine vision algorithms that could discriminate between defective and non-defective fish. The sixth application is detection of melanin spots in Atlantic salmon fillets. One of the manual operations done in salmon processing plants is to inspect the fillets and discard or process those that have melanin spots. Melanin spots are dark spots that reduce the quality grade of the fillet, and they are present in a substantial percentage of fillets. Melanin spots are caused by an inflammatory condition most often induced by vaccination. For the melanin spot detection application, a machine vision system using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was developed that could detect 93 % of melanin spots. At this detection rate the number of false alarms was very high, but an investigation showed that these false alarms were entirely due to two main causes: 1. uneven illumination and 2. blood, viscera and fin remnants near the belly flap. By improving the illumination uniformity, and cleaning and trimming the fillets before inspection, we thus have a method for accurate detection of melanin spots. This system uses RGB images, and can thus be easily integrated in a fillet processing line where other quality parameters, such as trimming grade, pigmentation and shape, are measured using machine vision with RGB cameras. The seventh application is automatic trimming of salmon fillets, in which fin and tail remnants, belly fat, back fat and belly membranes are detected and removed. Trimming fillets is today done manually, after rough trimming in mechanical trimming machines. This application was developed into a prototype sorting station, with conveyor belt, robot and camera and illumination housing. As part of this complete prototype, a machine vision system had to be developed that could distinguish between the ‘defective’ and ‘non-defective’ parts of the fillet. The solution that was found involved using a 3 D camera with blue LED illumination. This gave use both the required 3 D data needed to perform the trimming, and the illumination needed to acquire images in which the ‘defective’ parts of the fillet were clearly discriminated. Once the images clearly distinguished between objects to be trimmed off (‘defective’ parts) and the remaining fillet, the subsequent image processing was much simplified. The work in this application illustrates the importance of looking at the entire machine vision system, and its context, as a whole. The prototype was fully functioning and demonstrated all the necessary parts needed in an automatic salmon fillet trimming station. The eighth application is automatic sorting of salmonid eggs. Salmon breeding companies can produce up to 100 million eggs per year, and these must be manually inspected before delivery to the hatcheries. This is a highly laborious and costly task, and is therefore very desirable to automate. This manual sorting is needed to remove unfertilized eggs, dead eggs and fertilized eggs with defects. A machine vision system, including optics, illumination and image processing, was developed that can sort more than 100 000 eggs per hour with a sorting error of less than 1 %. This machine vision system was demonstrated in a prototype sorting machine, and then implemented in an industrialized sorting machine. These sorting machines are now successfully in use at several salmon breeding facilities. The applications developed and described in this thesis demonstrate the effectiveness of machine vision for defect detection in fisheries and fish processing applications. The work on these applications shows that in order to be successful, all aspects of the application, and their context, must be taken into account. In each application there are specific constraints that make each application unique. Even so, there are some commonalities between many applications, in terms of the challenges involved. These commonalities have been highlighted in this dissertation, and appropriate methods and approaches have been found to meet them. Being aware of these challenges, and of the relevant methods and approaches to meeting them, increases the probability of successfully solving an application. As such, the work in this dissertation, and understanding of the lessons learnt in it, will benefit future applications of machine vision for defect detection in the fisheries and fish processing industries. Through continuing improvements in machine vision technology, and increasing domainspecific knowledge of how to apply this technology to fisheries and fish processing applications, almost all such applications can be partially or fully automated in the future. This dissertation shows that this vision is indeed a possibility, and hints at the directions needed to realize it.   PhD i informasjons- og kommunikasjonsteknologiPhD in Information and Communications Technolog...|$|E

40|$|Juvenile {{chinook salmon}} Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were {{subjected}} to handling and tagging protocols typical of normal hatchery operations and monitored for their physiological response to stress. Treatments included coded-wire-tagging, counting, ventral fin clipping, adipose fin clipping, and a procedure simulating a pond <b>split.</b> Treatment <b>fish</b> were also subjected to a standardized stress challenge (1 h confinement) to evaluate their {{ability to deal with}} disturbances subsequent to a handling or tagging procedure. Circulating levels of cortisol and glucose were used as indicators of stress. Each of the treatments elicited very similar responses among treatment groups. Cortisol increased from resting levels of about 20 ng/mL to about 90 ng/mL by 1 h poststress and returned to near resting levels by 8 h poststress. Glucose levels increased from 50 mg/dL to about 80 mg/dL by 1 h poststress and remained elevated for much of the experiment. The cortisol and glucose responses to the confinement stress did not differ over time or among treatments. However, the confinement stress results do suggest a small but significant cumulative response, indicating small residual effects of the original handling protocols. No deaths were noted among treatment groups...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeptins, a conserved {{family of}} cytoskeletal GTP-binding proteins, were {{presented}} in diverse eukaryotes. Here, a comprehensive phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis for septin proteins in metazoan was carried out. First, we demonstrated that all septin proteins in metazoan could be clustered into four subgroups, and the representative homologue of every subgroup was presented in the non-vertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis, indicating that {{the emergence of the}} four septin subgroups should have occurred prior to divergence of vertebrates and invertebrates, and the expansion of the septin gene number in vertebrates was mainly by the duplication of pre-existing genes rather than by the appearance of new septin subgroup. Second, the direct orthologues of most human septins existed in zebrafish, which suggested that human septin gene repertoire was mainly formed by as far as before the <b>split</b> between <b>fishes</b> and land vertebrates. Third, we found that the evolutionary rate within septin family in mammalian lineage varies significantly, human SEPT 1, SEPT 10, SEPT 12, and SEPT 14 displayed a relative elevated evolutionary rate compared with other septin members. Our data will provide new insights for the further function study of this protein family...|$|R

5000|$|All the {{different}} fish {{have a unique}} combat power that is useful while battling other players. The piranha is equipped with the poop feature that blocks the players who are trailing it. The turtle {{has the ability to}} shoot a bomb at the player attacking it. The puffer fish uses its special feature to increase its size to trick other players. Once an enemy player is close enough, the puffer fish blows up in size and attacks the enemy player. The octopus has the ability to eject oil to slow down players who are trailing it. The shark can use its invisibility feature to eat players. The seahorse has the hallucinating ability to confuse its enemy players. The whale can increase its ability to speed up and split to catch up and eat enemy players.As players advance in levels, new techniques and skills are unlocked to battle opponents. During evolution, a player can transform into a similar but stronger type of underwater species. In addition to its special combat powers, a player can <b>split</b> a <b>fish</b> into two or four fishes for a quick split attack that can help the player dodge an enemy’s attack or catch up and attack a smaller fish who is faster.|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a neurotrophin {{from the}} lamprey that permitted us {{to perform a}} phylogenetic analysis of the neurotrophin gene family that dates back more than 460 million years to the early vertebrate ancestors. The {{results show that the}} neurotrophin gene family was originally formed by two subsequent duplications. The duplication that formed nerve growth factor, neurotrophin- 3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin- 4 / 5 occurred after the split of lampreys but before the <b>split</b> of cartilaginous <b>fish</b> from the main vertebrate lineage. Compilation of chromosomal gene maps around the neurotrophins shows that they are located in paralogous regions, suggesting that the genes were formed at major duplication events possibly by complete genome doubling. Analysis of two isolated Trk receptor sequences shows similar results as for the lamprey neurotrophin. Multiple neurotrophin and Trk genes...|$|R
