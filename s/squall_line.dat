As the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> overtook the cells, a few tornadoes — all EF0 — took place {{overnight}} in Florida and extreme southern Georgia within the <b>squall</b> <b>line,</b> before the severe weather emerged in the Atlantic Ocean that morning. The final tornado was a landfalling waterspout in the Outer Banks of North Carolina late that morning. In addition to the tornadoes, widespread straight-line wind damage from microbursts were also reported, along with scattered large hail, the largest of which were the size of baseballs.|$|E
5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a <b>squall</b> <b>line.</b> Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> itself and the synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E

5|$|From here, {{a general}} {{thinning}} of a <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> will occur: with winds decaying over time, outflow boundaries weakening updrafts substantially and clouds losing their thickness.|$|E
5|$|The {{system had}} formed into a <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> but at about 1:30 am CST (0730 UTC), the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> broke {{up in the}} Ohio Valley area, as the low level jet intensified, {{allowing}} embedded tornadoes to form rapidly out of newly formed supercells. They were fairly isolated (only seven were confirmed across the entire region over a 24-hour period) but three significant tornadoes formed from two simultaneous supercells in southern Indiana and western Kentucky — {{one of them was}} the deadly Evansville tornado.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is an {{important}} aspect of a <b>squall</b> <b>line.</b> In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to help create a leading edge lifting mechanism – the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E
500|$|If <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> form over arid regions, a {{duststorm}} {{known as}} a haboob may result from the high winds in their wake picking up dust from the desert floor.

5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the <b>squall</b> <b>line,</b> and may lead to acceleration of the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> itself.|$|E

5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming {{in the wake}} of mature squall lines at the back edge of their rain shields, where evaporative cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They can be caused by gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a <b>squall</b> <b>line,</b> when new thunderstorm development stops along the <b>squall</b> <b>line,</b> the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E

In this study, we present {{for the first time}} the seasonal and interannual variability of windthrows, focusing on Central Amazonia, and discuss the potential meteorological factors associated with this variability. Landsat images over the 1998 – 2010 time period were used to detect the occurrence of windthrows, which were identified based on their spectral characteristics and shape. Here, we found that windthrows occurred every year but were more frequent between September and February. Organized convective activity associated with multicell storms embedded in mesoscale convective systems, such as northerly <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> (that move from northeast to southwest) and southerly <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> (that move from southwest to northeast) can cause windthrows.

5|$|A <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> (also {{known as}} a quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for cold front. It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds can occur where the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} morning hours, a cold front with several {{embedded}} low pressure areas extended from east Texas northeastward into the Ohio River Valley. An upper-level disturbance that had moved across the frontal boundary the previous evening sparked an area of thunderstorms that morphed into a <b>squall</b> <b>line.</b> This line of severe thunderstorms {{would be responsible for}} tornado actitvity from late on April 26 into the late morning of April 27. Early in the morning, the <b>squall</b> <b>line,</b> packing straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes, moved through Louisiana and Mississippi, then proceeded to affect North and Central Alabama and parts of Middle and East Tennessee. The line strengthened as it moved through Alabama, due in part to a high amount of low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and increasing wind shear.|$|E

It was found {{that two-thirds of the}} convectively generated severe wind reports over the NHP were identified as being produced by organized convective structures rather than by isolated downburst or microburst activity. Specifically, at least 29 % of all severe wind reports were produced by bow echoes, 20 % by <b>squall</b> <b>lines,</b> 9 % by supercell thunderstorms, and 7 % by other convective systems not organized in a linear fashion. The occurrence of linear convective storm types that typically produce high winds (i. e., <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> and bow echoes) were also documented over the NHP during the period of study.

5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder.

Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a <b>squall</b> <b>line.</b> Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones.
