[...] At a {{time when}} California was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, he lost by less than a percentage point to George Pardee. (Theodore Roosevelt won the state by 35points two years later.) [...] Between 8,000 and 10,000votes were disqualified on various technicalities, possibly costing him the election. [...] During the campaign, the influential San Francisco Examiner slanted its news coverage against him. [...] Examiner owner William Randolph Hearst later denied responsibility for this policy, and stated that if Lane ever needed anything, he should send Hearst a telegram. [...] Lane retorted that if Hearst received a telegram purportedly signed by Lane, asking him to do anything, he could be <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> forgery.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{was named}} the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] in a 2011 ranking by Rolling Stone (based on record sales and social media metrics), and she ranked fourth in VH1's Greatest Women in Music in 2012. She has been often {{regarded}} as a trailblazer for sometimes utilizing controversy to bring attention to various issues. Because of The Fame success—it was listed {{as one of the}} 100 Greatest Debut Albums of All-Time by Rolling Stone in 2013—Gaga is acknowledged {{as one of the few}} artists for propelling the rise in the popularity of synthpop in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Scott Hardy, Polaroid's CEO, has praised Gaga for inspiring her fans and for her close interactions with them on social media. According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker, [...] "Lady Gaga blazed a trail for truculent pop stars by treating her own celebrity as an evolving art project." [...] Including Born This Way as one of the 50 best female albums of all time, Rolling Stone considers it [...] "hard to remember a world where we didn't have Gaga, although we're pretty <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot more boring." [...] In 2015, Time also noted that Gaga had [...] "practically invented the current era of pop music as spectacle." [...] Her work has influenced artists including Miley Cyrus, Nicki Minaj, Ellie Goulding, Halsey, Nick Jonas, Sam Smith, Noah Cyrus, Katherine Langford, and MGMT.|$|E

2500|$|The {{life history}} of Macrosoma heliconiaria was {{originally}} described from plants of Byttneria aculeata in Mexico. This was a historical breakthrough into {{the biology of}} hedylids. In this study, Kendall commented notably [...] "I thought the larvae might represent a satyr species, but when the first larva pupated I was <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pierid. The first adult emerged as a complete surprise. The pupa...is secured by girdle and cremaster, not unlike a pierid". Macrosoma cascaria was later also reared on this plant in Panama.

From these data, known host plants span {{a wide range of}} (according to the APG II system) rosid dicotyledonous plants, including the rosid order Myrtales family Melastomataceae (genera Miconia, Conostegia, and Ossaea), the eurosid I order Malpighiales, families Euphorbiaceae (Croton), and Malpighiaceae (Byrsonima), the eurosid II orders Sapindales, family Rutaceae (Zanthoxylum) and more commonly Malvales, family Malvaceae, tribes: Bombacoideae (Ochroma), Malvoideae (Hampea and also Hibiscus, Byttnerioideae (Byttneria aculeata, Theobroma) and Grewioideae (Luehea).

The larva of this species lives about 15 days in 5 instars, the pupal stage lasts about 7 days and the adult lives about 10 days. M. tipulata and many other species can be found as adults through most of the year.|$|E

[...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it... And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which {{led her to the}} realisation that she [...] "needed refreshing". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> look that was all me, you know?." [...] She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel [...] "completely intoxicated!."
