40|$|BACKGROUND: V 1 {{is known}} to contain neurons tuned to visual {{low-level}} features such as spatial frequencies and orientation. Psychophysical studies using delayed discrimination experiments have shown that these features can be retained in memory with high fidelity. According to the <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> <b>model</b> of working memory, visual working memory recruits the perceptual areas involved in discriminating the features {{that is to be}} retained. If this is the case, V 1 -neurons tuned to spatial frequencies should be recruited when information along this dimension is retained in memory. We tested this hypothesis taking advantage of the memory masking effect. METHOD: We used fMRI to measure BOLD responses while participants performed a delayed discrimination task for spatial frequencies. While performing the discrimination task, the participants had to retain spatial frequency information about an irrelevant masker stimulus. The mask differentially interfered with discrimination accuracy on the main task, and this memory masking effect was used to probe early visual areas for differential BOLD modulation related to the masking effect. In one experiment we presented the mask and the sample stimulus to be remembered in the same retinotopic position, and in a second experiment the mask and sample were spatially separated, allowing us to investigate the spatial extent of the low-level memory representation. Early visual areas were identified using a retinotopic mapping procedure, and ROIs retinotopically coding stimuli positions were defined for each visual area in an independent localizer session. RESULTS: When the mask and sample stimulus were presented to the same retinotopic position, the mask impaired discrimination accuracy when it differed in spatial frequency from the sample stimulus. This memory masking effect was observed as a reduced BOLD response in V 1. When spatially separating the mask and sample stimulus, we found no significant decrease in BOLD activation in V 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that neurons in V 1 involved in the perceptual coding of spatial frequencies are recruited during memory of the same information, in accordance with the <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> <b>model</b> of visual working memory. The memory masking effect is proposed to result from cross-channel inhibition, and is a local process in the retinotopically organized visual cortex...|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{recruitment}} {{models of}} working memory assume that information storage is {{mediated by the}} same cortical areas {{that are responsible for}} the perceptual processing of sensory signals. To test this assumption, we measured somatosensory event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a tactile delayed match-to-sample task. Participants memorized a tactile sample set at one task-relevant hand to compare it with a subsequent test set on the same hand. During the retention period, a sustained negativity (tactile contralateral delay activity, tCDA) was elicited over primary somatosensory cortex contralateral to the relevant hand. The amplitude of this component increased with memory load and was sensitive to individual limitations in memory capacity, suggesting that the tCDA reflects the maintenance of tactile information in somatosensory working memory. The tCDA was preceded by a transient negativity (N 2 cc component) with a similar contralateral scalp distribution, which is likely to reflect selection of task-relevant tactile stimuli at the encoding stage. The temporal sequence of N 2 cc and tCDA components mirrors previous observations from ERP studies of working memory in vision. The finding that the sustained somatosensory delay period activity varies as a function of memory load supports a <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> <b>model</b> for spatial working memory in touch...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that visual {{features}} are stored in working memory (WM) via <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> or sustained stimulus-specific patterns of activity in cortical regions that encode memoranda. One important question concerns the spatial extent of <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment.</b> One possibility is that <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> is restricted to neurons that are retinotopically mapped to the positions occupied by the remembered items. Alternatively, specific feature values could be represented via a spatially global recruitment of neurons that encode the remembered feature, regardless of the retinotopic position of the remembered stimulus. Here, we evaluated these alternatives by requiring subjects to remember the orientation of a grating presented in {{the left or right}} visual field. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivoxel pattern analysis were then used to examine feature-specific activations in early visual regions during memory maintenance. Activation patterns that discriminated the remembered feature were found in regions of contralateral visual cortex that corresponded to the retinotopic position of the remembered item, as well as in ipsilateral regions that were not retinotopically mapped to the position of the stored stimulus. These results suggest that visual details are held in WM through a spatially global <b>recruitment</b> of early <b>sensory</b> cortex. This spatially global recruitment may enhance memory precision by facilitating robust population coding of the store...|$|R
40|$|Recent neuroimaging {{studies suggest}} that early sensory areas such as area V 1 are {{recruited}} to actively maintain a selected feature of the item held in visual short-term memory (VSTM). These findings raise the possibility that visual attention operates in similar manners across perceptual and memory representations to a certain extent, despite memory-level and perception-level selections are functionally dissociable. If VSTM operates by retaining “reasonable copies ” of scenes constructed during sensory processing (Serences et al., 2009, p. 207, the <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> hypothesis), then {{it is possible that}} selective attention can be guided by both exogenous (peripheral) and endogenous (central) cues during VSTM maintenance. Yet, the results from the previous studies that examined this issue are inconsistent. In the present study, we investigated whether attention can be directed to a specific item’s location represented in VSTM with the exogenous cue in a well-controlled setting. The results from the four experiments suggest that, as observed with the endogenous cue, the exogenous cue can efficiently guide selective attention during VSTM maintenance. The finding is not only consistent with the <b>sensory</b> <b>recruitment</b> hypothesis but also validates the legitimacy of th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The “tubule <b>recruitment</b> <b>model</b> ” for the de-velopment of the holothurian gonad was {{proposed}} (a) {{to connect the}} stages of oogenesis with ovarian morphology in holothurians throughout the reproductive season and (b) to emphasize {{the potential for the}} holothurian ovary as a model system for cytological and biochemical study of echinoderm oogenesis. To reassess the evidence for this model, we have examined published accounts and unpublished observations on gonad development in ho-lothurians from both temperate and tropical habitats, in shallow water and in the deep sea. A very limited number of species were found to conform to the predictions of the tubule <b>recruitment</b> <b>model.</b> The patterns of gonad de-velopment vary substantially in holothurians, even at the individual level, and with taxonomic position, geograph-ical location, and habitat.

The simulations carried out {{as part of this}} study used two biologically inspired neuronal models to simulate networks with properties similar to those observed in the human motor system (Burke, 1991). The Synchronous neuronal model developed as part of this study explicitly models the input/output spike train and frequency relationship of each neuron. The motor pool simulations were carried out using the INSIGHT TOO simulation software developed as part of this study. INSIGHT TOO is a flexible neural design tool that allows the visual interactive design of network connectivity and has the power of a node specification language similar to that of BASIC that allows multi-layer, multi-model networks to be simulated. The simulations have shown that the motor pools are capable of reproducing commonly observed physiological properties during normal voluntary reaching movements.

40|$|We propose an {{integrative}} {{approach that}} explains patterns of recruitment to adult populations in sessile organisms {{by considering the}} numbers of individuals and their body size. A <b>recruitment</b> <b>model,</b> based on {{a small number of}} parameters, was developed for sessile organisms and tested using the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides, a marine invertebrate inhabiting North Atlantic intertidal shores. Incorporating barnacle body size improved model fit beyond that based on density alone, showing that growth {{played an important role in}} how resource limitation affected survival. Our approach uncovered the following: First, changes in the shape of the recruitment curve resulted from the balance between individual growth and mortality. Second, recruitment was limited by the least plastic trait used to characterise body size, operculum area. Basal area, a trait that responded to increases in barnacle density, did not contribute significantly to explain patterns of recruitment. Third, some temporal variation is explained by changes in the amount of space occupied by shells of dead barnacles: at high cover barnacles are densely packed and these shells remain long after death. Fourth, seasonal variation and spatial variation in survival can be separated from that resulting from resource limitation; survival was predicted for two different shores and four sampling times using a single <b>recruitment</b> <b>model.</b> We conclude that applying this integrative approach to recruitment will lead to a considerable advance in understanding patterns of mortality of early stages of sessile organisms...|$|R
40|$|Recruitment {{represents}} {{the net effect}} of seed dispersal and survival (germination and establishment) processes. Both are known to be a function of distance from the seed trees. Seed densities usually decline with distance from the seed trees and the survival function can have different shapes. It may e. g. increase with distance (Janzen-Connell type effects) or decrease in the case of facilitation. In <b>recruitment</b> <b>modeling</b> the dispersal kernel is often directly fitted to the number of saplings instead of to the number of seeds, by indirectly assuming a distance-invariant survival function. This assumption may be violated in many cases as the survival function may attain different shapes. The interaction of distance-dependent seed deposition and survival becomes more complex in the case of several seed trees, since processes shaping the survival function may act on seeds from different seed trees. We develop a <b>recruitment</b> <b>model</b> disentangling (1) seed dispersal as derived by a summed seed shadow model and (2) survival as a function of distance of several nearby seed trees. Using Bayesian model inversion we parameterize our model for post fire Pinus sylvestris regeneration, which is known to suffer from strong root competition in the vicinity of seed trees. We show that accounting for distance-dependent survival substantially improves the model performance for three tested seed dispersal kernels. We show that ignoring distance-dependency of survival leads to ecologically unrealistic parameter estimates, questionable seed dispersal properties and biased sapling density predictions at the landscape level. Disentangling seed dispersal and survival processes is essential for <b>modeling</b> <b>recruitment</b> patterns in the case of distance-dependent survival. Our model helps to learn about the connection between seed and sapling patterns particularly when several seed trees are present. Our modeling approach derives separate seed dispersal kernels, survival functions, and the resulting recruitment-patterns, also when only sapling counts are available. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
