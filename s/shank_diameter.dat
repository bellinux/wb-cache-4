2500|$|Spade bits {{are used}} for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause {{splintering}} when they emerge from the workpiece. [...] Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from {{the opposite side of}} the work. [...] Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small <b>shank</b> <b>diameters</b> relative to their boring <b>diameters,</b> spade bit <b>shanks</b> often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in drill chucks. Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a bell-hanger bit. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand drills. Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as [...] "paddle bits".|$|R

In this study, five reported polymorphisms (MR 1 -MR 5) of the PIT 1 gene were genotyped in a full sib F 2 resource population to evaluate their effects on growth, carcass and fatty traits in chickens. Results Marker-trait association analyses showed that, MR 1 was significantly associated with <b>shank</b> <b>diameters</b> (SD) at 84 days (P PIT 1 haplotypes were significantly associated with HW (P = 0. 0252), BW at 28 days (P = 0. 0390) and SD at 56 days (P = 0. 0400). No significant association of single SNP and haplotypes with chicken carcass and fatty traits was found (P > 0. 05).

5000|$|The largest {{sizes of}} {{conventional}} collated fastenings are the clipped head and full head nails {{which are used}} in framing, fencing {{and other forms of}} structural and exterior work. These nails generally have a <b>shank</b> <b>diameter</b> of 0.11 to 0.13 in. (2.9 to 3.1 mm) although some manufacturers offer smaller diameter nails as well. General lengths are in the range 2 in to [...] in (50 to 90 mm). Shank styles include plain, ring annular, twisted, etc. and a variety of materials and finishes are offered including plain steel, galvanized steel, sherardised steel, stainless steel, etc. depending on the pull-out resistance, corrosion resistance, etc. required for the given application. These sizes of fastenings are available in stick collated form (often 20° to 21° for full head, 28° to 34° for clipped head) or coil form (for use in pallet/roofing nailers) depending on the application. Full-head nails have greater pull-out resistance than clipped head nails and are mandated by code in many hurricane zones for structural framing.|$|E
40|$|High {{strength}} preloadable bolts are {{key components}} influencing strength, stiffness and ductility of beam-to-column joints. In Europe the HV and HR systems are themost commonly used types of pre-loadable bolt assemblies. EN 1993 - 1 - 8 provides design rules for bolted connections, without distinguishing {{the type of}} high strength preloadable bolt system. However, HV and HR are characterized by both different force-displacement responses and failure modes, which may significantly influence the performance of bolted joints under monotonic and cyclic actions, especially for seismic applications. The rational selection of the most suitable bolt type per specific structural demand may avoid premature reduction of joint strength for higher levels of joint rotation, or provide further rotational capacity. In order to investigate these features, experimental monotonic and both variable and constant amplitude cyclic inelastic tests were carried out on both HV and HR bolt assemblies, varying the <b>shank</b> <b>diameters.</b> The monotonic tests enabled to identify the failure modes and the relevant force-displacement monotonic response and ductility per type of bolt assembly. The variable amplitude cyclic tests allowed quantifying the strength degradation induced by cyclic actions, while the constant amplitude low-cycle fatigue tests enabled to investigate the fatigue capacity at different threshold of plastic strain and to determine the strain-number of cycles (i. e. ε-N) curves. The influence {{of the type of}} bolt assembly on the response of T-stub connections is also discussed on the basis of analytical models...|$|R

For h/d (head thickness to <b>shank</b> <b>diameter</b> ratio) values greater than 0. 66 and 0. 41 for axial tension and bending, respectively, the stress concentration factors are independent of h/d, load position, and D/d (head diameter to <b>shank</b> <b>diameter</b> ratio) for D/d in the range 1. 5 Q D/d Q 2. 0.

40|$|AbstractThe rotary draw bending(RDB) {{of large}} {{diameter}} thin-walled (LDTW) tube needs the strict cooperation of multiple processing parameters to avoid possible multiple defects. Due {{to the specific}} properties, the bending behaviors of LDTW commercial pure titanium (CP-Ti) tube are much more complex to achieve precise deformation. With the CP-Ti tube of 50. 8 mm (out diameter, D) × 0. 508 mm (wall thickness, t) × 101. 6 mm (bending radius, R) as a representative component, the bending behaviors of LDTW CP-Ti tube under different processing conditions were investigated. With experiments and analytical analysis, the bending characteristics of the CP-Ti tube were identified. Then, based on the orthogonal experimental design, a series of three-dimensional FE models of RDB for LDTW CP-Ti tube were established, {{and the effects of}} processing parameters on the bending behaviors were numerically investigated. The results show that: 1) Wrinkling is the primary behavior for the LDTW CP-Ti tube in RDB, and the larger the difference between the maximum wall thickening and the maximum wall thinning degrees of the bent tube, the larger the wrinkling tendency; 2) The bending behaviors of the LDTW CP-Ti tube are very sensitive to the some processing parameters, and the wrinkling is significantly affected by the mandrel <b>shank</b> <b>diameter,</b> while the wall thinning is remarkably affected by the clearance between wiper die and tube, mandrel <b>shank</b> <b>diameter.</b> The qualified bent tube with the wall thinning of 11. 43 %, the cross-section distortion of 2. 69 % and the wrinkling height less than 2 % is then obtained...|$|E

Bibliography: leaves [161]- 171. xvi, 171 l illus., tablesAn {{investigation}} was undertaken to determine gene {{action in the}} inheritance of agronomic traits in a diallel set of eight inbred lines of sweet corn and all possible Fl hybrids, including parents. Data were analyzed by Jinks and Hayman's diallel analysis for plant and ear height, weight with and without husk, shank and ear length, ear and cob diameter, kernel depth, and mid-silking days. Additive effects and environmental variations were significantly different from zero for April, June, and Combined dates of planting. Estimates of the component of variation due to dominance effects were significantly different from zero except for shank length and cob diameter in June and ear length in April planting. The parents carried an excess of dominant genes for plant height, ear length, weight with and without husk, mid-silking days, and an excess of recessive genes for shank length. Dominant and recessive alleles of each gene were distributed nearly equal among the parents for ear diameter, cob diameter, and kernel depth. Ear length, <b>shank</b> length, cob <b>diameter,</b> and mid-silking days for the June planting and ear height in Combined dates of planting were within the partial dominance range. Heritability estimates supported the conclusion that selection for weight with and without husk, mid-silking days, and ear height would be most effective and that selection for ear diameter, plant height, ear length, shank length, and kernel depth would be least effective. Eight inbred lines of sweet corn, including parents, Fl's, F 2 's, and first backcrosses were tested at two locations in one year. The population means obtained were used to estimate additive, dominance, additive x additive, additive x dominance, and dominance x dominance gene effects for nine quantitative agronomic traits. Additive gene effects {{appeared to be the}} most constant over locations for plant and ear height. Dominance gene effects for weight with and without husk, and ear length were more important than those of additive effects. The remaining types of gene effects indicated very little stability over locations for most of the agronomic traits studied. The relative magnitude of expected genetic gain expressed as a percentage F 2 mean would suggest that rapid progress should be accomplished by selecting and recombining in early generations for plant height in the crosses AA 11 x AA 18 and AA 8 x 190 a. Slower progress should be expected from crosses AA 18 x 190 a, AA 11 x 245, AA 2 x AA 11, and AA 20 x P 39. For ear height, rapid progress should be expected from crosses AA 18 x AA 20, AA 11 x AA 18, AA 8 x 190 a, and AA 2 x AA 11. For weight with husk, good progress should be expected from crosses AA 11 x AA 18, AA 11 x 245, AA 8 x 190 a, AA 2 x AA 11, and AA 20 x P 39. For ear length, rapid progress should be expected from crosses AA 18 x 190 a, AA 11 x AA 18, and AA 20 x P 39. For the nine crosses considered, it was concluded that most of the variation was due to additive and dominance gene effects with epistasis being some importance...|$|R

Shank length and diameter, weight {{and length of}} the first primary wing feather, and distance between the junction of upper and lower mandibles and auditory canal (face length) were used to classify bilateral types and measure relative asymmetry (RA) in six genetic stocks. The stocks were the S 23 generation of White Leghorn lines selected for high or low antibody response to SRBC, sublines in which selection had been relaxed for eight generations, and reciprocal crosses of the selected lines. Differences were found among all stocks for the traits measured. Rankings among traits for RA in descending order were face length, <b>shank</b> <b>diameter,</b> feather weight, and shank and feather lengths. The RA of shank and feather lengths {{did not differ from}} each other. An overall RA composed of mean RA of the five traits showed that the two selected lines exhibited greater RA than the crosses between them. The RA of the two lines where selection had been relaxed was similar to that of selected lines.

40|$|A lot of {{engineering}} effort {{is currently being}} invested {{in the development of}} Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLV) to lower launch costs and provide economical access to space in such vehi-cles. Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) are very favorable materials for hot structures and thermal protection systems (TPS). In addition to the improvement of the material itself, the development of suitable joining techniques is very important. Due to the high application temperatures, joining methods based on high temperature resistant materials are required. Depending on the operation of space re-entry vehicles in some cases joining elements are needed which have on the one hand the capability to attach TPS elements onto the vehicle structure with only external access. On the other hand they must be able to withstand high temperatures up to about 1600 °C. This value is derived from a real scenario of the re-entry of NASAs X- 38 experimental space vehicle. Besides, random vibration loads are introduced during the flight phases, strictly speaking the launch and the re-entry phase. In the past such kind of joining elements have been developed by DLR and were pre-qualified during a test campaign within the FESTIP-I program (Fig. 1) and patented. Respec-tively a fastener (Fig. 2) was designed for the FESTIP-Program which was locked by pulling in a cone. The fastener had a conical shank which is pressed together while inserting it into the conical nut. To provide sufficient deformation capability for the shank, the fastener with a <b>shank</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 mm had a minimum length of 35 mm. In a continuation of the developments mentioned the performance under a fatigue load en-vironment had to be proven and in addition a shorter structure length was required. Therefore a new ceramic fastener (Fig. 3), which combines the function of a screw and a rivet and which enables a shorter structure length, has been developed at DLR within a contract with ESTEC (Netherlands) and ERA (England).

40|$|Terminating {{action is}} a {{remedial}} repair which entails the replacement of shear head countersunk rivets with universal head rivets which have a larger <b>shank</b> <b>diameter.</b> The procedure was developed to eliminate the risk of widespread fatigue damage (WFD) in the upper rivet row of a fuselage lap joint. A test and evaluation program has been conducted by Foster-Miller, Inc. (FMI) to evaluate the terminating action repair of the upper rivet row of a commercial aircraft fuselage lap splice. Two full scale fatigue tests were conducted on fuselage panels using the growth of fatigue cracks in the lap joint. The second test was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the terminating action repair. In both tests, cyclic pressurization loading was applied to the panels while crack propagation was recorded at all rivet locations at regular intervals to generate detailed data on conditions of fatigue crack initiation, ligament link-up, and fuselage fracture. This program demonstrated that the terminating action repair substantially increases the fatigue life of a fuselage panel structure and effectively eliminates the occurrence of cracking in the upper rivet row of the lap joint. While high cycle crack growth was recorded in the middle rivet row during the second test, failure was not imminent when the test was terminated after cycling to well beyond the service life. The program also demonstrated that the initiation, propagation, and linkup of WFD in full-scale fuselage structures can be simulated and quantitatively studied in the laboratory. This paper presents an overview of the testing program and provides a detailed discussion of the data analysis and results. Crack distribution and propagation rates and directions as well as frequency of cracking are presented for both tests. The progression of damage to linkup of adjacent cracks and to eventual overall panel failure is discussed. In addition, an assessment of the effectiveness of the terminating action repair and the occurrence of cracking in the middle rivet row is provided, and conclusions of practical interest are drawn...|$|E
40|$|Background: For decades, genetic {{improvement}} based on measuring growth and body composition traits {{has been successfully}} applied {{in the production of}} meat-type chickens. However, this conventional approach is hindered by antagonistic genetic correlations between some traits and the high cost of measuring body composition traits. Marker-assisted selection should overcome these problems by selecting loci that have effects on either one trait only or on more than one trait but with a favorable genetic correlation. In the present study, identification of such loci was done by genotyping an F 2 intercross between fat and lean lines divergently selected for abdominal fatness genotyped with a medium-density genetic map (120 microsatellites and 1302 single nucleotide polymorphisms). Genome scan linkage analyses were performed for growth (body weight at 1, 3, 5, and 7 weeks, and shank length and diameter at 9 weeks), body composition at 9 weeks (abdominal fat weight and percentage, breast muscle weight and percentage, and thigh weight and percentage), and for several physiological measurements at 7 weeks in the fasting state, i. e. body temperature and plasma levels of IGF-I, NEFA and glucose. Interval mapping analyses were performed with the QTLMap software, including single-trait analyses with single and multiple QTL on the same chromosome. [br/] Results: Sixty-seven QTL were detected, most of which had never been described before. Of these 67 QTL, 47 were detected by single-QTL analyses and 20 by multiple-QTL analyses, which underlines the importance of using different statistical models. Close analysis of the genes located in the defined intervals identified several relevant functional candidates, such as ACACA for abdominal fatness, GHSR and GAS 1 for breast muscle weight, DCRX and ASPSCR 1 for plasma glucose content, and ChEBP for <b>shank</b> <b>diameter.</b> [br/] Conclusions: The medium-density genetic map enabled us to genotype new regions of the chicken genome (including micro-chromosomes) that influenced the traits investigated. With this marker density, confidence intervals were sufficiently small (14 cM on average) to search for candidate genes. Altogether, this new information provides a valuable starting point for the identification of causative genes responsible for important QTL controlling growth, body composition and metabolic traits in the broiler chicken...|$|E
