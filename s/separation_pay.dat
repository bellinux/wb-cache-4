2500|$|PAL has {{a history}} of labor {{relations}} problems. On June 15, 1998, PAL retrenched 5,000 of its employees, including more than 1,400 flight attendants and stewards to allegedly reduce costs and alleviate financial downturn in airline industry as consequence of Asian financial crisis. Represented by Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), the retrenched employees particularly the 1,400 cabin crews seek remedy for their problem through judicial process and filed a complaint on the grounds of unfair labor practice and illegal retrenchment. It took a decade before it was finally settled. It passed the Labor Arbiter to the National Labor Relations Commission then to the Court of Appeals and, finally, to the Supreme Court. The Philippine Highest Tribunal favored the aggrieved party and on July 22, 2008, in its 32-page decision ordered PAL to [...] "reinstate the cabin crew personnel who were covered by the retrenchment of and demotion scheme of June 15, 1998 made effective on July 15, 1998, without loss of seniority right and other privileges, and to pay them full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other monetary benefits computed from the time of their separation up to time of actual reinstatement, provided that with respect to those who have received their respective <b>separation</b> <b>pay,</b> the amount of payments shall be deducted from their backwages." [...] The Supreme Court further explained that there was a failure on the part of PAL to substantiate its claims of actual and imminent substantial losses. Although the Asian financial fiasco severely affected the airline, PAL defense of bankruptcy and rehabilitation are untenable; hence, the retrenchment policy is not justified.|$|E

40|$|Using a large German linked employer-employee {{data set}} {{and methods of}} {{competing}} risks analysis, this paper investigates gender differences in job separation rates to employment and nonemployment. In line with descriptive evidence, we find lower job-to-job and higher job-to-nonemployment transition probabilities for women than men when controlling for individual and workplace characteristics and unobserved plant heterogeneity. These differences vanish once we allow these characteristics to affect separations differently by gender. When additionally controlling for wages, we find that both separation rates are considerably lower and also significantly less wage-elastic for women than for men. job <b>separations,</b> gender, gender <b>pay</b> gap, Germany...|$|R
2500|$|For example, some {{countries}} and cultures value the trait of assertiveness and personal accomplishment while others instead place more merit on cooperation and interpersonal connection. [...] Countries scoring high on assertiveness consider PA to {{be a way}} of assuring equity among employees so that higher performing employees receive greater rewards or higher salaries. [...] Countries scoring low on assertiveness but higher in interpersonal relations may not like the social <b>separation</b> and <b>pay</b> inequity of higher/lower performing employees; employees from this more cooperative rather than individualistic culture place more concern on interpersonal relationships with other employees rather than on individual interests. [...] High assertive countries value performance feedback for self-management and effectiveness purposes while countries low in assertiveness view performance feedback as [...] "threatening and obtrusive". [...] In this case, the PA of the high assertive countries would likely not be beneficial for countries scoring lower in assertiveness to employ. [...] However, countries scoring lower in assertiveness could employ PA for purposes of improving long-term communication development within the organization such as clarifying job objectives, guide training and development plans, and lessen the gap between job performance and organizational expectations.|$|R
30|$|However, {{there is}} also always a non-negligible share of job {{switchers}} who have experienced downward mobility (cf. Gibbons and Katz 1991). Whereas voluntary quits are most often associated with <b>separations</b> to higher <b>paying</b> jobs, involuntary lay-offs are associated with a switch to lower wages (McLaughlin 1991), which Gibbons and Katz (1991) explain with the ‘lemon effect’ causing laid-off workers having troubles with finding a new job. The importance {{of the nature of}} the switch is also highlighted by recent results of Fitzenberger et al. (2015). Providing evidence concerning the occupational mobility of recent apprenticeship completers in the German labour market, they find that mere job switches inside the occupation but between firms most often lead to a wage loss, while occupational mobility is associated with a wage gain in most cases. However, they point out that occupation-and-firm switches only result in a gain if this switch reflects an occupational upgrading, while occupation switches within the firm, which reflect a switch to a better fitting position, are usually associated with a wage gain.|$|R

40|$|Severance pay, a fixed-sum {{payment to}} workers at job {{separation}}, {{has been the}} focus of intense policy concern for the last several decades, but much of this concern is unearned. The design of the ideal separation package is outlined and severance pay emerges as a natural component of job displacement insurance packages, serving both as scheduled reemployment wage insurance and, if search moral hazard is a problem, as scheduled UI. Like any firm-financed <b>separation</b> expenditure, severance <b>pay</b> can induce excessive job retention, but such distortions do not appear to be of practical significance at benefit levels typically mandated in the industrialized world. Moreover there is no evidence that firms attempt to avoid these firing cost distortions by substituting severance savings plans, which have zero firing costs. Indeed severance insurance plans similar to those mandated are often offered voluntarily in the U. S. The appropriate role of government in the market for severance pay is briefly considered...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} companies choosing {{to separate the}} tax and audit function prior to and subsequent {{to the passage of}} the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2 ̆ 2 the Act 2 ̆ 2). While the provision of tax services is not currently prohibited by the Act, some companies have separated these two functions. An examination of the relationship between tax function separation and audit quality, financial statement visibility and tax minimization proxies is performed for two different samples: (1) a matched pair design for companies engaging their audit firm for tax work in 2001 (2 years before the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was placed in effect) and then separating the tax and audit function by 2003 (the effective year of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and (2) a logistic regression analysis on all companies in the Russell 2000, a major market index, for 2002 - 2004. The data used in this study is compiled from proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commercially available information from I/B/E/S, COMPUSTAT and AuditAnalytics. ^ After controls for size, industry and growth are added to the model, the results reveal that in some years <b>separation</b> companies <b>pay</b> significantly less for their audit and, as a consequence, have higher instances of financial statement restatement. These results support the idea that the integration of audit and tax provide a better quality audit, supporting prior empirical work of Kinney et al. (2004) and anecdotal evidence from accounting firms. Some evidence for 2004 exists that separation companies are actually becoming less visible in the capital markets. Given that audit quality, analyst following, share turnover and management ownership are decreasing, this implies that these companies are less concerned with financial reporting quality. Overall, these findings suggest that tax service separation may be motivated by factors beyond merely shopping for the best tax provider. ...|$|R

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Young Lives younger cohort, we {{examine the effect of}} {{economic}} shocks on nutritional achievement, schooling and child work of index children (at age 5), controlling for various individual and household characteristics. Shocks that occurred {{both before and after the}} child was born are considered. Data used was from the Round 1 and Round 2 surveys, collected in the third quarter of 2002 and 2006 respectively. The most serious shocks reported to have occurred before the child’s birth are: (1) decrease in food availability; (2) crop failure; (3) death of livestock; (4) severe illness or injury; (5) loss of job/source of income/family enterprise; (6) birth of new household member’ (7) death of a household member. Although they have less perceived impact on child welfare, other shocks reported included crime, divorce or <b>separation</b> of family, <b>paying</b> for child's education, and migration of family members. Shocks that occurred after the child’s birth included: (1) illness and death of household member; (2) drought; (3) crop failure; (4) pests and diseases; (5) shutdown of place of employment or job loss; (6) natural disasters such as drought and flooding; (7) divorce or separation; (8) death of livestock; (9) increased input prices; (10) decreased output prices; (11) theft and robbery; (12) having to pay for education; and (13) birth of a new household member. We found a significant effect of shocks on nutrition. Not only shocks that occurred after the child was born but those that happened up to five years before the child was born, signalling the longterm consequence of shocks on child growth. On the other hand, recent shocks have more negative impacts on child schooling and work than shocks that occurred some time ago...|$|R
