5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid</b> at such temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid</b> state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a depth of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid,</b> possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantages}} of <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid</b> extraction (compared with liquid extraction) {{are that it}} is relatively rapid because of the low viscosities and high diffusivities associated with supercritical fluids. The extraction can be selective to some extent by controlling {{the density of the}} medium, and the extracted material is easily recovered by simply depressurizing, allowing the <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid</b> to return to gas phase and evaporate leaving little or no solvent residues. Carbon dioxide is the most common supercritical solvent. It is used on a large scale for the decaffeination of green coffee beans, the extraction of hops for beer production, and the production of essential oils and pharmaceutical products from plants. A few laboratory test methods include the use of <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid</b> extraction as an extraction method instead of using traditional solvents.|$|E
40|$|<b>Supercritical</b> <b>fluids</b> have {{different}} properties compared to regular fluids and {{could play a}} role as life-sustaining solvents on other worlds. Even on Earth, some bacterial species {{have been shown to}} be tolerant to <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluids.</b> The special properties of <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluids,</b> which include various types of selectivities (e. g., stereo-, regio-, and chemo-selectivity) have recently been recognized in biotechnology and used to catalyze reactions that do not occur in water. One suitable example is enzymes when they are exposed to <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluids</b> such as <b>supercritical</b> carbon dioxide: enzymes become even more stable, because they are conformationally rigid in the dehydrated state. Furthermore, enzymes in anhydrous organic solvents exhibit a “molecular memory”, i. e., the capacity to “remember” a conformational or pH state from being exposed to a previous solvent. Planetary environments with <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluids,</b> particularly <b>supercritical</b> carbon dioxide, exist, even on Earth (below the ocean floor), on Venus, and likely on Super-Earth type exoplanets. These planetary environments may present a possible habitat for exotic life...|$|R

25|$|The {{formation}} of small particles of a substance {{with a narrow}} size distribution is an important process in the pharmaceutical and other industries. <b>Supercritical</b> <b>fluids</b> provide {{a number of ways}} of achieving this by rapidly exceeding the saturation point of a solute by dilution, depressurization or a combination of these. These processes occur faster in <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluids</b> than in liquids, promoting nucleation or spinodal decomposition over crystal growth and yielding very small and regularly sized particles. Recent <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluids</b> have shown the capability to reduce particles up to a range of 5-2000nm.|$|R

25|$|Supercritical fluids {{act as a}} {{new media}} for the {{generation}} of novel crystalline forms of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) named as pharmaceutical cocrystals. <b>Supercritical</b> <b>fluid</b> technology offers a new platform that allows a single-step generation of particles that are difficult or even impossible to obtain by traditional techniques. The generation of pure and dried new cocrystals (crystalline molecular complexes comprising the API and one or more conformers in the crystal lattice) can be achieved due to unique properties of SCFs by using different <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid</b> properties: supercritical CO2 solvent power, anti-solvent effect and its atomization enhancement.|$|E

40|$|<b>Supercritical</b> <b>fluids</b> {{have been}} studied and used as the working fluids in power {{generation}} system for both high- and low-grade heat conversions. Low-grade heat sources, typically defined as below 300 ºC, are abundantly available as industrial waste heat, solar thermal, and geothermal, to name a few. However, they are under-exploited for power conversion because of the low conversion efficiency. Technologies that allow the efficient conversion of low-grade heat into mechanical or electrical power {{are very important to}} develop. First part of this chapter investigates the potential of supercritical Rankine cycles in the conversion of low-grade heat to power, while the second part discusses <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluids</b> used in higher grade heat conversion system. The selection of <b>supercritical</b> working <b>fluids</b> for a <b>supercritical</b> Rankine cycle is of key importance.

25|$|Impregnation is, in essence, the {{converse}} of extraction. A substance is dissolved in the <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid,</b> the solution flowed past a solid substrate, and is deposited on or dissolves in the substrate. Dyeing, which is readily {{carried out on}} polymer fibres such as polyester using disperse (non-ionic) dyes, is a special case of this. Carbon dioxide also dissolves in many polymers, considerably swelling and plasticising them and further accelerating the diffusion process.|$|E
25|$|In 1822, Baron Charles Cagniard de la Tour {{discovered}} the critical {{point of a}} substance in his famous cannon barrel experiments.

Above this temperature, the densities of the liquid and gas phases become equal and the distinction between them disappears, resulting in a single <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid</b> phase.|$|E
25|$|Supercritical drying is {{a method}} of {{removing}} solvent without surface tension effects. As a liquid dries, the surface tension drags on small structures within a solid, causing distortion and shrinkage. Under supercritical conditions there is no surface tension, and the <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid</b> can be removed without distortion.

25|$|In the diagram, {{the blue}} line marking the {{boundary}} between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely, but terminates at a point called the critical point.

Above the critical point, there are no longer separate liquid and gas phases: there is only a generic fluid phase referred to as a <b>supercritical</b> <b>fluid.</b> In water, the critical point occurs at around 647 K (374°C or 705°F) and 22.064 MPa.|$|E
25|$|The {{mobile phase}} is the phase that moves in a {{definite}} direction.

The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of HPLC the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or a polar solvent such as methanol in reverse phase chromatography and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated.|$|E
