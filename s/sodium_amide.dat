Throughout the last decade, intense research on complex metals hydrides has been made.

A mixture of LiNH 2 and NaNH 2 is found and confirmed to be stable: Li 6 Na 2 (NH 2) 8, as earlier reported. Both the crystal and electronic state was calculated. The structure of Li 6 Na 2 (NH 2) 8 belongs to space group I- 4. This is the same space which also belongs to LiNH 2.
