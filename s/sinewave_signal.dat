From the measured C-V plot, the capacitance was always positive with negative and positive bias.

40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of lock detector algorithms for Costas loops have ignored {{the effects of}} the inherent correlation between samples of the phase error process. In this paper, both analysis and simulations are used to quantify the effects of phase correlation on lock detection for the 'square law' and 'absolute value' type detectors. Results are obtained which depict the lock detection probability as a function of loop signal-to-noise ratio for a given false alarm rate. It is shown that the square law detector experiences less degradation due to phase jitter than the absolute value detector and that the degradation in detector signal-to-noise ratio is more pronounced for squarewave than for <b>sinewave</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{following}} {{application note}} provides {{an insight into}} the mathematical definitions of quantization and thermal noise, parameters which can significantly affect the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-noise plus distortion (SINAD) specifications of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in RF receiver applications. It concludes by comparing {{their impact on the}} effective noise figure for a Nyquist and oversampling ADC. When using a Nyquist analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in a sampling or sub-sampling receiver application, an RF designer needs to know the ADC's effective noise figure, in order to perform determine the cascaded noise figure for the complete receiver line-up. The following discussion assumes that the noise is flat across the converter's Nyquist band and provides a designer with the means to determine an estimate for the ADC effective noise figure. Additionally, this article provides a direct comparison of the effective noise figure for a Nyquist ADC and an oversampling ADC. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an ADC is the ratio of the signal power to the non-signal power. Non-signal power includes thermal noise, quantization noise, and other residual errors in the converter, measured in the Nyquist bandwidth (fSAMPLE/ 2) of the ADC. SNR is typically defined for a continuous <b>sinewave</b> <b>signal</b> applied to the ADC input at some level below the full-scale (FS) level of the converter, usually 0. 5 dB to 1 dB. The ADC converts the signal into discrete output levels using a nonlinear process. The smallest discrete step is called th...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{contribution}} in nonlinear systems {{is very different}} from that in linear systems. The noise effects in nonlinear systems can be complicated and not obvious to predict. In this thesis, the focus was on the noise {{contribution in}} nonlinear systems when measuring with the nonlinear vector network analyzer (NVNA). An additional noise source together with a single <b>sinewave</b> <b>signal</b> was fed into the input of the amplifier and the performance was studied. The input power of the amplifier is considered to be the sum of the noise power and the signal power. The variation of the 1 dB compression point and the third order interception point as functions of the added noise power were studied. From the measured results in this thesis, the 1 dB compression point referred to the output power will decrease when increasing the added noise power at the input of the amplifier. The contribution of the added noise to the 1 dB compression point of an amplifier is considered dual: with the added noise the linear regression lines of the AM/AM curves are changed, and due to hard clipping the useful output power is reduced. As a result of those two effects, the added noise made the compression start at a lower power level. When the added noise reaches a certain level, the 1 dB compression point is hard to measure. Thus when performing nonlinear measurements, the noise effects should be taken into considerations and further studies are required to get better understanding of the system’s behavior in noisy environment...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a new dynamic testing method for {{effective}} bit number evaluation of digitizing signal analyzers. This technique is valid when, owing to particular working conditions, {{only a limited number}} of the <b>sinewave</b> test <b>signal</b> periods can be collected. In such a case, existing test methodologies can present problems for a correct application. The proposed method is based on a regression algorithm and, by virtue of employing the acquisition of a <b>sinewave</b> test <b>signal</b> for a time interval enclosing only three zero crossings of the sinewave, requires a very short computational time. After a brief summary of existing test methodologies, the performances and limits of the-proposed method are analyzed and highlighted.

40|$|In 5 experiments, {{the authors}} {{investigated}} how listeners {{learn to recognize}} unfamiliar talkers and how experience with specific utterances generalizes to novel instances. Listeners were trained over several days to identify 10 talkers from natural, sinewave, or reversed speech sentences. The <b>sinewave</b> <b>signals</b> preserved phonetic and some suprasegmental properties while eliminating natural vocal quality. In contrast, the reversed speech signals preserved vocal quality while distorting temporally based phonetic properties. The training results indicate that listeners learned to identify talkers even from acoustic signals lacking natural vocal quality. Generalization performance varied across the different signals and depended on the salience of phonetic information. The results suggest similarities in the phonetic attributes underlying talker recognition and phonetic perception. When a talker produces an utterance, the listener simultaneously apprehends the linguistic form of the message {{as well as the}} nonlinguistic attributes of the talker’s unique vocal anatomy and pronunciation habits.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} theory {{behind the}} noise power ratio (NPR) testing of ADCs. A mid-riser formulation {{is used for}} mathematical simplicity. Simulated results, using DAC generated signals, suggests that the uniformly distributed signal is easier to implement and is more sensitive to amplitude dependent distortions. 1. Introduction Historically, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have been characterized for static and dynamic error performance using ramp and <b>sinewave</b> test <b>signals</b> respectively. However, many modern applications that deal with wideband signals such as telephone super groups, multiplexed data channels, cellular base station receivers, and others, require some form of wideband, random (or pseudo-random) noise structure {{to be used as}} characterization signals to check ADC response to such signals. Since wideband signals induce intermodulation distortion rather than harmonic distortion as observed with single tones, it is often felt that wideband testing provides more reassur [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted in which listeners were presented with audio-visual sentences in a transcription task. The visual components of the stimuli consisted of a male talker's face. The acoustic components consisted of : (1) natural speech (2) envelope-shaped noise which preserved the duration and amplitude of the original speech waveform and (3) various types of <b>sinewave</b> speech <b>signals</b> that followed the formant frequencies of a natural utterance. Sinewave speech is a skeletonized version of a natural utterance which contains frequency and amplitude variation of the formants, but lacks any fine-grained acoustic structure of speech. Intelligibility of the present set of sinewave sentences was relatively low in contrast to previous findings (Remez, Rubin, Pisoni, & Carrell 1981). However, intelligibility was greatly increased when visual information from a talkers face was presented along with the auditory stimuli. Further experiments demonstrated that the intelligibility of single tones increased differentially depending on which formant analog was presented. It was predicted {{that the increase in}} intelligibility for the sinewave speech with an added video display would be greater than the gain observed with envelope-shaped noise. This prediction {{is based on the assumption}} that the information-bearing phonetic properties of spoken utterances are preserved in the audio+visual sine-wave conditions. This prediction was borne out for the tonal analog of the second formant (T 2), but not the tonal analog of the first formant (T 1) or third formant (T 3), suggesting that the information contained in the T 2 analog is relevant for audiovisual integration...|$|R
