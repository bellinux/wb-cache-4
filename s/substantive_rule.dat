This is followed by an analysis of the views of known scholars on the determination of <b>substantive</b> <b>rules</b> of IIL highlighting the controversies within the ITA system. Then, after noting the problems arising out of the conflicting ITA awards and the complicated nexus of state obligations, the article argues that the solution to the ITA systemic problems is in finding a new foundation for the system based on solid <b>substantive</b> <b>rules</b> and collective values. In conclusion, a road map has been advanced for the accomplishment of this collective value system...|$|R

Insolvency Act. The thesis analyzes their meaning and purpose, mentioning relevant judicial decisions and their historical context. Also foreign literature and expert monographs dedicated to insolvency law are mentioned. Questions of proposed amendments to the Insolvency Act related {{to the theme of}} the thesis are discussed, and personal opinions of the author on selected insolvency issues are included. The thesis is divided into 5 chapters, which analyze substantive norms of the Insolvency Act. Chapters Two, Three and Four form the core of the thesis. The first chapter defines procedural law and substantive law, relations between the Insolvency Act and other legal regulations, and its position in the system of law. The second chapter deals with different stages of insolvency proceedings, especially with the legal effects of the commencement of insolvency, bankruptcy but also with remedial ways of solving bankruptcy - reorganisation and debt relief. All the above mentioned is dealt with taking into account <b>substantive</b> <b>rules</b> of the Insolvency Act. The third chapter is dedicated to questions of liability of parties to insolvency proceedings, to the [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|If, as O'Connor had argued, the FAA {{was merely}} {{procedural}} law, why would Congress have limited it to maritime and interstate transactions? [...] "We therefore view the 'involving commerce' requirement in § 2, {{not as an}} inexplicable limitation {{on the power of}} the federal courts, but as a necessary qualification on a statute intended to apply in state and federal courts." [...] O'Connor's interpretation would lead to forum shopping, Burger wrote: We are unwilling to attribute to Congress the intent, in drawing on the comprehensive powers of the Commerce Clause, to create a right to enforce an arbitration contract and yet make the right dependent for its enforcement on the particular forum in which it is asserted. And since the overwhelming proportion of all civil litigation in this country is in the state courts, we cannot believe Congress intended to limit the Arbitration Act to disputes subject only to federal court jurisdiction. Such an interpretation would frustrate congressional intent to place [...] "an arbitration agreement [...] [...] [...] upon the same footing as other contracts, where it belongs."In creating a <b>substantive</b> <b>rule</b> applicable in state as well as federal courts, Congress intended to foreclose state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements. We hold that § 31512 of the California Franchise Investment Law violates the Supremacy Clause.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{customary}} {{international law}} (2 ̆ 2 CIL 2 ̆ 2) by courts in the United States, long the subject of debate among scholars, has finally come {{to the attention of}} the Supreme Court. In the last few years, the Court has interpreted and applied CIL to interpret provisions of the U. S. Constitution, to interpret statutes and treaties, and as a <b>substantive</b> <b>rule</b> of decision. While the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s renewed interest in {{customary international law}} has drawn much praise, it has also sparked sharp criticism. The purpose of this symposium essay is not to recapitulate these disagreements, but instead, to identify a different problem with the interpretive and substantive use of CIL by federal and state courts. Whether a court uses CIL as a tool for statutory or constitutional interpretation or as a <b>substantive</b> <b>rule</b> of decision, the court 2 ̆ 7 s usage creates potentially serious structural conflicts in the U.

40|$|Introduction__ Imagine the {{following}} example. A {{woman has a}} job interview and is turned down because ulti-mately the employer prefers a man for the position. The woman goes to court to seek justice. The court in fact does allow the woman’s claim {{because there is a}} <b>substantive</b> <b>rule</b> of equal op-portunity in private law forbidding gender discrimination in employment contracts. According to the private law system that the court had to apply, the appropriate remedy is compensation for damage. However, as there was no contract between the woman and the employer, in effect the pecuniary damage that the woman suffered were the travel expenses she made {{in order to get to}} the job interview. That was all she got compensated for. This is a silly example of a case in which the <b>substantive</b> <b>rule,</b> which aimed at preventing gender discrimination, was defeated by an inefficacious enforcement instrument. It is obvious that if pri-vate law rules aim at preventing a wrong, then the remedy should at least aspire to have a pre-ventive effect. So, this example sounds like a bad joke about lawyers. In fact, the joke gets worse...|$|E

The paper attempts to separate the formal from the <b>substantive</b> <b>rule</b> of law and therein the rule of law is regarded as the fundamental value in the legal systems of international organizations such as the United Nations, the European Union and the Council of Europe. The conclusion shows the viewpoints of the Croatian Constitutional Court on the principle of the rule of law in concrete judgements...|$|E

In overruling the trial court’s order allowing such ex parte communications, the 2010 decision comports {{with the majority of}} state courts that prohibit such informal discovery techniques. Notably, however, the Missouri court did not rest its holding on any state <b>substantive</b> <b>rule</b> expressly prohibiting ex parte communications, but on the court’s interpretation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The Proctor court is the only tribunal that has {{held that the}} HIPAA Privacy Rule, as opposed to state substantive law, does not authorize such communications, pitting itself against many sister state courts that have interpreted the HIPAA confidentiality regulations to the contrary...|$|E

40|$|On October 1, 1973 the Supreme Court promulgated rules {{prescribing}} {{the practice}} and procedure to be followed in cases and proceedings governed by Chapters I-VII and Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act. The procedural changes are extensive, permeating every stage of straight bankruptcy and Chapter XIII Wage Earner proceedings. One {{of the more important}} rules is Bankruptcy Rule 13 - 307 (d), which deals with claims of secured creditors in Wage Earner proceedings under Chapter XIII. Secured creditors have challenged the validity of Rule 13 - 307 (d), claiming that the rule modifies the secured party 2 ̆ 7 s substantive right to full recovery of the contract price. Thus, they allege that it is a <b>substantive</b> <b>rule</b> of law and outside the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s rulemaking power. Various courts have made conflicting decisions.

40|$|I {{have been}} asked to make a few remarks {{regarding}} Arthur Laby 2 ̆ 7 s presentation, but, as everyone knows, {{it is very hard to}} discuss anything with the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”). As far as I can see, the conceptual interplay of ‘disclosure versus substantive rules,‘ or rather — in its historical order — ‘substantive rules versus disclosure,‘ has not yet been widely discussed in Europe. Let me first set out what I mean by the two approaches as there are probably differences of definition between the United States and Europe, and, indeed, my understanding differs a bit from the one presented by my colleague, Mr. Laby. Let me try a rough definition: the <b>substantive</b> <b>rule</b> concept encompasses not only rules for disclosure of sufficient information to the client, but also requires that intermediaries owe further duties to the client in good faith. The client must be ‘tutored,‘ even though the degree of such tutoring is subject to a variety of opinions...|$|E
