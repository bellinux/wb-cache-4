40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we propose a novel, rapid and simple {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the identification and quantitation of individual phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species from natural mixtures. To overcome difficulties deriving from the lack of adequate standards and from the variability of the responses to UV <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>detectors</b> currently used in HPLC analysis, we first fractionated and quantitated the major molecular species of a commercial egg PC by means of a preparative column. The identification of PC molecular species was confirmed by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of fatty acids. We employed the fractions recovered from preparative HPLC to determine the detector calibration factors of the individual molecular species separated using an analytical, high-speed, reversed-phase HPLC column. The proposed method seems to be adequate for the analysis of PC from many biological sources. Its application to the analysis of human hepatic and gallbladder biliary PC is show...|$|R

In particular: 	investigation of natural and synthetic AASs and their main metabolites in urine by HPLC-MS/MS developing easy, quick and highly specific multiresidue analyses; allowing to determine excretion profiles and the ratios between conjugated and free fractions of the target compounds. 	development of direct methods for the determination of exogenous human Growth Hormone (hGH) administration in human biological fluids, using CE- UV/Vis for screening purposes and Mass Spectrometry (with Q/ToF system) for confirmatory purposes.

The analytical technique used, alternative to the routinely used technique in official laboratories (GC-MS with hydrolysis of the sample prior to determination of the total fraction of the excreted hormone), is the HPLC coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS). This technique is extremely selective in Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode and allows certain identification of the investigated molecules. The developed methods will allow to simultaneously analyze the Phase I (free fraction) and Phase II (conjugated fraction) metabolites of these hormones in a single chromatographic run without manipulation of the sample (no hydrolysis and derivatisation) apart from an early stage of clean up.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of new bitropone derivatives, namely, 3, 3 '-biphenyl- 2, 2 '-bitropone and 7, 7 '-biphenyl- 2, 2 '-bitropone, are reported. Isolation of enantiomers arising from restricted rotation around the C-C bond connecting the tropone moieties was attempted {{by means of}} chiral high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). No separation was obtained for 7, 7 '-biphenyl- 2, 2 '-bitropone. For 3, 3 '-biphenyl- 2, 2 '-bitropone, difficulties were encountered because of the low separation factor of the peaks {{and the presence of}} a rapid racemization process. However, quantitative chiroptical data on the antipodes were obtained by linking a circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer and a UV-vis <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>detector</b> in series to the HPLC instrument. The analysis of the CD and UV-vis spectra in terms of absolute conformations was done with the help of theoretical calculations performed at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level. The most stable conformations of the 3, 3 '-biphenyl- 2, 2 '-bitropone in its ground state were obtained. Starting from these minimum energy conformations, it was possible to compute theoretical CD and UV absorption spectra that fit well with the experimental ones. From this comparison the absolute configuration to the antipodes was assigned. Finally, the effect of the presence of the two lateral phenyl substituents on the structure of the bitropone and hence on the CD spectrum is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a dental amalgam electrode (DAE) to evaluate the electrochemical behaviour and to develop an electroanalytical procedure for determination of diquat herbicide in natural water and potato samples. The work was based on the square wave voltammetry responses of diquat, which presented two well-defined and reversible reduction peaks, at - 0. 56 V (peak 1) and - 1. 00 V (peak 2). The experimental and voltammetric parameters were optimised, and the analytical curves were constructed and compared to similar curves performed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet-visible <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>detector</b> (HPLC/UV-vis). The responses were directly proportional to diquat concentration in a large interval of concentration, and the calculated detection limits were very similar, around 10 mu g L(- 1) (10 ppb) for voltammetric and chromatographic experiments. These values were lower than the maximum residue limit established for natural water by the Brazilian Environmental Agency. The recovery percentages in pure electrolyte, natural water and potato samples showed values from 70 % to 130 %, demonstrating that the voltammetric methodology proposed is suitable for determining any contamination by diquat in different samples, minimising the toxic residues due to the use of liquid mercury or the adsorptive process relative to use of other solid surfaces.

30|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} {{was performed}} with a HPLC system {{equipped with a}} binary pump and photodiode array high speed <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>detector</b> and autosampler, all controlled by the Agilent Chemstation software (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA). A Waters Symmetry C 18 (15  mm ×  4.6  mm i.d.; 5  μm) column {{was used for the}} separation with MeCN–H 2 O (0.1 % formic acid) as mobile phase; the separation employed a stepwise gradient that began with 5 : 95 (MeCN:H 2 O), changed to 40 : 60 after 10  min and ended with 75 : 25 (MeCN:H 2 O). The total run time was 25  min. The column was washed with 100 % (MeCN) during 5  min. The flow rate was maintained at 1  mL/min. APCI-MS detection was achieved in negative mode on a Finnigan (San Jose, CA, USA) model LCQ ion trap spectrometer equipped with a Finnigan APCI source. The APCI parameters were as follows: heated capillary temperature, 150  °C; vaporizer temperature, 360  °C; discharge current, 5.0  μA; nebulisation gas (nitrogen), 90 psi. In source collision-induced dissociation of 15  eV was used. TOF–MS experiments for accurate mass measurements (resolution of 10, 000 FWHM) were conducted on a TOF LCT mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK). The ESI conditions were as follows: capillary voltage, 2800  V; source temperature, 120  °C; desolvation temperature, 200  °C; cone voltage, 40  V; desolvation gas flow, 600  L/h. MS scan time: 1  +  0.1  s interscan delay. Sulfadimetoxine ([M–H]− 309.0658) was used as lock mass calibrant (Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectra were obtained in CDCl 3 with a Varian Inova Unity 500 spectrometer (499.87 and 125.70  MHz, respectively). Complete assignment was achieved on the basis of 2 D experiments (COSY, HSQC, HMBC) using Varian VNMR software.|$|E
