40|$|The <b>softshell</b> <b>clam,</b> Mya arenaria, (Figure 1) is an ecologically {{important}} bivalve mollusk that is harvested recreationally and commercially from {{coastal waters}} of the western North Atlantic. As with all bivalve mollusks, they possess two valves or shells that are connected by a hinge. The pair of whitish/gray shells surrounds and protects a mantle, visceral mass and muscular foot. The elongate shells are relatively thin and brittle, leading to the name “softshell. ” Unlike hard clams and oysters, the <b>softshell</b> <b>clam</b> cannot close its shells completely, resulting in a gape most notable at the anterior and posterior ends. As such, softshell clams are damaged more readily and can have a shorter shelf-life than do similar-size oysters or hard clams. A shelf-life of 7 to 10 days can be expected when the animal is kept cool, approximately...|$|E

40|$|A gill-associated Perkinsus sp. {{isolated}} from the <b>softshell</b> <b>clam</b> (Mya arenaria) {{is described as a}} new species, P. chesapeaki sp. nov. Examination of the parasite in seawater cultures revealed life cycle stages and zoosporulation processes similar to those described for other species of the genus Perkinsus. Prezoosporangia developed thickened cell walls upon contraction of the cytoplasm and development of a distinctive clear area between the cell wall and the protoplast. Successive bipartition of the protoplast {{led to the formation of}} hundred's of zoospores within mature sporangia. Zoospores were released into seawater through one or more discharge tubes. Ultrastructural studies revealed an oblong zoospore possessing two flagella that arose from a concave side located in the upper third of the zoospore body. The anterior flagellum possessed a unilateral array of hair-like structures. A large anterior vacuole and basolateral nucleus dominated the cytoplasm of the zoospore body. The presence of a rudimentary apical complex including on open-sided conoid, rhoptries, micronemes, and subpellicular microtubules were also discerned.

To better address the role of environmental exposures in cancer etiology, there has been an increasing focus on the development of nontraditional, environmentally relevant models. Our research involves the development of one such model. Gonadal tumors have been described in the <b>softshell</b> <b>clam</b> (Mya arenaria) in Maine and the hardshell clam (Mercenaria spp.) from Florida. Prevalence of these tumors is as high as 40 % in some populations in eastern Maine and 60 % in some areas along the Indian River in Florida.

40|$|The <b>softshell</b> <b>clam,</b> Mya arenaria, is {{a commercially}} {{important}} bivalve with wide latitudinal distribution in North America. Populations of clams {{with a history}} of repeated exposure to toxic Alexandrium spp. have developed a natural resistance to the paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) produced by these algae. An association between PST resistance in individual clams and a single mutation in the saxitoxin (STX) binding region of the -subunit of the voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channel gene was previously identifed. Here we establish that more than one mutation associated with nerve resistance to STX occurred at this locus. Both cDNA from mRNA and genomic DNA sequences from individual clams are identical demonstrating that both alleles are expressed simultaneously.

40|$|Our {{previous}} work demonstrated a clear {{link between the}} prior history of exposure to paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and toxin resistance in <b>softshell</b> <b>clam,</b> Mya arenaria, populations. Resistance is caused by selection for a naturally occurring point mutation in the sodium channel gene which greatly reduces the binding affinity of PSTs. The present study attempts to identify the life history stage at which natural selection {{is most likely to}} operate and the conditions of toxin exposure necessary to cause a shift in the genetic composition of a population from sensitive to resistant. Progeny from a predominantly sensitive population (Lawrencetown River Estuary, LE) and a predominantly resistant one (Bay of Fundy, BF), were compared in laboratory experiments. Growth and survival of 1 week-old larvae exposed to a high-toxicity Alexandrium tamarense isolate (PR 18 b) in combination with non-toxic algae were not adversely affected in either population compared to non-toxic controls. Thus selection for resistance is not expected at these stages, as A. tamarense cells are too large (35 25 m ESD) to be ingested. In contrast, juveniles (4 - 5 mm) exposed to a unialgal suspension of A. tamarense (100 cells ml- 1) showed significantly higher mortalities and lower toxin uptake rates in LE than BF clams.

40|$|Abstract The known {{negative}} effects of shellfish toxin producing dinoflagellates on feeding, burrowing and survival of some bivalve mollusks has prompted questions concerning whether they might also impair the internal defense system of affected bivalves and make them more susceptible to disease agents. The primary components of the cellular defense system are hemocytes. Many toxic dinoflagellates are too large to be ingested whole by hemocytes and would most likely be exposed to intracellular toxins only after the algae are consumed, broken down, and the water-soluble toxins, released. Therefore, we {{conducted a series of}} experiments in which hemocytes from two suspension-feeding bivalves- the Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, and the <b>softshell</b> <b>clam,</b> Mya arenaria- were exposed in vitro to filtered extracts of one highly toxic paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) -producing and one nonPST-producing strain of Alexandrium tamarense (isolates PR 18 b, 76 ± 6 STXeq cell- 1) and CCMP 115, with undetectable PST, respectively). We measured adherence and phagocytosis, two hemocyte attributes known to be inhibited by bacterial pathogens and other stressors. We found no measurable effect of a cell-free extract from a highly concentrated suspension of the PSTproducing strain on hemocytes of either bivalve species. Instead, extract from the nonPST-producing strain had a consistent negative effect on both clams, resulting in significantly lower adherence and phagocytosis compared to strain PR 18 b and filtered seawater controls.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explored}} metapopulation {{dynamics and}} population connectivity, {{with a focus}} on the <b>softshell</b> <b>clam,</b> Mya arenaria. I first worked towards developing a method for using elemental signatures retained in the larval shell as a tag of natal habitat. I designed and implemented an experiment to determine whether existing methods commonly used for fishes would be applicable to bivalves. I found that the instrumentation and setup I used were not able to isolate and measure the first larval shell of M. arenaria. In concert with developing this method for bivalves, I reared larval M. arenaria in the laboratory under controlled conditions to understand the environmental and biological factors that may influence elemental signatures in shell. My results show that growth rate and age have significant effects on juvenile shell composition, and that temperature and salinity affect larval and juvenile shell composition in variable ways depending on the element evaluated. I also examined the regional patterns of diversity over the current distribution of M. arenaria using the mitochondrial gene, cytochrome oxidase I (COI). I found minimal variability across all populations sampled, suggesting a recent population expansion in the Northwest Atlantic. Finally, I employed theoretical approaches to understand patch dynamics in a two-patch metapopulation when one patch is of high quality and the other low quality. I developed a matrix metapopulation model and compared growth rate elasticity to patch parameters under variable migration scenarios. I then expanded the model to include stochastic disturbance. I found that in many cases, the spatial distribution of individuals within the metapopulation affects whether growth rate is most elastic to parameters in the good or bad patch. by Carly A. Strasser.

40|$|Bivalve molluscs, {{the primary}} vectors of paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) in humans, show marked inter-species variation in {{their capacity to}} accumulate PSP toxins (PSTs) 1 which has a neural basis 2, 3. PSTs cause human fatalities by blocking sodium conductance in nerve fibres 4, 5. Here we identify a molecular basis for inter-population variation in PSP resistance within a species, consistent with genetic adaptation to PSTs. <b>Softshell</b> <b>clams</b> (Mya arenaria) from areas exposed to 'red tides' are more resistant to PSTs, as demonstrated by whole-nerve assays, and accumulate toxins at greater rates than sensitive clams from unexposed areas. PSTs lead to selective mortality of sensitive clams. Resistance is caused by natural mutation of a single amino acid residue, which causes a 1, 000 -fold decrease in affinity at the saxitoxin-binding site in the sodium channel pore of resistant, but not sensitive, clams. Thus PSTs might act as potent natural selection agents, leading to greater toxin resistance in clam populations and increased risk of PSP in humans.

40|$|SummaryTetrodotoxin (TTX) is {{a highly}} potent neurotoxin that {{selectively}} binds to the outer vestibule of voltage-gated sodium channels. Pufferfishes accumulate extremely high concentrations of TTX without any adverse effect. A nonaromatic amino acid (Asn) residue present in domain I of the pufferfish, Takifugu pardalis, Nav 1. 4 channel has been implicated in the TTX resistance of pufferfishes [1]. However, {{the effect of this}} residue on TTX sensitivity has not been investigated, and it is not known if this residue is conserved in all pufferfishes. We have investigated the genetic basis of TTX resistance in pufferfishes by comparing the sodium channels from two pufferfishes (Takifugu rubripes [fugu] and Tetraodon nigroviridis) and the TTX-sensitive zebrafish. Although all three fishes contain duplicate copies of Nav 1. 4 channels (Nav 1. 4 a and Nav 1. 4 b), several substitutions were found in the TTX binding outer vestibule of the two pufferfish channels. Electrophysiological studies showed that the nonaromatic residue (Asn in fugu and Cys in Tetraodon) in domain I of Nav 1. 4 a channels confers TTX resistance. The Glu-to-Asp mutation in domain II of Tetraodon channel Nav 1. 4 b is similar to that in the saxitoxin- and TTX-resistant Na+ channels of <b>softshell</b> <b>clams</b> [2].

Each system included six, 400 litre rectangular fibreglass tanks, a modular pump and filter unit (particle and activated carbon filters and ultra-violet sterilisers), a biological filter and a refrigeration unit. The total volume of water for each system was 2300 litres of artificial seawater (Instant Ocean super(")). The mean water temperature of 22 degree C was achieved by thermostat-controlled room temperature. Salinity was maintained between 27 and 31 ppt by addition of either freshwater or artificial seawater. Shellfish were fed daily a mixed diet of carboy-cultured algae and spray-dried algae. Mean values for water quality parameters in both systems were as follows: NH sub(3) < 0. 004 mg/litre; NO sub(2) super(-) < 0. 01 mg/litre; NO sub(3) super(-) < 19 - 16 mg/litre; and pH 8. 0 - 8. 4. The system design was adequate in maintaining healthy bivalves {{for a period of}} 22 months, {{with the exception of the}} sea scallops which succumbed to warm water. Mean monthly shellfish survival rates were 79. 9 - 100 % in the control and 74. 8 - 98. 9 % in the experimental system. A method of controlling water temperature other than via room temperature should reduce slight seasonal temperature fluctuations...|$|R
