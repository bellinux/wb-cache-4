50|$|Iran {{plans to}} {{generate}} 23,000 MWh of electricity through nuclear technology by 2025 {{to meet its}} increasing demand for energy. The first of four 915 MW reactors of Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, built with help from Russia, came online in August 2010 after numerous delays and Iran's indigenously designed Darkhovin Nuclear Power Plant is scheduled to come online in 2016. Overall, Iran remains a net exporter of electricity and exchanges electrical power with all its land neighbors. While nuclear power in the US costs a little over 10 cents per kilowatt hour, Iran, with domestic uranium enrichment capabilities, high interest rates, low energy output (a single 1,000-watt reactor), low efficiency, extremely <b>slow</b> <b>reactor</b> construction, and no reprocessing pays around 68 cents per kilowatt hour (this assumes a price of $140 per separative working unit and of $40 per kilogram of uranium).|$|E
50|$|A {{stainless}} steel cell, full of plastic caps of different dimension, slowly rotates (1-3 rpm) partially submerged inside a tank, {{where there are}} wastewaters to be purified. Plastic caps spontaneously form a bacterial film that progressively presents, at first, heterotrophic bacteria development which are able to nourish of organic carbon pollutants; then the decrease of COD and BOD concentration and then the development of autotrophic bacteria. They belong to the Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter category and {{they are able to}} oxidize ammonium, transforming it into nitrites and nitrates.The cell containing the carriers (caps) can be flooded as needed; in this way the depuration process control is obtained and it can be oriented both to the carbon removal both to the wastewaters denitrification. These plants, like happening for the biological disks, do not need any blower for the bacteria film oxygenation. It's the <b>slow</b> <b>reactor</b> rotation - alternatively submerged into sewage and into atmosphere - to guarantee the adequate oxygen supply for the oxidation aerobically of the sewage made by the biological film attached to the carriers. In this way it is possible to obtain a huge reduction of functioning and operating treatment costs.|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{periodic}} operation is investigated for a simple model of a heterogeneous catalytic Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR). For the heterogeneous case two scales of response times have been derived, slow for heat processes and fast for concentration processes. Periodic operation in intermediate mode between slow and fast processes is studied by manipulation of feed flow rate. The new approach is designated as mediating operation. Mediating operation demonstrates ability to control interaction between fast and <b>slow</b> <b>reactor</b> subsystems due to desired separation of dynamic responses for temperature and concentration processes by a single input variable. The conversion improvement at lower temperature can be achieved for lower and upper stable steady states.

The effects of the feedback were varying length of the reaction time (RT), the "contingent negative variation" (CNV), and the variation in heart frequency. The CNV, measured by EEG, indicated the reaction during the preparatory interval between the warning signal and the reaction signal or button-pressing. The CNV was characterized by the rapid ascent of the EEG during the preparatory interval and a rapid reduction succeeding the reaction signal. A strong deceleration in heart frequency {{was associated with a}} strong CNV amplitude and a short RT. The conditions were no feedback, random feedback, and constant feedback. With random or constant feedback the CNV rose but fell with no feedback.

In 1940, when Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather showed that a <b>slow</b> neutron <b>reactor</b> fuelled with uranium would in theory produce {{substantial}} amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product, Kemmer (who was lodging at the Bretschers') proposed the names Neptunium for the new element 93 and Plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus (uranium being element 92).

50|$|In 1940 Feather and Egon Bretscher at the Cavendish Laboratory, made a {{breakthrough}} in nuclear research for the Tube Alloys project. They proposed that the 239 isotope of element 94 could be produced from the common isotope of uranium-238 by neutron capture. Like U-235, this new element {{should be able to}} sustain a nuclear chain reaction. A <b>slow</b> neutron <b>reactor</b> fueled with uranium would, in theory, produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product, since U-238 absorbs slow neutrons to form the new isotope U-239. This nuclide rapidly emits an electron, decaying into an element with a mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93. This nuclide then emits another electron to become a new element still of mass 239, but with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half-life.|$|R
5|$|The {{breakthrough}} with plutonium was by Bretscher and Norman Feather at the Cavendish Laboratory. They realised that a <b>slow</b> neutron <b>reactor</b> fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial {{amounts of}} plutonium-239 as a by-product. This is because uranium-238 absorbs slow neutrons and forms a short-lived new isotope, uranium-239. The new isotope's nucleus rapidly emits an electron through beta decay producing a new element with an atomic mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93. This element's nucleus also emits an electron and becomes a new element with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half-life. Bretscher and Feather showed theoretically feasible grounds that element 94 would be fissile—readily fissioned by both slow and fast neutrons, with the added advantage of being different from uranium, and therefore could be chemically separated from it. Bretscher even devised a chemical method to separate.|$|R

50|$|The NRC {{continued}} atomic {{research at}} Chalk River Laboratories until {{the scale of}} activity necessitated its transfer to a newly created organization, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, dedicated exclusively to atomic research, in 1952. Although Canada had the scientific, engineering and industrial means to design, built and test nuclear weapons, the government decided not to pursue this option. AECL took over responsibility for the operations of NRX but coincidentally shortly after the transfer that reactor experienced a serious accident. It was repaired and rebuilt. In 1957 AECL commissioned a new research facility, the heavy-water moderated and cooled National Research Universal Reactor (NRU) at Chalk River. In 1963 a new site, the Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment, became operational at Pinwa, Manitoba. Here a new organically cooled and operated research reactor was built and work was undertaken {{on the development of}} the <b>Slow</b> Poke <b>reactor</b> and the thorium fuel cycle.

50|$|This {{concept was}} first {{postulated}} by Funk and Reinstrom (1966) as a reflexion {{about the most}} efficient way to produce fuels (e.g. hydrogen, ammonia) from stable and abundant species (e.g. water, nitrogen) and heat sources. Although fuel availability was scarcely considered before the oil crisis era, these researches were justified by niche markets. As an example, in the military logistics field, providing fuels for vehicles in remote battlefields is a key task. Hence, a mobile production system based on a portable heat source (a specific nuclear reactor was strikingly considered) was being investigated with the uttermost interest.Following the crisis, many programs (Europe,Japan,USA) were set up to design, test and qualify such processes for more peaceful purposes such as energy independence. High temperature (1000K) nuclear reactors were still considered as the heat sources. However, the optimistic expectations of the first thermodynamics studies were quickly moderated by more pragmatic analysis based on fair comparisons with standard technologies (thermodynamic cycles for electricity generation, coupled with the electrolysis of water) and by numerous practical issues (not high enough temperatures with nuclear <b>reactors,</b> <b>slow</b> reactivities, <b>reactor</b> corrosion, significant losses of intermediate compounds with time...). Hence, the interest for this technology was fading away during the next decades, or at least some tradeoffs (hybrid versions) were being considered with the use of electricity as a fractional energy input instead of only heat for the reactions (e.g. Hybrid sulfur cycle). A rebirth in the year 2000 can be explained by both new energy crisis and the rapid pace of development of concentrated solar power technologies whose potentially very high temperatures are ideal for thermochemical processes, while the environmentally friendly side of these researches attracts funding in a period with the peak oil shadow.|$|R
40|$|Diffuse {{emission}} from {{agricultural land}} is a major, persistent source of {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} in surface waters. In this contribution, we present field experiments {{of a series of}} robust options to remove nitrate and phosphorus at field drainage level. Nitrate removal was enhanced by stimulating naturally occurring denitrification by adding wood chips. The results showed that the initial removal rates were high (between 60 and 80 %). Efficiency decreases in case of periodic presence of oxygen. The concentrations of phosphate in the effluent showed peaks during the first year at high temperatures and l ow water discharge. The emission of nitrous oxide to the surface above the drains was negligible, but was increased at the ends of the drains. It is estimated that the long-term efficiency depends on good control of the water levels and flow rates in the filter beds. Phosphorus removal was enhanced by using iron-oxide coated sand as filter material. Three methods were tested: drains enveloped with iron oxide coated sand, an edge of field <b>reactor</b> and a <b>slow</b> sand filter <b>reactor</b> at the downstream end of the drainage canal. Results show that up to 95 % of the phosphorus can be removed.

40|$|International audienceThe {{gas phase}} {{reaction}} between the CN radical and acetonitrile CH 3 CN was investigated experimentally, at low temperatures, with the CRESU apparatus and a <b>slow</b> flow <b>reactor</b> to explore the temperature dependence of its rate coefficient from 354 K down to 23 K. Whereas a standard Arrhenius behavior was found at T > 200 K, indicating {{the presence of an}} activation barrier, a dramatic increase in the rate coefficient by a factor of 130 was observed when the temperature was decreased from 168 to 123 K. The reaction was found to be pressure independent at 297 K unlike the experiments carried out at 52 and 132 K. The work was complemented by ab initio transition state theory based master equation calculations using reaction pathways investigated with highly accurate thermochemical protocols. The role of collisional stabilization of a CN⋯CH 3 CN van der Waals complex and of tunneling induced H atom abstractions were also considered. The experimental pressure dependence at 52 and 132 K is well reproduced by the theoretical calculations provided that an anharmonic state density is considered for the van der Waals complex CH 3 CN⋯CN and its Lennard-Jones radius is adjusted. Furthermore, these calculations indicate that the experimental observations correspond to the fall-off regime and that tunneling remains small in the low-pressure regime. Hence, the studied reaction is essentially an association process at very low temperature. Implications for the chemistry of interstellar clouds and Titan are discussed...|$|R

The purpose of the experiments reported in this thesis was to extend our understanding of the fast pyrolysis process for straw, perennial grasses and hardwoods, and the implications of selective pyrolysis, crop harvest and storage on the thermal decomposition products. To this end, characterisation and laboratory-scale fast pyrolysis were conducted on the available feedstocks, and their products were compared. The variation in light and medium volatile decomposition products was investigated at different pyrolysis temperatures and heating rates, and a comparison of fast and slow pyrolysis products was conducted. Feedstocks from different harvests, storage durations and locations were characterised and compared in terms of their fuel and chemical properties. A range of analytical (e. g.

The growing interest in industrial biomass pyrolysis {{is the potential for}} upgrading of the pyrolysis bio-oils to liquid transport fuels, while the solid char, which is rich in carbon, {{can be used as a}} renewable solid fuel alternative, specialty carbon product, such as metallurgical carbon or can be blended into soils thereby sequestering carbon and improving soil quality. Industrial biomass pyrolysis processes can operate under fast or slow pyrolysis conditions, depending on the residence time and heating rate of the material in the reactor. Fast pyrolysis is characterised by rapid heating rates that are usually within the range of 1, 000 to 10, 000 °C/s. On a dry feed basis the yields of liquid oil from fast pyrolysis are between 50 and 80 wt% with gas and char products accounting for the remainder in approximately even proportions. Slow pyrolysis applies gradual heating rates that can be as low as several degrees per minute, where the products may range from being equally distributed amongst the solid, liquid and gas phases to producing solid and gas only. Fast pyrolysis reactor types include bubbling fluidized beds, circulating fluidized beds, rotating cone transported beds and ablative pyrolysers. <b>Slow</b> pyrolysis <b>reactor</b> designs include vacuum pyrolysers, bubbling fluidized beds, augers and heated kilns of various types.

The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of the corn cob, cassava stem, and cassava rhizome in order to identify their potential as pyrolysis feedstocks for biochar production. This was achieved by using the proximate and elemental analyses as well as calorific value and lignocellulosic determination. The second objective is to investigate the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the biochar produced. A fixed bed <b>slow</b> pyrolysis <b>reactor</b> was used to pyrolyze the corn cob, cassava stem, and cassava rhizome. The pyrolysis temperatures were varied between 400 °C and 600 °C, while the heating rate and the holding time were fixed at 5 °C/min and 1 hour, respectively. Corn cob, cassava stem, and cassava rhizome were found to be suitable feedstocks for pyrolysis process because they contained a high percentage of volatile matter more than 80 mf wt. %. All the three feedstocks contained low nitrogen and sulphur content less than 1 mf wt. %. Therefore, during the pyrolysis process, the feedstocks give off very low rate of GHG such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides. Independent of the types of biomass, the percentage of biochar yield is inversely proportional to the pyrolysis temperature. The highest biochar yield for each studied temperature is from slow pyrolysis of cassava rhizome as the feedstock contained the highest percentage of ash compared to the other two feedstocks. The percentage of fixed carbon in all the biochars increased as the pyrolysis temperature increased. The increment of pyrolysis temperature from 400 °C to 600 °C increased the fixed carbon of corn cob biochar, cassava stem biochar and cassava rhizome biochar by 26. 35 %, 10. 98 %, and 6. 20 % respectively.

In this study, they all had the same anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic volumes. The UCT process had the highest phosphorus (P) removal efficiency when the amount of P removed per unit of COD consumed was considered.

40|$|Continuum {{models for}} the role of the {{interstitial}} fluid with respect to mass and heat dispersion in a fixed bed are discussed. It is argued that the departures from local equilibrium and not the concentration and temperature gradients as such should be considered as the driving forces for mass and heat dispersion fluxes. This general principle results in a new two-dimensional, continuum model for dispersion in the fluid flowing through a packed bed. An essential feature of the model is that mass and heat dispersion flux vectors are taken to be state variables additional to concentration and temperature; their values characterize the departures from local equilibrium. The differential equations for the dispersion model are of the hyperbolic type and they require fundamentally different boundary conditions compared to the usual conditions for the conventionally used diffusion type models. The new model avoids the physical drawbacks inherent to the diffusion models. It provides a new physical interpretation of the scatter in point temperature measurements and of the temperature drop observed near the reactor wall under conditions of heat transfer through the wall. A part of the temperature drop and the temperature scatter are direct consequences of the macroscopic local thermal nonequilibrium state of the fluid. The results predicted by the new model and diffusion model are essentially equivalent in case of <b>slow</b> processes in <b>reactors</b> with large tube-to-particle diameter ratios.

Reactions at different temperatures (150, 175, 200, and 225 ˚C) allowed us to determine activation energy and frequency factor to be 21. 4 $pm$ 0. 6 kcal/mol and 10 ^(8. 8 ± 0. 3 } L/mol s, respectively. Experiments with additional alkynes helped define the scope and limitations of the method. Anisole served as our model ether for hydrolysis. We tested the same acid catalysts as above and found indium triflate to be the best catalyst of those tested. Experiments at different temperatures (200, 225, 250, 275, and 300 ˚C) allowed us to determine that activation energy and frequency factor to be 31 ± 1 kcal/mol and 10 ^(10. 6 ± 0. 5 } L/mol s, respectively. We tested additional ethers toward hydrolysis to determine the limitations of the procedure. We tested the effects that our reactor vessel may be exerting upon the reaction. For alkyne hydration, we found that the use of a capillary quartz <b>reactor</b> <b>slowed</b> the reaction dramatically, likely due to transport limitations. For ether hydrolysis, we found that the presence of quartz or statinless steel decreased reaction progress, perhaps due to interaction between the surface and the indium triflate catalyst. These experimental results identify an important phenomenon that had previously gone unrecognized in the field. The overall significance of our work is our demonstration that the use of WTLAs in HTW presents potential as a novel medium for organic synthesis. For hydration and hydrolysis, this previously unexplored reaction medium can be competitive with traditional techniques in terms of rate and yiel...|$|R
