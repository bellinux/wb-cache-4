5|$|Wells elects five councillors to Mendip District Council {{from the}} <b>same</b> <b>three</b> wards as {{are used for}} the City Council (two are {{returned}} from St Cuthbert's, two from St Thomas' and one from Central). The Mendip district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 and the district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.|$|E
5|$|In 1935–36, he {{continued}} as a fixture at outside-left, but scored fewer goals. {{one of which}} came as an equaliser against Lincoln City when the referee failed to notice that teammate Johnny Wigham punched the ball to him rather than playing it legitimately. All the <b>same,</b> <b>three</b> months into the season he was the team's top scorer with six. As in the previous season, Hartlepools played Halifax Town in the FA Cup, and again, they won after a replay; Bonass was involved in three of their four goals, two of which were scored when his shot was parried to another player. He finished the season with 13 goals, second only to Wigham, as Hartlepools finished eighth in the Third Division.|$|E

5|$|In the {{classical}} {{presentation of a}} three-set Venn diagram as three overlapping circles, the central region (representing elements belonging to all three sets) takes {{the shape of a}} Reuleaux triangle. The <b>same</b> <b>three</b> circles form one of the standard drawings of the Borromean rings, three mutually linked rings that cannot, however, be realized as geometric circles. Parts of these same circles are used to form the triquetra, a figure of three overlapping semicircles (each two of which form a vesica piscis symbol) that again has a Reuleaux triangle at its center; just as the three circles of the Venn diagram may be interlaced to form the Borromean rings, the three circular arcs of the triquetra may be interlaced to form a trefoil knot.|$|E
5|$|The <b>same</b> <b>three</b> brigades – one mounted rifle, one {{light horse}} and one Yeomanry, with the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) {{supporting}} the Yeomanry – moved {{to attack the}} German and Ottoman position at Oghratina, but the rearguard position was again found to be too strong. Lacking the support of infantry or heavy artillery, the mounted force {{was too small to}} capture this strong rearguard position, but the threat from the mounted advance was enough to force the hostile force to evacuate the position. During the night, the German and Ottoman forces retreated back to Bir el Abd, where they had been three weeks before, on 20 July, when they established a base with a depot for supplies and stores.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} {{nominated}} for 12 Golden Globe Awards overall, winning five. The first nomination came in 1994, when the show won Best Series – Drama. The following year, Anderson and Duchovny were nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Leading Role, respectively. In 1996, the series won three awards; Anderson and Duchovny for Best Actress and Actor and for Best Series – Drama. In 1997 and 1998, the show received the <b>same</b> <b>three</b> nominations. In 1997, however, the series won Best Series – Drama". In 1998 the series won no award and received no nominations thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Division 11 {{arrived at}} Con Son Island on 29 July taking shelter from heavy seas and monsoon rains that had {{developed}} during the transit. Point Banks was the only cutter to have engine problems during the transit and repairs {{were made in the}} cramped engine room while underway so that no time was lost by the division during transit. During the lay over at Con Son minor repairs were made and repainting was completed on some of the cutters' hulls which had been partially stripped of paint by the storm. Three RVN liaison officers reported aboard the cutters just before the division departed for Phu Quoc Island and the <b>same</b> <b>three</b> cutters started patrol work {{as the rest of the}} division put into Phu Quoc harbor on 31 July. On 30 July operational control of all Market Time elements, whether U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard or RVN, was transferred to the Commander, Task Force 115 (TF115).|$|E
5|$|Each clan has {{specific}} Disciplines, {{which can}} be used in combat and to create approaches to quests. Although some powers overlap clans, no two clans share the <b>same</b> <b>three</b> Disciplines. More physical vampires can enhance themselves to become fast and lethal killers or summon spirit allies to attack their foes; others can mentally dominate their targets to force their cooperation or render themselves invisible to hide from detection; and others can boil their opponent's blood from afar. Some Disciplines, such as Auspex (which boosts perception, highlighting other characters' auras through obstacles) and Blood Buff (which temporarily upgrades strength, dexterity, stamina and lockpicking), are common to all vampires. Several abilities can be active at the same time. Blood is a primary currency in Bloodlines, used to activate Disciplines and abilities. It is drained with each use, and can be replenished by drinking from rats, visiting blood banks or drinking from humans by attacking or seducing them; the player can feed on enemies during combat. Drinking from innocents for too long can kill them, costing a character humanity points.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} ordered on 10 November 1934 and laid down at Germania, Kiel on 12 October 1935 as yard number G539. She was {{launched}} on 18 March 1937 and completed on 28 August 1939. Erich Koellner {{was still on}} sea trials when World War II began and did not become operational until early January 1940 when she {{was assigned to the}} 8th Destroyer Division (8. Zerstörerdivision). Led by Commander (Fregattenkapitän) Erich Bey, Erich Koellner and her sisters Bruno Heinemann, and Wolfgang Zenker laid a minefield off Cromer during the night of 11/12 January that sank three ships totalling 11,153 Gross Register Tons (GRT). The <b>same</b> <b>three</b> ships laid 157 mines near the Haisborough Sands off Cromer on the night of 9/10 February. This minefield sank three ships of 11,885 GRT. During Operation Wikinger, an attempt to capture British fishing trawlers operating off the Dogger Bank on 22 February, two German destroyers hit newly laid British mines in the supposedly mine-free channel and sank. Koellner lost one man overboard while attempting to rescue sailors from the two sunken ships and succeeded in rescuing 24 men.|$|E

It is to be hoped that his histories contained some things easier to believe than this.|$|R
5|$|The video {{opens with}} two men street dancing in a white hall, with {{speakers}} and chairs scattered around. Shots of an audience lead to Roberts walking to a microphone positioned on a stage before she starts lip-synching, wearing a 1970s style outfit. After knocking over the microphone stand, Roberts performs a routine with three female back-up dancers in front of multiple speakers. During the chorus, she dances with the <b>same</b> <b>three</b> dancers, whilst shots of men watching them are shown. Roberts then leads the three women through the hall before they perform a dance section in {{the bridge of the}} track. Three men marching in a small white room are shown, leading to a shot of Roberts marching alongside a marching band of drummers. She is then shown in a multi-coloured sweater-dress, stood atop a speaker and surrounded by dancers. Final shots show Roberts producing shapes of letters L, O, V, and E with cheerleaders. The video ends with Roberts casually interacting with her dancers.|$|E
5|$|The first Sky {{television}} rights {{agreement was}} worth £304million over five seasons. The next contract, negotiated {{to start from}} the 1997–98 season, rose to £670million over four seasons. The third contract was a £1.024billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001–02 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320million {{from the sale of}} its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of £1.7billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the <b>same</b> <b>three</b> seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6million, a 63percent increase on the £105million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10pm on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched £625million, nearly double the previous contract. The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.|$|E
