5|$|The {{focus of}} this debate often centers on a {{phenomenon}} named by sexologist Pepper Schwartz in 1983. Schwartz found that long-term lesbian couples report having less <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> than heterosexual or homosexual male couples, calling this lesbian bed death. However, lesbians dispute the study's definition of <b>sexual</b> <b>contact,</b> and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant, greater sexual fluidity in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives—or reject the labels entirely. Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> between women, or <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> between women has increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves.|$|E
5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> between servant and master; a prohibition against <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would prevent this. Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to hold his position.|$|E
5|$|Kinsey and {{his staff}} {{reported}} that 28% of women had been aroused by another female, and 19% had a <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> with another female. Of women who had <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> with another female, half to two-thirds of them had orgasmed. Single women had the highest prevalence of homosexual activity, followed by women who were widowed, divorced, or separated. The lowest occurrence of sexual activity was among married women; those with previous homosexual experience reported they got married to stop homosexual activity.|$|E
40|$|Neisseria gonorrhoeae multiantigen {{sequence}} typing (NG-MAST) is {{a highly}} discriminatory molecular typing procedure that provides precise and unambiguous strain characterization. Since molecular typing can complement contact tracing for reconstructing gonorrhea sexual networks, the concordance between the NG-MAST genotypes of pairs of N. gonorrhoeae isolates from recent <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> was examined. Among 72 pairs of gonococci from recent <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts,</b> the genotypes of each pair were concordant in 65 cases (90. 3 %). In two further pairs, the isolates from <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> differed by only a single nonsynonymous substitution in the porin gene, and {{in both of these}} pairs, the isolates were the same by opa typing. The other five nonconcordant pairs of isolates were clearly different strains. opa typing data were available for 51 of the pairs of isolates from <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts,</b> and concordant opa types were obtained in 38 cases (74. 5 %). NG-MAST should therefore be better than opa typing at identifying recent <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> and has the important advantage over opa typing of being a more precise method of strain characterization...|$|R

The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.|$|E

5|$|Statistics on lynchings {{began to}} be {{collected}} in 1882.

Most of the incidents took place between 1876 and 1930; though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders still occurred. Throughout the South, whites publicly prohibited interracial relationships as a means to maintain white supremacy. Even the suggestion of <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> between black men and white women could carry severe penalties for black men. A resurgence of the enforcement of such Jim Crow mores was evident following World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal rights in the South.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} {{mode of transmission}} of HIV is through <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> with an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital <b>sexual</b> <b>contact.</b> In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
40|$|Which moral {{principles}} should guide us in evaluating <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> of adolescents? This paper tries {{to answer this}} question by taking two steps. First, the implications of a liberal sexual ethics for adolescence are spelled out, assessed and refuted. The core principle of the liberal ethical view, the principle of valid consent, takes competence as a necessary condition of morally permissable sex. Because adolescents are not yet sufficiently capable of judging and acting prudently in the sexual sphere of life, their consent to sexual relations cannot meet the criterion of competence. Hence, if judged from the principle of valid consent, <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> in which adolescents are involved are morally impermissible. This rather illiberal implication of a liberal sexual ethics is rejected for several reasons. Second, an alternative moral principle for evaluating <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> of adolescents is proposed, explained and defended. Precisely because they are not yet sufficiently capable of looking after their own interests, adolescents are still placed under parental authority. With reference to that, it is argued that their free and informed consent to <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> is not enough for making these contacts morally permissible. What is also required is the considerate consent of their parents. Finally, three guidelines for parental interaction with adolescents are recommended. If parents take these guidelines seriously, exercising their authority will be at the same time an important way of promoting the growth of adolescents into competent actors in the field of sexual relations...|$|R

5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Evidence from {{microelectrode}} recordings {{from the}} brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system.The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and <b>sexual</b> <b>contact.</b> Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.|$|E
25|$|STD may refer only to {{infections that}} are causing diseases, {{or it may}} be used more loosely as a synonym for STI. Most of the time, people do not know that they are {{infected}} with an STI until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease. Moreover, the term sexually transmissible disease is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission. For instance, meningitis is transmissible by means of <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> but is not labeled an STI because <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> is not the primary vector for the pathogens that cause meningitis. This discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means other than <b>sexual</b> <b>contact.</b> In general, an STI is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than <b>sexual</b> <b>contact,</b> but has a realistic means of transmission by <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> (more sophisticated means—blood transfusion, sharing of hypodermic needles—are not taken into account). Thus, one may presume that, if a person is infected with an STI, e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, HPV it was transmitted to him/her by means of <b>sexual</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} the sexual behaviour {{of men and}} women in a fishing village on the shores of Lake Victoria in southwest Uganda. The village is near a well known trading town-truckstop on the main trans-Africa highway with a high recorded prevalence of HIV infection. Data were obtained on the daily travel and sexual activities of 26 women and 54 men with particular attention paid to the rate of partner change and the proportion of <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> with people outside the village. During a total of 587 person-weeks the men made 1086 trips, mostly returning home the same day. They had a total of 1226 <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts,</b> most of which occurred either in their own village (83 %) or a neighbouring fishing village (11 %); 17 per cent of <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> were with new partners. Fifteen of the women described themselves as married; 42 per cent of their <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> were with casual, paying partners. Of the eleven women who were single, between 80 and 100 per cent of contacts were with paying partners. Most of the women’s partners were resident in the village. These data show a very high rate of sexual mixing within the village but little contact with people from outside. This suggests that all sexually active men and women in the village are at high risk of STDs including HIV. There is currently no formal health care available in the village.
