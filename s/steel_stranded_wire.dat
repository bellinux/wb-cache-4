Beside the aramid, glass and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) used to replace <b>steel</b> bars, <b>strands,</b> <b>wires</b> or tendons in the structures, FRP panels, membranes and textiles {{are more and more}} used in all type of structures. In the last few years, research has been conducted in the area of {{advanced composite}}s to be used as smart materials for smart structures. Smart structures and materials are defined as systems which have two basic functions: the first is to sense any external stimuli and the second to respond to that stimuli in some appropriate ways in real or near real time. This intelligent health monitoring is very beneficial to aerospace, mechanical or civil structures. The use of advanced composites for reinforcement as well as for sensing and actuating purposes combined with sophisticated data acquisition and monitoring apparatus has been proposed. This paper examines the sensing and actuating functions as an added value to advanced composites to be used in smart structures and evaluates their potential implications in improving the performance of the structure...|$|R

Apart from such measurement function, the smart strand shall at first satisfy the structural performance required as a tendon. Therefore, research has been implemented so as to embed the sensor within the small diameter of the core wire by using optical fibre sensor. To that goal, new materials were devised for the core wire to avoid the method cutting and machining the conventional steel core wire. The performances of the core wire fabricated by this new approach as well as its fabricability and structural performance were examined through tensile test to derive the optimal fabrication method of the smart strand. The tests conducted on the core wire fabricated by the so-selected fabrication method and embedded with the optical fibre sensor revealed that the resulting strain measurement range was significantly larger than the range complying with the design prestress force of the conventional <b>steel</b> <b>strand.</b> The core <b>wire</b> for the smart strand under development was seen to provide sufficient measurement performance as well as to satisfy the required structural performance.

The electronic number of corona discharge of each pre-set conductor was measured, when applying AC high voltage on the wearing wires step by step,so that the corona inception voltages of the conductors could be confirmed. And {{the effect of the}} vibration cycle times and environmental conditions on the corona discharge was researched. Taking the sum of all aluminium stands wear area of a pre-set wire as the fretting wearing capacity, the relationship between the wire wearing capacity and the corona discharge was studied. The results indicate that the corona inception voltages of the conductors decrease with the increase of the cycle times and the wires wear capacity. In general, the wear capacity of the acidic corrosion conductors is larger, and its corona inception voltage is lower. Therefore the decrease of the conductor fretting wear can effectively reduce the corona loss of transmission lines and other hazards...|$|R

The decline of the majority (B, C, D) was around 20  ~  40  MPa, that is to say, the original {{tensile strength}} decreased by about 1.5  ~  2.0 %. It shows that if the corrosion rate of the prestressed <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> is small (usually within 5 % of the cross-sectional loss), the mechanical properties of the prestressed <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> {{will be affected by}} corrosion, but not very seriously. Corrosion of <b>steel</b> <b>strands</b> leads to the reduction of mechanical properties. On the microlevel, the electrochemical reaction occurred between the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> and the corrosion ion, and the microstructure of materials has been changed.

More recently, alternative solutions have been developed and implemented that use straight post-tensionedcarbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons, ideally enlisting their high-strength to failure, small relaxation, corrosion resistance, and light weight. In this paper, a novel CFRP system for external post-tensioning is presented. The solution consists of unbonded CFRP bars connected to dead- and live-end steel anchors by means of couplers that allow the bar to develop the full tensile strength. Intermediate deviators can be extended vertically to impart additional post-tensioning (PT) force and achieve a profiled bar configuration.

Conditions such as corrosion, <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> and <b>wire</b> breakage, tendon section loss, voids in the grout, water infiltration, and other undesired grout conditions can go undetected in nontransparent stay cable and external PT ducts without proper inspection. In this research, sounding, ultrasonic tomography, infrared thermography, and ground penetrating radar are evaluated for their applicability to identify selected conditions in a mock-up specimen representative of both a stay cable system and an external PT system. A borescope {{is also used to}} collect ground truth data for comparison with the NDE results. The conditions are fabricated in the mock-up specimen to closely represent conditions in the field so that the NDE results are directly applicable to bridge construction quality control and in-service bridge inspections. Locations of corrosion, breakage, and section loss are established prior to grouting. These conditions are combined with both foam void locations and an air-filled void in the grout {{along the top of the}} duct. The sounding method was extremely applicable in accurately detecting air voids in the grout and the sounding results matched closely with the ground truth data of the air void extent collected by the use of a borescope. This research concludes that the infrared thermography and ground penetrating radar devices used did not identify any of the corrosion, section loss, or breakage locations within the specimen. However, both of these methods identified air voids and foam voids in the duct free span during both the quality control testing period and inspection testing period, although GPR did not provide accurate void depth. In addition, infrared thermography was able to identify air voids within the grout caps at each anchorage end.
