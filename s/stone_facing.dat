5|$|During the Late Preclassic {{structures}} were built using volcanic stone {{held together with}} clay, as in the Middle Preclassic. However, they evolved to include stepped structures with indented corners and stairways dressed with rounded pebbles. At the same time, old Olmec-style sculptures were moved from their original positions and {{placed in front of}} the new-style buildings, sometimes reusing sculpture fragments in the <b>stone</b> <b>facing.</b>|$|E
5|$|A large mound on {{the south}} side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz, a deity of the {{mountains}} and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage. Like the other structures of Q'umarkaj, all the <b>stone</b> <b>facing</b> has been robbed, leaving only a rubble and mud core. This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.|$|E

5|$|The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was {{appointed}} {{to carry out the}} rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the <b>stone</b> <b>facing</b> of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.|$|E

25|$|In the Late Classic to Early Postclassic periods (from {{approximately}} AD 6251000), {{the ceremonial}} {{centre of the}} settlement was abandoned and smaller structures were built around a small plaza. This has been interpreted as a Mesoamerican influence with its origins on the Gulf coast of Mexico, or perhaps from Seibal, a Maya city in the Petén Basin of northern Guatemala. The <b>stone</b> <b>facing</b> from this period is cruder than that of earlier times and stairways replaced the earlier use of access ramps. The ballcourt also dates to this time.|$|E

500|$|Radiocarbon dating {{indicates}} that the ramparts defending Maiden Castle were built in around 600BC. Built from earth and timber, the inner rampart was originally [...] wide, with a revetment of dry stone walling behind the bank, and at least [...] high. The outer bank was originally [...] wide and about [...] high. It was built from sand and had a dry <b>stone</b> <b>facing</b> at the front and no revetment behind. The outer bank was later enlarged: the outer face was extended [...] away from the fort and the revetment moved. Its height was probably increased to [...] The defences cover about [...] out of the entire [...] of the Maiden Castle site. According to archaeologist James Forde-Johnston, who conducted {{a study of the}} hill forts of Lancashire and Cheshire in 1962, this was an unusually strong defence for such a small site. Few artefacts have been recovered from the site; they include a piece of Iron Age pottery. Maiden Castle was probably occupied until the Roman conquest of Britain in 1st centuryAD, and the outer bank may have been reconstructed around this time.|$|E
500|$|The {{second phase}} was {{built around the}} year 160. Although it was again of turf and timber construction, it was larger than the {{previous}} fort, measuring [...] to accommodate extra granaries (horrea). Around 200, the gatehouses of the fort were rebuilt in stone and the walls surrounding the fort were given a <b>stone</b> <b>facing.</b> The concentration of furnaces in sheds in part of the vicus associated with the fort {{has been described as}} an [...] "industrial estate", which would have been the first in Manchester. [...] Mamucium was included in the Antonine Itinerary, a 3rd-century register of roads throughout the Roman Empire. This and inscriptions on and repairs to buildings indicate that Mamucium was still in use {{in the first half of}} the 3rd century. The vicus may have been abandoned by the mid-3rd century; this is supported by the excavated remains of some buildings that were demolished and the materials robbed for use elsewhere. Evidence from coins indicates that although the civilian settlement associated with the fort had declined by the mid-3rd century, a small garrison may have remained at Mamucium into the late 3rd century and early 4th century.|$|E

500|$|The {{sanctuary}} is a {{precast concrete}} building {{designed in the}} brutalist style. [...] It features an overhanging concrete flat roof, concrete block foundation, and corrugated concrete wall panels. [...] Square clerestory windows are on the north, east, and west sides of the building's top level and narrow fixed-light windows are on the first floor. [...] The east and west sides of the sanctuary are five bays wide while {{the north and south}} sides feature three bays, a large central bay with a smaller bay on each side. [...] The bays are defined by tall concrete columns, spaced [...] apart, that stand from the ground to the underside of the roof. [...] Pale blue wooden doors flanked by black wooden frames provide access to the sanctuary while there are two narrow doors on the north side. [...] The main entrance to the sanctuary is on the south side where the 1994 addition is sited. [...] The 1994 addition runs along the entire south side of the sanctuary and extends west past the building. [...] It is a [...] building that includes a social hall, classrooms, and office space. [...] Like the sanctuary, the 1994 addition features a flat roof and concrete foundation. [...] The concrete walls are a lighter color than the sanctuary and are also smoother. [...] A one-story terrace was originally on the southeast corner of the 1994 addition, but this was replaced by the 2013 addition, named the Celebration Center.

2500|$|The Haussmann façade was {{organized}} around horizontal lines that often continued from one {{building to the}} next: balconies and cornices [...] were perfectly aligned without any noticeable alcoves or projections, {{at the risk of}} the uniformity of certain quarters. The rue de Rivoli served {{as a model for the}} entire network of new Parisian boulevards. For the building façades, the technological progress of stone sawing and (steam) transportation allowed the use of massive stone blocks instead of simple <b>stone</b> <b>facing.</b> The street-side result was a [...] "monumental" [...] effect that exempted buildings from a dependence on decoration; sculpture and other elaborate stonework would not become widespread until the end of the century.|$|E

[...] The hall, which has an exterior wall only on the London Road side because of the slope of the land, also has arch-headed trefoil windows and stone dressings.

2500|$|Structure 29 {{is a small}} mound {{that was}} a three-tiered pyramid {{platform}} measuring [...] at the base. It is out of alignment with the other structures in the west group. The mound was [...] high when excavated but the structure's original height has been calculated as approximately [...] based on the angle of its stairway. The <b>stone</b> <b>facing</b> was poor quality, consisting of rough, unequal stones placed haphazardly and cemented with mud mortar. This was then roughly covered with a thick, uneven coating of mortar. The lowest tier of the platform was [...] high, the middle tier measured [...] in height and the third tier was approximately [...] high. The stairway climbed {{the west side of}} the platform and projected [...] from the base of the pyramid. Structure29 was built over an earlier structure that was similar in form. The poor workmanship associated with Structure 29 indicates that it was probably one of the last major structures to be erected at Quelepa. Ceramic evidence indicates that the building was abandoned at the end of the occupational history of the site, around AD 1000 at the beginning of the Early Postclassic period.|$|E
2500|$|Three main gates on the north, {{south and}} west {{are part of the}} fortifications of the Purana Qila, the sixth city of Delhi, built by Sher Shah Suri (1538–45). Sher Shah Suri raised his citadel after {{demolishing}} Dinpanah, the city built by Humayun. The fortifications of the Qila extended to a boundary of (...) on an irregularly oblong plan. Bastions adorned the corners and the western wall. Of the existing three gates, the west gate forms the entrance to the Qila and is called the Bara Darwaza (big gate). All three gates are doublestoried structures built with red sandstone and have chhatris. The enclosure wall inside has cells in twobay depth. The northern gate, built in 1543–44, is called the Talaqi-Darwaza for reasons unknown. On this gate, in the front, carved marble leogryphs in combat with a man are seen above the oriel windows. Built in random rubble masonry with dressed <b>stone</b> <b>facing,</b> the gate has a tall arch enclosed by two smaller arched openings. Two bastions adorn the gate with high ceiling rooms. On {{the second floor of the}} gate, there are two openings. Exterior surface of the gate had coloured tiles and the inner rooms were covered with incised plaster work. The Purana Qila was stated to have been left unfinished by Suri, which was later completed by Humayun. The southern gate is called the Humayun Darwaza; the reasons attributed for the name are that either Humayun built it or the gate overlooked Humayun’s tomb. An inscription in ink on the gate refers to Sher Shah with the date as 950 A.H. (1543–44).|$|E
2500|$|Structure 3 is {{the largest}} {{structure}} at Quelepa. It is situated [...] {{to the east of}} the smaller pyramid Structure4, on the third terrace rising northwards from the river. Both the terrace upon which it stands and the structure itself were faced with large, finely cut stone blocks. Structure3 was built somewhat after Structure4, which was already in use during its construction. Considerable effort was made to artificially level the volcanic tuff surface of the terrace before construction began. The pyramid probably had eight stepped levels, with the lowest measuring [...] and the highest measuring approximately [...] It is not aligned precisely with Structure3, being oriented 5° east of north, a 10° variance from the earlier structure. The lower levels of the pyramid measured between [...] high, the fourth level was higher, measuring [...] The lower levels had a horizontal depth of between , the upper levels of approximately [...] The front (south) face of the pyramid was not straight, the angles of the southern corners were slightly greater than 90° with the facade of the pyramid extending out slightly to meet the access ramp. The excavator concluded that this was to create the illusion that the building was larger than its actual size. The pyramidal base originally stood between [...] high. The access ramp was [...] wide and originally faced in stone, as uncovered during the 1949 excavations by Pedro Armillas. However, after the excavations, the owners of the Hacienda La Obrajuelo stripped the <b>stone</b> <b>facing</b> to be reused as construction material in San Miguel. The surviving remains of the ramp project [...] {{from the front of the}} pyramid, ending [...] from the edge of the supporting terrace. The ramp had a total length of approximately [...] from base to summit and an initial incline of 18.5° that increased to 28° at the upper levels. [...] The south face of Structure 3, including the access ramp, is badly eroded with the damage having been accelerated by the original excavations at the site. Structure3 was built on top of an earlier structure that had been deliberately destroyed to make way for the new building. Structure3-sub is estimated to have been [...] high. Construction of the final structure is estimated to have begun around AD 500.|$|E
