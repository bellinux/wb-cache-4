40|$|Background: Clavicular {{prominence}} {{is common}} in patients with symptomatic degenerative sternoclavicular arthritis. It is unclear if this is caused by enlargement or subluxation of the clavicle. The aim of this report is to describe a reproducible measurement technique to evaluate {{the relationship of the}} medial clavicular head to the manubrium. Methods: One hundred normal <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints,</b> twenty-five <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> with symptomatic degenerative arthritis, and twenty-five non-symptomatic <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> on the contralateral side were studied with three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction with use of computer modeling. The greatest width (anterior-posterior distance) and height (superior-inferior distance) of the clavicle in the sagittal plane were measured, and the positions of the anterior and superior borders of the medial clavicle and their distances to the frontal and axial planes, respectively, were evaluated. The ratio of the anterior-posterior distance to the anterior-frontal plane distance was measured to evaluate the anterior-posterior position of the clavicle and the ratio of the superior-inferior distance to the superior-axial plane distance was measured to evaluate its superoinferior position. If the ratio was not in the 95 % normal range, the clavicle was defined as subluxated. The reproducibility of this technique was evaluated {{on the basis of the}} interobserver and intraobserver reliability. Results: This technique showed good interobserver and intraobserver reliability. The mean anterior-posterior and superior-inferior distances were significantly larger in association with symptomatic sternoclavicular arthritis than in the normal <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> (p < 0001). The clavicle was subluxated anteriorly in twenty-two of the twenty-five cases of symptomatic sternoclavicular arthritis, but it was not subluxated superiorly. Conclusions: The medial clavicular head in patients with degenerative sternoclavicular arthritis is significantly larger than it is in the normal population, and it is usually subluxated anteriorly...|$|R
40|$|The joints of 56 {{patients}} with polymyalgia rheumatica were examined {{for evidence of}} inflammatory synovitis. x Rays, isotope scans, and thermography supplemented clinical examination. Control <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> were examined at necropsy. Peripheral and axial synovitis were uncommon and the results contrast {{with the findings of}} several recent studies...|$|R
25|$|The unique {{feature of}} the {{temporomandibular}} joint is the articular disc. The disc is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue that is positioned between the two bones that form the joint. The temporomandibular joints {{are one of the}} few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joint.</b> The disc divides each joint into two.These two compartments are synovial cavities, which consists of an upper and a lower synovial cavity. The synovial membrane lining the joint capsule produces the synovial fluid that fills these cavities.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} a ball-and-socket joint formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, acromion and coracoid processes. The main joint of the shoulder is the shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint), between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The acromioclavicular joint and <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joint</b> {{also play a role}} in shoulder movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the joint space is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the joint space are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the shoulder joint - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joint.</b> Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of erosive arthropathy of the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> in 25 consecutive cases of polymyalgia rheumatica was studied {{by means of}} sternoclavicular tomography.

40|$|The {{clinical}} and experimental searches are relatively less on <b>sternoclavicular</b> and acromioclavicular <b>joints.</b> The data found in literature are incompatible. Usually <b>sternoclavicular</b> and acromioculavicular <b>joints</b> considered in total movements of shoulder girdle, {{because it is}} difficult to be measured separately by traditional methods. The electronic digital inclinometer (EDI 320) improved by Cybex Co is a very precise and portable device and it can be used easily. Its reality and reliability at measurements of range of motion (ROM) of limbs was proved, but it was not applied on <b>sternoclavicular</b> and acromioclavicular <b>joints.</b> Therefore we searched the practicability of the inclinometer on these joints. 40 volunteer university students (20 men and 20 women) participated in our study. Protraction-retraction and elevation-depression movements of <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> and scapular abduction-adduction movements of acromioclavicular joints were measured on both right and left joints. The most suitable position for subject and researcher and location of device's probe was determined for the measurement of each movement. The first results found in this preliminary study which are proposed to form a method were like this: average value for protraction + retraction is 450, for elevation + depression is 400, for scapular abduction + adduction is 550.

40|$|A 45 -year-old patient {{presented}} with recurrent upper chest pain of 5 years duration. The physical examination revealed prominent and tender <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> bilaterally (Fig 1). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 35 mm {{at the end}} of 1 hour and CRP within normal limits. HLA-B 27 was negative and Rheumatoid factor negative. Patient did not have a history of fever. CT scan of the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> (Fig 2) revealed expansion of the clavicular ends, hyperostosis as well as erosions involving the sternum as well as medial end of clavicle bilaterally. Patient did not have any history of skin lesions. The radiological changes are characteristic changes of Sternoclavicular Hyperostosis, a subtype of SAPHO syndrome (1, 2). The acronym SAPHO stands for Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, and Osteitis. The skin lesions may manifest years later and may not parallel with the bony lesions (3). The condition is under- recognized and commonly mistaken for septic cause; especially for a tuberculous cause. Awareness of the syndrome and its skeletal manifestation will lead to an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment...|$|R
2500|$|Only {{the left}} common carotid artery has a {{substantial}} {{presence in the}} thorax. [...] It originates directly from the aortic arch, and travels upward through the superior mediastinum {{to the level of}} the left <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E
2500|$|While not {{directly}} a shoulder problem, this may affect shoulder functionality due to problems with sternoclavicular rotation. [...] A sternoclavicular separation {{occurs when the}} sternum separates from the clavicle at the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joint.</b> [...] Sternoclavicular separations (dislocation and subluxation) are rare [...] and generally caused by accident. [...] If the clavicle is separated posteriorly (i.e. the clavicle separates and goes behind the sternum) the situation can be dangerous and the clavicle can cause damage to interior arteries, veins or organs.|$|E
50|$|Trauma {{may result}} in the {{dislocation}} of the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joint.</b> Posterior dislocation puts the mediastinal structures at risk. A spontaneous partial dislocation can also occur sometimes.

40|$|A {{study of}} the degree of {{accessory}} movements available in the <b>sternoclavicular</b> and acromioclavicular <b>joints</b> as a result of passive movement is presented. Using the common terms of hypomobility, normal and hypermobility and defining another set of terms — the pure, mixed and heterogenous triplets — findings based on a sample of 64 children indicate that the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints,</b> in comparison to the acromioclavicular joints, are decisively less mobile; are more uniformly constrained in their linear motions along the relevant anatomical planes; and exhibit a higher degree of left/right symmetry. The significance of these findings both from the biomechanical and clinical aspect is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} group, the {{scapulohumeral}} or glenohumeral joint is the anatomical joint mechanically {{linked to the}} physiological subdeltoid or suprahumeral joint (the [...] "second shoulder joint") so that movements in the latter results in movements in the former. In the second group, the scapulocostal or scapulothoracic joint is the important physiological joint that can not function without the two anatomical joints in the group, the acromioclavicular and <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints,</b> i.e. they join {{both ends of the}} clavicle.|$|R
40|$|Amyloid-containing tissues were sampled from 19 {{capsules}} and 10 cartilages from hip, {{knee and}} <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> of 16 elderly patients. Heart ventricles from 3 {{of these patients}} were also studied. Histochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed and amyloid fibrils extracted from one hip capsule. The results indicate that 9 of 13 hip capsules contained prealbumin-like amyloid fibril protein ASc 1, a finding characteristic of senile systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid of 16 out of 17 other joint structures showed no reaction with anti-ASc 1 or antisera to 3 other systemic forms of amyloid, indicating that they represent localized forms of amyloid.

50|$|The <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joint</b> is the {{articulation}} of the manubrium of the sternum and the first costal cartilage with the medial end of the clavicle. It is a saddle type of synovial joint but functions as a plane joint. The <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joint</b> accommodates {{a wide range of}} scapula movements and can be raised to a 60° angle.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a type}} III injury with {{avulsion}} of the coracoclavicular ligament {{from the}} clavicle, with the distal clavicle displaced posteriorly into or through the trapezius and may tent the posterior skin. A displaced clavicle is easily seen on a radiograph. It is important to evaluate the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joint</b> also, because there can be an anterior dislocation of the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joint</b> and posterior dislocation of the AC joint. This injury is generally acknowledged to require surgery.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{the only}} true {{anatomical}} joints between the shoulder girdle and the axial skeleton are the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> on each side. No anatomical joint exists between each scapula and the rib cage; instead the muscular connection or physiological joint between the two permits great mobility of the shoulder girdle compared to the compact pelvic girdle; because the upper limb is not usually involved in weight bearing, its stability has been sacrificed in exchange for greater mobility. In those species having only the scapula, no joint exists between the forelimb and the thorax, the only attachment being muscular.|$|R
40|$|Aims: Tuberculous {{infection}} of the thoracic cage is rare and is difficult to discern clinically or on radiographs. This study aims to describe the common sites and the imaging appearances of chest wall tuberculosis. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of the clinical and imaging records of 12 confirmed cases of thoracic cage tuberculosis (excluding that of the spine), {{seen over the last}} 7 years, was performed. Imaging studies available included radiographs, ultrasonographies (USGs), and computed tomography (CT) scans. Pathological confirmation was obtained in all cases. Results: All patients had clinical signs and symptoms localized to the site of involvement, whether it was the sternum, <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints,</b> or ribs. CT scan revealed sternal destruction in three patients and osteolytic lesions with sclerosis of the articular surfaces of the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> in two patients. In five patients with rib lesions, USG elegantly demonstrated the bone destruction underlying the cold abscess. All cases were confirmed to be of tuberculous origin by pathology studies of the aspirated/curetted material, obtained by CT / USG guidance. Conclusions: Tuberculous etiology should be considered for patients presenting with atypical sites of skeletal inflammation. CT scan {{plays an important role in}} the evaluation of these patients. However, the use of USG for demonstrating rib destruction in a chest wall cold abscess has so far been under-emphasized, as has been the role of CT and USG guided aspiration in confirming the aetiology...|$|R
40|$|Two sisters with diffuse chronic sclerosing {{osteomyelitis}} of the mandible and the humerus and the synovitis, acne, pustolosis, hyperostosis and osteitis syndrome (SAPHO syndrome) are presented. The {{diagnoses of}} diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis {{at the age}} of 12 years and 27 years, respectively, were based on typical medical history, clinical symptoms and radiographic, histologic and scintigraphic findings. Because skin lesions and scintigraphic enhancement of the <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> with hyperostosis were present, a SAPHO syndrome was diagnosed in both sisters. Microbiological cultures of biopsy specimens revealed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus at the humerus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Veilonella species at the mandible. Repeated operative procedures, including decortications, resection and reconstruction, and multiple histologic and microbiologic studies were performed over a period of up to 20 years. Since HLA typing yielded identical gene loci, we suggest that hereditary and autoimmune factors {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of these cases...|$|R

50|$|Examples of {{this form}} of {{articulation}} {{are found in the}} hip, where the rounded head of the femur (ball) rests in the cup-like acetabulum (socket) of the pelvis, and in the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder, where the rounded head of the humerus (ball) rests in the cup-like glenoid fossa (socket) of the shoulder blade.

30|$|The {{shoulder}} has {{the greatest}} range of motion of all joints in the human body.

[1991]). However, since the glenohumeral joint (GH) has little bony stability, its supporting passive (labral and ligamentous) and dynamic (muscular) restraints help to preserve shoulder function.|$|R
40|$|Chronic mandibular {{osteomyelitis}} is an intractable disease. In recent years, some {{case reports}} have related this disease process to synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, which is chronic with frequent remissions and exacerbations. This report describes {{a case of}} chronic mandibular osteomyelitis suspected to be SAPHO syndrome. A 68 -year-old woman presented with pain {{on the left side}} of the mandible. On the basis of clinical and radiological findings, chronic mandibular diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis was initially diagnosed. We administrated oral clarithromycin (400 mg daily) and levofloxacin (500 mg daily), and her pain subsequently resolved. On 99 mTc-labeled methylene diphosphonate scintigraphy, tracer uptake in the asymptomatic mandible was unchanged, but there was increasing tracer uptake in the sternocostal and <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints,</b> compared with 99 mTc-labeled methylene diphosphonate scintigraphic findings of the first visit. We diagnosed SAPHO syndrome and administrated oral sodium risedronate hydrate (2. 5 mg daily).

40|$|SAPHO {{syndrome}} (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis), a rare inflammatory disorder, is {{an association}} of distinct skin disorders with pustules with osteoarticular inflammation. Its etiology remains unclear, and various treatment regimens frequently fail to control the disease. An 18 -year-old male patient presented to the outpatient department with severe nodulocystic acne on the face with pain at both the wrists and lower back associated with high-grade fever and chills. On physical examination, he had severe tenderness at both wrist joints and lower back, along with swelling of right wrist. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed osteitis of the distal end of the right radius. Technetium- 99 m-MDP Whole Body Bone Scan revealed increased metaphyseal uptake in distal radius {{on both sides and}} prominent uptake at the sacroiliac joints, vertebral end plate, left 7 th costo-vertebral <b>joint</b> and bilateral <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> and manubrium sternum (resulting in “bull's head” sign, which is characteristic of SAPHO syndrome).

40|$|We {{report a}} case of 73 -year-old man with massive {{hyperostosis}} of the cervical spine associated with {{diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis}} (DISH), resulting in dysphagia, hoarseness and acute respiratory insufficiency. An emergency operation was performed, which involved excision of osteophytes at the level of C 6 –C 7, compressing the trachea against enlarged <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints,</b> also affected by DISH. Approximately 3  years later, the patient sustained a whiplash injury in a low impact car accident, resulting in a C 3 –C 4 fracture dislocation, which was not immediately diagnosed because he did not seek medical attention after the accident. For the next 6  months, he had constant cervical pain, which was growing worse and eventually became associated with dysphagia and dyspnoea, ending once again in acute respiratory failure due to bilateral palsy of the vocal cords. The patient underwent a second operation, which comprised partial reduction and combined anteroposterior fixation of the fractured vertebrae. Twenty months after the second operation, mild hoarseness was still present, but all other symptoms had disappeared.

40|$|Synovitis was {{observed}} in 13 out of 88 consecutive patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. It is described in detail in five patients, {{on the basis of}} clinical and radiological observations, joint aspiration, arthroscopy and biopsy. The synovitis of polymyalgia rheumatica cannot be dis-tinguished histologically or at arthroscopy from the appearance seen in mild rheumatoid arthritis. Clinically, however, the synovitis of polymyalgia rheumatica is mild, transient and confined to one or two joints or tendon sheaths. It is not followed by joint deformity or by radiological erosive changes in the bone ends. It may occur at any stage of the disease but particularly at its onset, or when the dose of corticosteroid treatment is reduced. SYNOVITIS is infrequent in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). It is often the absence of joint involvement in patients with proximal limb-girdle stiffness, constitutional illness and a rapid erythrocyte sedimentation rate (e. s. r.) that suggests this diagnosis. However, it does occasionally occur, for example, in four out of sixty-five patients reported by Dixon (1970). Non-specific synovitis has also been described in biopsy studies from the shoulder and <b>sternoclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> of three series of patients (Gordon, Rennie and Branwood, 1964; Andrews, 1965; and Bruk, 1967) ...|$|R
