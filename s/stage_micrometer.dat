The {{aim was to}} explore the use of foliar micro-anatomical traits in resolving the lingering systematic challenges associated with this fruit crop. Leaves of four varieties of Mangifera (Big-no-fibre, Julie, Opioro and Small-fibre varieties) were collected across various locations in the North Central part of Nigeria. Eighty (80) permanent slides were prepared from the foliar abaxial and adaxial surfaces following standard microscopic practices. Micrometry was carried out using the calibrated ocular and <b>stage</b> <b>micrometers</b> mounted on the compound microscope. From each specimen, thirteen (13) characters were examined and analysed. Mean values of all characters were computed and analysed using the SPSS software (20. 0 versions). Pearson’s correlation matrix was generated to ascertain the association among the characters. Dendrogram was constructed using the Ward’s method to classify the varieties {{on the basis of}} their similarities and differences. From the result obtained, the Julie mango had the longest epidermal cell length of 57 µm (adaxial) followed by the Smallfibre type with 55. 3 µm (abaxial).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} direct {{methods for}} vision-based {{control for the}} application of industrial inkjet printing. In this, visual control is designed with a direct coupling between camera measurements and joint motion. Traditional visual servoing commonly has a slow visual update rate and needs an additional local joint controller to guarantee stability. By only using the product as reference and sampling with a high update rate, direct visual measurements are sufficient for controlled positioning. The proposed method is simpler and more reliable than standard motor encoders, despite the tight real-time constraints. This direct visual control method is experimentally verified with a 2 D planar motion <b>stage</b> for <b>micrometer</b> positioning. To achieve accurate and fast motion, a balance is found between frame rate and image size. With a frame rate of 1600 fps and an image size of 160 × 100 pixels we show the effectiveness of the approach...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop a {{three-dimensional}} imaging method for studies of deformation in low-density materials during loading, and to implement finite element solutions of the elastic equations based on the images. Specimens of silica-reinforced polysiloxane foam pads, 15 mm in diameter by 1 mm thick, were used for this study. The nominal pore density was 50 %, and the pores approximated interconnected spheres. The specimens were imaged with microtomography at {approx} 16 {micro}m resolution. A rotating <b>stage</b> with <b>micrometer</b> driven compression allowed imaging of the foams during deformation with precise registration of the images. A finite element mesh, generated from the image voxels, was used to calculate the mechanical properties of the structure, and the results were compared with conventional mechanical testing. The foam exhibited significant nonlinear behavior with compressive loading. The finite-element calculations from the images, which were in excellent agreement with experimental data, suggested that nonlinear behavior in the load displacement curves arises from buckling of the cell walls during compression and not from any nonlinear properties of the base elastomer. High-resolution microtomography, coupled with efficient finite-element modeling, shows promise for improving our understanding of the deformation behavior of cellular materials...|$|R
30|$|If the IRR {{camera was}} focused on the high point of the panel, near the center, and no focus {{adjustments}} were made as the painting was scanned, the individual IRR image frames would blur near the left and right sides. Two different actions could be taken to restore focus as the IRR image frames were collected. One option would be to adjust the focus of the lens, but this would change the magnification. The other option would be to leave the focus of the lens unchanged and adjust the distance between the camera and the painting until the image is in focus again. Only the latter approach would keep the image magnification fixed while scanning, and thus this latter approach was used. The IR camera system was mounted on a translation <b>stage</b> with a <b>micrometer</b> screw, which allowed moving the camera along the optical axis of the lens, the z-axis.|$|R

To his delight the East India Company were willing to undertake such a venture and ordered a second great theodolite from Ramsden. It was ready in 1791 but Ramsden felt obliged to increase the price because of problems in its manufacture. To his surprise the company rejected his price and refused to purchase the instrument. It was bought by the Duke of Richmond who, as Master of the Board of Ordnance, had provided most of the finance for Roy's Anglo-French Survey (1784-1790). The theodolite is designated as the Board of Ordnance theodolite, or Ramsden BO in short. Richmond's intention was to use the new theodolite on the extension of Roy's survey to the southern counties of Britain. The instrument was basically the same as the first with added refinements, mainly to the number and placement of the microscopes with their precision <b>micrometer</b> <b>stages.</b> It was in use until the completion of the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain in 1853 and it is now in the Science Museum in London.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{method of}} {{improving}} coating thickness measurement repeatability {{of the ball}} crater method is proposed. The improvement is realized by using image processing techniques to measure the radii of crater circles from a microscope image. While traditional methods use {{a limited number of}} operator-selected points on a circle edge to calculate the radius value, the new method measures the radius by fitting a circle to all edge points of a crater circle edge, which is automatically extracted from the microscope image of the crater by image processing techniques. This eliminates the randomness introduced by human operators in the traditional methods and improves the measurement repeatability. Experimental results confirm the feasibility of our method and its potential in improving the measurement repeatability and increasing measurement accuracy of the ball crater method. Traditional methods of measuring the radii of the circles are subjective as they involve the use of human operators. For example, one method (two point method) is to move the sample <b>stage</b> by a <b>micrometer</b> drive in a direction normal to a line on the microscope eyepiece reticles and record the readings of the micrometer at two positions, where the line becomes the tangent of the circle [2]. The subtraction of the two readings provides the diameter of the circle. These two positions are defined by the operator. The other method (three point method) is to calculate the radius by using the coordinates of three points on the circle [2]. In the latter method, the locations of the three points are chosen by the operator. Index Terms—Digital image processing, measurement repeatability, thickness measurement, coatings T I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{simultaneous}} {{measurement technique}} based on planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging (PLIF) and particle image/tracking velocimetry (PIV/PTV) is described {{for the investigation}} of the hydrodynamic characteristics of harmonically excited liquid thin-film flows. The technique is applied as part of an extensive experimental campaign that covers four different Kapitza (Ka) number liquids, Reynolds (Re) numbers spanning the range 2. 3 – 320, and inlet-forced/wave frequencies in the range 1 – 10 Hz. Film thicknesses (from PLIF) for flat (viscous and unforced) films are compared to <b>micrometer</b> <b>stage</b> measurements and analytical predictions (Nusselt solution), with a resulting mean deviation being lower than the nominal resolution of the imaging setup (around 20 μm). Relative deviations are calculated between PTV-derived interfacial and bulk velocities and analytical results, with mean values amounting to no more than 3. 2 % for both test cases. In addition, flow rates recovered using LIF/PTV (film thickness and velocity profile) data are compared to direct flowmeter readings. The mean relative deviation is found to be 1. 6 % for a total of six flat and nine wavy flows. The practice of wave/phase-locked flow-field averaging is also implemented, allowing the generation of highly localized velocity profile, bulk velocity and flow rate data along the wave topology. Based on this data, velocity profiles are extracted from 20 locations along the wave topology and compared to analytically derived ones based on local film thickness measurements and the Nusselt solution. Increasing the waviness by modulating the forcing frequency is found to result in lower absolute deviations between experiments and theoretical predictions ahead of the wave crests, and higher deviations behind the wave crests. At the wave crests, experimentally derived interfacial velocities are overestimated by nearly 100 %. Finally, locally non-parabolic velocity profiles are identified ahead of the wave crests; a phenomenon potentially linked to the cross-stream velocity field...|$|R

Rice hull is an environmental friendly natural source of silicon. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of rice hull as a Si source on anthracnose disease and also on fruit cuticle thickness (CT), total soluble and cell wall-bound phenolic compounds (TSP and CWBP) in fruits and formation of fungal appressoria on fruits as possible mechanisms of disease reduction in capsicum (Capsicum annuum L.). In this study a simplified hydroponics system (SHS) with rice hull as an inert media and nutrients supplied with either NF (New Formula) or Albert's solution was used. A liquid hydroponic system (LHS) was also maintained with same nutrient solutions as controls. Disease development was assessed by challenge inoculation with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides on fruits. CT was measured using <b>stage</b> and ocular <b>micrometer.</b> TSP and CWBP in fruits were analysed by Folin-Ciocalteu method during first 5 days after inoculation (DAI). Appressoria formation by fungal conidia on fruit peels at inoculated spots was observed through micrometer daily after inoculation. More than 83 % disease reduction was observed in fruits harvested from SHS compared to that of LHS supplied with both nutrient solutions. There were significantly higher values of CT and CWBP (about 45 % and 30 % respectively) in fruits from SHS compared to that of LHS (Si-free). However, TSP was not significantly affected by Si treatment. A higher percentage of appressoria was prevailed on fruits harvested from SHS thus the disease initiation was delayed compared to that of LHS. There may be a possibility that germination of appressoria was hindered by thicker cuticle or biochemical reaction involved with induced CWBP in fruits from Si treated plants...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the development, characterization and suggested applications of {{a platform for}} controlling the chemical environment around a cell or a cell constituent. The platform is unique in its capability to combine rapid solution switching with precise timing and access to a manifold of solution environments. It {{can be used to}} present a sequence of different solution environments to a cell or cell constituent, with rapid switching between them. Furthermore, the system can be used to expose cells and their constituents to complex chemical waves and oscillations, either mimicking concentration variations found in vivo, or of artificially composed patterns. The system comprises a microfluidic device and a motorized computer-controlled scanning <b>stage</b> that has <b>micrometer</b> precision. The device contains a varied number of channels which start in individual sample reservoirs and exit as a closely packed array into an open volume. By loading the sample reservoirs with different solutions, a stripe-patterned flow can be formed outside the channel exits. If a cell is scanned in this patterned flow, its chemical environment can be controlled and varied with high precision. The platform can be used for applications in ion channel research and drug discovery. To confirm this, it was combined with standard patch-clamp equipment, and rapid generation of dose-response curves and sequential stimulation of an ion channel population with different kinds of agonists were demonstrated. Additional possible applications of the system range from elucidation of signalling network properties, to experiments on decoding of temporal signalling patterns that are used by cells. To characterize the stripe-patterned fluid flow, and the diffusion-driven mixing of species within it, fluorescence microscopy and scanning nanoelectrode amperometry were used.

Different groups included {{equal number of}} immature heifers, mature heifers, lactating and non-lactating animals. Tissues fixed in 10 % NBF were processed as per routine and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Massons trichome. Morphometry {{was done with the}} help of <b>stage</b> and ocular <b>micrometer.</b> Gross studies revealed that the camel's udder consists of four quarters. The udder and teat showed light brown to solid black tinge in colour. The tips of teats sloped to a point both in immature and mature animals, however, the conformation of teats turned rounded at the tips in lactating camels. Each teat possessed two teat canals. The dimensions of teat and streak canal varied markedly among four different groups. Number of Furestenberg's rosettes ranged from 11. 6 to 13. 6. Microscopic studies revealed that streak canal was lined by stratified squamous keratinized epithelium that was partially extremely thin in some parts. Cutaneous layer of teat was devoid of hair follicles except at the base of teat. Follicles were associated with sebaceous glands. Sweat glands were less coiled and showed a wide acinous element forming the part of excretory duct. Glomus organs occurred in the stratum profundum of the corium {{as well as in the}} subcutis of the skin of mammary gland. They also revealed great variation in structure and size. Epithelial lining of the alveoli varied from flattened to columnar according to physiological state.

40|$|Background: Articular {{cartilage}} normally {{functions as}} a load-bearing resistant material in joints. Patella is composed of hyaline cartilage and spongy bone. Chondrocytes form only 1 - 5 % volume of the articular cartilage. They receive their nutrition by diffusion through the matrix. The alteration in articular cartilage become apparent following immobilization, from 4 to 6 weeks. Until now, focus of research has been the whole cartilage. Zonal changes have not been studied in detail. Since superficial zone bears maximum load and is the first zone to come in contact, {{the present study was}} designed to determine changes in thickness on immobilization and remobilization in superficial zone after dividing it into proximal, central, and distal segments. Materials and Methods: Forty male rats belonging to Sprague Dawley strain were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n= 20) subdivided into an experimental subgroup of 10 rats that were immobilized in plaster of Paris (POP) for 4 weeks and a control subgroup of 10 that were not immobilized. Group 2 (n= 20) subdivided into an experimental subgroup of 10 rats that were immobilized for 4 weeks and remobilized for next 4 weeks and a control subgroup of 10 animals that were not immobilized. At the end of the experimental period, the knee joint was dissected and was cut in sagittal plane. The section was fixed in 10 % formalin for 48 hours. Specimen was decalcified using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The paraffin blocks of 7 μm sections were cut and stained by H and E stain for routine histology and Alcian blue stain and Mallory Trichrome for fine structural microscopy. The zones were named as superficial transitional, radial, and hypertrophic according to the shape of cells present in each zone. The superficial zone was divided into superior part, central, and inferior parts. These parts were labeled as central, proximal, and distal segments. The calibrated <b>stage</b> <b>micrometer</b> was used to calibrate the ocular micrometer under objectives of different power. The ocular micrometer was placed inside the ocular lens. It was calibrated with the <b>stage</b> <b>micrometer</b> under objective lenses of different power. The number of divisions of ocular covering each zone was calculated. These divisions were converted into micrometer and the actual thickness was calculated. Results: The significant decrease in thickness of superficial zone in proximal, central and distal segment was observed in experimental group in comparison to control group. When the experimental subgroup of group 2 was compared with experimental subgroup of group 1 (group immobilized for 4 weeks), no significant reversal was seen in superficial zone and instead significant decrease was observed in distal segment. Fibrous connective tissue was increased adjacent to superficial zone. Conclusion: Each segment of superficial zone behaves differentially on immobilization and remobilization. Perhaps a much longer duration of remobilization is required to reverse changes of immobilization in articular cartilage and plays a significant role in knee joint movements...|$|E

The second group received normal saline and radiation. The third group received pretreatment with dexamethasone at 1 mg/kg body weight/day for 2 days followed by radiation. Radiation {{was delivered to}} the animals as a single fraction of 2. 5 Gy of gamma rays from Cobalt- 60 source, using an AECL Theatron 780 -C Teletherapy machine. After exposure to the different interventions, the animals were sacrificed on the 14 th post-irradiation day and the kidneys dissected out from each animal. The renal tissues were subjected to histological processing, and then studied using an eyepiece objective ruler calibrated with a 2 mm <b>stage</b> <b>micrometer</b> for histomorphometric studies. The result of the study showed that all irradiated animals suffered weight loss by the 14 th day post-irradiation (p< 0. 05) irrespective of the additional treatment with dexamethasone and this was statistically significant. Histomorphometry showed that the maximum width of the glomerular capsule was significantly greater in the radiation groups than in the control at p< 0. 05. The maximal glomerular diameter was significantly greater in irradiated animals compared with the control animals at p< 0. 05. The outcome of {{this study showed that}} the intraperitoneal administration of dexamethasone at 1 mg/kg body weight/day for 2 days prior to treatment with irradiation did not prevent weight loss nor ameliorate the swelling of th...|$|E
40|$|Background: Controversies still prevail on glomerular {{changes of}} kidney whether due to normal aging or its {{association}} with diseases. Objective: The aim {{of the present study}} was to see the variation in number and size of the glomeruli of kidney with increasing age in a Bangladeshi population based on autopsy. Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive study was done in the Department of Anatomy, Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka, from July 2008 to June 2009, based on collection of 140 post mortem human kidneys collected from 70 unclaimed dead bodies from the morgue. All the samples were divided into three age-groups: 10 - 19 years, 20 - 39 years and 40 - 59 years. Histological slides were prepared by using routine Harris ’ Haematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) stain. The number of glomeruli was measured by point counting technique, while the size (diameter) was measured by using ocular and <b>stage</b> <b>micrometer.</b> Results: The mean ± SE number of glomeruli per sq. mm found in the right and left kidney were 8. 45 ± 0. 52 and 8. 67 ± 0. 80 in group 10 - 19 years, 9. 90 ± 0. 42 and 9. 92 ± 0. 47 in 20 - 39 years, and 8. 52 ± 0. 18 and 8. 55 ± 0. 16 in 40 - 59 years respectively. Besides, the size (mean ± SE diameter) of glomeruli was found in the right and left kidney were 43. 96 ± 3. 01 ìm and 143. 92 ± 2. 90 ìm in group 10 - 19 years, 153. 69 ± 5. 18 ìm and 153. 61 ± 5. 24 ìm in 20 - 39 years, and 140. 48 ± 0. 95 ìm and 140. 78 ± 0. 88 ìm in 40 - 59 years respectively. Conclusion: No difference was found in number and size of glomeruli between right and left kidney in any group. Similarly, no difference was also evident among different age groups...|$|E
30|$|The {{trial was}} carried out in a {{randomized}} complete block design. Two trees from each stocking density with a total of sixteen trees from the two clones were sampled. The trees were cut at a height of 15  cm above the ground level. A cross-sectional disc of approximately 50  mm in thickness collected from each tree at 1.3  m above ground level was used in the determination of radial anatomical component characteristics. The discs were labeled, wrapped in black plastic bags and transported to the laboratory of wood anatomy for further analyses. Owing to indistinct growth rings in the samples, the radial variation in fibers, vessels, and wood ray cells for each disc was analyzed on a strip running from pith to bark [14, 15]. Radial blocks with precise dimensions of 15  ×  15  ×  15  mm with no intervals between them were cut from each strip. After removing the pith, 4 blocks from SD I and 3 blocks from SDs II, III, and IV were prepared, depending on the diameter at breast height of sampled trees and the radius of the strips. These blocks would enable detection of the gradual radial change in wood anatomical features. All blocks were properly numbered. Almost the middle part of each block was chosen for sectioning. Transverse and tangential microsections with thicknesses of 20 – 25  μm were obtained from each small block using a sledge microtome. To determine the fiber cell features, the maceration process used followed the TAPPI Standard T 233 -Su- 64 [16]. The fiber length (μm), fiber diameter (μm), fiber lumen diameter (μm), and fiber wall thickness (μm) of randomly selected fibers were measured by image processing software calibrated with a <b>stage</b> <b>micrometer.</b> Fiber diameter, fiber lumen diameter and fiber wall thickness were measured with a magnification of × 400 and for fiber length, vessel and ray cell components, a magnification of × 100 was used. A preliminary study was conducted to determine the number of fibers to be measured. High values of standard deviations were obtained with < 30 readings for each of the features recorded. Therefore, the final countable number was increased to 50 readings for every single component. Crosswise sectional microscopic images were measured using an Image Analyzer Microscope (Leica Qwin model). The vessel density (mm− 2), vessel diameter (the average of radial and tangential diameter, μm), and vessel area (%) were determined in every field under microscope. Likewise, ray density (mm− 2), ray height (number of parenchyma cells in every single ray cell), and ray area (tangential surface occupied by ray cells, %) were calculated in tangential section.|$|E

[...] Boston UniversityEnergy {{levels are}} {{characterized}} by the following properties: excitation energy, Q, angular momentum, parity, level width, isobaric spin, magnetic moment and configuration. They may be studied experimentally by the following methods: (1) measurement of the energy spectra of nuclear reaction products, (2) measurement of peaks in the yield curve {{as a function of}} incident particle energy to obtain levels in the compound nucleus, (3) measurement of gamma ray intensity as a function of bombarding particle energy, (4) measurement of the maximum beta decay energy to locate levels in the residual nucleus, (5) measurement of input particle energy thresholds for production of neutrons, (6) measurement of angular distributions and angular correlations to find the spin and parity of a level. The accurate measurement of neutron spectra is difficult because the uncharged neutron must be detected by indirect means. Cloud chambers, proportional counters, threshold detectors, time-of-flight methods, and nuclear emulsions have all been used successfully. Nuclear emulsions detect neutrons by the track of developable silver halide crystals left by a recoil proton after being struck by a neutron. The range of the recoil proton and the angle it made with the incident neutron beam are measured. Knowledge of the range-energy curve for the emulsion and application of the laws of conservation of energy and momentum determines the energy of the incident neutron. The emulsion consists of a high concentration of silver halide crystals embedded in gelatin. The following is a description of the nuclear emulsion method: A beam of particles strikes a target, neutrons are emitted, and they are detected by plates placed at several different angles with respect to the incident beam. Development of the plates must be done soon after exposure, since the latent image fades rapidly. In this experiment, a combination of the two-solution and low temperature development techniques was used. The plates are scanned with a microscope and the following quantities are measured: (1) θ, the dip angle in the processed emulsion, (2) l, the projection in the x-y plane of the track length in the processed emulsion, and (3) φ the angle l makes with the x axis. φ and θ are measured {{at the beginning of the}} track. To avoid large errors, only tracks which fall within certain acceptance criteria are measured. This experiment required the following criteria to be satisfied: (1) if φ≤ 10 °, tan θ≤ 0. 075, (2) if 10 ° 15 ° it is not accepted, and (4) the track must lie wholly within the emulsion. Scanning is done in strips one field of view wide and about half the plate length long. At each x and y coordinate setting the entire depth of the emulsion is searched for tracks, then the x coordinate is changed by about half a field of view, and the process is repeated. Strips are separated by two or three fields of view so that overlapping does not occur. Length measurements are made in eyepiece scale divisions, which must be converted to microns by calibrating against a <b>stage</b> <b>micrometer.</b> The emulsion thickness must be measured daily since it varies with humidity. Neutron energies are calculated by converting the measured track length to length in the unprocessed emulsion, and then applying conservation of energy and momentum. The number of tracks obtained per energy interval as a function of energy is tabulated. Two corrections are needed because: (1) the neutron-proton scattering cross section is strongly energy dependent, and (2) the probability of the recoil proton escaping from the emulsion increases with energy. Results are plotted in histogram form. The Q value for each neutron group is calculated; the highest neutron energy group usually represents formation of the ground state, the next highest represents the first excited state, etc. The energy resolution of the nuclear emulsion method is limited by the following factors: (1) Range straggling of protons in the emulsion, (2) energy straggling of the beam in the target, (3) energy spread of the beam, (4) multiple scattering of the protons in the emulsion, (5) length and angle measurement errors, (6) finite target size and angular spread of neutrons incident on the emulsion. This experiment was performed to measure the mass of p^ 28, by means of the reaction Si^ 28 (p,n) p^ 28. The target, a suspension of natural silicon in polystyrene, was bombarded by protons from the Princeton cyclotron, with an energy of 17. 45 ± 0. 15 Mev. The target thickness corresponded to an energy loss of 100 kev for 17 Mev protons, so the average proton energy reaching the plates was 17. 4 ± 0. 2 Mev. Ilford C- 2 plates, 400 microns thick, were placed 4. 5 in. from the target in an evacuated scattering chamber. Plates were mounted at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 degrees. At each angle two plates were sandwiched together, emulsions facing, and wrapped in aluminun 1 and lead foils. The beam was collimated by graphite apertures and was stopped by a graphite cup, relatively far from the plates. Plates were scanned at 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The range-energy relation of Rotblat was used. Data was corrected for n-p scattering and geometry. Five hundred tracks were measured at 30 ° and 90 °, and 250 tracks at 60 °. The ground state of p^ 28 was resolved only at 30 °, and actually the peak found in the 30 ° spectrum is probably due to both the ground and first excited states in p^ 28. Q for the ground state is - 14. 71 ± 0. 22 Mev; the mass defect of p^ 28 is 0. 68 ± 0. 22 Mev; the mass of p^ 28 is 28. 00073 ± 0. 00024 amu. The differential cross section at 30 ° for formation of the ground and first excited states of p^ 28 is 0. 27 ±. 018 mb/steradian. If one corrects for the Coulomb energy difference and the neutron-proton mass difference, the mass of p^ 28 is 9. 39 Mev greater than that of Si^ 28. This means that the ground state of p^ 28 probably corresponds to the lower of two levels in Si^ 28, located at about 9. 39 Mev. This is in excellent agreement with the hypothesis of charge independence of nuclear forces. The reactions Si^ 29 (p,n) p^ 29 and Si^ 30 (p,n) p^ 30 were observed. No new levels were found in either p^ 29 or p^ 30...|$|E
