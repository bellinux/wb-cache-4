Consequently our investigations were extended to include {{a comparison of the}} mixed juice ash results obtained via conductimetric and gravimetric analysis. The results obtained in this investigation indicate that conductivity ash values are representative of the ash content in South African mixed juice and that both methods of ash determination are equally precise...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental study}} was conducted targeting lubricant consumption effects on,diesel exhaust ash levels using a model year 2002 5. 9 L diesel engine, high and low Sulfur commercial lubricants, and clean diesel fuels. Regulatory decreases in allowable particulate matter emissions for on road diesel engines are driving industry to develop diesel particulate filters to trap and combust particulate. Remaining ash not combusted in this process clogs filters requiring engine down time and additional cleaning expenses. Recent reductions in fuel Sulfur and ash levels have also made lubricant consumption a significant relative contributor to particulate and ash generation. The goal of this study, a detailed understanding of lubricant contribution to particulate formation and ash transport, is required to enhance future filter design. 'The use of ultra clean fuels enhances accuracy of the Sulfur Dioxide tracer technique for estimating lubricant consumption and increases the relative contribution of lubricant to particulate emission. Results indicate the subject engine lubricant consumption is typical of others reported in literature. Particulate matter emission increases were measured after switching from a relatively low Sulfur, low <b>sulfated</b> <b>ash</b> oil to a high Sulfur, high <b>sulfated</b> <b>ash</b> lubricant. (cont.) Volatile organic fraction and ash emission rates measured using thermogravimetric analysis indicate exhaust ash increases correlate with increasing <b>sulfated</b> <b>ash</b> content and lubricant consumption. Increased exhaust Sulfur and wear metal debris can also increase relative ash in particulate. Particulate generated using high Sulfur fuels has a higher ash emission rate than that obtained using near zero Sulfur fuel. The consequences of on road emissions improvements will {{have a significant impact}} on -the marine industry in coming years. New emissions regulations are reducing allowable particulate emission from marine diesels for the first time, with adaptation of on road ·technologies for these applications expected in the near future. by Michael J.

Valeton, Rubiaceae. Macromorphological inspection of the vegetative parts both plants reveals only a slight difference in {{the arrangement of the}} petioles. Microscopic investigation of the plants roots used as crude drugs revealed however distinctive anatomical features. Prismatic calcium oxalate crystals and banded paratracheal parenchyma are characteristics of S. macrophylla while P. glabra displays an abundance as crystals. Other features such as vessels diameters and arrangements are also of diagnostic importance. Some of these characters were also identified in the powder of thes e plant materials and proposed for diagnostic purpose. The values for extraction of ethanol and water as well as total ash, acid-insoluble ash, water-soluble ash and <b>sulfated</b> <b>ash</b> were determined for both plants. Phytochemical studies were carried out on hexane and chloroform extracts of S. macrophylla and methanolic extract of P. glabra.

Data were analyzed by flame atomic absorption, using the air acetylene flame. For Pb, Zn, Ni, Mn and Cu the metal concentration obtained the acid digestion were higher than metal concentration were obtained in tests in the muffle furnace. This behavior observed in the muffle furnace occurs because these metals are fixed in stable sulfated compounds in the ashes, which are difficult to dissociate at flame temperature, and also due to the volatile character of the metals, mainly Pb and Zn. There was a constant concentration in the ashes in of Cr the acid digestion and muffle furnace tests. Results from tests using an XRD apparatus indicated, he formation of sulfated compounds in the ashes for both. coals. The analysis using microprobe electronic showed retention of metals like Ni, Mn, Cu, Fe, Ti and Ca.

This tree species {{has been of}} interest to researchers {{because it is a}} medicinal plant employed in the Indian traditional system of medicine. Pharmacognostic standardization; physico-and phytochemical evaluation of the roots of Amaranthus spinosus was carried out, to determine its macro-and microscopical characters, and also some of its quantitative standards. Microscopical studies were done by using the trinocular microscope. Total ash, water-soluble ash, acid-insoluble ash, <b>sulfated</b> <b>ash</b> values, and alcohol-and water-soluble extractive values were determined for physico-chemical evaluations. A preliminary phytochemical screening was also done to detect different phytoconstituents. Microscopically, the root showed cork, cortex, stellar region, and calcium oxalate crystals. Powder microscopy showed anamalous secondary growth in between the xylem vessels and Calcium Oxalate crystals in the cortex region. Total ash was approximately three times more than acid insoluble and water soluble ash. The ethanol soluble extractive was approximately the same as the water soluble extractive. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) of the Petroleum-ether extract using Benzene : Ethyl acetate (6 : 1), showed six spots. In the chloroform extract, using Benzene : Ethyl acetate (4 : 1) nine spots were seen, and in the ethanol extract, using Chloroform: Methanol (93 : 7), only four spots were observed, using Iodine vapor as a viewing medium. Phytochemically, the root exhibited terpenes, alkaloids, glycosides, and sugars. These findings might be useful to supplement information with regard to its identification parameters, which are assumed significant in the way of acceptability of herbal drugs, in the present scenario, which lacks regulatory laws to control the quality of herbal drugs...|$|E

Many markets produce nonproprietary medicines; assessing their efficacy and safety is difficult as regulators may approve nonproprietary drugs without bioequivalence data, genotoxic evaluation, or risk management plans (RMPs). This assessment {{is especially important for}} fingolimod given its solubility/bioavailability profile, genotoxicity risk, and low-dose final product (0. 5 mg). This paper presents an evaluation of the quality of proprietary and nonproprietary fingolimod variants. Methods: Proprietary fingolimod was used as a reference substance against which eleven nonproprietary fingolimod copies were assessed. The microparticle size distribution of each compound was assessed by laser light diffraction, and inorganic impurity content by <b>sulfated</b> <b>ash</b> testing. Heavy metals content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and levels of unspecified impurities by high-performance liquid chromatography. Solubility was assessed in a range of solvents at different pH values. Key information from the fingolimod RMP is also presented. Results: Nonproprietary fingolimod variants exhibited properties out of proprietary or internationally accepted specifications, including differences in particle size distribution and levels of impurities such as heavy metals. For microparticle size and heavy metals, all tested fingolimod copies were out-of-specification by several-fold magnitudes. Proprietary fingolimod has a well-defined RMP, highlighting known and potential mid- to long-term safety risks, and risk-minimization and pharmacovigilance procedures. Conclusion: Nonproprietary fingolimod copies produced by processes less well controlled than or altered from proprietary production processes may reduce product reproducibility and quality, potentially presenting risks to patients. Safety data and risk-minimization strategies for proprietary fingolimod may not apply to the nonproprietary fingolimod copies evaluated here. Market authorization of nonproprietary fingolimod copies should require an appropriate RMP to minimize risks to patients.

40|$|Lubricating oils, {{which are}} {{formulated}} {{with a number}} of chemicals blended base oils provide products that last longer, keep machinery cleaner and allow the machinery to work better under severe operating conditions. However, the used oil-waste generated by the automobiles and other allied industries poses an environmental hazard. The motivation of the present research study was to study the merits and demerits of commonly applicable technique acid/clay for reclamation of waste oil. This process has been employed for many years as the premier type of re-refining in which concentrated sulfuric acid is introduced to dehydrate waste lubricating oil. An acidic sludge is produced which is treated with clay. In this study, the conventional process of reclamation of waste oil, which is acid/clay, has been reviewed in the light of recovered product quality and hazardous effects on the environment and human health. Forty samples, in which, waste oil (10), reclaimed oil (30) were collected from different blending and reclamation plants located in different areas of the Punjab Province and were compared with two stroke blended oil (10 samples). The samples were tested for kinematic viscosity at 40 and 100 ºC, Viscosity Index, Flash point, <b>Sulfated</b> <b>Ash</b> content, Copper Corrosion, Water content, Sediments and Color by following the standard ASTM Methods D- 445, D- 2270, D- 92, D- 482, D- 130, D- 95, D- 473 and D- 1500 (ASTM, 2002), respectively. According to the results, blended reclaimed (two stroke) oil samples were found up to the recommended standard test limits. On the other hand, waste oil and reclaimed oil samples were found above the maximum test limits of acid number and copper corrosion and were found below in flash point test limit. Waste oil samples were highly contaminated and adulterated with mud and water. Although no such standard criteria or parameters are available for comparison but analysis results showed a bad reflection and due to which only few tests like copper strip corrosion, water content, sediments and flash point were performed to understand the characteristics of the market available waste oil product. These results showed that product is not environment friendly and the processing method needs to be improved. More research is needed to find out atmospheric pollution due to burning or use of reclaimed and waste oil on human health especially from occupation health and safety perspective...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 Malaria {{has been}} {{responsible}} for the deaths of thousands of people annually and is considered one of the biggest health challenges globally. In order to ensure that patients in malaria affected areas receive products of suitable quality, it is important that effective pharmacopoeial monographs for these medicines are available for distinguishing between good and inferior quality products, prior to distribution to the public. With artemether and lumefantrine forming part of the current, most effective treatment regimes against malaria, the development of monographs for the lumefantrine active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) (a monograph already exists for the artemether API) and for artemether/lumefantrine combination dosage forms, has become a high priority to the World Health Organization (WHO) for inclusion in the International Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Int.). During this study, both APIs were also evaluated for the possible occurrence of polymorphism, in order to provide manufacturers with additional information regarding identified polymorphic forms. During the polymorphic screening of artemether, the physico-chemical properties of the different recrystallisation products demonstrated results similar to those of the raw materials tested. Although the polymorphic screening of lumefantrine revealed no new polymorphic forms, it was found that the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns were influenced by preferred orientation and that the variation in melting points obtained, correlated well with differences observed in particle size and/or morphology. It therefore illustrated the importance for manufacturers of lumefantrine to consider the possibility of the melting point being influenced by crystal habit and particle size, and would it be advisable not to characterise and identify lumefantrine, based on the melting point alone. The physico-chemical analytical results obtained during the polymorphic screening of artemether and lumefantrine furthermore revealed that only one crystal packing for each API exists. Methods for the two new monographs were developed in accordance with WHO requirements and were validated compliant with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on the validation of methods. The methods developed for lumefantrine during this study, included the following: The chosen identification tests comprised a standalone infrared method, or as an alternative a combination of ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV-VIS) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) methods. The standard pharmacopoeial methods for heavy metals, <b>sulfated</b> <b>ash</b> (residue on ignition) and loss on drying were proposed. For the determination of the related substances (impurities from synthesis and degradation products), a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method and a newly developed TLC method were included, with the monograph allowing a choice. Furthermore, a titration with perchloric acid was decided upon for the assay of the lumefantrine API. An alternative UV spectrophotometric assay method (not included in the Ph. Int. monograph) was developed using a UV spectrophotometric method where the A 1 %/ 1 cm value in methanol was established as 331. 4. For the monographs of artemether/lumefantrine tablets and powder for oral suspension two identification tests were developed for use in combination, namely TLC and HPLC methods. A TLC limit test was developed for the related substances of artemether, which proved to be less stable than lumefantrine. The developed method made the simultaneous assaying of artemether and lumefantrine, using HPLC, possible. The proud outcome of this research project was the adoption of the final proposed monographs for the lumefantrine API and artemether/lumefantrine combination dosage forms, during the 42 nd meeting of the WHO’s Expert Committee on Specifications for Pharmaceutical Preparations (July 2008, Geneva), for inclusion in the Ph. Int. The methods for identification, assay and related substances of the artemether/lumefantrine tablets monograph were verified by an independent surveillance study, during which the results demonstrated that the methods were easily transferable between quality control (QC) laboratories. During this study, the proposed monograph was used to test 108 batches of artemether/lumefantrine tablets, sourced by the WHO. The generated results were able to identify batches of substandard quality and thus proved the monograph methods to be suitable for distinguishing between suitable or inferior quality, and even counterfeit batches. The conclusion that could be drawn from the outcomes of this study was that the use of the methods in these monographs during quality control testing, should indeed result in a reduction in substandard and/or counterfeit products being distributed to the public, thus in reducing the number of malaria related deaths and the escalating occurrence of resistance against antimalarial treatment regimes.
