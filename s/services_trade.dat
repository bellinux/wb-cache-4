In December 2015, average salaries available in Prague reached 35,853 CZK, an annual increase of 3.4%, which was nevertheless lower than national increase of 3.9% both in nominal and real terms. (Inflation in Prague was 0.5% in December, compared with 0.1% nationally.) Since 1990, the city's economic structure has shifted from industrial to service-oriented. Industry is present in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, printing, food processing, manufacture of transport equipment, computer technology and electrical engineering. In the service sector, financial and commercial <b>services,</b> <b>trade,</b> restaurants, hospitality and public administration are the most significant. Services account for around 80 percent of employment. There are 800,000 employees in Prague, including 120,000 commuters. The number of (legally registered) foreign residents in Prague has been increasing in spite of the country's economic downturn. As of March 2010, 148,035 foreign workers were reported to be living in the city making up about 18 percent of the workforce, up from 131,132 in 2008.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{comparative}} advantages and trade {{patterns in the}} evolution of the <b>service</b> <b>trade</b> in BRICS in terms of international market share, Lafay index, and other indicators, revealing a pattern of these five countries competing in various service areas. The results reveal that the scale of the <b>service</b> <b>trade</b> in the BRICS countries has continuously expanded. Except for individual cases, the trade structures of the five BRICS countries give priority to, and have comparative advantages in terms of, the general labor force and natural resource intensive sector, while having comparative disadvantages in terms of capital and a technically crowded modern service sectors. The results of Lafay index analysis further indicate that at its present stage, the BRICS <b>service</b> <b>trade</b> as a whole can be still characterized as mainly inter-industry, although a trend of intra-industry trade appears to be gradually emerging. This paper also proposes factors influencing BRICS' competitiveness in <b>trade</b> in <b>services</b> with Michael Porter's "diamond model" and then conducts a comparative analysis of the effect of these factors on the development of the five countries. According to the results, lack of advanced factors of production, underpowered domestic market demand, low market openness, and imbalanced goods and <b>services</b> <b>trades</b> synergies are the main causes of the weak competitiveness of the BRICS' <b>service</b> <b>trade.</b> Accordingly, possible solutions are provided, including enhancing the accumulation of advanced factors of production, expanding domestic market demand, improving market openness, and promoting good and <b>service</b> <b>trade</b> synergies. 通巻第 37...|$|R
