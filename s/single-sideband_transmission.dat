50|$|If {{part of one}} {{sideband}} and all of {{the other}} remain, it is called vestigial sideband, used mostly with television broadcasting, which would otherwise take up an unacceptable amount of bandwidth. Transmission in which only one sideband is transmitted is called <b>single-sideband</b> <b>transmission</b> or SSB. SSB is the predominant voice mode on shortwave radio other than shortwave broadcasting. Since the sidebands are mirror images, which sideband is used is a matter of convention.|$|E
40|$|A {{modulation}} system {{suggested by}} Logan and Schroeder (1962) is investigated, {{in which the}} modulated signal occupies only the bandwidth of the message, whereas the envelope contains the message in the intelligence band and any distortion outside the intelligence band. Distortionless detection is possible with a linear envelope detector followed by low-pass filtering. The function of the envelope and the spectrum of the signal are given for single-tone modulation and are compared with conventional <b>single-sideband</b> <b>transmission</b> with carrier. As there is no known closed form solution for the nonlinear convolution integral equations describing this modulation system, it is computer-simulated {{by means of an}} iteration method. The results yield information about important system parameters {{for the construction of a}} signal processor utilizing this method. The results of the simulation are verified by measurements...|$|E
2500|$|Using a {{receiver}} capable of demodulating <b>single-sideband</b> modulation, SSTV <b>transmissions</b> {{can be heard}} on the following frequencies: ...|$|R
50|$|These filter designs, which Zobel {{was later}} to improve upon, were of great {{economic}} value to AT&T. The ability to send multiple conversations {{over the same}} wires resulted in very substantial savings in cable installation costs. The modulation system used (<b>single-sideband</b> suppressed-carrier <b>transmission)</b> and the ITU standard remained the primary method of telephone service distribution until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.|$|R
50|$|Although four-, six-, {{and even}} a few rare eight-tube radios were produced, they were not common. The four-tube version with vacuum tube {{rectifier}} was of inferior performance, as they typically had no IF amplifier tube, although some four-tube designs with a selenium rectifier in place of the rectifier tube avoided this problem. The six-tube versions added either a RF amplifier tube, a push-pull audio power amplifier tube, or a beat frequency oscillator tube (to listen to Morse code or <b>single-sideband</b> modulation <b>transmissions).</b> However, these radios cost significantly more and sold in smaller quantities. The eight-tube versions cost even more, adding two or more of the features of the six-tube versions and sometimes an extra IF amplifier tube.|$|R
50|$|A signal at {{baseband}} {{is often}} used to modulate a higher frequency carrier signal in order that it may be transmitted via radio. Modulation results in shifting the signal up to much higher frequencies (radio frequencies, or RF) than it originally spanned. A key consequence of the usual double-sideband amplitude modulation (AM) is that the range of frequencies the signal spans (its spectral bandwidth) is doubled. Thus, the RF bandwidth of a signal (measured from the lowest frequency as opposed to 0 Hz) is twice its baseband bandwidth. Steps may be taken to reduce this effect, such as <b>single-sideband</b> modulation. Some <b>transmission</b> schemes such as frequency modulation use even more bandwidth.|$|R
25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (<b>single-sideband</b> suppressed-carrier <b>transmission)</b> or with both sidebands remaining (double sideband suppressed carrier). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of AM {{is that it}} is inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal. [...] The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.). [...] However its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using envelope detection, providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands. [...] In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the intermediate frequency) from a greatly reduced [...] "pilot" [...] carrier (in reduced-carrier transmission or DSB-RC) to use in the demodulation process. Even with the carrier totally eliminated in double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, carrier regeneration is possible using a Costas phase-locked loop. This doesn't work however for <b>single-sideband</b> suppressed-carrier <b>transmission</b> (SSB-SC), leading to the characteristic [...] "Donald Duck" [...] sound from such receivers when slightly detuned. Single sideband is nevertheless used widely in amateur radio and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in medium wave and short wave broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers. The broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience.|$|R
