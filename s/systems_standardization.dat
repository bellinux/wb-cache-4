40|$|Legacy {{systems have}} proven to be {{long-term}} integration challenges for Intermountain Health Care (IHC) despite commitment and attention to share clinical information across settings and among clinicians. This study measures the extent of the disparity of data elements across three independent data systems in current use. A sample of relevant data elements was selected across systems covering prenatal, labor and delivery, and newborn intensive care units (NICU). The findings revealed only 17 % of these sample data elements had compatible structure across all three systems. The implications from differences in granularity, missing data, and duplicate data entry, include diminished data quality, greater risk for medical error, increased costs of integration and inefficient use of clinician time. Retrospective guidelines for managing conceptual context and granularity are given to assist in designing an integrated longitudinal patient electronic medical record.
