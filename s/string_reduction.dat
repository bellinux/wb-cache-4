40|$|<b>String</b> {{rewriting}} <b>reductions</b> of the form, called loops, are {{the most}} frequent cause of infinite reductions (non- termination). Regarded {{as a model of}} computation, infinite reductions are unwanted whence their static detection is important. There are string rewriting systems which admit infinite reductions although they admit no loops. Their non-termination is particularly difficult to uncover. We present a few necessary conditions for the existence of loops, and thus establish a means to recognize the difficult case. We show in detail four relevant criteria: (i) the existence of loops is characterized by the existence of looping forward closures; (ii) dummy elimination, a non-termination preserving transformation method, also preserves the existence of loops; (iii) dummy introduction, a transformation method that supports subsequent dummy elimination, likewise preserves loops; (iv) bordered systems can be reduced to smaller systems on a larger alphabet, preserving the existence and the non-existence of loops. We illustrate the power of the four methods by giving a two-rule string rewriting system over a two-letter alphabet which admits an infinite reduction but no loop.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{alleviate}} the limitation of “state output probability conditional independence ” assumption held by Hidden Markov models (HMMs) in speech recognition, a discriminative semi-parametric trajectory model was proposed in recent years, in which both means and variances in the acoustic models are modeled as time-varying variables. The timevarying information is modeled as a weighted contribution ution from all the “centroids”, which {{can be viewed as}} the representation of the acoustic space. In previous literatures, ures, such centroids are often obtained by clustering the Gaussians ussians in the baseline acoustic models to some reasonablee number or by training a baseline model with fewer Gaussian ussian components. onen The centroids obtained in this way are maximum m likelihood estimation of the acoustic space, which are relatively weak in discriminability compared to the discriminatively trained acoustic models. In this paper, per, er, we proposed an imp improved semi-parametric mean trajectory ectory model training framework, in which the centroids are re first discriminatively trained by minimum phone error criterion erion to provide a more discriminative representation of the acoustic space.

This so-called heterotic M(atrix) string theory is defined by two-dimensional (8, 0) supersymmetric chiral gauge theory with gauge group SO(2 N) in the large N limit. We argue that at strong coupling fixed point the chiral gauge theory flows to a (8, 0) superconformal field theory defined via $S_N$ symmetric product space orbifold. We show that the leading order correction to the strong coupling expansion corresponds to a unique irrelevant operator of scaling dimension three and describes joining and splitting cubic interactions of light-cone heterotic string.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that information carried by the Magnocellular (M) pathway may be used in written word recognition and reading, although these findings are far from conclusive. The precise nature of this potential role of the M pathway in word recognition is also unclear, with some researchers suggesting that it is to convey word-level shape information whilst other researchers have indicated that the M pathway’s role may relate to attentional selection. Eight experiments are reported that used isoluminant stimuli to investigate the validity of these claims. Experiment 1 examined the use of Heterochromatic Flicker Photometry to create isoluminant stimuli and in particular, the effect of stimulus type on the luminance ratios obtained. Experiments 2 - 4 investigated the recognition of words, pseudowords and illegal nonwords under isoluminant and non-isoluminant conditions in a Reicher-Wheeler task. Experiment 5 was a further Reicher-Wheeler task experiment in which case type (lowercase, UPPERCASE, and MiXeDcAsE), stimulus type and target luminance were varied. The recognition of isoluminant and non-isoluminant letter and nonletter strings were compared in Experiments 6 and 7. Experiment 8 used a similar design to previous experiments to investigate whether the recognition of isolated letters might also use M pathway information. These experiments revealed that with lowercase words, accuracy in the Reicher-Wheeler task is reduced at isoluminance in comparison to perception under non-isoluminant conditions, indicating that M pathway information is used in the recognition of these stimuli. Furthermore, this reduction in accuracy at isoluminance was shown to extend to pseudowords and illegal nonwords, to words and nonwords presented in upper and mixed case, and to isolated letters. However, with nonletter <b>strings,</b> no <b>reduction</b> in accuracy at isoluminance was obtained in the Reicher-Wheeler task. The implications of these findings for the various theoretical explanations of the M pathway’s role in written word recognition are discussed.
