500|$|Kenneth {{revealing}} that {{his real name}} is [...] "Dick Whitman" [...] is {{a reference to the}} main character Don Draper of Mad Men (played by Jon Hamm, who had a recurring role on 30 Rock earlier in the season). [...] "Earn this", spoken by Kenneth as Jenna has poisoned him again, references the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan when actor Tom Hanks <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> words to actor Matt Damon's title character. When she is told that Kenneth has gone into a severe allergic shock and needs to have his hands cut off, Jenna apologizes to him for what she has done, telling him [...] "I'm just a girl sitting in front of a boy she poisoned so this other guy would go to town on her", which Jenna misquotes from actress Julia Roberts' character from the romantic comedy Notting Hill (1999). After Kenneth drinks his strawberry water, as he risked his life so that Jenna can meet the paramedic again, Jenna says to Kenneth [...] "You magnificent sonofabitch!", a line quoted by actor George C. Scott in the American biographical war film Patton (1970). Kenneth blows white smoke out while referencing bringing back something from [...] "the other side" [...] (death) echoes the same look when actor Haley Joel Osment remarked [...] "I see dead people" [...] in the movie The Sixth Sense (1999).|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking {{at him as if he}} were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent in such a way that it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", the Tenth Doctor {{says that}} as a Time Lord, he can see both fixed and mutable points in time. The Twelfth Doctor <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing here, but that there are [...] "grey areas", points in time for which he cannot see the outcome.|$|E

2500|$|... i. Two village theory - According to the Imperial {{gazetteer}} of United Province of Agra and Oudh -1909 {{there were}} two different villages Kulhua and paharia which later jointly became the town of Kulpahar; even the folklore <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> It doesn't have any supporting evidence for the theory; {{it seems that the}} British writer of the gazetteer went by the folklore.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy {{encourages}} him to sink {{under the}} water again and to show her how he did it. Charlie again refuses and turns the conversation to her. He tells {{her that she was}} a good wife. Nancy <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> about him, listing the many ways in which he was a good husband. When she is done, she is bitter because the [...] "good life" [...] they have had seems limited to her. Charlie is hurt by her attitude. They argue. Nancy is still angry that his only interest is to rest, while she wants to experience new things.|$|E
2500|$|In Germany, §76 AktG <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for the {{management}} board, while under §111 AktG the supervisory board's role is stated to be to [...] "oversee" [...] (überwachen). In the United Kingdom, the right to manage is not laid down in law, but is found in Part.2 of the Model Articles. This means it is a default rule, which companies can opt out of (s.20 CA 2006) by reserving powers to members, although companies rarely do. UK law specifically reserves shareholders right and duty to approve [...] "substantial non cash asset transactions" [...] (s.190 CA 2006), which means those over 10% of company value, {{with a minimum of}} £5,000 and a maximum of £100,000. Similar rules, though much less stringent, exist in §271 DGCL and through case law in Germany under the so-called Holzmüller-Doktrin.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, at Kalindi, {{the same}} American, David Cooper (J. Brandon Hill), {{who is the}} Kalindi {{chemical}} plant owner, commits suicide by hanging himself after {{writing on the wall}} of his room, [...] "Tum ashudh ho, andar sey sadh chuke ho" [...] (You are impure, you are rotten from inside), with his blood. The inspector investigating the suicide is severely affected by it. Back at his home, Prithvi makes another picture of Nandita getting mobbed. He runs to a fashion show where Nandita is performing, and witnesses her being possessed and attacking a spiritual guru attending the show. She then <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> lines, [...] "Tum ashudh Ho, andar sey sadh chuke ho", to the guru. Prithvi rushes to her rescue, but is prevented by the guards. Nandita is taken away from the guru and audience. The guru later appears on TV, claiming she had been possessed. Coming to know about everything, Yash has her publicly apologise to everyone, and declares that she has mental problems.|$|E

60|$|Our {{version of}} the Bible is to be loved and prized for this, as for a {{thousand}} other things,--that it has preserved a purity of meaning to many terms of natural objects.
