40|$|A {{user-friendly}} {{computer program}} called MultiDiFlux {{has been developed}} {{for the analysis of}} multicomponent diffusion. Such analysis includes the evaluation of interdiffusion fluxes directly from the concentration profiles of an n-component diffusion couple and the determination of all (n- 1) 2 interdiffusion coefficients. The interdiffusion coefficients are evaluated as average values over selected regions of the diffusion zone by the method of moments developed by Dayananda and Sohn. ^ The program was assessed by determining the interdiffusion coefficients from a ternary test diffusion couple with known interdiffusion coefficients; the evaluated coefficients agreed within 1 % of the known coefficients. The program was also used to analyze two sets of Cu-Ni-Zn single-phase diffusion couples annealed at 775 °C; one set with intersecting diffusion paths and the other with overlapping diffusion paths. For the intersecting couples, the interdiffusion coefficients calculated at the common composition of the intersection from each individual couple agreed with those determined by the Boltzmann-Matano analysis within 2 - 39 %. For the couples with overlapping diffusion paths, interdiffusion coefficients calculated for each couple over the overlapping path segments agreed within 0 - 30 %. ^ New expressions relating the concentration profiles, interdiffusion fluxes, and interdiffusion coefficients have been developed. The expressions were applied to one two-phase and several <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> Cu-Ni-Zn diffusion <b>couples</b> annealed at 775 °C as well as one <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> Fe-Ni-Al <b>couple</b> annealed at 1000 °C. Such applications showed that the ratio of the flux gradient to the concentration gradient of each component plotted against distance yielded overlapping straight lines with identical slopes. Effective interdiffusion coefficients for the individual components were also calculated at selected locations within the diffusion zones of the various diffusion couples. ^ Additional expressions have also been developed to relate slopes of the diffusion path and ternary interdiffusion coefficients at selected locations. These expressions were used with calculated average ternary interdiffusion coefficients to estimate the diffusion path slopes at selected sections of the <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> Cu-Ni-Zn diffusion <b>couples.</b> The estimated diffusion path slopes were comparable to those determined from the concentration profiles. A preliminary method to predict the diffusion path of a ternary diffusion couple from ternary interdiffusion coefficients as functions of composition is also presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Magnetoelectric (ME) {{coupling}} in materials offer tremendous advantages in device functionality enabling technologies including advanced electronic memory, combining electronic speed, and efficiency with magnetic robustness. However, low cost polycrystalline ME materials {{are excluded from}} most commercial applications, operating only at cryogenic temperatures, impractically large electric/magnetic fields, or with low ME coefficients (1 - 100 mV/cm[*]Oe). Despite this, the technological potential of single compound ME coupling has continued to drive research into multiferroics {{over the last two}} decades. Here we show that by manipulating the large induced atomic strain within the polycrystalline, room temperature multiferroic compound 0. 7 BiFeO 3 – 0. 3 PbTiO 3, we can induce a reversible, piezoelectric strain controlled ME effect. Employing an in situ neutron diffraction experiment, we have demonstrated that this piezomagnetoelectric effect manifests with an applied electric field > 8 kV/mm at the onset of piezoelectric strain, engineered in to the compound by crystallographic phase mixing. This produces a remarkable intrinsic ME coefficient of 1276 mV/cm[*]Oe, due to a strain driven modification to the oxygen sub-lattice, inducing an increase in magnetic moment per Fe 3 + ion of + 0. 142 μB. This work provides a framework for investigations into strain engineered nanostructures to realize low-cost ME devices designed from the atoms up, as well as contributing to the deeper understanding of <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> ME <b>coupling</b> mechanisms...|$|R

30|$|It {{has been}} shown in our {{previous}} articles [6, 7, 10, 11] that sophisticated bispectrum-based signal processing permits the extraction and use for radar target recognition of the discrimination and classification of <b>phase</b> <b>coupled</b> harmonics in raw radar backscattering contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and vegetation clutter. The distinctive benefits of the bispectrum-based radar signature compared to a common energy-based spectrogram can be characterized as follows. First, the possibility of retrieving the <b>phase</b> <b>coupled</b> contribution which common energy-based techniques are simply unable to provide. Second, the bispectrum tends to zero for a stationary zero-mean AWGN, which means that there are no <b>phase</b> <b>coupled</b> frequencies in a linear Gaussian process. Therefore, bispectrum-based signal processing provides suppression of the AWGN contribution in the TF radar signature. As a result, the powerful, i.e., the <b>phase</b> <b>coupled</b> contributions unambiguously belonging to a moving target are emphasized, and the weak, i.e., the phase independent spectral contributions belonging to vegetation clutter and AWGN, are diminished. Therefore, the bispectrum-based approach allows improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in collected radar signatures and, hence, provides robustness in its discriminative features.|$|R

40|$|To {{enable the}} {{complete}} optimization of a geothermal system requires fully-coupled models {{that include the}} reservoir, the wellbore, and the surface plant. In order to find a true global optimum for the operation of a geothermal system over its lifetime requires that one {{should be able to}} integrate the subsurface and the surface, including operating parameters and the subsequent capital cost as well as operating costs. Integrating these simulations together could allow for a reduction in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) or direct-use heat (LCOH) as well as decreased simulation time due to the implicit coupling of the three major components of a geothermal system. This paper presents a combined model to simulate flow in reservoir {{as well as in the}} wellbore and evaluates the LCOE and LCOH from Enhanced Geothermal Systems. The components of this combined model includes two dimensional unsteady state <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> wellbore simulator <b>coupled</b> with the reservoir simulator TOUGH 2 -EGS (Xiong et al., 2013) plus a surface plant model.

The output parameters at the production well head are then taken as an input in to surface model which provides an estimate of the LCOE or LCOH.
