The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the perceptions of agricultural college students in Mexico toward agricultural soil and its conservation in their country. The study also determined relationships between selected characteristics of future agriculturists of Mexico and their perceptions of agricultural soil resources and soil conservation. The study was conducted during Spring, 1995. Study subjects consisted of agricultural college students from two universities in Mexico: Universidad de Chapingo and Universidad Autonoma Agraria "Antonio Narro. " Professors at the universities distributed a Spanish translation of the questionnaire concerning soils in Mexico. The data were analyzed statistically to determine sample characteristics, to evaluate perceptions regarding agricultural soil and its conservation in Mexico, and to determine relationships between these perceptions and selected student characteristics. 1. Most respondents were 22 years old or older and male. 2. Students perceived natural and human causes as somewhat major causes of agricultural soil degradation in Mexico, with human causes being more of a cause than natural causes. 3. Students felt that soil conservation efforts are needed; these efforts should be the responsibility of agriculturists, in conjunction with government's involvement. 4. Students believed that education, government <b>subsidies,</b> <b>laws,</b> and regulations would encourage agriculturists to conserve soil. 5. No significant relationships existed between the following student characteristics and students' perceptions and opinions concerning causes of soil degradation, soil conservation, and governmental responsibility for soil conservation: age, gender, size of town where respondent grew up, involvement of respondent's family in agriculture, respondents whose parents own agricultural land, years worked on a farm or ranch, semesters of college, number of soils or soils-related courses completed in college, whether respondent had or had not studied agriculture before college, and respondent's career or occupational plans. 6. A relationship existed between agricultural employment and perception of natural causes of soil degradation. Students not currently working on a farm or ranch were more likely to perceive natural causes to be greater causes of agricultural soil degradation in Mexico than were students currently working on a farm or ranch...|$|E

The financing of Airbus's upfront investment expenditures came in a significant proportion from public funds, which violated, in the US's opinion the SCM Agreement. While the Appellate Body follows this view of things to a large extent, it does so in a measured way: the category of per se illegal export subsidies is interpreted {{with a view to}} the manipulation of normal market conditions; the distortion on competitive conditions matters, not the increase of exports as such. Other aspects of <b>subsidies</b> <b>law</b> clarified are the relationship between effect and subsidy. They are closely related but not identical; rightly, the report operates from the premise that the SCM Agreement's regime focuses on the effect, and not on the subsidy as such, which is a manifestation of a political choice by a sovereign Member state. The Appellate Body affirms that a subsidy has a ‘life', a shorthand for a beginning and an end: it follows that the effect of a subsidy is not bound to be permanent but is bound to terminate. It is to be regretted that the Appellate Body avoided clarifying to what extent partial privatization, hence sale of assets at market prices to private investors, ‘extinguish' subsidie...|$|R

The European Court of Auditors for instance refuses year after year to provide an unqualified audit opinion as regards the legitimacy of the subsidies spent by the Member States. Mistakes are discovered in such large numbers that the European Court of Auditors does not dare to warrant the legitimacy of these subsidies financed from the EU budget. Also in the Netherlands problems occur in the implementation of the European subsidy schemes. More than once the European Commission has recovered money already paid to the Netherlands.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{that the}} question of policy space with respect to public support to electricity cannot be answered by clinically isolating legal rules from their factual background – constituted of technological innovations, market developments and the broader political economy. Various stylized scenarios in the green economy are briefly assessed to determine the impact subsidy rules may have. A more general assessment of the SCM Agreement leads to the conclusion that WTO <b>subsidy</b> <b>laws</b> are uncertain and - inasmuch as they may not be fully in line with best green policy prescriptions - unsound. In the face of a prospect of more frictions and litigation, legal security must be positively reinstated. The case-law may contribute to clarify some issues but the more fundamental decisions determining what is, and what is not, legitimate are beyond its purview and competence. For this reason, the recent Appellate Body decision in the Canada – Renewable Energy/ FIT disputes, with its construction of the benefit analysis, is essentially wrong. The paper concludes by arguing that the only real option for a clear and legitimate recognition of green policy space resides with law reform. In this regard, acknowledging that reform is not only an outcome but first of all a process preparing for a negotiated outcome, various suggestions for the way forward are outlined...|$|R

40|$|The US Farm Bill of 2002 is {{the latest}} in a 7 -decade history of farm <b>subsidy</b> <b>laws</b> that {{transfer}} funds to farmers and regulate and subsidize production of selected commodities. Fruit, tree nut, ornamental and vegetable crops, hay and meats remain outside scope of main subsidy programs. The new law continues many innovations of the 1996 Act, such as removal of authority for annual land idling and crop price floors accompanied by government stockholding. Government payments remain the primary focus of commodity programs. The total amount of these payments are likely to remain similar to the amount paid in the period 1999 – 2001, but with some changes in the form of the programs. For example, allowing owners to update acreage and yield payment bases creates additional incentives for farmers to link current planting decisions to anticipated farm subsidies. Similarly, the new program that ties “counter-cyclical” payments to the price of a specific crop also has production stimulus. A new program, estimated to add about 5 – 10 per cent to marginal milk revenue for smaller farms, makes ‘deficiency’ payments to dairy farms when milk prices are low. Despite the new programs with added links to stimulating production, new USA programs stimulate production only marginally more than the subsidies of the 1999 – 2001 period, which were replaced. Furthermore, the USA has flexibility to avoid explicitly violating its WTO commitments. Nonetheless, this US Farm Bill of 2002 has curtailed the previous trends toward lower farm subsidies and smaller production stimuli, and the negative publicity surrounding it has made negotiating reductions of farm trade distortions more difficult.

At the first step using econometric approach, economic value of irrigation water in different agriculture crops is determined that shows demand side price for water. Then, supply cost of surface and ground water is calculated using accounting approach which shows supply side price for irrigation water. Finally, economic value and supply cost of irrigation water compared and different water pricing methods is evaluated. Results indicated that, weighted average of economic value and supply costs of irrigation water in Golestan province were 1795 and 1399 IRR per cubic meter, respectively.

40|$|Recognition {{over the}} past century of the {{benefits}} provided by land and landscapes has seen a net shift in balance from the private interests of landowners towards broader beneficiaries across society, with post-apartheid constitutional and legislative change in South Africa providing a striking illustration of this transition. Planning and conservation <b>laws,</b> <b>subsidies</b> and the development of common law in the UK and the EU also provide evidence of the societal transition, but also of the conceptual shortfall in what precisely constitutes socially beneficial uses of land. A pragmatic,transparent yet robust framework is required to guide more equitable and sustainable decision-making in statute and common <b>law,</b> <b>subsidy</b> system and public policy. Such a model of the relative private and public benefits derived from different land uses is developed using a risk-based approach founded on ecosystem-services, validated using analysis of real land use practices. The model proved to be a helpful basis for orienting different types of land use against a grid of private and public benefits, serving as a semi-quantitative decision-support tool providing a comprehensive and transparent basis for discussion, stakeholder dialogue and the innovation of optimally beneficial uses of land. It also helped to deliver greater public benefit, promoting participative decision-making and the testing of options through a simple graphical interface. Development of this model is informed by, and in turn has informed, consideration of environmental and human development practices in South Africa, but it may also help inform better integrated solutions for priority environmental management challenges such as the EU Water Framework Directive oppotunities for 'paying for ecosystem services' markets and improved targeting of subsidies under the EU Common Agricultural Policy...|$|R

A look into the present procedures and control mechanisms of policies concerning scholarships and grants-in-aid (GIAs) is an imperative measure when seeking to reform the delivery of higher education in the country. This can shed light on the reasons why the administration of a public good is efficient or inefficient. Though, the funds for these scholarship programs and grants are expended in the spirit of charity and altruism for the poor and deserving, they are nonetheless from the government and thus, from the taxpayers' pockets. This makes scholarship funds and other subsidies no different from ordinary government procurement that should be expended in a transparent, accountable, and cost-efficient manner ensuring that every centavo is going where it should. Undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate scholarships and GIAs implemented by national government agencies are generally guided by policies and guidelines for the administration and monitoring of the said <b>subsidies</b> through <b>laws,</b> implementing rules and regulations, and department issuances.

40|$|The worrisome rise in {{the number}} of trade {{disputes}} relating to climate change policies leaves no doubt as to the relevance of WTO law to climate change policies. Perhaps the most contentious aspect of the relationship between trade law and climate change policies is the issue of subsidies — while many climate change policies rely heavily on the use of <b>subsidies,</b> WTO <b>law</b> considers <b>subsidies</b> a distortive force and aspires to limit the use of such measures. This article evaluates the compatibility of several climate change programs in light of the WTO <b>law</b> on <b>subsidies.</b> It argues that the current legal framework is unsuitable for the promotion of climate change abatement objectives.
