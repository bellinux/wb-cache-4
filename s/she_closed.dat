5|$|According to a People {{magazine}} {{profile of}} McKenzie written in January 1953, McKenzie received an unceremonious notice from {{the owners of}} 10 Clarence Street to quit the premises. The Sands Directory indicates that she moved her operation briefly to No 6 Wharf at Circular Quay in 1953, before retiring to her home at Greenwich Point in 1954. McKenzie wrote that <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> the school when the airlines established their own school and the government added a signals training section to the Navigation School at the Technical College. She continued to help the occasional pupil with special difficulties at her home.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Conrad {{began dating}} actor Kyle Howard. Howard {{expressed}} concern that appearing on reality television would interfere with his acting career; consequently, their relationship was not documented on The Hills. (After three years together, Conrad and Howard ended their relationship in 2011.) Upon {{the conclusion of the}} fourth season of the series that December, Conrad wished to leave the series to pursue other career opportunities. However, per the producers' requests, she filmed ten episodes for the following season, in which <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> her storylines. Conrad made her final appearance on the series in May 2009, attending Montag and Pratt's wedding after much deliberation during the mid-season finale of the fifth season. However, in the July 2009 issue of Cosmopolitan, she stated that producers had pressured her into a reconciliation with Montag throughout the season, adding that she was displeased when they would not allow otherwise. Conrad was replaced by former Laguna Beach castmate Kristin Cavallari until the series' conclusion in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|She {{was part}} of a {{flotilla}} which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Zhiyuans sole action was at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894 during the First Sino-Japanese War. During the battle, she came under heavy fire from the Japanese forces. Having been holed, Deng ordered for the ship to ram an opposing vessel. She was destroyed as <b>she</b> <b>closed,</b> either by a hit on one of her torpedo tubes, or from a Japanese torpedo. This attack, and the subsequent story of her captain and his dog have become embedded in popular culture in the People's Republic of China. A replica of the Zhiyuan was constructed in 2014 at the Port of Dandong, while the wreck was discovered in 2013 after a 16-year search.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of owner Charles van Raalte in 1907, his wife Florence stayed on Brownsea until 1925. Mary Bonham-Christie bought the island at an auction in 1927. In 1932, Bonham-Christie allowed 500 Scouts to camp there to {{celebrate}} the Silver Jubilee of Scouting, but shortly afterwards <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> the island {{to the public and}} it became very overgrown. In 1934, some Sea Scouts were camping on the island when a fire broke out. Mrs. Bonham-Christie blamed the Sea Scouts, although the fire did not start where the Sea Scouts were camping. The fire engulfed most of the island, burning west to east. The eastern buildings were only saved by a subsequent change in wind direction. Although it was not known how the fire started, Scouts were not allowed to camp on the island again until after Bonham-Christie's death in 1961. Her family becoming liable for inheritance tax on her estate, they put the island up for sale. Interested citizens who feared that the island would be bought by developers helped raise an endowment, and in 1962 the government allowed the National Trust to take over management of the island in lieu of the death duties.|$|E

25|$|At 05:30 on 26 January, Tunny sighted masts and a stack {{over the}} horizon {{indicating}} a possible target. During the day, she lessened the distance between herself and her quarry; and, near dusk, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> a 400-ton trawler. Finding the prey not worth a torpedo, the submarine surfaced and opened fire with her deck gun. Soon, darkness forced her to discontinue the attack, and she continued on her way.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Campbell {{covered the}} May issue of Vogue Australia, the September issue of Vogue Japan, and the November issue of Vogue Turkey; {{the latter two}} were special editions celebrating Campbell and fellow supermodels.

25|$|Then, at the Roland Garros Junior Championships, {{she entered}} the main draw as the 9th seed. In the first round, she {{defeated}} Charlotte Rodier, then Karen Barbat from Denmark, and in the 3rd round Halep won against 5th seed Jessica Moore, in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, she beat 13th seed Ksenia Lykina, and in the semifinals, Halep defeated second seed Arantxa Rus. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> things by winning the all–Romanian final in three sets against 10th seed Elena Bogdan.|$|E

25|$|Chaumareys {{had decided}} to involve one of the passengers, Richefort, in the {{navigation}} of the frigate. Richefort was a philosopher {{and a member of}} the Philanthropic Society of Cape Verde, but had no qualification to guide ships. As <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> on the coast of Africa, the course of Méduse became dangerous. Richefort apparently mistook a large cloud bank on the horizon for Cape Blanco on the African coast, and so underestimated the proximity of the Bank of Arguin off the coast of Mauritania.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{she decided}} to end her long and {{impressive}} career. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> it in style: {{at the world championships}} of 2005 in Montreal she won the bronze in the 5 kilometers, and gold on both the 10 and 25 kilometers, thereby annoying her everlasting rival from Germany with whom she fought a number of duels, Britta Kamrau. The last race of Holland's most praised marathon swimmer was in December 2005 at the Dutch Short Course Championships (25 meter pool) in Amsterdam.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June, the {{submarine}} {{was searching for}} Japanese shipping off Sagami Nada when she sighted two columns of smoke. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> the range toward a firing position, made out two cargo ships, and fired a spread of three torpedoes at each target. Hit in her stern, the lead ship, Noborikawa Maru, sank immediately. The second ship saw the torpedo wakes, turned and passed between them. Trigger then fired a torpedo at the oncoming ship; if the torpedo reached the target, it failed to explode.|$|E

25|$|The {{first came}} in 1942, when she {{improved}} the world mark in the 80m hurdles. The following year, she did even better. First, she improved the high jump record by an unequalled 5cm from 1.66m to 1.71m in a specially arranged competition in Amsterdam on 30 May. Then, she tied the 100m world record, but this was never recognised officially, as she competed against men when setting the record. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> out {{the season with a}} new world record in the long jump, 6.25m on 19 September 1943. The latter record would last until 1954.|$|E
25|$|At the Women's Corporate Team Ekiden Championships in 2004, she ran for Shiseido and {{the team}} {{finished}} third overall. She set the stage two record at the 2005 Yokohama International Ekiden, running the 10km stretch in 31:25, and took the team gold with Japan. She ran for Japan in the International Chiba Ekiden in 2006, helping her team to third place. She also began competing abroad and {{took part in the}} Carlsbad 5000 and finished in sixth place. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> the year with a fourth-place finish at the Sanyo Half Marathon.|$|E
25|$|Born in Chambéry, France, she {{initially}} {{focused on}} the 3000 metres and won the French under-23 title {{at the age of}} nineteen and broke the French under-23 record in 1982. Sergent went on to win her first national title over that distance in 1983. She won a 1500/3000m double at the French Athletics Championships the year after and was selected to represent France at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. On her first senior international outing, she was eliminated {{in the first round of}} the 3000m, coming seventh in her heat. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> the year with a win at the Cross du Figaro in Paris.|$|E

The ringing leads her to the trunk, which she slowly opens, dreading what that she will find. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> the trunk door after being horrified at the contents, then uses her car to ram the tow truck off the cliff.

25|$|In the 2009 season, {{she won the}} Troféu Brasil Caixa de Atletismo with a season's best of 6.79m, {{putting an}} end to rival Maurren Maggi's decade-long {{dominance}} of the championships. She became the continental long jump champion for a second time at the 2009 South American Championships in Athletics. The long jump at the 2009 Lusophony Games was a head-to-head with Portugal's Naide Gomes and Costa took the silver medal, three centimetres back with a mark of 6.71m. Her focus turned to the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, but she failed to record a mark in her three attempts in the long jump final. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> the season with a seventh-place finish at the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.|$|E
25|$|In many ways, the Orthodox Church fared {{no better}} than its foreign {{counterparts}} {{during the reign of}} Catherine. Under her leadership, she completed what Peter III had started: the church's lands were expropriated, and the budget of both monasteries and bishoprics were controlled by the College of Economy. Endowments from the government replaced income from privately held lands. The endowments were often much less than the original intended amount. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> 569 of 954 monasteries and only 161 got government money. Only 400,000 rubles of church wealth were paid back. While other religions (such as Islam) received invitations to the Legislative Commission, the Orthodox clergy did not receive a single seat. Their place in government was restricted severely during the years of Catherine's reign.|$|E
25|$|A sixth place {{finish at}} the Kenyan Cross Country Championships {{put her in}} the frame for the {{national}} team at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, but the selectors opted for Pauline Korikwiang instead, who was in good form that season but performed poorly at the event. Chepkorir ran extensively on the roads that year, with highlights including a 10K win in Brescia, a defence of her Ribarroja title, a personal best time of 69:56 minutes for third at the Prague Half Marathon, a win at the Udine Half Marathon, and a third place at the Porto Half Marathon. She was also the 5000m runner-up at the Kenyan nationals that year. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> the year with a win at the Corrida Internacional de São Silvestre 15K.|$|E
