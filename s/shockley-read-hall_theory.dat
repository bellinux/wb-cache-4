40|$|The {{classical}} <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory</b> of {{free carrier}} recombination and generation via traps is extended to degenerate semiconductors. A concise and simple expression is found which avoids completely {{the concept of}} a Fermi level, a concept which is alien to nonequilibrium situations. Assumptions made in deriving the recombination generation current are carefully delineated and are found to be basically identical to those made in the original theory applicable to nondegenerate semiconductors...|$|E
40|$|First-principles {{study of}} BO 2 complex in B-doped Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si) reveals a novel, self-trapping-enhanced carrier {{recombination}} mechanism, in sharp contrasts {{to the standard}} fixed-level <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory</b> for carrier recombination. We found that an O 2 dimer, distant from any B, would cause only weak carrier recombination under illumination [...] only enough to drive its diffusion to find B and form the BO 2 complexes. Surprisingly, BO 2 and O 2 produce nearly identical defect gap states. Despite this, recombination at BO 2 is substantially faster than that at O 2, because the charge state of the latter inhibits hole capture, the key step for such recombination...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} devoted to the {{identification}} of the metallic impurities in silicon wafers by using Temperature Dependent Lifetime Spectroscopy (TDLS). We consider the variation of all recombination mechanisms, intrinsic and extrinsic, to follow the variation of lifetime with the temperature. The extrinsic recombination mechanism is based on the standard <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory</b> (SRH) [1], [2] and we simulated the variation of SRH lifetime for two impurities: gold and iron. The simulation results show that their SRH lifetime variations with the temperature are opposite and that the presence of a peak is characteristic of the impurity studied. Experimental measurements are displayed showing the identification of gold impurity by means of Phase-Shift TDLS (PS-TDLS) measurement. Thanks to these results, we demonstrate that PS-TDLS is an efficient method to identify gold and iron impurities at concentrations as low as 1. 1010 cm- 3 for a doping level of 1. 1015 cm- 3...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new way}} how to calculate the currents in a Schottky barrier. The novel phenomeno-logical model extends the <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> recombi-nation-generation <b>theory</b> of trap-assisted tunneling. The proposed approach explains the occurrence of large leakage currents in Schottky structures on wide band semi-conductors with a high Schottky barrier (above 1 eV) and with a high density of traps. Under certain conditions, trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) plays a more important role than direct tunneling...|$|R
40|$|Deep level {{transient}} spectroscopy and the <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> recombination <b>theory</b> {{are used}} to identify the defect responsible for reverse annealing in 2 ohm-cm n+/p silicon solar cells. This defect, with energy level at Ev + 0. 30 eV, has been tentatively identified as a boron-oxygen-vacancy complex. It has been also determined by calculation that the removal of this defect could result in significant annealing at temperatures as low as 200 C for 2 ohm-cm and lower resistivity cells...|$|R
40|$|When a {{semiconductor}} {{sample is}} irradiated {{by means of}} an external source, emitting photons or electrons, excess carriers are produced which distribute themselves throughout the sample. One of the parameters which determine the distribution of the carriers is the surface recombination velocity. The present investigation is concerned with the recombination lifetime tau. The predominant mechanism for recombination in wide band-gap semiconductors is described by the <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> (SRH) <b>theory.</b> The transport equations are derived for free carriers and the radiation field. The considered theory is applied to a semiinfinite, one-dimensional semiconductor slab irradiated by light of a given frequency. Some numerical considerations based on n-type GaAs are presented. Attention is given to a determination of the radiation transmitted through the surface of the sample...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of microelectronics in a radiation environment {{is an important}} concern for defense and space applications. Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), in particular, are susceptible to neutron radiation. Neutron radiation affects BJT performance primarily by creating lattice defects, which can dramatically increase carrier recombination rate. In turn, the increase in recombination rate degrades the current gain. Two approaches were taken {{in the development of}} a compact BJT model that include the effects of static neutron damage. One approach is based on the Gummel-Poon term for recombination current. The other approach is based on the <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory</b> of recombination. Simulation results of the BJT neutron-effects model compare favorably with measured data of BJT test structures. Application of the neutron-effects BJT model in a voltage reference circuit provides critical information for circuit design in a neutron environment.

40|$|The {{barrier height}} and the {{recombination}} velocity at {{the interface between}} a metallic precipitate and a semiconductor matrix are investigated with a new self consistent procedure based both on {{the analysis of the}} recombination and emission balance rates for electrons and holes and on the determination of the size-dependent electronic structure of the embedded precipitate. In the present work, the precipitate is modeled within the spherical well potential framework. The main result is the dependence of the recombination features on the electronic structure of the metal precipitate unlike the models based only on the <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory.</b> The behaviors of the surface charge density on the metallic precipitate and the barrier height versus the precipitate size are similar to our previous studies. Unlike previous works, the recombination velocity reaches a constant non-zero value for sizes smaller than a critical size which is dependent on the defect concentration at the interface. The new dependencies of the recombination parameters are illustrated by the calculation of the electron beam induced current (EBIC) contrast at the interface...|$|E
40|$|Photo-Hall effect {{spectroscopy}} {{was used}} in the study of deep levels in high resistive CdZnTe. The monochromator excitation in the photon energy range 0. 65 - 1. 77 eV was complemented by a laser diode high-intensity excitation at selected photon energies. A single sample characterized by multiple unusual features like negative differential photoconductivity and anomalous depression of electron mobility was chosen for the detailed study involving measurements at both the steady and dynamic regimes. We revealed that the Hall mobility and photoconductivity can be both enhanced and suppressed by an additional illumination at certain photon energies. The anomalous mobility decrease was explained by an excitation of the inhomogeneously distributed deep level at the energy Ev+ 1. 0 eV enhancing thus potential non-uniformities. The appearance of negative differential photoconductivity was interpreted by an intensified electron occupancy of that level by a direct valence band-to-level excitation. Modified <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory</b> was used for fitting experimental results by a model comprising five deep levels. Properties of the deep levels and their impact on the device performance were deduced.

40|$|The defect {{responsible}} for reverse annealing in 2 ohm/cm n(+) /p silicon solar cells was identified. This defect, with energy level at e sub v + 0. 30 eV was tentatively {{identified as a}} boron oxygen-vacancy complex. Results indicate that its removal could result in significant annealing for 2 ohm/cm and lower resistivity cells at temperatures as low as 200 C. These results were obtained by use of an expression derived from the <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> recombination <b>theory</b> which relates measured diffusion length ratios to relative defect concentrations and electron capture cross sections. The relative defect concentrations {{and one of the}} required capture cross sections are obtained from Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy. Four additional capture cross sections are obtained using diffusion length data and data from temperature dependent lifetime studied. These calculated results are in reasonable agreement with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the optoelectronic properties of novel solar cell architectures, such as the amorphous-crystalline interface in silicon heterojunction devices, we calculate and analyze the local microscopic structure at this interface and in bulk a-Si:H, in particular {{with respect to the}} impact of material inhomogeneities. The microscopic information is used to extract macroscopic material properties, and to identify localized defect states, which govern the recombination properties encoded in quantities such as capture cross sections used in the <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory.</b> To this end, atomic configurations for a-Si:H and a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces are generated using molecular dynamics. Density functional theory calculations are then applied to these configurations in order to obtain the electronic wave functions. These are analyzed and characterized with respect to their localization and their contribution to the (local) density of states. GW calculations are performed for the a-Si:H configuration in order to obtain a quasi-particle corrected absorption spectrum. The results suggest that the quasi-particle corrections can be approximated through a scissors shift of the Kohn-Sham energies.

40|$|The VIS {{instrument}} {{on board}} the Euclid mission is a weak-lensing experiment that depends on very precise shape measurements of distant galaxies obtained by a large CCD array. Due to the harsh radiative environment outside the Earth's atmosphere, it is anticipated that the CCDs over the mission lifetime will be degraded to an extent that these measurements will only be possible through the correction of radiation damage effects. We have therefore created a Monte Carlo model that simulates the physical processes taking place when transferring signal through a radiation-damaged CCD. The software is based on <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory,</b> and is made to mimic the physical properties in the CCD as closely as possible. The code runs on a single electrode level and takes three dimensional trap position, potential structure of the pixel, and multi-level clocking into account. A key element of the model is that it also takes device specific simulations of electron density as a direct input, thereby avoiding to make any analytical assumptions about the size and density of the charge cloud. This paper illustrates how test data and simulated data can be compared {{in order to further}} our understanding of the positions and properties of the individual radiation-induced traps.

40|$|As {{electrons}} {{are transferred}} through a radiation damaged Charge Coupled Device (CCD), they may encounter traps in the silicon {{in which they}} will be captured and subsequently released. This capture and release of electrons {{can lead to a}} 'smearing' of the image. The dynamics of the trapping process can be described through the use of <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory,</b> in which exponential time constants are used to determine the probability of capture and release. If subjected to a hostile radiation environment, such as in space where the dominant charged particle is the proton, these incident protons can cause displacement damage within the CCD and lead to the formation of stable trap sites. As the trap density increases, the trapping and release of signal electrons can {{have a major impact on}} the Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) to the detriment of device performance. As the science goals for missions become ever more demanding, such as those for the ESA Euclid and Gaia missions, the problem of radiation damage must be overcome. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the trapping process and the impact on device performance, a Monte Carlo simulation has been developed to model the transfer of charge in a radiation damaged CCD. This study investigates the various difficulties encountered when developing such a model: the incorporation of appropriate clocking mechanisms, the use of suitable trap parameters and their degeneracy, and the development of methods to model the charge storage geometry within a pixel through the use of three-dimensional Silvaco simulations...|$|E
40|$|The silicon divacancy {{is one of}} {{the main}} defects of concern in {{radiation}} damage studies of Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) and, being immobile at room temperature, the defect is accessible to a variety of characterisation techniques. As such, there is a large amount of (often conflicting) information in the literature regarding this defect. Here we study the donor level of the divacancy, one of three energy levels which lie between the silicon valence and conduction bands. The donor level of the divacancy acts as a trap for holes in silicon and therefore can be studied through the use of a p-channel CCD. The method of trap-pumping, linked closely to the process of pocket-pumping, has been demonstrated in the literature over the last two years to allow for in-situ analysis of defects in the silicon of CCDs. However, most work so far has been a demonstartion [sic] of the techinique [sic]. We begin here to use the technique for detailed studies of a specific defect centre in silicon, the donor level of the divacancy. The trap density post-irradiation can be found, and each instance of the trap identified independently of all others. Through the study of the trap response at different clocking frequencies one can measure directly the defect emission time constant, and through tracking this at different temperatures, it is possible to use <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory</b> to calculate the trap energy level and cross-section. A large population of traps, all with parameters consistent with the donor level of the divacancy, has been studied, leading to a measure of the distribution of properties. The emission time constant, energy level and cross-section are found to have relatively large spreads, significantly beyond the small uncertainty in the measurement technique. This spread has major implications on the correction of charge transfer inefficiency effects in space applications in which high precision is required...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiation}} damage {{effects from the}} harsh radiative environment outside the Earth's atmosphere can be {{a cause for concern}} for most space missions. With the science goals becoming ever more demanding, the requirements on the precision of the instruments on board these missions also increases, and it is therefore important to investigate how the radiation induced damage affects the Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) that most of these instruments rely on. The primary goal of the Euclid mission is to study the nature of dark matter and dark energy using weak lensing and baryonic acoustic oscillation techniques. The weak lensing technique depends on very precise shape measurements of distant galaxies obtained by a large CCD array. It is anticipated that over the 6 year nominal lifetime of mission, the CCDs will be degraded to an extent that these measurements will not be possible unless the {{radiation damage}} effects are corrected.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{study has been}} performed on the stability of GaAs surfaces in a 0. 10 M K 2 Se- 0. 01 M K 2 Se 2 aqueous solution. In this electrolyte, n-type GaAs electrodes displayed significant photocorrosion in competition with faradaic charge transfer to Se 2 -. Chemisorption of group VIIIB metal ions onto the GaAs surfaces yielded improved current-voltage behavior of the GaAs photoanodes, and also resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} photocorrosion. This behavior implies that the chemisorbed metal ions act to increase the rate of hole transfer to the Se 2 - species. Related experiments on n-GaAs, pGaAs, and Sn-doped In 2 O 3 electrodes in Te 2 -/- aqueous solutions have also been performed. The majority carrier (electrons) transfer rate constant at a highly doped n + -Si/Co(Cp) 2 Cl-methanol junction has been measured directly using the chronoamperometry electrochemical technique. The reduction reaction rate of Co(Cp) 2 + was 0. 03 cm-s - 1 at the Si electrode, and was more than 100 times slower than at a hanging mercury electrode. The slower rate was attributed to the smaller optical and static dielectric constants, and the lower density of electrons of the semiconductor. The experimental results were compared to the Marcus theory of charge transfer. The unique properties of high purity Si/liquid junctions have been investigated under illumination conditions in which the photogenerated carrier concentration exceeds the dopant concentration. Under these high injection conditions, negligible electric fields exist at the semiconductor/liquid interface, and carrier motion is driven by diffusion. Studies of the current-voltage properties of the Si in methanol solutions containing various redox couples suggested that high efficiency photoelectrochemical cells could be established through selective collection of carriers at the semiconductor/liquid junction. The quasi-Fermi levels of electrons and holes were measured directly against the solution potential. Steady-state and transient photovoltage measurements, and theoretical modeliug of the carrier transport, generation, and recombination dynamics indicated that the quasi-Fermi levels were flat across the semiconductor sample. The recombination velocities at the Si/liquid junctions have also been measured, and were shown to vary with the solution potential following the <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory</b> on recombination. ...|$|E
40|$|Silicon has {{numerous}} {{benefits as}} a photonic integrated circuit platform, including optical transparency from 1. 1 Âµm to greater than 5 Âµm, tight optical confinement {{due to its}} high index of refraction, high third order non-linearity, and lack of two photon absorption at wavelengths above 2. 2 Âµm. Additionally, silicon photonics has {{the added benefit of}} decades of fabrication knowledge from the CMOS industry. Despite these advantages, an enormous challenge exists in two areas, optical sources for silicon photonic integrated circuits, and on the other end, optical detectors for silicon photonic integrated circuits. The same bandgap energy that leads to the optical transparency at telecom and mid-infrared wavelengths, limits both generation and detection in this same regime. This dissertation focuses on the detection problem, exploring the use of defect-mediated sub-bandgap optical absorption in ion-implanted silicon nano-wire waveguides. Section I of this dissertation focuses on fabrication and the ion-implantation process, including a primer on <b>Shockley-Read-Hall</b> <b>theory</b> and its application to defect-mediated sub-bandgap optical absorption. Section II examines the devices for use at telecom wavelengths. In Chapter 4, the fabrication and characterization of metal-semiconductor-metal ion-implanted silicon nano-wire waveguide photodiodes is examined. These devices require minimal fabrication, are compatible with standard CMOS fabrication processes, and exhibited responsivities as high as 0. 51 A/W and frequency responses greater than 2. 6 GHz. With improved fabrication tolerances, frequency responses of greater than 10 GHz are expected. Chapter 5 examined these ion-implanted photodiodes in a p-i-n configuration as a high speed data interconnect, demonstrating error free operation at 10 Gbs with expected sensitivities approaching that of Ge detectors. Section III extends the above research to longer wavelengths, starting with data reception at 1. 9 Âµm in Chapter 6, exhibiting an approximate 5 dB penalty in sensitivity compared to the same diodes at 1. 55 Âµm, at a data rate of 1 Gbs, limited by RC due to the 2 mm length of the device. Chapter 7 goes even further, characterizing Si+ implanted silicon nano-wire waveguides for operation between 2. 2 Âµm and 2. 35 Âµm. These devices showed responsivities as high as 9. 9 mA/W, with internal quantum efficiencies approaching 5 %. Chapter 8 concludes with the characterization of Zn+ implanted silicon nano-wire waveguides operating in the same wavelength regime, exhibiting higher overall responsivity, albeit at a much higher reverse bias. These long wavelength devices open up new areas of research for silicon photonics, allowing for CMOS compatible detectors operating into the mid-infrared region, useful for chemical sensing, free-space communications, and medical imaging...|$|E
