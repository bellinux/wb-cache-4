500|$|Returning to San Francisco {{after this}} event, {{it was here}} that Sylvester {{produced}} his next album for Fantasy Records, <b>Sell</b> <b>My</b> Soul. Largely avoiding disco after the genre had become unpopular following the much publicized Disco Sucks movement, <b>Sell</b> <b>My</b> Soul instead represented a selection of soul-inspired dance tracks. Recorded in two weeks, Sylvester worked largely with backing singers and musicians whom he was unfamiliar with, and regular collaborators Rhodes and Cowley were entirely absent. Reviews were generally poor, describing the album as being average in quality. [...] The only disco song on the album, [...] "I Need You", was released as a single, but fared poorly.|$|E

Now the government through its efforts is selling their goods... Nobody can <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> property if I am unwilling to sell it. Article 21 of the Constitution forbids it. If we are a constitutional regime functioning in accordance with constitutional law we can't do this. This is atrocious. Grab my arm, eject me from my village, then <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> goods and properties, such a thing can never be permissible. Neither {{the conscience of the}} Ottomans nor the law can allow it.|$|E

2500|$|Alcott patiently drudged away at Little Women {{but found}} {{emotional}} release in scribbling her blood-and-thunder tales. [...] The difference shows: in pacing, tone, and content, Love Chase is startlingly unlike its famous successor. The ostentatiously Faustian plot centers on Rosamond Vivian, a discontented maiden {{who lives on}} an English island with only her bitter old grandfather for company and who begins the novel by rashly declaring: [...] "I often feel as if I'd gladly <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> soul to Satan for a year of freedom." [...] Right on cue, a man named Phillip Tempest — a man who bears a more than trivial resemblance to Mephistopheles — walks in the door. Within a month, Rosamond is in love, and although she realizes that this man is “no saint”, she marries him, believing with the fatuousness of youth that her love will save him. She sails away from her lonely island in Tempest's yacht, the Circe, and begins her married life at a luxurious villa in Nice.|$|E
2500|$|... "Three {{organizations}} {{are involved in}} trying to force me off land I legally own — Stephenville Town Council: Stephenville Chamber of Commerce: and Stephenville Lions Club. It was the Chamber of Commerce in 1957 that called for the setting up of a civic park at Long Gull Pond. It is a whisper campaign, to make people believe I am {{standing in the way of}} progress, that I am stubbornly refusing to <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> land thus robbing the people of the west coast their own born-right to boil the kettle on their chosen spot of summer scenery. This argument is full of holes. Firstly, I have stated publicly that a first rate section of my land including frontage along the beach of the pond has been reserved and placed solely at the disposal of all comers without cost. I have offered to make such an arrangement permanent by entering into a proper contract with the appropriate authority. This fact, plus the fact that land is still available elsewhere on the pond, shows that more than just a park is involved.|$|E
