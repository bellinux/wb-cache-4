50|$|The {{construction}} camps {{consisted of}} open-sided barracks built of bamboo poles with thatched roofs. The barracks were about 60 m long with <b>sleeping</b> <b>platforms</b> raised {{above the ground}} {{on each side of}} an earthen floor.

Across the room they saw the opening of {{what appeared to be a}} corridor and which investigation proved to be a short passageway, terminating in a chamber in the center of which was an ornate sleeping dais. This room, like the others, was but poorly lighted, time having dimmed the radiance of its bulbs and coated them with dust. A glance showed that it was hung with heavy goods and contained considerable massive furniture in addition to the <b>sleeping</b> <b>platform,</b> a second glance at which revealed what appeared to be the form of a man lying partially on the floor and partially on the dais. No doorways were visible other than that at which they had entered, though both knew that others might be concealed by the hangings.|$|E

50|$|The track {{consists}} of 58 sections and is marked {{at regular intervals}} with triangular pointers, most of which have {{an image of the}} wagyl, a mythical creature from Aboriginal Dreamtime stories. Each section is approximately one day's walk, except for the northernmost 150 km or so, where the sections consist of half-day walks. At the end of each section is either a town or a purpose-built campsite. Each campsite {{consists of}} a three-sided shelter with wooden <b>sleeping</b> <b>platforms,</b> a water tank, a pit toilet, picnic tables and cleared tent sites. In the northern half, most campsites also have a barbecue pit and plate (open fires are banned in the southern section).|$|R
50|$|A narrow {{entrance}} tunnel, a little {{wider than the}} occupants of the cave, leads into the main chamber which consists of a flat area, perhaps with elevated <b>sleeping</b> <b>platform(s),</b> also excavated from snow. Most sources agree that using tools such as a shovel and ice axe are vital; digging by hand is for emergencies only. Digging a snow cave can be very physically demanding. In perfect conditions with good snow, digging a snow cave for 2 or 3 persons often takes 3 to 4 hours to complete. It can be useful to take turns {{in a group of}} climbers such that each person works in 5 minute intervals inside the cave, while the others help remove excess snow outside the cave and prepare food and warm liquids for the group.|$|R
50|$|Homes {{were not}} permanent, but rather camps of chickees. The chickee was an open-sided {{structure}} with corner support posts of cypress or palm logs, to which was secured a <b>sleeping</b> <b>platform</b> with a thatched roof of palmetto fronds. These chickee camps were arranged according to matrilineal clans and multiple living units surrounded a shared central cooking chickee. Well suited to climate, {{they could be}} moved in hunting or farming seasons. As Osceola described his youth, sometimes {{they lived in a}} temporary camp in Indiantown, sometimes in Brighton, and only occasionally with his father on Big Cypress where his father raised corn, sweet potatoes and a lot of pumpkin.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is a small}} {{man-made}} cave {{carved into}} the outcrop beneath the Bunnet Stane called Maiden's Bower. The story goes that many years ago a young maiden {{fell in love with}} the son of a rival family. The stone was their meeting spot but one day, as she approached, she saw her father's men ambush and kill the young man. After that she refused to return home and spent the remainder of her life in the cave, becoming known locally as a saint. More realistic theories suggest that the cave may have been built by a landlord as a bothy or by surveyors in the 19th century. A further explanation was provided by a contributor to the Scots Magazine, a few years ago. This person was an elderly lady who, as a child, spent holiday time at the nearby farm of Wester Nether Urquhart. In her letter, she described an old man (possibly an ex-soldier) who was given permission by the farmer to make himself a small bothy which he occupied while employed as a shepherd. An examination of the interior shows the remains of an iron fire grate and ventilation chimney. The walls bear grooves, notches and small platforms which are likely to have served the purpose of partitioning off, say, a sleeping area or storage. One largeish notch in the southern wall may have supported one end of a <b>sleeping</b> <b>platform</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The daily {{construction}} of a <b>sleeping</b> <b>platform</b> or "nest" is a universal behavior among large-bodied hominoids. Among chimpanzees, most populations consistently select particular tree species for nesting, yet the principles that guide species preferences are poorly understood. At Semliki, Cynometra alexandri constitutes only 9. 6 % of all trees in the gallery forest in which the study populations ranges, but it was selected for 73. 6 % of the 1, 844 chimpanzee night beds we sampled. To determine whether physical properties influence nesting site selection, we measured the physical characteristics of seven common tree species at the Toro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Uganda. We determined stiffness and bending strength for a sample of 326 branches from the seven most commonly used tree species. We selected test-branches with diameters typically used for nest construction. We measured internode distance, calculated mean leaf surface area (cm 2) and assigned a tree architecture category {{to each of the}} seven species. C. alexandri fell at the extreme of the sample for all four variables and shared a tree architecture with only one other of the most commonly selected species. C. alexandri was the stiffest and had the greatest bending strength; it had the smallest internode distance and the smallest leaf surface area. C. alexandri and the second most commonly selected species, Cola gigantea, share a 'Model of Koriba' tree architecture. We conclude that chimpanzees are aware of the structural properties of C. alexandri branches and choose it because its properties afford chimpanzees sleeping platforms that are firm, stable and resilient...|$|E
50|$|Hayden’s {{excavation}} included Housepit No. 3, which measured 14 {{meters in}} diameter. It {{is estimated that}} thirty people (i.e., five or six nuclear families) occupied this structure. Deposits here indicate some elements of wealth, larger storage pits, some higher grade food products, and probable access to better fishing sites than {{the residents of the}} smaller housepits. The wood used for fuel was the same type as for the small housepit, but here was evidence of greater use of fire and of the hearths present. There were bedding materials at the peripheral walls with some raised <b>sleeping</b> <b>platforms</b> signifying another difference from the residents of the smaller structures. The medium-sized housepit included separate domestic spaces with a central communal area. The overall space was divided into four sectors with a principal hearth in central area.|$|R
5000|$|In North America, dreys {{begin as}} a {{collection}} of small, gnawed-off branches bearing green leaves. The habit of harvesting these branches well before autumn (when the leaves would naturally fall) allows the leaves - though they turn brown - to adhere tightly throughout the winter. [...] A finished drey is a hollow sphere, about a foot or more in diameter, with branches and other rough-hewn materials loosely woven on the outside and an inner surface lined with a variety of finer materials, such as grass, moss, leaves, shredded bark or pine needles. There may be one, or occasionally two, entrance/exit holes in a drey, usually close to the bottom and oriented toward the trunk, which keeps rain out. A second hole is used for an escape route. The incomplete or flat dreys sometimes seen may be hot-weather <b>sleeping</b> <b>platforms,</b> or abandoned efforts built by very young, inexperienced squirrels.|$|R
5000|$|The Birnirk {{people lived}} in small single family {{dwellings}} containing either a long or short entrance {{that led to a}} single room with <b>sleeping</b> <b>platforms.</b> Houses lacked open fireplaces; instead, heat and light were provided by stone and clay lamps. [...] Birnirk settlements are thought to have been small, with only a few families living in a settlement at a time. [...] As such, the concept of the Birnirk people whaling is often debated. Most communities involved in whaling require several crews, which would have been difficult for the Birnirk as they had such small settlements. [...] However, a whaling harpoon found in Barrow, along with artifacts derived from whale parts found in other sites (baleen, whale bones, and the like) suggest that the Birnirk people were involved in some form of whale hunts. They were also known to hunt seals, caribou, birds, and fish using a variety of tools.|$|R
50|$|The Taaw't Bato's artistry is cruder {{compared}} to other Palawan groups, except in exceptional cases involving basketry. Around cave-dwellings, for example, they construct a light and sturdy lattice-work made of saplings lashed together and anchored fast to crevices in the walls {{to provide access to}} the caves. The construction does not depend on any major framework to hold the unit against the walls. The anchorage is distributed all along the framework such they the breakdown of one section can be compensated for {{by the rest of the}} construction. With conditions varying in different caves, there are modifications and elaboration on the basic datag or <b>sleeping</b> <b>platforms,</b> and lagkaw or granary. They are swidden cultivators, practicing multiple cropping with cassava as the major source of carbohydrate. They also produce sweet potato, sugarcane, malungay, garlic, pepper, string beans, squash, tomato, pineapple, etc. Throughout the year, hunting and forging is pursued to complement the carbohydrate diet of the people. Most of the wild pigs are caught through spring traps.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the density and {{population}} size of Bornean orang-utan (Pongo pygmaeus) {{was carried out in}} 1995 and 1996 in an area of peat swamp forest in the Sungai (River) Sebangau catchment, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Densities were calculated for four forest sub-types by counts of orang-utan <b>sleeping</b> <b>platforms</b> (nests) along line transects. Densities were found to be highest in the tall interior and mixed swamp forest sub-types. Low pole forest supported the lowest density. Habitat disturbance caused by log-ging was shown to affect orang-utan density within mixed swamp forest. The orang-utan population for a larger peat covered landscape unit (9200 km 2), including the Sebangau catchment, was estimated to be between 5671 (955) and 8951 (1509) indi-viduals, based upon the area of each forest type, the level of disturbance in each area and corrected to prevent overestimates. This study identifies the presence of a very large, self-sustaining orang-utan population in this region and emphasises the urgent requirement for greater protection of Kalimantan’s peat swamp forests in the light of recent and rapid habitat degradation...|$|R

40|$|Captive environments {{often fail}} to {{resemble}} the wild environment in respects of limited space, unchanging habitat, lack of stimulus and contingency. Common animal welfare problems which occur in captive animals include low behavioral diversity, abnormal behavior and excessive inactivity. Environmental enrichment, as an effective strategy to tackle these problems and promote mental health of captive animals, has been recognized as an important principal for captive animal management. Among all the enrichment techniques, olfactory enrichment is a simple and effective method for improving {{the well-being of the}} olfactory sensitive felids. Behavioral problems were observed in six Amur leopards Panthera pardus orientalis at Beijing Zoological Garden. These were held in the older type exhibits which have now been rebuilt. These behaviors include stereotypic behavior and excessive inactivity caused by the spatially limited enclosures with low levels of stimuli. To determine the effects of predator, prey, and herb odors as potential enrichment materials for captive leopards, we conducted olfactory enrichment experiments for the leopards and tested the effects of nutmeg Myristica fragrans, feces of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and urine of Amur tiger Panthera tigris altaica to test for an increase in behavioral repertoire and activity. Odors provided in this study were also believed to improve the psychological and physiological health of individuals. To standardize the method of presentation the odors were introduced to the enclosures by rubbing or spraying onto a clean towel. Our results show that the selected three odors effectively increased the behavioral diversity. Ten new behavior types were observed in the nutmeg experiment, eight in the feces of roe deer experiment and six in the tiger urine experiment. Among the three odors, cats responded to nutmeg for the longest duration, followed by tiger urine and feces of roe deer. Leopards showed more play behavior in presence of nutmeg while more investigatory behavior in presences of feces of roe deer and tiger urine. Providing novel odors increased the spatial use of the exhibit and the animal’s increased use of the logs, <b>sleeping</b> <b>platforms</b> and bars in the cages. Novel odors also significantly increased the overall activity of the leopards, but the effects were diminished in about three hours [Current Zoology 55 (1) : 20 – 27, 2009]...|$|R

When brought up before the Captain and myself they both confessed their guilt. Nobibux stated that for the last ten years he had allowed men to commit acts of beastliness: he had no doubt induced Mohangu to do this criminal act. Nobibux was put in irons and Mohangu, after blistering his penis, was made to holystone [scrub the decks] from 6 a. m. to 6 p. m. daily.

This surgeon was given 20 shillings per immigrant landed alive. for immigrants classified as invalids on embarking, if they died during voyage, he received a pro-rated amount, based on how long they lived; wife not allowed to go along. Arthur Harrison, SS, states on November 4, 1898 : [on 25 th Sept, when near the Cape of Good Hope, his compounder Abdul Wahed reported to him at 8 a. m. that he heard two men had committed sodomy during the night. he told the compounder to take the men to the hospital, where he would question them. ] [witness, the sirdar Rambuccus, brought in with the two men. questioned in front of them, {{he said that he was}} on watch in between decks at midnight and "saw something unusual between these two men, they being under one blanket; he pulled off the blanket and saw them committing sodomy. " he called the head sirdar at once. the prisoners denied it to the head sirdar but then later confessed. they were left in the charge of the hear sirdar for the rest of the night. captain also present at inquiry. while Rambuccus was giving this testimony, neither prisoner said anything. ] [the head sirdar Salikram is then questioned. confirms being called as above. says he separated the men and "asked them why they were doing this wrong thing, that they at first denied it and afterwards they confessed they did it for pleasure. "] [when questioned by SS, men at once confessed. Nabibux: "I have done it. " Mohungu said same, "as far as I can remember. I cannot remember the words they used in confessing. " Nabibux placed in irons fastened to a stanchion in the hospital. Mohangu placed in hospital and ordered to holystone from 6 a. m to 6 p. m. "I blistered the penis of Mohungu. I did so as a punishment as I thought he deserved it. " did this right after enquiry concluded. the captain knew Harrison did this. "Mohungu was the man who committed the act on Nabibuccus. I blistered him as a preventitive, as he might have attempted the act again. I have known cases where the penis has been blistered as a preventitive treatment, in case of masturbation with boys. "] [says he didn't see it as a crime committed against the laws of England, but "as a matter of discipline on board ship"; didn't examine their private parts for evidence] "Since this all occurred, it has come to my knowlegde that the head sirdar had threatend the two men to make them confess. Since I heard this, I have questioned them. Both denied the act and said Salikram had threatened to make them confess. My compounder's name is Abdul Wahed. I have heard from him since that the man Rambuccus who caught them had a spite against one of the men, owing to something that had occurred in the country Depot in India. " ABDUL WAHED, THE CHIEF COMPOUNDER, STATES: [the inquiry occurred at about 8 : 30 p. m. on the 25 th Sept. ] "I heard Mohungu say he had put his penis in Nabibux' anus, and some days afterwards both men said to me that Rambux and Salikram had threatened to beat them throughout the voyage if they did not confess to having committed the sodomy.
