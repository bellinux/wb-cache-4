The loop thermosyphon used a porous <b>structure</b> <b>on</b> a boiling surface and a microgroove <b>structure</b> <b>on</b> a condensation surface. In this study, we measured the heat transfer performance and we obtained the following results. The evaporation heat transfer of the porous structure is about six times as large {{as that of the}} flat surface.

Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood.

The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of <b>structures</b> <b>on</b> the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries.

The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other <b>structures</b> <b>on</b> virus particles. The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells. Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.|$|E

PROPs describe `extra algebraic <b>structure</b> <b>on</b> objects of any sym-metric monoidal category'. Algebraic Theories describe `ex-tra algebraic <b>structure</b> <b>on</b> objects of any category with nite prod-ucts'. 2 For example: There's a monad on Set whose algebras are groups.
