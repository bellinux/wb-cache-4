50|$|<b>Static</b> <b>routing</b> {{is a form}} of routing {{that occurs}} when a router uses a manually-configured routing entry, rather than {{information}} from a dynamic routing traffic. In many cases, static routes are manually configured by a network administrator by adding in entries into a routing table, though this may not always be the case. Unlike dynamic routing, static routes are fixed and do not change if the network is changed or reconfigured. <b>Static</b> <b>routing</b> and dynamic routing are not mutually exclusive. Both dynamic routing and <b>static</b> <b>routing</b> are usually used on a router to maximise routing efficiency and to provide backups in the event that dynamic routing information fails to be exchanged. <b>Static</b> <b>routing</b> can also be used in stub networks, or to provide a gateway of last resort.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A Wireless {{sensor network}} is an {{infrastructure}} comprised of sensing (measuring), computing, and communication elements that gives an administrator {{the ability to}} instrument, observe, and react to events and phenomena in a specified environment. The administrator typically is a civil, governmental, commercial, or industrial entity. The environment can be the physical world, a biological system, or an information technology (IT) framework. Routing is very difficult in wireless sensor network due to {{a large number of}} sensor nodes. In wireless sensor network, Routing can be divided into Flat Routing, Hierarchical Routing, Location- aware Routing. Hierarchical Routing can be further divided into two parts: Dynamic and <b>Static</b> Hierarchical <b>Routing</b> or Clustering-based Routing. Dynamic Clustering based protocols are those in which the clusters are formed and diminished dynamically. <b>Static</b> Clustering based <b>Routing</b> Protocols are those in which clusters once formed remain same throughout the network lifetime. In our paper, we discuss all Dynamic and <b>Static</b> Clustering based <b>Routing</b> Protocols and its pros and cons...|$|R

40|$|In a {{communication}} network with a source node, a multicast tree {{is defined as a}} tree rooted at the source node and all its leaves being recipients of the multicast originating at the source. The tree or bandwidth cost is normally measured by its utilization of tree links along with the quality of service (QoS) measures such as delay constraint and end-to-end delay. However, if nodes are allowed to join or leave the multicast group {{at any time during the}} lifetime of the multicast connection, then the problem is known as dynamic multicast routing problem. In this article, we combine a greedy approach with <b>static</b> multicast <b>routing</b> using Tabu Search to find a low-cost dynamic multicast tree with desirable QoS parameters. The proposed algorithm is then compared with several <b>static</b> multicast <b>routing</b> algorithms. The simulation results show that, on a large number of events, i. e., where nodes are leaving or joining, the proposed algorithm is able to find multicast trees of lower cost and more desirable QoS properties...|$|R

5000|$|Fault tolerance: <b>Static</b> <b>routing</b> is not fault tolerant. This {{means that}} {{when there is a}} change in the network or a failure occurs between two statically defined devices, traffic will not be re-routed. As a result, the network is {{unusable}} until the failure is repaired or the static route is manually reconfigured by an administrator.|$|E
50|$|In <b>static</b> <b>routing</b> (or non-dynamic routing), small {{networks}} may use manually configured routing tables. Larger {{networks have}} complex topologies {{that can change}} rapidly, making the manual construction of routing tables unfeasible. Nevertheless, most of the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) uses pre-computed routing tables, with fallback routes if the most direct route becomes blocked (see routing in the PSTN).|$|E
40|$|In PC {{clusters}} or {{high performance}} I/O networks including InfiniBand, network topologies often become irregular. Although various adaptive routings for irregular networks have been proposed, most of such commercial or experimental networks use a deterministic routing which enables a simple switch structure and in-order packet delivery. A strategy of path selection algorithm which fixes a single path among alternative paths between {{each pair of}} switches(hosts) is required {{but only a few}} studies have been asserted. In this paper, we propose three path selection algorithms which have different concepts using a <b>static</b> analysis of <b>routing</b> path to distribute the traffic, and investigate the influences of path selection algorithms on the throughput. Result of simulations shows that the throughput of each path selection algorithm depends on routing algorithm and topology, and the path selection algorithms using a <b>static</b> analysis of <b>routing</b> path achieves higher throughput compared with one without using it...|$|R
30|$|To avoid {{additional}} costs of multi-path routing when {{the network is}} not congested, biased geographical routing (BGR) protocol [16] is presented to reactively split traffic, when congestion is detected. BGR employs the dynamic routing technique to alleviate congestion so as to decrease the additional cost of <b>static</b> multi-path <b>routing.</b> If its drawbacks, such as the blindness during scattering packets and the restrictions on coordinate systems, can be properly overcome, a more effective and practicable congestion control mechanism would be achieved for WSNs. Based on this understanding, many {{studies have been conducted}} with the aim of using gradient search to solve the routing problem in WSNs [17 - 21].|$|R
40|$|For dynamic QoS {{multicast}} routing, efficient {{handling of}} node's join and leave {{is an important}} problem. This paper addresses the problem of optimally connecting a new node to an existing multicast tree under sourceto -destination delay and inter-destination delay variation constraints (MRDC-JOIN). We assume a QoS framework where a delay dependent cost function is associated with each network link. After showing that MRDC-JOIN is NPcomplete, we present centralized and distributed versions of the algorithm MRDC-JOIN. By means of simulation, we show that the algorithm is capable of handling join requests efficiently in terms of success rate and tree cost in comparison with a centralized <b>static</b> multicast <b>routing</b> algorithm [1]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In low {{duty-cycle}} sensor networks, sensors sleep most {{of their}} time; it is consequently hard for sensors to maintain always-awake communication links. One major challenge is therefore to design communication algorithms to reduce the delivery delay. In this paper we propose and evaluate a delay-aware routing algorithm for low duty-cycle sensor networks. The proposed algorithm first organizes the network into a layered structure. And then the sensor with packets ready to be sent dynamically determines a forwarder from multiple potential next-hop sensors in terms of timeliness. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm outperforms the <b>static</b> shortest-path <b>routing</b> in delivery delay and drop rate.
