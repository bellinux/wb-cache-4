5|$|After {{moving to}} the US, Rihanna signed a {{contract}} with Def Jam Recordings, and released her debut album Music of the Sun (2005). The album was inspired by caribbean music, including soca, dancehall, and reggae, and incorporates dance-pop and R. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> she had arrived in the US, she had been exposed to different types of music that she had never heard before, including rock music, which she incorporated into her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006).|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{later told}} a BBC {{documentary}} {{that he had}} not expected to become Prime Minister, and the coalition agreement had not yet been completed when Brown resigned. Speaking on the programme, Five Days That Changed Britain, broadcast on 29 July, he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he went to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the coalition deal had not been finalised. Formally, the monarch can only invite a prospective Prime Minister to form a Government; the shape of the Government is for the new Prime Minister to decide. William Hague said that as Cameron travelled to the Palace, the coalition agreement was still being completed and signed.|$|E
5|$|Critics cited Arkham Origins {{handling}} of the genesis of Batman's relationships with his adversaries and allies and its question of whether Batman's presence enhances crime in Gotham City as the game's greatest assets. Scenes with the Joker received the most praise, with Polygon saying that although {{he was also a}} central antagonist in previous Arkham games, the story shone new light on the character; GameSpot called the story surprising in its exploration of the bond and similarities between Batman and the Joker. The story was criticized for lacking a cohesive narrative (particularly the opening plot line of assassins hunting Batman, largely forgotten by the game's end), but EGM <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it works, the story was worthy of any Batman film, TV show or comic book.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
5|$|In {{the regular}} season finale of 2001, Favre {{was the target of}} minor {{controversy}} when, in a game against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium, he was sacked by the Giants defensive end Michael Strahan. It was Strahan's lone sack of the game and gave him the NFL's single–season sack record of 22.5, which topped Mark Gastineau's record of 22 set in 1984. The controversy (Favre fell over unusually easily) has followed Strahan continuously since he set the record. Jim Fassel, Strahan's coach in 2001, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a respected athlete like Strahan gets close to an all-time record, sometimes opponents want him to break it.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong {{striking resemblance to}} him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the same}} character. He also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be {{explained by the fact that}} the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.|$|E
5|$|Maids' representatives <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{the waiver}} was announced, the {{guidelines}} were unclear {{and had no}} implementation date. Employers deferred contracts or dismissed workers pending confirmation of the effective date, leaving them in limbo. They protested the uncertainty, demanding an increase in their minimum wage to HK$4,000. Employers reportedly began terminating their helpers' contracts, stoking fears of mass terminations. On 20 July Secretary for Labour and Welfare Matthew Cheung announced that the waiver commencement date would be moved up by one month, and the Immigration Department temporarily relaxed its 14-day re-employment requirement for helpers whose contracts had expired.|$|E
5|$|Many critics {{compared}} Nuka-World to {{a previous}} expansion pack for Fallout 4 named Far Harbor. Dan Stapleton (IGN) <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> compared to Far Harbor, the role-playing elements {{are far less}} developed, though he also said Nuka-World has a nice setting filled with surprises and battles. Nicholas Tan (Game Revolution) also believed {{it was one of}} the better expansion packs, albeit not having such an in-depth a story-line as Far Harbor. Paul Tassi (Forbes) preferred Far Harbor due to this expansion being light on story.|$|E

50|$|Keene LJ <b>said</b> <b>that</b> even <b>when</b> {{there were}} express words, the {{question}} was whether the context and character of the agreement made them apt for incorporation into individual contracts. Therefore, the agreement {{was not intended to}} create individual rights.|$|R
5|$|Although {{details of}} the siege were not recorded, it {{appeared}} to be bloodless. The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled regime of Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a jizya (tribute), on condition that the caliph came to Jerusalem to sign the pact and accept the surrender. It is <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, Shurahbil ibn Hassana, one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead of waiting for the caliph to come all the way from Madinah, Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he was very similar in appearance to Umar. The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited him to come to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city.|$|E
5|$|His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach {{farmer in}} his home town of Gaffney who {{died at the age}} of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father {{attended}} a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round. The union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full-time workers being made redundant and {{a significant increase in the}} number of part-time staff. The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Royal Mail stopped talking to staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not stopped talking to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|E
5|$|Taonere Banda was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard because the country {{did not have any}} athletes who met the qualification standards. Banda spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, uneven running track without standard defined lanes. She stated that it had been her childhood ambition to represent Malawi at a major international sporting event and this was her sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). Banda was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. Banda was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities to work hard and participate in sporting events.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by Hurricane's {{on-screen}} injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle {{at the request of}} Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey because he did not help him fend off Angle. The next week, The Hurricane no-showed a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, reverting to his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd, and that he was sick of carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. This turned him into a heel in the process. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Helms and Rosey faced off in a singles match, which Helms won. Subsequently, Helms wrestled mostly on Raws sister show, Heat. On the January 2, 2006 episode of Raw Helms confronted Jerry Lawler over jokes that Lawler had been making at Helms' expense, and Lawler <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Helms was The Hurricane, he was entertaining and called Helms a joke. Helms responded by slapping Lawler, who hit Helms back. This confrontation led to Lawler defeating Helms in a match at New Year's Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Navarins actions during the Battle of Tsushima on 27–28 May as {{there were very few}} {{survivors}} from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle. The ship was apparently not heavily engaged during {{the early part of the}} battle, but was badly damaged later in the day when she was third from last in the Russian line of battle. She was hit four times by large-caliber shells on the waterline that caused major flooding aft. Her quarterdeck was awash up to her rear 12-inch turret by 2100 and the ship was forced to stop for repairs. Around that time she was attacked by Japanese torpedo boats that may have made one or two torpedo hits. Navarin managed to get underway again and damaged one torpedo boat badly enough that she sank later that night. Around 0200 on 28 May, the ship was attacked again by the Fourth Destroyer Division which dropped six strings of mines ahead of her. These consisted of four mines linked together with cables so that hitting any part of the string would draw the mines onto the ship. Two of these mines struck Navarin, which quickly capsized and sank. Some 70 men were able to abandon ship before she sank, but only three were alive when they were found 16 hours later. One man was rescued by a Japanese torpedo boat while the other two were rescued by a British merchant ship. The rest of her crew of 674 officers and enlisted men were lost. The rescued men had <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> they called out for help, they were fired on by Japanese torpedo boats.|$|E
