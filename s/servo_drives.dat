40|$|Abstract: Friction, {{especially}} its nonlinear components, may degrade the tracking performance of any <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> systems. Focused on high precision positioning of DC electrical drive the paper proposes an easy method {{to compensate for}} the friction by using a non-model based compensator developed around a simple control structure. The approach to inhibit the friction influence is based on a compensation signal provided by the mathematical model of the <b>servo</b> positioning DC <b>drive</b> in which the load torque (including friction component) is considered zero. Build on the difference between the command signals of real <b>servo</b> tracking <b>drive</b> and, respectively, of the same <b>servo</b> <b>drive,</b> but no load status, the compensation variable depends only on the usual and measurable states of an electrical drive (current and velocity) The control problem of the <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> with friction is solved via the gain scheduling of a P controller parameter as function of position reference scale. Good results concerning the tracking errors are achieved for large range of reference test signals, including the micrometer scale...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An {{incremental}} {{motion control}} problem, specified by a trapezoidal speed command profile using multisegment {{sliding mode control}} (MSSMC), is proposed to control synchronous reluctance motor (SRM) <b>servo</b> <b>drive.</b> Since the control gains in the MSSMC are fixed, chattering responses occur due to large external load disturbances. Therefore, a neural network (ANN) is developed to tune the control gains online. A field-oriented control SRM <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> is implemented and each segment of the multi-segment switching surface is designed so as to match the corresponding part of the trapezoidal speed command profile. As a consequence, the motor dynamics on the specified segment switching surface have the desired speed or acceleration corresponding to the trapezoidal speed command profile. Theoretical analyses for the proposed ANN-based MSSMC are described in detail. The effectiveness of the proposed SRM <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> is demonstrated using simulated and experimental results...|$|R
50|$|A precise {{synchronization}} of {{the rotary}} motion with the stroke movement is required {{so that the}} needle does not touch the groove channel during {{the up and down}} movement. Influencing variables for the maximum winding speed are the needle stroke, the rotation angle of the stator (number of poles), the wire diameter and the groove channel width and the helix angle of the angularly grooved stators. The mass of the wire guide and the needle support experience a high acceleration. This can lead to unwanted vibrations that {{have an effect on the}} winding quality. The lifting motion is normally generated by ball screws. During this movement, the <b>servo</b> <b>drives</b> must constantly reverse in order to reverse the direction of the needle movement.|$|E

50|$|In {{the field}} of Industrial Control Systems, the {{interfacing}} of various control components must provide means to coordinate the signals and commands sent between control modules. While tight coordination is desirable for discrete inputs and outputs, {{it is especially important}} in motion controls, where directing the movement of individual axis of motion must be precisely coordinated so that the motion of the entire system follows a desired path. Types of equipment requiring such coordination are, for example, metal cutting machine tools, metal forming equipment, assembly machinery, packaging machinery, robotics, printing machinery and material handling equipment.
