5|$|McCain {{was born}} in the Panama Canal Zone. Had he been elected, he would have become the first {{president}} who was born outside the contiguous forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen of the United States. A bipartisan legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency, and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.|$|E
5|$|The Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) was a {{statement}} adopted by the Cabinet of Rhodesia on 11 November 1965, announcing that Rhodesia, a British territory in southern Africa that had governed itself since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent sovereign state. The culmination of a protracted dispute between the British and Rhodesian governments regarding the terms under which the latter could become fully independent, {{it was the first}} unilateral break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Declaration of Independence nearly two centuries before. Britain, the Commonwealth and the United Nations all deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions, the first in the UN's history, were imposed on the breakaway colony. Amid near-complete international isolation, Rhodesia continued as an unrecognised state with the assistance of South Africa and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|The {{tendency}} to create larger calibre cannon during the World Wars has reversed <b>since.</b> <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Army, for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their ageing pieces. As {{it could be}} towed, the M198 was selected to be the successor to the World War II–era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979. Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the M777 Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much and can be more easily moved. Although land-based artillery such as the M198 are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller than in the past, and, in some cases, having been replaced by cruise missiles. However, the 's planned armament includes the Advanced Gun System (AGS), a pair of 155mm guns, which fire the Long Range Land-Attack Projectile. The warhead, which weighs , has a circular error of probability of , and will be mounted on a rocket, to increase the effective range to , further {{than that of the}} Paris Gun. The AGS's barrels will be water cooled, and will fire 10 rounds per minute, per gun. The combined firepower from both turrets will give a Zumwalt-class destroyer the firepower equivalent to 18 conventional M198 howitzers. The reason for the re-integration of cannon as a main armament in United States Navy ships is because satellite-guided munitions fired from a gun are less expensive than a cruise missile but have a similar guidance capability.|$|E

25|$|Kahn {{rested his}} theory upon two premises, one obvious, one highly controversial.

25|$|Colombia's {{source of}} {{platinum}} was another important issue.

25|$|Never {{before had}} {{international}} monetary cooperation been attempted {{on a permanent}} institutional basis. Even more groundbreaking was the decision to allocate voting rights among governments, not on a one-state one-vote basis, but rather in proportion to quotas. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> was contributing the most, U.S. leadership was the key. Under the system of weighted voting, the United States exerted a preponderant influence on the IMF. The United States held one-third of all IMF quotas at the outset, enough on its own to veto all changes to the IMF Charter.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-four NZSAS {{personnel}} were deployed to Kuwait in February 1998 on Operation GRIFFIN {{during a period}} of international tension with Iraq, tasked with rescuing downed airmen in hostile territory {{in the event of a}} US-led aerial campaign. A smaller force replaced them in May 1998 for a further two-month tour. There were no missions into Iraq undertaken during the deployment, though it was considered a useful opportunity to practice mobile desert warfare skills, and to have contact with US Forces which had been limited <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> suspended its ANZUS relations with New Zealand in 1986.|$|E

25|$|Albert, however, {{was under}} {{investigation}} by the Secret Service because of his propaganda activities. On July 24, 1915, he accidentally left his briefcase on a train; it was recovered by a Secret Service agent who had been following him. The briefcase contained details about the phenol plot and other covert activities to indirectly aid the German war effort. Although it was not incriminating enough to bring charges against Albert or the other conspirators (<b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> was still officially neutral and trade with Germany was legal), the documents were soon leaked to the New York World, an anti-German newspaper. The World published an exposé on August 15, 1915, and the publicity soon forced Albert to stop funding the phenol purchases.|$|E
25|$|The BIS was {{originally}} owned by both central banks and private individuals, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Belgium and France {{had decided to}} sell all {{or some of the}} shares allocated to their central banks to private investors. BIS shares traded on stock markets, which made the bank an unusual organization: an international organization (in the technical sense of public international law), yet allowed for private shareholders. Many central banks had similarly started as such private institutions; for example, the Bank of England was privately owned until 1946. In more recent years the BIS has bought back its once publicly traded shares. It is now wholly owned by BIS members (central banks) but still operates in the private market as a counterparty, asset manager and lender for central banks and international financial institutions. Profits from its transactions are used, among other things, to fund the bank's other international activities.|$|E
25|$|Jackson invaded Florida on March 15, 1818, {{capturing}} Pensacola. He crushed Seminole and Spanish {{resistance in}} the region and captured two British agents, Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot. After a brief trial, Jackson executed both British agents, causing a diplomatic incident with the British. Jackson's actions polarized Monroe's cabinet, some of whom argued that Jackson had gone against Monroe's orders and violated the Constitution, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> had not declared war upon Spain. Yet Jackson was defended by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. Adams thought that Jackson's conquest of Florida would force Spain to finally sell the province, and Spain did indeed sell Florida to the United States in the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819. A congressional investigation exonerated Jackson, but Jackson was deeply angered by the criticism he received, particularly from Speaker of the House Henry Clay. After the ratification of the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1821, Jackson briefly served as the Governor of Florida before returning to Tennessee.|$|E

25|$|US {{military}} {{resources can}} be used as part of a counter-drug (CD) component of a FID program. While these are most often focused on supply, they also {{can be used}} to interfere with drug shipment. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Department of Defense is the lead government agency of the USG for the detection and monitoring (DM) of aerial and maritime transit of illegal drugs into the US, the DM mission is performed with regularly appropriated funds, notwithstanding the possibility of incidental benefit to the HN. Such activities may include nonconfrontational intercepts for intelligence or communication purposes and gathering and processing of tactical intelligence from a variety of sources, including fixed and mobile surveillance assets and certain intelligence sharing. In a CD support role (subject to national policy and legislative guidance) DOD may offer certain direct support to HN CD personnel, and certain enhanced support to US civilian law enforcement agencies that may be operating in the HN, and to the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement of the United States Department of State.|$|E

On 26 March 2003, 15 USAF C-17s participated in the biggest combat airdrop <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> invasion of Panama in December 1989: the night-time airdrop of 1,000 paratroopers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade occurred over Bashur, Iraq. The airdrop of paratroopers were followed by C-17s ferrying M1 Abrams, M2 Bradleys, M113s and artillery. USAF C-17s have also been used to assist allies in their airlift requirements, including Canadian vehicles to Afghanistan in 2003 and Australian forces during the Australian-led military deployment to East Timor in 2006. In 2006, USAF C-17s flew 15 Canadian Leopard C2 tanks from Kyrgyzstan into Kandahar in support of NATO's Afghanistan mission. In 2013, five USAF C-17s supported French operations in Mali, operating with other nations' C-17s (RAF, NATO and RCAF deployed a single C-17 each).|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} of Spain during the Spanish–American War in 1898, Filipino general, Emilio Aguinaldo {{declared}} independence on 12 June while General Wesley Merritt became the first American governor of the Philippines. On 10 December 1898, the Treaty of Paris formally ended the war, with Spain ceding the Philippines and other colonies to the United States in exchange for $20million. After the Philippine–American War, the United States civil governance was established in 1901, with William Howard Taft as the first American Governor-General. A number of Americans settled in the islands and thousands of interracial marriages between Americans and Filipinos have taken place since then. Due to the strategic location of the Philippines, as many as 21 bases and 100,000 military personnel were stationed there <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> first colonized the islands in 1898. These bases were decommissioned in 1992 {{after the end of}} the Cold War, but left behind thousands of Amerasian children. The country gained independence from the United States in 1946. The Pearl S. Buck International Foundation estimates there are 52,000 Amerasians scattered throughout the Philippines. In addition, numerous Filipino men enlisted in the US Navy and made careers in it, often settling with their families in the United States. Some of their second or third generation-families returned to the country.|$|E

500|$|The 50 {{remaining}} mensoon to {{be known}} as the [...] "Port Chicago 50"were formally charged in early September 1944 with disobeying orders and making a mutiny [...] "with a deliberate purpose and intent to override superior military authority".

500|$|Design work on {{what became}} the Illinois class began on 25 March 1896, when Rear Admiral J. G. Walker convened a board to {{consider}} future battleship designs. At this time, the only modern battleship in service was the low-freeboard the high-freeboard battleship [...] and the low-freeboard [...] were under construction. As the Navy had little experience with modern battleships, the question settled on whether to repeat one of the low-freeboard designs, which were suitable for coast defense, to build another Iowa, or to request a new design altogether. The Walker Board determined that another coastal battleship design would be imprudent, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> had long coastlines and therefore the new ships would need to have better seakeeping qualities than the Indiana or Kearsarge designs.|$|E
500|$|Congress {{drew the}} three {{permutations}} of combat from President Kennedy's executive order of April 25, 1962, which previously added the same criteria to the Purple Heart.

The amendment was necessary because Cold War armed conflicts did not qualify for consideration under previous statutes such as the 1918 Army Medal of Honor Statute that required valor [...] "in action involving actual conflict with an enemy", <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> has not formally declared war since World War II {{as a result of}} the provisions of the United Nations Charter. According to congressional testimony by the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, the services were seeking authority to award the Medal of Honor and other valor awards retroactive to July 1, 1958, in areas such as Berlin, Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu Islands, Taiwan Straits, Congo, Laos, Vietnam, and Cuba.|$|E
