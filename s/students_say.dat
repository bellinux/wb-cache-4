2500|$|The OLPC {{project has}} also been criticized for {{allegedly}} adopting a [...] "one-shot" [...] deployment approach {{with little or no}} technical support or teacher training, and for neglecting pilot programs and formal assessment of outcomes in favor of quick deployment. Some authors attribute this unconventional approach to the OLPC promoters' alleged focus on constructivist education and 'digital utopianism'. Mark Warschauer, a Professor of University of California at Irvine and Morgan Ames, at the time of writing, a PhD candidate at Stanford University, have pointed out that the laptop by itself does not completely fill the need of students in underprivileged countries. The [...] "children’s machines", as they have been called, have been deployed to several countries, for example Uruguay, Peru, and in the US, Alabama, but after a relatively short time, their usage has declined considerably, sometimes because of hardware problems or breakage, in some cases, as high as 27% to 59% within the first two years, and sometimes {{due to a lack of}} knowledge on the part of the users on how to take full advantage of the machine. However, another factor has recently been acknowledged; a lack of a direct relation to the pedagogy needed in the local context to be truly effective. Uruguay reports that only 21.5% of teachers use the laptop in the classroom on a daily basis, and 25% report using it less than once a week. In Alabama, 80.3% of <b>students</b> <b>say</b> they never or seldom use the computer for class work, and Peru, teachers report that in the first few months, 68.9% use the laptop three times per week, but after two months, only 40% report such usage. Those of a low socio-economic level tend to not be able to effectively use the laptop for educational purposes on their own, but with scaffolding and mentoring from teachers, the machine can become more useful. According to one of the returning OLPC executives, Walter Bender, the approach needs to be more holistic, combining technology with a prolonged community effort, teacher training and local educational efforts and insights.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the fall}} of 1986, roughly 100 PBS {{stations}} carried The Mechanical Universe, and by {{the fall of}} 1987, over 600 higher-education institutions had purchased it or licensed the episodes for use. In 1992, Goodstein noted that the series had been broadcast, via PBS, by over 100 stations, [...] "usually at peculiar hours when innocent people were unlikely to tune in accidentally on a differential equation in the act of being solved". He observed that detailed viewership figures were difficult to obtain, but when the show had been broadcast in Miami during Saturday mornings, the producers were able to obtain Nielsen ratings.In fact, it came in second in its time slot, beating the kiddie cartoons on two network stations. There were 18,000 faithful core households in Dade County alone, the median age of the viewers was 18, and half were female. However, we seldom get that kind of detailed information.Goodstein and assistant project director Richard Olenick noted,Anecdotal information in the form of letters and phone calls indicates very considerable enthusiasm among users at all levels from casual viewers to high-school students to research university professors, but there have also been a number of sharp disappointments, particularly when Instructional Television administrators have tried to handle TMU like a conventional telecourse.Similarly, a 1988 review in Physics Today suggested that the programs would not function well on their own as a telecourse, but would work much better as a supplement to a traditional classroom or a more standard distance-learning course such as Open University. The reviewers also found the [...] "algebraic ballet" [...] of computer-animated equations too fast to follow: [...] "After a short time, one yearns for a live professor filling the blackboard with equations". Similarly, a review in the American Journal of Physics, while praising the [...] "technical proficiency of the films", wrote of the animated equation manipulations, [...] "As the MIT <b>students</b> <b>say,</b> this is like trying to take a drink of water out of a fire hose". A considerably more enthusiastic evaluation came from physicist Charles H. Holbrow, who told Olenick, [...] "These materials will constitute the principal visual image of physics for decades". Goodstein and Olenick reported that younger viewers tended to enjoy the [...] "algebraic ballet" [...] style [...] "much more than older viewers, who are made uncomfortable by the algebraic manipulations they cannot quite follow".|$|E

40|$|While human tutors {{respond to}} both what a <b>student</b> <b>says</b> and {{to how the}} <b>student</b> <b>says</b> it, most {{tutorial}} dialogue systems cannot detect the student emotions and attitudes underlying an utterance. We present an empirical study investigating the feasibility of recognizing student state in two corpora of spoken tutoring dialogues, one with a human tutor, and one with a computer tutor. We first annotate student turns for negative, neutral and positive student states in both corpora. We then automatically extract acoustic-prosodic features from the student speech, and lexical items from the transcribed or recognized speech. We compare the results of machine learning experiments using these features alone, in combination, and with student and task dependent features, to predict student states. We also compare our results across human-human and human-computer spoken tutoring dialogues. Our results show significant improvements in prediction accuracy over relevant baselines, and provide a first step towards enhancing our intelligent tutoring spoken dialogue system to automatically recognize and adapt to student states. © 2005 Elsevier B.
