5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the {{research}} of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major <b>snowstorm</b> on December 20, 1946 by seeding a cloud. This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification. Its most important goal {{was to try to}} weaken hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|The 1846 {{session of}} Parliament {{experienced}} a <b>snowstorm</b> of bills for new railways; {{many of these}} threatened to encroach on the GPK area of influence and abstract business; several schemes were promoted by the Caledonian Railway or its allies; in self-defence the GPK itself promoted numerous schemes—in fact 25 branches {{as well as a}} bill nominally by the K to authorise the modernisation works—to head off some of the encroachment.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the newly formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) began subsidizing northside {{commuter}} rail operations in the late 1960s, both the Lexington Branch and the Central Mass Branch {{had been reduced to}} single rush hour round trips on poorly maintained track. The South Sudbury run on the Central Mass was terminated on November 26, 1971.

Lad finds him there, but has to jump down to the ledge to save the boy from a bobcat. Now trapped with the boy, Lad keeps him warm until a rescue party arrives.|$|E
5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving <b>snowstorm</b> on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, the bus {{was hit by a}} semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the {{opposite}} direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered it down a steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 feet below the eastbound lanes of I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E
5|$|Famed writer Paul Sheldon (Brian) {{has just}} {{finished}} his latest and final installment in his series entitled Snuggly Jeff, a series of children's books in which he kills off the titular character so he can focus on more serious work, despite objections from his agent, Marcia (Lois).

40|$|Lake-effect <b>snowstorms</b> in {{northern}} Utah and western New York {{with and without}} lightning/thunder are examined. Lake-effect <b>snowstorms</b> with lightning have significantly higher temperatures and dewpoints in the lower troposphere and significantly lower lifted indices than lake-effect <b>snowstorms</b> without lightning. In contrast, there is little difference in dewpoint depressions between events with and without lightning. Surface-to- 700 -hPa temperature differences (a surrogate for lower-tropospheric lapse rate) for events with and without lightning differ significantly for events {{in northern}} Utah, but not for those in western New York. Nearly all events have no convective available potential energy, regardless {{of the presence of}} lightning. These results are discussed in the context of current models of storm electrification. 1...|$|R

When her room was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings packed in boxes and the art removed from the walls. It's not clear whether Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night and Monday morning. On top of the boxes was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a <b>snowstorm.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late November 1918 the 4th Division began a road {{march of}} more than 125 miles from the French city of Metz toward the German city of Koblenz, on the Rhine River. The final {{destination}} of Middleton's 47th Regiment would be the town of Adenau, 35 miles due west of Koblenz. The road trip took fifteen days of moving through almost incessant rain and ended in a driving <b>snowstorm</b> on 15 December. During the march, Middleton broke character and rode a horse during most of each day, surveying his troops and occasionally dismounting to talk with them. The formation marched for fifty minutes of each hour, and rested for ten, with a full hour for lunch.|$|E
