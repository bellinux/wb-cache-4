40|$|Senior federal {{government}} ministers say that welfare spending is growing too quickly. Peter Whiteford sifts the figures {{and comes to}} a different conclusion Soon after he became social services minister in September, Christian Porter declared {{that he was on}} the “hunt for savings” in his portfolio and hinted that carer and disability payments may need to be cut to get the budget back to surplus. A few weeks later the Daily Telegraph likened the welfare system to “a ticking time bomb” and quoted the minister’s observation that it was in “urgent need” of reform. “Government modelling has revealed taxpayer-funded welfare spending in today’s dollars by 2026 will be $ 81 billion more than current tax revenue,” the paper reported. Porter developed his theme on Sky News. “In every single category of the very large spend in social services,” he <b>said</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> month, “the growth is, in any rational observation, unsustainable if it were to go on the way it’s gone on over the last ten years. In all areas, things like the disability support pension and a range of other payments – and there are many of them in the portfolio – they are growing at a rate greater than the ability of the tax base to sustain them. ” If these remarks sound familiar, it’s because they bear a strong resemblance to statements by Porter’s predecessor, Scott Morrison, who argued that “the social services budget could swamp the federal budget” and that “eight out of ten taxpayers work every day to pay our $ 150 billion welfare bill. ” And last year Morrison’s predecessor as social services minister, Kevin Andrews, described welfare spending as “unsustainable” and “relentless. ” The disparity between spending and taxing that worries the Daily Telegraph is essentially meaningless, of course, because it compares spending in eleven years’ time with tax levels today. And, just like the argument that eight out of ten taxpayers work every day to fund the welfare system, the calculation appears to include only personal income taxes, not overall tax revenue (from where social security spending is financed) [...] .

40|$|Aid {{and trade}} {{are needed to}} reduce poverty and inequality, argues Ross Buckley JOHN HOWARD has {{announced}} {{a major shift in}} our government’s approach to security. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Santiago on the weekend he stressed that reducing poverty and inequality in poor countries was critical in the fight against terrorism as these issues provided a point of advocacy for terrorists. His comments echoed those of George W. Bush who, at the same forum, said, ‘Weak and troubled nations export their ills - problems like economic instability and illegal immigration, crime and terrorism. ’ The Australian and US governments have, to date, focused their security efforts on capturing terrorists and toppling the regimes that support them. They have consistently denied a link between poverty and terror. Now they have acknowledged that extreme inequality and poverty fuel the fires of hatred and alienation that underpin terrorism. This shift brings American and Australian views more into line with those of the World Bank and the European nations. Jim Wolfensohn, World Bank president, has been stressing for two years the need to tackle global poverty as part of the fight against terror. Gordon Brown, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, <b>said</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> month, ‘Poverty is a breeding ground for discontent. There is a sense of injustice. We have got to act. ’ However, differences in perspective remain. Howard and Bush separately stressed that trade, not aid, is the key to reducing poverty, and that aid, when given, should be linked to tough anti-corruption initiatives by the recipient countries. Both of these statements are true, to an extent. Freer and fairer trade is critical to reducing global poverty. Aid dollars have more impact when corruption levels in recipient countries are lowered and governance standards are improved. Yet what is needed is more trade, and more aid. Aid can do much that trade cannot; the Europeans understand this. Well-constructed aid programs serve to strengthen local institutions in recipient countries. For instance, Australia has funded a long- term project to support Indonesia in developing local bond markets so that it can keep its savings at home, and not be so dependent on foreign capital. Likewise, we are funding a project to revamp the commercial laws of Vietnam so as to promote the efficiency of its economy and render the country more attractive to foreign investment. We do these projects well; we need to do much more. These critical capacity-building initiatives will never result from trade alone. Most people agree aid could be implemented more effectively. Aid is often tied - restricted to being used to buy goods and services from the donor country. The present model of aid remains beset by the belief that the donors know best. Forty-five of the 47 most recent studies found aid was effective to promote growth and reduce poverty {{even in the face of}} high corruption in the recipient nations. We need more aid. At the individual level Australians seem to recognise this. In the past three years, our donations to charities to spend abroad have grown rapidly. Yet as a nation our record is dismal. The global target for foreign aid is 0. 7 per cent of gross national income. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have reached or surpassed this level. Ireland, Belgium, France, Spain and Britain are all increasing aid rapidly and have pledged to reach the target within between five to ten years. Accordingly, nearly half of the 22 donor countries are at or well on their way to the 0. 7 per cent target. We spend 0. 26 per cent of gross national income on aid (down from 0. 32 per cent when the Howard government came to power). The US gives the least, 0. 14 per cent. But putting the aid issue aside, we now have an explicit acknowledgement that a fairer more equal world will be a safer world, and everyone agrees that fairer and freer trade will make for a fairer world. Our record on trade is generally good. But will the US back up its new insight with action? Will it reduce dramatically the $US 19 billion ($A 24 billion) it paid last year in agricultural subsidies to its farmers so that poor-country farmers can compete with subsidised US ones? It is a major step for the American and Australian governments to have acknowledged that global poverty and inequality must be addressed to make the world safer for all. It will be another thing altogether for the US to give the poorest farmers in the world a level playing field.

40|$|Electronic {{structure}} of crystals is a polymorphic name that covers {{a wide range}} of properties of electrons in periodic solids. For instance, it can refer to the probability to find an electron at space point r, in other words, to the electronic density. It can refer to the energy needed to extract an electron of the material, the ionization energy, or alternatively, the energetic gain when an electron is added to the system, the electron affinity. It can also stand for the response of the electrons of the solid to an external perturbation (a photon or a fast electron). All these properties characterize the electronic {{structure of}} the solid. They describe indeed different aspects. Some of them are ground-state properties, others correspond to excited states. Some of them conserve the number of particles, others do not. As a consequence, the properties that are generically called “electronic structure” are measured with distinct experimental setups, e. g. direct and inverse photoemission, optical absorption, electron energy-loss [...] . And analogously, the theoretical description and prediction of these properties require distinct frameworks. This thesis work will handle the issue of the electronic structure of the cuprous oxide, Cu 2 O. Therefore, different theoretical methods will be used and results will be compared to {{a wide range of}} experimental techniques. The present manuscript contains different parts, which may seem at first sight independent. It is therefore instructive to draw here quickly, what has been the historical development of this work, from the original project to the final achievements. Three years ago, I started this thesis work with the purpose to describe theoretically the electronic structure of copper oxides, begining with the simplest one Cu 2 O, going to the antiferromagnetic CuO, and possibly to the CuO 2 planes of high Tc superconducting cuprates. The cuprous oxide, Cu 2 O, with its closed electronic d shell was thought as a starting point to initiate the study of the Cu–O bonding in the different oxides. Cu 2 O is also interesting because spectacular excitonic series have been measured in its optical absorption or reflectivity spectra during the sixties [1 – 3]. However, it has been quickly clear that the usual electronic structure methods, as density-functional theory (DFT) or even the state-of-the-art GW approximation of the many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), were unable to give a proper description of Cu 2 O. Comparison with existing photoemission or optical measurements were surprisingly bad. This unexpected failure changed the aims of my thesis, which turned into the analysis and the cure of the shortcomings of the theoretical methods applied to Cu 2 O. I have been motivated to develop a number of theoretical and technical tools that, as I hope, will also be useful in future studies of other materials. The failure of the state-of-the-art GW approximation could come from two distinct reasons: either the current implementation of the method that worked well with simpler materials uses further assumptions, that are not anymore valid with the complex oxide Cu 2 O; or the GW approximation itself is not enough to account for the electronic structure of Cu 2 O. In order to check which hypothesis was the right one, I had first to identify, analyse and avoid all further approximations used in a standard GW, as it has most often been performed for 20 years. This part required some code and method development in order to remove the technical approximations that were used to make calculations easier, in our code or in most existing codes. This is what part II of this manuscript is concerned with. Of course, the implementation of new pieces of code had to be checked on simple textbook examples, before being applied to copper oxide. That is why part II provides many results on bulk silicon and solid argon. This methodological part aims at removing the single plasmon-pole approximation that models the dynamical behavior of the screened Coulomb interaction W in GW. It has also the purpose of going beyond the usual perturbative evaluation of GW and to perform real self-consistent calculations within GW or within simpler approximations. The application of these developments to cuprous oxide are postponed to part IV, where all results concerning Cu 2 O are gathered. Alternatively, if the failure of the GW approximation were really a breakdown of the first-order perturbation theory in W (the coupling constant of the perturbation procedure), one would have to include further correcting terms to improve the results: these terms are commonly called “vertex corrections”. Due to their complexity, there is no unique method in literature to approximate them. Having in mind the purpose of applying vertex corrections to cuprous oxide, I had, first of all, the general task to define a proper scheme to do that, and to provide meaningful approximations to it. The basic idea was to start from the earlier developments made in our group concerning the comparison between time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) and MBPT [4 – 6] in order to simplify the otherwise untractable task of calculating vertex corrections. Deep insight in the respective role of the two theories was required and the study finally ended with theoretical achievements that went farther than the initial project. Part III exposes first the advances made in the understanding of the link between TDDFT and MBPT with a new simple equation that derives the crucial, but unfortunately unknown, kernel of TDDFT from the central quantity of MBPT, the self-energy. Second, part III shows how the same kind of ideas can be used in the other direction (namely, use TDDFT in order to progress within MBPT), to make the calculation of vertex corrections easier. These developments were applied in practice to simple materials: once again bulk silicon and solid argon. In fact, even though the derived vertex correction are “simpler”, the calculations remain orders of magnitude more complicated than the usual GW ones. It is still out of reach to apply these developments to cuprous oxide at present. Nevertheless, this derivation and study of vertex corrections allowed me to draw the general conclusion that strong cancellations between vertex corrections occur. The last part of the present work (part IV) presents all my results concerning Cu 2 O, from ground-state DFT studies to new self-consistent GW results, and also from theoretical data to experimental measurements. This part starts with a standard electronic structure study, first DFT geometrical structure, Kohn-Sham band structure and characterization of the orbitals, then standard perturbative GW evaluation of the quasiparticle band structure. As <b>said</b> <b>earlier,</b> <b>this</b> study unexpectedly fails, in particular, for the band gap and the optical threshold. That is why the methods developped in the previous parts are indeed needed in the study of Cu 2 O. Moreover, existing valence band photoemission experiments did not allow one to detect some of the states found in our and previous bandstructure calculations. However, the experiments were performed on polycrystalline samples and therefore yielded spectra resulting from an integration over the whole Brillouin zone. This was the motivation to apply for beamtime at the synchrotron Elettra in Trieste, Italy together with my collaborators (theoreticians and experimentalists). The purpose was to obtain precise angle-resolved photoemission spectra of the valence states of Cu 2 O. This means k-point resolved information. After a one-week experimental shift at Elettra, an important part of the present work was to compare our state-of-the-art measurements to the theoretical data, taking into account the experimental aspects, as photoemission cross-sections, evaluation of the causes of experimental uncertainties [...] . Indeed, it turned out that a careful comparison of state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches could remove all existing or seeming contradictions, within the remaining uncertainty of the respective approaches. This is a significant part of the present study of the electronic structure of Cu 2 O. This part ends with the calculation of energy-loss and optical absorption spectra of cuprous oxide, the latter being now also in good agreement with experiment. The theories and methods used throughout this text are extensively described in the first part of the manuscript. It seemed important to me to provide an accurate account for the theoretical background, because most of the present work deals with improvements of existing methods, or going beyond some piece of the theory. In order to explain the achievements, one first needs to have clearly in mind the existing grounds. Let me then open this text with the part concerning the theoretical background my work is based on. La structure électronique des cristaux est un nom polymorphe qui couvre une large gamme de propriétés des électrons dans les solides périodiques. Par exemple, il peut se référer à la probabilité de trouver un électron au point r de l'espace, en d'autres termes, à la densité électronique. Il peut faire référence à l'énergie nécessaire pour extraire un électron du matériau, l'énergie d'ionisation, ou encore, le gain énergétique lorsqu'un électron est ajouté au système, l'affinité électronique. Il peut aussi se lire la réponse des électrons du solide à une perturbation externe (un photon ou un électron rapide). Toutes ces propriétés caractérisent la structure électronique du solide. Ils décrivent les aspects bien différents. Certains d'entre eux sont propriétés de l'état, d'autres correspondent à des états excités. Certains d'entre eux de conserver le nombre de particules, d'autres pas. En conséquence, les propriétés qui sont généralement appelés «structure électronique» sont mesurées avec différentes configurations expérimentales, par exemple photoémission directe et inverse, l'absorption optique, de l'énergie d'électrons de perte [...] . Et de manière analogue, la description théorique et la prévision de ces propriétés requièrent cadres distincts. Ce travail de thèse se chargera de la question de la structure électronique de l'oxyde cuivreux, Cu 2 O. Par conséquent, différentes méthodes théoriques seront utilisées et les résultats seront comparés à un large éventail de techniques expérimentales...|$|E
