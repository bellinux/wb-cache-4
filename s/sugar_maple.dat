5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (<b>sugar</b> <b>maple)</b> and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> with those of the red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the <b>sugar</b> <b>maple,</b> and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredient}} in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> or various {{other species of}} maple trees. It consists primarily of sucrose and water, with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the invert sugar created in the boiling process.|$|E
5|$|Leucopholiota decorosa is a {{saprobic}} species, deriving {{nutrients from}} decaying organic matter, particularly the rotting branches and stumps of deciduous trees. One field guide notes {{a preference for}} <b>sugar</b> <b>maple.</b> It grows singly or in bunches, clustered together {{at the base of}} the stem. In Ohio, it typically fruits from late September to mid November.|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} species and sub-species that {{comprise}} North American <b>sugar</b> <b>maples</b> has remained in dispute since their first characterization over 100 years ago. The taxonomic distinctiveness of Acer nigrum (black maples) and A saccharum (<b>sugar</b> <b>maples)</b> has been particularly controversial. An analysis of the nucleotide sequences from a non-coding region of the chloroplast genome of Ohio black and <b>sugar</b> <b>maples</b> suggests that these trees are genetically very similar and do not require separate taxonomic designations...|$|R

2500|$|Climate change {{appears to}} be {{affecting}} the <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> industry. <b>Sugar</b> <b>maples</b> {{have been subject to}} stress by acid rain, asian longhorn beetles, pear thrips, and, in 2011, an excessive deer herd that is forced to eat bark in the winter. These maples need a certain amount of cold to produce sap for maple syrup. The time to tap these trees has shrunk to one week in some years. The tree may be replaced by the more aggressive Norway maples, in effect forcing the <b>sugar</b> <b>maples</b> to [...] "migrate" [...] north to Canada.|$|R
5|$|The lowest {{elevations}} of Pinkham Notch are {{occupied by}} a northern hardwood forest. This forest type is primarily deciduous and consists mostly of <b>sugar</b> <b>maple,</b> American beech, and yellow birch. There is also a proliferation of understory and forest floor plants; common examples include wild sarsaparilla, painted trillium, hobblebush, and Indian cucumber-root.|$|E
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and grows}} on the decaying wood of deciduous and coniferous trees. Host species include white fir (Abies concolor), <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer saccharum) and other maple (Acer) species, grey alder (Alnus oblongifolia), beech (Fagus) species, spruce (Picea) species, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and other pine (Pinus) species, poplar (Populus) and oak (Quercus) species. In temperate North America, specimens are typically collected between July through September.|$|E
5|$|Maple {{products}} are considered emblematic of Canada, in particular Quebec, and are frequently sold in tourist shops and airports as souvenirs from Canada. The sugar maple's leaf {{has come to}} symbolize Canada, and is depicted on the country's flag. Several US states, including New York, Vermont and Wisconsin, have the <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> as their state tree. A scene of sap collection is depicted on the Vermont state quarter, issued in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so that there are now more hardwoods, including <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have {{a high rate of}} biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including <b>sugar</b> <b>maple,</b> bigtooth maple, nolina and Southern live oak.|$|E
5|$|Flora {{along the}} {{northern}} end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).|$|E
50|$|Sugar Creek Township {{is named}} for the Sugar Creek. The name of the creek may refer to either {{the large number of}} <b>sugar</b> <b>maples</b> growing along it, or to the {{sweetness}} of the water.|$|R
50|$|Deciduous trees can include: Quaking aspens (Populus tremuloides), Red oaks (Quercus rubra), Paper birches (Betula papyrifera), American {{mountain}} ash (Sorbus americana), and Red <b>maples</b> (Acer rubrum), <b>Sugar</b> <b>maples</b> (Acer saccharum), and Mountain maples (Acer spicatum).|$|R
50|$|<b>Sugar</b> <b>maples</b> {{engage in}} {{hydraulic}} lift, drawing water from lower soil layers and exuding that water into upper, drier soil layers. This not only benefits the tree itself, but also many other plants growing around it.|$|R
5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of <b>sugar</b> <b>maple,</b> red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E
5|$|The Shickshinny Mountain Slopes, {{which are}} listed as a Locally Significant Area in the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory, {{are located in the}} {{watershed}} of Hunlock Creek in Plymouth Township. These slopes are on the northern side of Shickshinny Mountain and contain second-growth northern hardwood forests and some rock outcroppings with small seeps. The area contains a large number of wildflower species and some rare plants. The main tree species in this area include American basswood, <b>sugar</b> <b>maple,</b> white ash, white oak, black cherry, and eastern hemlock.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota squarrosa {{is thought}} to be a white rot fungus, which use {{cellulose}} as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including <b>sugar</b> <b>maple,</b> red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E
5000|$|This town is New Hampshire's youngest, having {{incorporated}} in 1962 {{out of the}} town of Lisbon after considerable litigation. The name [...] "Sugar Hill" [...] comes from a large grove of <b>sugar</b> <b>maples</b> in the hills.|$|R
50|$|Brown sugar adds {{flavor to}} desserts and baked goods. It can be {{substituted}} for <b>maple</b> <b>sugar,</b> and <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> {{can be substituted}} for it in recipes. Brown sugar caramelizes much more readily than refined sugar, and this effect {{can be used to}} make glazes and gravies brown while cooking.|$|R
50|$|Each March, the SM&NC revives the New England pastime of <b>maple</b> <b>sugaring</b> {{during the}} <b>Maple</b> <b>Sugar</b> Festival Weekend. At the Hecksher Farm sugarhouse, one can view tree tapping, sap collecting, and taste the sweet <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> that ushers {{in the annual}} {{agricultural}} awakening. Other offerings include scavenger hunts, storytellers, face painting, maple-themed crafts, pancake brunch, and a Chef’s Cook-off Challenge.|$|R
5|$|Volvariella bombycina is a {{saprobic}} species. Fruit bodies grow singly or {{in small}} groups on trunks and decayed stumps of dead hardwoods. Favored species include <b>sugar</b> <b>maple,</b> red maple, silver maple, magnolia, mango, beech, oak, and elm. It is often found in clefts and knotholes of dead or living tree trunks. It has been noted to fruit in the same location for several years. Despite its preference for hardwoods, {{it has been reported}} growing on rare instances on coniferous wood. An uncommon species with a wide distribution, it has been reported from Asia (China, India, Korea, Pakistan), the Caribbean (Cuba), Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. It acquired protected status in Hungary in 2005, making it a legal offense to pick it. Variety microspora is known from Venezuela, while V.bombycina var. palmicola occurs in the DR Congo.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{mountain}} stands at only , the {{conditions on the}} summit are a bit harsher than at the bottom, which in consequence causes altitudinal zonation. As the altitude increases, the vegetation passes from <b>sugar</b> <b>maple,</b> bitternut hickory at the base, to northern red oak, <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> on the summit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Maple</b> <b>Sugar</b> Time: For {{two weeks}} every spring, an {{opportunity}} to make <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> is offered.
