30|$|The fungus was {{observed}} to cause stem rot on Sawara cypress Chamaecyparis pisifera (Sieb. & Zucc.) Endl. (Fig.  1 C, D) and Hinoki cypress Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. & Zucc. (Fig.  1 E, F). Imazeki [4] called this disease “Hi-akagare-sei-mizogusare-byo” in Japanese, stem <b>sap</b> <b>rot.</b> Aoshima et al. [5] identified the causal fungus as Fomitiporia punctata (Fr.) Murrill (Phellinus punctatus) and named the fungus from Chiba Prefecture, Japan “Cha-ana-take-modoki” in Japanese. Recently, Hattori et al. [7, 8] morphologically and phylogenetically analyzed the preserved fruiting body and mycelia of this fungus, {{and reported that}} the causal organism was distinct from F. punctata [9 – 11] and was another species of the genus Fomitiporia. Ota et al. [12, 13] reported that the isolated fungus from C. japonica and that from stem rot of C. pisifera form a phylogenetically distinct clade from F. punctata, and discussed that the pathogens on these tree species were possibly conspecific.|$|E
50|$|This {{butterfly}} seldom visits flowers, {{but rather}} feeds on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, salts and minerals from puddling, and dung.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 56-70 mm. The upperside is {{brown with}} dark eyespots at the margins. The underside is light brown. Adults feed on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, carrion and dung.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 59-70 mm. Males have spotted forewings. The upperside is {{brown with}} patches of dark scales along the veins. The underside is tan for {{both males and}} females. Adults feed on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, carrion and dung.|$|R
50|$|Their mother, Hamadryas, is immortalized in {{the name}} of two genera: that of the cracker {{butterfly}}, and that of the northernmost monkey in Asia Minor, the hamadryas baboon. The cracker butterfly is more arboreal than most butterflies, as it commonly camouflages itself on trees. It feeds on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit and dung. The hamadryas baboon is one of the least arboreal monkeys, but was the most common monkey in Hellenic lands.|$|R
5|$|Butterflies feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen, tree <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, {{they do not}} carry as much pollen load as bees, but {{they are capable of}} moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 32-38 mm. The upperside is brown without markings. The underside is also brown, {{but with}} small eyespots rimmed with yellow on both wings. They feed on <b>sap</b> and <b>rotting</b> fruit.|$|R
50|$|An adult has a {{wingspan}} {{of up to}} 8 centimeters. The larva is a {{dark gray}} mottled caterpillar with thick pink-tinted legs and a jumping ability. The adults feed on nectar, <b>sap,</b> and <b>rotting</b> fruit, while the larvae prefer the foliage of several oak species.|$|R
50|$|Larval Diptera feed in leaf-litter, in leaves, stems, roots, {{flower and}} seed heads of plants, moss, fungi, rotting wood, rotting fruit or other organic matter such as slime, flowing <b>sap,</b> and <b>rotting</b> cacti, carrion, dung, {{detritus}} in mammal bird or wasp nests, fine organic material including insect frass and micro-organisms. Many Diptera larvae are predatory, sometimes on the larvae of other Diptera.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 70-86 mm. The upperside is mottled {{brown and}} white {{although there is}} some red in the forewing cell bar. The hindwing eyespots have orange scales preceding black crescents. The underside of the hindwings is white and the submarginal eyespots are composed of a brown ring around a black crescent in a white center. Adults are on wing year round in the tropics and from August to October in southern Texas. They feed on <b>sap</b> and <b>rotting</b> fruit.|$|R
50|$|The {{larval food}} is the foliage of certain native and {{introduced}} tree species. The native species include wattles, Illawarra flame-tree, lacebark or white kurrajong, kurrajong and Celtis species, while the black locust or false acacia is an exotic species {{that is also}} favoured. Adults may feed on the <b>sap</b> of trees, <b>rotting</b> fruit and moisture from dung.|$|R
50|$|Brachyopa insensilis is {{arboreal}} descending {{to visit}} sap runs and flowers (white umbellifers, Photinia, Prunus padus, Sorbus aria The flight period {{is from the}} beginning of May to the end of June.Brachyopa insensilis has a characteristic, rapid, zigzag flight and rarely descends lower than 3 metres from the ground. It may occur in small swarms around sap runs.Larvae feed in <b>sap</b> runs and <b>rot</b> holes.|$|R
