40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the optimization of a micro gas preconcentrator {{based on a}} micro-channel in porous and non-porous <b>silicon</b> <b>filled</b> with an adequate adsorbent. This micro gas preconcentrator is both applicable {{in the fields of}} atmospheric pollution monitoring (Volatil organic compounds—VOCs) and explosives detection (nitroaromatic compounds). Different designs of micro-devices and adsorbent materials have been investigated since these two parameters are of importance in the performances of the micro-device. The optimization of the device and its operation were driven by its future application in outdoor environments. Parameters such as the preconcentration factor, cycle time and the influence of the humidity were considered along the optimization process. As a result of this study, a preconcentrator with a total cycle time of 10 min and the use of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as adsorbent exhibits a good preconcentration factor for VOCs with a limited influence of the humidity.

40|$|We {{have applied}} time-resolved {{terahertz}} (THz) spectroscopy to probe ultrafast conduction dynamics of photoexcited carriers in silicon nanocrystal films {{with a wide}} range of nanocrystal sizes and concentrations. The picosecond THz conductivity reveals microscopic photocarrier motion with significant interface scattering within the nanocrystals, as well as percolative transport between nanocrystals. In films with <b>silicon</b> <b>filling</b> fractions above the percolation threshold, we observe a transition from long-range internanocrystal transport immediately after photoexcitation to increased carrier localization over a 50 -ps time scale due to accumulation of charges at interface defect sites. However, in films with <b>silicon</b> <b>filling</b> fractions below the percolation threshold, transport between nanocrystals is strongly suppressed at all times. Finally, we estimate effective carrier diffusion lengths of 60 to 130 nm for the silicon nanocrystal composites with <b>silicon</b> <b>filling</b> fractions above the percolation threshold, making such films promising candidates for active layers in photovoltaic devices. 9 2011 American Physical Society.

As nowadays almost all modern technologies rely greatly on such crystallized materials, targeting an improved understanding of the convective phenomena which occur in the melt has become a subject of great importance.
