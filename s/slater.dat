40|$|Abstract In {{this note}} I respond to Hartley <b>Slater's</b> {{argument}} [12] tothe e ect {{that there is}} no such thing as paraconsistent logic. <b>Slater's</b> argument trades on the notion of contradictoriness in the attempt to show that the negation of paraconsistent logics is merely a subcontrary forming operator and not one which forms contradictories. I will show that <b>Slater's</b> argument fails, for two distinct reasons. Firstly, the argument does not consider the position of non-dialethic paraconsistency (which rejects the possible truth of any contradictions). Against this position <b>Slater's</b> argument has no bite at all. Secondly, while the argument doesshow that for dialethic paraconsistency (according to which contradictions can be true), certain other contradictions must be true, I show that this need not deter the dialethic paraconsistentist from their position.

5|$|After the Kneitals had {{rejected}} his request for initiation into Gardnerian Wicca, Buczynski met with another Gardnerian high priestess, Patricia Siero, who instead agreed to initiate both him and <b>Slater.</b> Siero herself had been initiated by Fran Fisher, high priestess of a coven located in Louisville, Kentucky, in June 1973, {{who in turn}} had claimed initiation from Rosemary Buckland. The weekend after returning from Kentucky, Siero initiated Buczynski and <b>Slater</b> through all three degrees of the Gardnerian tradition, entitling them to operate as high priests of their own covens. Buczynski decided to do so, founding his own Gardnerian coven with an older German woman named Renate Springer as high priestess that operated in the Brooklyn Heights area. Nevertheless, the Kneitals refused to accept Buczynski's Gardnerian credentials, asserting that Rosemary Buckland had never actually initiated Fran Fischer up to the third degree. As {{a result of the}} Kneitals' claims, the Gardnerian community in the Northeastern United States widely refused to accept the Brooklyn Heights coven as legitimate, and Siero decided to take up the Kneitals' offer for re-initiation; as a result, she disowned the initiations of Buczynski and <b>Slater</b> which she had carried out. Springer was uneasy at the situation, and decided to depose Buczynski from his position as high priest, replacing him with one of her initiates, Gilbert Littlebear.|$|E
