50|$|A {{range of}} unique stone {{furniture}} has been excavated in Skara Brae, a Neolithic village in Orkney, Scotland. The site dates from 3100-2500 BC {{and due to}} a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each house shows {{a high degree of}} sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats, and limpet tanks. The <b>stone</b> <b>dresser</b> was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic Carved Stone Balls also found at the site.|$|E
50|$|It was {{discovered}} in 1984 by Colin Richards. Excavations were conducted between 1986 and 1991, over time revealing the base courses of at least 15 houses. The houses have similarities {{to those of the}} early phase of the better-known settlement at Skara Brae in that they have central hearths, beds built against the walls and <b>stone</b> <b>dressers,</b> but differ in that the houses seem to have been free-standing. The settlement dates back to circa 3000 BC.|$|R
5|$|The Barnhouse Settlement is {{a cluster}} of at least fifteen buildings, {{including}} one {{that may have been}} used for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and <b>stone</b> <b>dressers.</b> There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch. Pottery of the grooved ware type, flints and stone tools have been found, as well as three flakes of pitchstone thought to have come from the Isle of Arran.|$|R
30|$|Massive {{stone masonry}} {{is a very}} complex and expensive. It {{requires}} sophisticated architectural knowledge, highly skilled <b>stone</b> <b>dressers,</b> professional masons, special instruments and a large workforce to move and maneuver the stones [22]. Although this masonry was never common, there are fine examples of it in antiquity [31]. Locally, however, with the exception of Jerusalem, this type of masonry is found only at Qal’at al-Subayba. In ancient time, massive masonry relied heavily upon slave labor. It was abandoned in the early medieval period and replaced by more efficient and less laborious methods. The Mamluks were highly skilled masons [32]. Nevertheless, they did not have the knowledge or the means to utilize this technology. If they did have such skill, as suggested by Hartal [6], there should be examples of massive masonry at other Mamluk sites [15].|$|R
5|$|Skara Brae {{consists}} of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 31002500 BC {{the houses are}} similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large midden containing ash, bones, shells, stone and organic waste. Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from the outside. In each case the <b>stone</b> <b>dressers</b> were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view.|$|R
25|$|Dresser's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} rapidly {{at the end}} of 1905, when he wrote to his sister that he was ill, but gave no details. After his finances finally gave out, Dresser was forced to leave the hotel where he was living and move to his sister's and brother-in-law's home in New York City. Dresser died at their home on January 30, 1906, at 6:23p.m., from a brain hemorrhage. He also suffered from alcoholism, obesity, and depression. A funeral was held in New York City on February 2, but because Dresser died penniless, his remains were held at Calvary Cemetery on Long Island until his funeral bill was paid. On March 19 Dresser's remains were moved to St. Boniface Cemetery in Chicago, where a funeral and final burial took place on November 23, 1907. With no funds to purchase a memorial <b>stone,</b> <b>Dresser's</b> grave remained unmarked until 1922, when the Indiana Society of Chicago had a boulder from the banks of the Wabash River brought to Chicago to mark his burial site.|$|R

50|$|Up {{until the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, men capable of working earned their livelihoods for their families mostly in the many small and few big quarries (hard rock and sandstone) as quarrymen, <b>stone</b> <b>dressers</b> or stonemasons, as craftsmen at the local craft businesses, and also as farmers as their secondary occupation at the many small secondary agricultural operations that were to be found at almost every house in Erdesbach. Mainly it was grain or potatoes that were grown, and mostly for the growers’ own needs. Five full-time farmers lived in the municipality at this time. About 1960, there were still three carpentry businesses in the municipality, along with three building companies, a cabinetry shop, a plasterer’s shop, a blacksmith, a shoemaker’s workshop, two tailor’s shops, an installation shop, four bakeries, two butcher’s shops, a haulage business and a mill. For women in those days, there were no job opportunities in this poor area. They were obliged to do the housekeeping, the childrearing and also some work on the little farms that the men worked as a sideline. Today, members of the workforce are mainly commuters who go to work in the big industrial works in Kaiserslautern, the nearby Saarland or the local middle centres. Early on in the 20th century (1909), Erdesbach got its own centralized waterworks. The system was fed by several walled-up surface wells. After these wells began to run dry in the early 1970s at a time when demand for water was always steadily rising, Erdesbach had to link itself to the “Ohmbachtal” special-purpose association’s water supply {{at the same time as}} the municipality was seeking to expand its new water supply network.|$|R
40|$|The Italian Prealps are {{a natural}} passage between the alpine {{world and the}} Po plain. The {{highlands}} have always been easily reached from the Po plain, especially in the east, thanks to the gentle mountain ridges and the deep north-south valleys. The eastern Italian Prealps have therefore been exploited from historical times {{to the present day}} for many purposes that are typical of a mountain zone: in the area between lake Garda and Brenta river, which is the focus of this paper, charcoal was made from wood, which was also used as building material; a poor agriculture was developed; mining activities were performed; stone quarry workers and <b>stone</b> <b>dressers</b> left remains of open quarries; during 18 th and 19 th centuries, the production of ice became important. The most important activity in the uplands was stock-raising from the 10 th century shepherds have been using the high pastures, crossing the almost impassable woodland belt; during the 18 th and 19 th centuries, cattle husbandry prevailed over sheep rearing. Ethnoarchaeological and archaeological projects have been carried out in the study area in order to detect and document the traces of human activities, especially shepherds and sheep farming. To date, it has been possible to locate hundreds of sheep folds, shepherds’ shelters and breeders’ houses in the uplands; to interview the last shepherds in the lowlands, which turn out to be complementary to the use of uplands for animal breeding; to discover that the most ancient traces of organized human exploitation in the uplands go back to the Bronze Age, while during the Iron Age a change in upland economy is evident, possibly connected with the organization of larger territorial communities and their boundaries; in Roman times the exploitation of uplands seem to be connected with a network of sanctuaries, inherited from the Iron age...|$|R
40|$|Silicosis {{is a form}} of pneumoconiosis. It {{results from}} {{inhalation}} of dust containing crystalline Silica particles of size 0. 5 - 5 microns in diameter. Prevalence of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Silicotics is more common when compared to prevalence in general population. This entity is called Silico-tuberculosis. Study was conducted in Kamla Nehru Chest Hospital attached with Dr. SNMC Jodhpur, among 300 stone mine workers of sand stone mines of Jodhpur with clinico-radiological evidence of Silico-tuberculosis. Workers were divided into 3 categories cutter / driller involved in blasting and cutting <b>stones,</b> <b>dresser</b> engaged in fine work by chisel and Labourer - Loading and Unloading of Stones in Mines. All studied patients were males, majority of cases belong to 21 - 55 years (93 %) age group. Among these cases maximum no. of patients belong to 46 - 50 yr. (18 %) age group. This is the most economically productive age group in India. With increase in duration of exposure from (0 - 20 years) to Silica particles there is increase in the no. of silico-tuberculosis. After 20 year of exposure there is decrease in no. of cases because cases do not survive upto that long period. 137 patients out of 300 cases were confirmed Acid Fast Bacilli positive by smear examination. 123 patients out of 300 cases were bacteriologically confirmed by culture. Out of 123 culture positive cases 66 (53. 65 %) were typical Mycobacteria&amp; 57 (46. 34 %) were Atypical Mycobacterium. M. Kansasii(28), M. Scrofulaceum (9),M. Ulcerans(1) M. Fortuitum (19), When radiological pattern of Typical Mycobacteria cases and Atypical Mycobacterial cases were confirmed compared we found that Cavity with Nodulation, Pleural Reaction, Progressive Massive Fibrosis, Lower Lobe Involvement, Pnemothorax they all were more common in Atypical than Typical Mycobacteria. M. Kansasii predominantly grown in mining area all around the world. Prevalence of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Silicotics is more common when compared to prevalence in general population hence all should use prophylactic measures...|$|R

50|$|For centuries, {{agriculture}} deﬁned people’s {{daily life}} and characterized the village’s image. To this day, the three-layer structure of large, medium and small agricultural operations that held true in Herschweiler-Pettersheim {{right up until the}} middle of the 20th century can still be made out. The predominant system in farming up to that time, which saw the younger generation taking over the day-to-day running of farms when their parents became elderly, and thus offering the parents some security in their old age, could not keep up with the system that became predominant after the Second World War. Younger workers could earn salaries, and industry was altering the economic and social landscape. The undervaluing of agricultural products, too, in comparison with industrial ones steadily thrust farming into rationalization with its consequent growth in farms’ average size, or even forced some people to give farms up and shift to wage-dependent work. Of the 125 farming operations still in business in 1950, which employed 36.8% of the local workforce, only 73 were still in business in 1960. By 1970, this had shrunk to 26, by 1986 to 13 and by 2000 to only 4 run as primary sources of earnings, while a further two were run as secondary sources of earnings, with the trend continuing downwards. Besides agriculture, men and women from Herschweiler-Pettersheim and the surrounding area could seek their livelihoods at the hard-stone quarries on the Steinkopf and the Hühnerrech, which had been opened as early as 1832 and were not shut down for good until 1972, as quarrymen, <b>stone</b> <b>dressers,</b> pitmen, <b>stone</b> chippers and hauliers. The municipality, too, proﬁted from tenancies and tax revenues. Earning great importance after the First World War were the local diamond-cutting workshops that arose in the area around Brücken, about 4 km south of Herschweiler-Pettersheim and the hub of the Palatine diamond-cutting industry, which gave rise to an economic upswing. The groundwork for this blossoming industry was laid for Herschweiler-Pettersheim in 1908 by Christian Schultheiß, who came from the German centre for diamond processing in Hanau, and who had been recruited in 1887-1888 by Isidor Dreyfuß for the newly founded diamond-cutting workshop at the Neumühle (“New Mill”) between Ohmbach and Brücken. Further growth was cut short only a few years later when the First World War broke out, but this was only a temporary setback, and work began again in 1923. The industry’s promising development was again cut short in October 1929 when the stock markets in the USA crashed and the Great Depression struck the industrialized world. Since demand for diamonds was now very slight and since rough stones were now hard to come by anyway, many diamond cutters were out of work for weeks or even longer. Once the National Socialists had seized power, though, the situation did not improve at ﬁrst. The Nazi boycott of Dutch and Belgian diamond dealers, brought about by the persecution of Jews in Germany, forced 13 of the 14 local independent diamond-cutting businesses to shut up shop in 1933, with the remaining one cutting back on the amount of business that it did. Low production costs due to the Nazi state’s subsidies, and the high quality standard, made the boycott ineffective, so that the business reached a peak in 1935. Of the 3,500 people then working in the 150 businesses in the Palatine diamond industry, 197 diamond cutters were working at 23 diamond-cutting workshops in Herschweiler-Pettersheim. With the outbreak of the Second World War, almost all these businesses were shut down. After currency reform in 1948 (the introduction of the Deutsche Mark), the diamond-cutting industry came back to life. Between 1950 and 1960, Herschweiler-Pettersheim had roughly 30 such businesses, and even as many as 50 until 1972. Even so, as early as 1957, business was suffering from quickly shrinking earnings. It was actually in 1972 that all work in the industry ceased, the industry’s fate sealed by competition from countries with lower labour costs. All that can be seen of the industry today in Herschweiler-Pettersheim is the former diamond-cutting workshop buildings, recognizable from their great lattice windows. When the rich coal deposits on the Saar started a boom in the coal and iron industry, workers from Herschweiler-Pettersheim, too, found jobs there as miners and ironworkers. About 1890, young people set off on foot in great throngs, walking far, to the new workplaces in the Frankenholz and Neunkirchen mines and at the ironworks. Once there, they worked the whole week through, stayed in dormitories, and returned home on Sunday. With a knapsack full of potato wafﬂes to keep themselves warm during the work week, they set off back to their jobs on Sunday evening. The women took care of farming, the children herded the cows and goats on common land. Until the time after the Second World War, many people still worked their land as a secondary occupation as worker-farmers or retired miners. First and foremost, the Bergmannskühe (literally “miner’s cows”; that is to say, goats) helped worker families out of the grimmest neediness after the war. After the fall of the ironworking industry and the closure of many collieries in the Saarland in the last fourth of the 20th century in the face of stiff foreign competition, many workers switched to the processing and ﬁnishing industry in the Homburg and Kaiserslautern area. The old adage “nothing is as constant as change”, however, applies here, too. With the growing shift of cost-intensive production facilities about the turn of the millennium to countries with low labour costs, the economic outlook for the Saarland and the Western Palatinate is rather more bleak than rosy. Also grave was the decline of craft occupations beginning about 1970. The vocations of blacksmith, shoemaker, tailor, painter and cabinetmaker fell victim to industrial output. Even those of baker and butcher met the same fate in the late 20th century. Of the three bakeries and two butcher’s shops of the postwar era, only the Leixner butcher’s shop was still in business in 2000. All other goods were sold by foreign ﬁrms in local branch locations. Wars, suppression of freedom of thought and economic need are also reﬂected in population ﬁgures. The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) almost emptied Herschweiler and Pettersheim of people. In 1670, only ﬁve families came back. Into the almost thoroughly depopulated Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken came new settlers from various parts of Germany, but foremost in number were those who came from Switzerland. During French King Louis XIV’s wars of conquest, several more Pettersheim farmers were killed on 5 December 1675 when the Homburg Garrison was attacked. There was great loss of life among the local population, too, in the First World War (1914-1918), in which 24 local men fell, and in the Second World War (1939-1945), in which 67 local men fell and 29 went missing. Economic distress and a lack of future prospects have also made some locals turn their backs on their homeland and seek their fortune in faraway lands. As early as 1709, and again later in 1742, citizens from Herschweiler and Pettersheim took part in the ﬁrst great wave of emigration from southwestern Germany to the New World and settled in Pennsylvania, “America’s Palatinate”. Beginning in 1765, some accepted Empress Empress Maria Theresia’s and Emperor Joseph II’s offer of settlement in the southeast of their empire. Thus, in 1765, Jakob Hederich, who was born in Pettersheim, cropped up in the records as working in Bačka and the Banat as a teacher and a preacher along with Friedrich and Christian Schneider. Only at the beginning of Bavarian times in 1816 did the numbers of people emigrating to North America rise again. In 1816, the Year Without a Summer, bad grain harvests along with their attendant unpleasant consequences led ten local day-labourer families with all together 51 persons to emigrate. Between 1833 and 1854, six individual villagers and 45 families with one to ten children left the village to seek new lives elsewhere. During this time, far more than 200 persons, smallhold farmers, day labourers and craftsmen may have left Herschweiler-Pettersheim, which is reﬂected in stagnating, and even shrinking, population ﬁgures. From 1833 to 1883, the American state of Ohio was a target of local emigrants; a West Palatine colony of sorts was forming there about 1840. Three poor families wanted to emigrate to Algeria, but could not obtain approval because they did not have enough money to make the trip.|$|R
