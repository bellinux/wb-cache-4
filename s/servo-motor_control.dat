The board improves the performance of this inexpensive hardware in many applications that involve feedback control. We discuss the use of this hardware in a simple <b>servo-motor</b> <b>control</b> experiment that demonstrates many of the fundamentals of digital signal processor control of physical plants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A <b>servo-motor</b> <b>control</b> {{system of}} robot based on ARM 9 {{processor}} and LM 629 are introduced. With {{the features of}} fewer electronic components, stable performance and higher real-time, the system greatly simplifies software and hardware design of the motor servo control system. The experimental {{results show that the}} system has high accuracy and stability relatively and the system design is reasonable and feasible...|$|E
40|$|Evolutionary {{algorithms}} {{are applied}} to the on- line generation of <b>servo-motor</b> <b>control</b> systems. In this paper, the evolving population of controllers is evaluated at run-time via hardware in the loop, rather than on a simulated model. Disturbances are also introduced at run-time in order to pro- duce robust performance. Multiobjective optimisation of both PI and Fuzzy Logic controllers is considered. Finally an on-line implementation of Genetic Programming is presented based around the Simulink standard blockset. The on-line designed controllers are shown to be robust to both system noise and ex- ternal disturbances while still demonstrating excellent steady- state and dvnamic characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Rotary chair {{testing is}} used to {{quantify}} progress of central vestibulo compensation after peripheral-vestibulo defects. This is important when studying the progress of vestibular compensation and when giving an expert opinion on the employability of a patient if vestibular compensation has been achieved. Servo motor controlled rotational chairs are too expensive {{for this type of}} diagnostic testing. A very cost eficient alternative is to manually rotate a standard otolaryngology examination chair. 30 subjects were rotated at 0, 1 and 0, 2 Hz (max. chairspeed 50 °/s, max. Amplitud 79 ° / 39 °) on a <b>servo-motor</b> <b>controlled</b> rotational chair made by Toennies. The resulting nystagmus was measured with a video-oculographic system (SMI®). The chair velocity was measured using a perrotational angel velocity sensor (Watson Industries) that was attached to the goggles of the video-oculographic system. For manual rotational testing a standard otolaryngology examination chair was used. The operator could apply the 0, 1 and 0, 2 Hz rotational frequencies via a visual metronome. Through manual rotation, differences in acceleration and chair velocity occur. Therefore mathematical algorithems are applied to measure and compensate these differences. The data (SPV and chair velocity) of both rotational tests were analyzed and compared using five different mathematical algorithems (MathCad®). The actual manual rotational frequency was measured using fouriertransformation. Data analysis of all five algorithems in the student&# 900;s t-test showed no significant differences between manual and <b>servo-motor</b> <b>controlled</b> rotational testing. When determining the correlation between the manual and the <b>servo-motor</b> <b>controlled</b> rotational test data of all five algorithems, {{it turned out that the}} algorithem analyzing the speed-curve-area had the highest correlation. The algorithems analysing phaseshift and curve-regression had the lowest correlation. Manual rotational testing using these five algorithems to analyse and compensate occuring side differences, shows no significant differences to <b>servo-motor</b> <b>controlled</b> rotational testing. This method can be considered a cost effective alternative to expensive <b>servo-motor</b> <b>controlled</b> rotational test batteries, as long as the described algorithems are employed to compensate occuring side differences during manual rotational testing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} obtain the loading {{characteristics}} of magnetic particle brake (MPB) in rotary system, the <b>servo-motor</b> <b>controlling</b> and testing experimental platform is used to research MPB loading characteristics. The key step is designing different experiments that include static loading experiment, step loading experiment, and tracking loading experiment. Based on the static experiment data, the MPB static property presents hysteresis which is described appropriately {{in the way of}} piecewise fitting. The response time in step experiment is longer in upward section than in downward section and it has no relation with the speed of MPB by lucubrating step experiment data. Phase difference is relevant to input current excitation frequency after analyzing tracking experiment data. The loading characteristic of MPB is closely relation to the MPB velocity which is proposed in rotary loading system. When the input current doesn’t change, the output torque increases along with the rotary speed increasing. Also, this paper provides reference materials for improving the loading precision, mathematics modeling, and hysteresis compensation...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} discusses {{technical and}} growth relevant aspects of using laser techniques for weed control. The research on thermal weed control via laser first {{focused on the}} interaction of laser beams and weed plants. Due to preliminary studies, a CO 2 -laser was selected for further studies {{with regard to the}} process factors laser energy, laser spot area, coverage of the weeds meristem, weed species (Amaranthus retroflexus), and weed growth stage. Thereby, the laser damage was modeled in order to control the necessary laser output power online. Furthermore, the beam positioning leading to an effective damaging of the weeds was investigated and a test device was designed. With the aid of contemporary image processing algorithms for weed recognition and meristem determination, a laser and <b>servo-motor</b> <b>control</b> was developed. Most of the studies presented in this paper were part of the project “Investigations on laser light affected weed control of juvenile plants with the aid of image processing” funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft...|$|E

Hydraulic cylinders are, in fact, without competition for linear forces. For these cylinders, hydraulic systems will remain of interest and if such a system is available, it is easy and logical to use this system for the rotating drives of the cooling systems, also.|$|R
50|$|The WSUR core {{consists}} of a rectangular aluminum box suspended from a movable bridge structure. Surrounding the core is a 242,000 liter pool of high purity deionized light water, which is used as both a coolant, shield, and moderator. Inside the core box there is a bottom grid-plate into which 3 and 4-rod clusters of TRIGA fuel sit separated by boron-aluminum (Boral) control elements. These control elements are raised out of the core via <b>servo-motors</b> to <b>control</b> reactor power. Power is monitored via three different and independent detectors that sit inside the core structure; there is a compensated ion chamber, an uncompensated ion chamber, and a fission chamber {{in three of the}} four corners of the grid box.|$|R

50|$|Elmer Sperry and Hewitt served {{together}} on the Naval Consulting Board, where they both {{were members of the}} Committee on Aeronautics and Aeronautical Motors. Because of these connections, they were able to arrange for a representative of the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance, Lt. T. S. Wilkinson, to examine the control equipment they assembled. The system consisted of a gyroscopic stabilizer, a directive gyroscope, an aneroid barometer to regulate height, <b>servo-motors</b> for <b>control</b> of rudders and ailerons, and a device for distance gearing. These all could be installed in an airplane which could be catapulted or flown from the water, and would climb to a predetermined altitude, fly a pre-set course, and after traveling a pre-set distance, drop its bombs or dive to the ground. Wilkinson reported that the weapon did not possess a degree of accuracy sufficient to hit a ship, but, because of its range of 50 to 100 mi, it might be of interest to the Army.|$|R
30|$|The one-part foam type robot has {{a single}} tilted foam {{canister}} on the body part, which can eject foam vertically downward through a φ 6.5 mm silicon tube. The foam ejection is <b>controlled</b> by a <b>servo-motor</b> (Dynamixel MX- 28, Robotis Corp.), where the motor pushes the trigger of the canister. We incorporated a shut-off mechanism {{at the tip of}} the nozzle, because foam curing occurs in the ejection nozzle. The shut-off mechanism is implemented by a slide-rail action, whereby the silicone tube becomes flat. The slide-rail is linked to the ejection <b>control</b> <b>servo-motor,</b> and shuts down the tube according to the motor rotation. We can therefore realize both a shutdown and ejection mechanism using a single motor by this mechanism.|$|R
30|$|A 6 °-of-freedom (DOF) {{robotic system}} was {{utilized}} in the study. The system {{consisted of a}} velocity-control 6 -axis manipulator (custom-designed) with a universal force/moment sensor (UFS) (SI– 660 – 60, ATI Industrial Automation, NC, USA) and a control computer (Windows XP; Microsoft, WA, USA) linked with a high-speed motion network (Mechatrolink-II; Yaskawa Electric, Fukuoka, Japan) (Fujie et al. 1993; Fujie et al. 1996; Fujie et al. 2004). The manipulator had two mechanisms: the upper mechanism attached to the UFS and the lower one. The upper mechanism was linked to two translational-axis actuators (SGDS- 01 F 12 A; Yaskawa Electric, Fukuoka, Japan) and three rotational-axis actuators (HA– 800 B– 3 A; Harmonic Drive Systems, Tokyo, Japan), while the lower one was linked to one translational-axis actuator. All the actuators were powered by AC <b>servo-motors.</b> The <b>control</b> computer in a graphical language programming environment (LabView 8.6. 1; National Instruments, TX, USA) operated the program to control both the position of and the force/moment acting on the knee joint. The system could manipulate a natural three-dimensional (3 D) motion of the knee, prescribing the force/moment acting on a joint except for the operator’s intended direction at zero, by calculating acquired data of the position and the force/moment. The manipulator had a position accuracy of[*]±[*] 0.003  mm in translation and[*]±[*] 0.002 ° in rotation; the clamp-to-clamp stiffness was more than 319  N/mm in translation and more than 84.6 Nmm/° in rotation (Fujie et al. 2013). Iteration of data acquisition, kinematic and kinetic calculation, and motion of actuator were performed {{at a rate of}} 20  Hz.|$|R
40|$|A {{person with}} a {{moderate}} or severe motor disability will often use specialised or adapted tools to assist their interaction with a general environment. Such tools can assist with the movement of a person's arms so as to facilitate manipulation, can provide postural supports, or interface to computers, wheelchairs or similar assistive technologies. Designing such devices with programmable stiffness and damping may offer a better means for the person to have effective control of their surroundings. This paper addresses the possibility of designing some assistive technologies using impedance elements that can adapt to the user and the circumstances. Two impedance elements are proposed. The first, based on magnetic particle brakes, allows control of the damping coefficient in a passive element. The second, based on detuning the P-D controller in a <b>servo-motor</b> mechanism, allows <b>control</b> of both stiffness and damping. Such a mechanical impedance can be modulated to the conditions imposed by the task in hand. The limits of linear theory are explored and possible uses of programmable impedance elements are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the large}} variety of {{products}} in small batch sizes, a modern machining shop floor requires an advanced real-time control system able to both monitor all the features and adapt the manufacturing system to the rapid changes of production capability and functionality. This is especially true when the shop floors are combined with the e-Manufacturing concept. e-Manufacturing is a transformation system which enables the manufacturing operations to achieve a predictive near-zero-downtime performance {{as well as to}} synchronize with the management systems through the use of infotronics technologies (i. e., wireless connections, web applications, networking systems, etc.). In recent years, the impact of web-oriented technologies has added “velocity” to the design, manufacturing, and aftermarket service of a product. Today’s competition in manufacturing industry depends not only on lean manufacturing but also on the ability to provide customers with total solution and life-cycle costs for sustainable value. Companies are always under a high pressure to improve their efficiency in terms of product development, operations, and resource utilization with a transparent visibility of production and quality control. However, a highly efficient infrastructure, able to integrate all the parts of an automated equipment together and to link them to the e-Manufacturing, is still not available. The objective of this research is to develop an appropriate methodology with open architecture for real-time monitoring and remote control of some networked CNC machines. A new enabling technology is therefore urgently required in order to bring traditional CNC machine tools on-line with combined monitoring and control capability. Without it, the advanced factory automation will hardly have the possibility to become practical in the next generation distributed manufacturing shop floor environments. Thanks to the availability of low cost and Open Source CNC systems, it is currently possible to use CNC technology even in very simple and small production environment. The milestone of this research is EMC 2, a Linux CNC-executable control program, freely downloadable on the Internet, able to <b>control</b> <b>servo-motors,</b> stepper motors, robots and other automated devices. It allows CNC machine users to manage a numerical control machine from the parallel port of an even low-performing PC. It provides motion planning with cutter radius compensation, tool length offsets, and constant velocity control. It also have support for non-Cartesian motion systems. This includes hexapods (Stewart platforms and similar concepts) and systems with rotary joints to provide motion. In order to remotely manage a EMC 2 based CNC machine, a computer remote control of a milling station has been realised in two different configurations: thanks to a webcam pointed on the working table, the remote computer shows the milling machine movements. The first configuration uses an SSH client and server - indeed it is possible to install them not only on a great number of such UNIX versions as Linux and Mac OS X, but also on Windows. The second one uses a remote text shell (like telnet) and three different methods to broadcast images. The structure is based on a server running Linux (Ubuntu 8. 04) on which EMC 2 is installed. Thanks to a TCP/IP network, the server connects many CNC machines; moreover users are able to connect their computer to the server and to control CNC machines by using a wireless LAN. Some tests have been performed by using different computers (also a brand new netbook) in order to verify the real efficiency of the structure. The remote programs can be seen on separated windows: this way users are able to open multiple windows at the same time, one with EMC 2 and the other with the webcam image visualisation program. In this aim, a suitable software which is able to send images to a server by an ordinary Internet browser has been selected. This {{has proven to be a}} more than satisfactory solution as far as image quality and fluency are concerned. Moreover, it gives the users an opportunity to visualise webcam images on different computers at the same time, if they are in network. EMC 2 remote control could result to be an interesting tool, as an example in all those case when, for safety reasons, the operator cannot closely follow either the operations or the manufacturing; such an idea is made realer when we think about the chance to command robots by EMC 2. It can also be applied to rapid fabrication, offsite NC machining training, and distant trouble-shooting, in addition to remote real-time monitoring and control. This network has demonstrated its efficiency not only in the production, but also in the educational field, where it is very important to train students by practical sessions as long as possible. Due to the high costs of CNC equipment, there’s a need to share it among the students. Since the training sessions of the courses are limited to a few hours per week, it is crucial to share every resource and make them available as long as possible. A very important target of this project is to put engineering students in a position to access and use CNC machines from remote places. As a matter of fact, students can connect their computer (usually a laptop with a wireless broadband connection) to the server, transfer their NC file, simulate it within a virtual test environment and schedule a machining session using the real CNC machine. Thanks to the developed environment, it is possible to remotely control the machine and visualize the machining session via an ordinary webcam...|$|R
