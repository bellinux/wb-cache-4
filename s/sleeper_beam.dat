Except for the work of Vedaraman et al. [19], there is very limited information available to produce biodiesel using Sal oil. Moreover, the use of ion-exchange resin catalyst was limited to the synthesis of biodiesel.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{a unique}} Belyana barge, {{which was built}} in the Nizhny Novgorod region for several centuries. Belyana as a type of vessels was designed for transportation of logs, <b>sleepers,</b> <b>beams,</b> planks and other forest products from the Upper to the Lower Volga. Originally, the center of Belyana construction was the village of Baki, which was situated on the Vetluga River, a tributary of the Volga River. The Belyana construction technique spread from the Vetluga river banks further to Nizhny Novgorod, and then to Perm region. Almost all aspects of Belyana construction starting from the logging finishing with its floating to the lower Volga, and also cost of transported products in the prices of the XIX century are disclosed. Due to Belyana is truly a popular invention, it was built by traditional methods, relying solely on the centuries-old experience. Any drawings for the construction never existed, that’s why the author relied on preserved photographs and drawings in the historical reconstruction of this unique vessel. At the beginning of the article a brief overview of the geographical location of Nizhny Novgorod, as well as the names of wooden ships which were sailing on Volga and its tributaries in the same times with Belyana are given.

40|$|Purpose. The {{deficit of}} {{permanent}} way (PW) material elements {{leads to a}} revision of the re-use of old serviceable object after their replacement or repair. As {{an example is the}} following fact, that after the wear in the under-rail area of wooden <b>sleepers</b> and <b>beams,</b> or other defects that prevent their further exploitation, there is an acute issue of their planned replacement. Usually, the required minimum margin of sleepers is always in the track service brigades. As for the wooden beams the length of which in the turnouts is up to 5 m, there is not always possible quickly replace them {{due to the lack of}} size in the short term. Therefore, the geometric dimensions of the connect elements of the two halves of the <b>beams</b> or <b>sleepers</b> in a single rigid structure were proposed and justified and its characteristics do not differ from solid beam. Methodology. The authors considered the calculation algorithm of wooden elements connection and mathematical models that describe the elastic properties of base. The most adequate technique that fully characterizes the interactions beam in the form of a beam of finite length on the ballast was determined. Findings. The qualitative and quantitative verification of the results showed a very good agreement between the values of bending moments, shear forces and deflections that were obtained by the finite difference method (FDM) and the analytical method. It gives the reason to believe that the received geometric dimensions of nag connection can be recommended to employees of track facilities to connect the wooden sleepers on the switches and crossovers. Originality. The nag connection geometrical sizes of two wooden <b>sleepers</b> in the <b>beam</b> for using on switches were substantiated. Practical value. The proposed joint design allows re-using of renovated old wooden sleepers and bars. This design can be applied not only for the connection of conventional wooden <b>sleepers</b> in the <b>beam</b> of desired length, but also to create the halves of a single sleeper designs for lightly loaded sections of the station and access routes...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{a railway}} turnout system {{when one of}} the sleepers is replaced with a fibre composites sleeper is analyzed to simulate the spot replacement maintenance strategy. In the analysis, the rails and the sleepers are modeled as a simplified three dimensional grillage beam system with the <b>sleepers</b> as <b>beams</b> on elastic foundation. The most critical sleepers in the railway turnout system were assigned with a modulus of elasticity (MOE) of 4 GPa while keeping the elastic modulus of the other sleepers the same. The analysis showed that a spot replacement sleeper with a low MOE leads to a lowering overall stiffness of the railway track. It resulted in a reduction in the bending moment and shear and an increase in the vertical deflection of the sleeper directly under the rail seat load. Results also showed that a spot replacement sleeper material with an MOE of 4 GPa will distribute the load evenly in the neighboring timber sleepers. ...|$|R

30|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{research}} of Remington and Witting, Thompson et al. [47, 48, 49] conducted many studies on a track–bridge vibration model. Under that model, first, the bridge combined with the track was considered as an infinitely long Euler–Bernoulli beam with continuous elastic support. Then, the continuous elastic support was replaced by a fixed equivalent point support (i.e., two layers of continuous elastic support were modeled). Finally, discrete point supports were inserted between the track and the bridge to account for the random distribution of support stiffness, <b>sleeper</b> space, and <b>beam</b> mass. This model was used to study problems related to steel-bridge noise and validated SEA for calculation of low-frequency bridge-borne noise. The results showed that SEA is applicable for calculation of sound radiation above 40  Hz and that sound radiation calculation results below 40  Hz can be inaccurate.|$|R
40|$|Analytical and {{finite element}} {{solutions}} to the problem of a vibrating beam on an elastic foundation are presented. An application example is a concrete railway sleeper embedded in an elastic medium (the ballast). The sleeper is also elastically connected to the rails. Eigenfrequencies are calculated and vibration modes are discussed. The <b>beam</b> (<b>sleeper)</b> is divided into sections where each section {{may or may not be}} supported by the elastic foundation. The elastic connections to the rails are situated at the two joinings of the three sleeper sections. Some conclusions are that Euler-Bernoulli beam theory can be used to calculate two, or maximum three, eigenfrequencies of the sleeper. The foundation stiffness influences the lowest bending-mode eigenfrequency the most; higher eigenfrequencies are practically unaffected by the foundation stiffness. The influence of railpad (and rail) stiffness on the sleeper eigenfrequencies is negligible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} {{stability}} problem of {{continuous welded rail}} (short for CWR) on bridge in the small radius curve section, a sleeper connector structure was proposed, {{which is used to}} connect sleepers together and strengthen the stability of CWR. A FEM model was established to study the effect of the CWR stability strengthening scheme. This study result shows that the integrity of the track structure and the stability of CWR in the small radius curve section of which the radius is from 250 m to 600 m will be both improved by the strengthening scheme, and the larger the curve radius is, the better the CWR stability improvement will be. In order to guarantee the strength of sleeper connector and connecting bolt, it is suggested that the <b>sleeper</b> connectors at <b>beam</b> gaps should not be connected, and small resistance fasteners should be used in strengthening area...|$|R
40|$|The {{classic and}} {{reinforced}} railway track {{is composed of}} two infinite rails separated from sleepers by visco-elastic pads. There are numerous assumptions leading to different simplifications in railway track modelling. The rails are modelled as infinite Timoshenko <b>beams,</b> <b>sleepers</b> by lumped masses or elastic bodies and ballast as a visco-elastic foundation. Nowadays the interest of engineers {{is focused on the}} Y-shaped sleepers. The fundamental qualitative difference between the track with classic or Y sleepers is related to local longitudinal symmetric or antymetric features of railway track. The sleeper spacing influences the periodicity of elastic foundation coefficient, mass density (rotational inertia) and shear effective rigidity. The track with classical concrete sleepers is influenced much more by rotational inertia and shear deflections than the track with Y sleepers. The increase of elastic wave velocity in track with Y sleepers and more uniform load distribution will be proved by the analysis and simulations. The analytical and numerical analysis allows us to evaluate the track properties in a range of moderate and high speed train. However, the correct approach is not simple, since the structure of the track interacts with wheels, wheelsets, boogies and vehicles, depending on the complexity of the analysis. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three main parts: The first part that uses classic track models {{as a basis for}} further developments, the second part that deals with constitutive behaviour of granular materials and the third part that describes {{the development of a new}} triaxial cell apparatus and the testing of a ballast material using this apparatus. The description of classic track models is focused on the beam-on-elastic-foundation model (abbr. BOEF model), which make use of the Winkler foundation, and a simple beam element model with linear discrete support. The shortcomings of the BOEF model is discussed: It assumes a continuous foundation, a continuously welded track, the weight of the track ladder is not incorporated, linear support which imply prediction of tension in the uplift regions, no shear deformation in the rails is taken into account, it cannot predict stresses and strains within the granular layers. While some of the shortcomings may easily be incorporated others are not: Especially to remove tension in the uplift zones, and to calculate stresses and strains in the granular layers. The latter actually requires a continuum approach. A track model that approximately eliminates the tension in the uplift regions has been developed for a single axle load. As expected, the model shows that the length of the uplift zone and the amount of uplift have higher values than predicted by the BOEF model. The model may be useful when considering contact problems in the track, for instance in a buckling-of-rails analysis. For the BOEF model a tool that makes use of dimensionless sensitivity diagrams has been developed. The method will in an easy way provide the new maximum track reactions when one or more track parameters are changed. It is hoped that this tool will prove very helpful in a design process, at least as a first step. Dimensionless sensitivity diagrams have been worked out for rail deflection, rail moment, rail seat load, tensional rail base stress and vertical stress between sleeper and ballast. The parameters considered are the design wheel load, rail moment of inertia, position of neutral axis in the rail, sleeper spacing, sleeper width and the length of the sleeper that carries the vertical load. The dimensionless sensitivity diagrams for the BOEF model may be used both for a single axle load and for a double axle load. Also for a beam element model with linear discrete support the dimensionless sensitivity diagrams may be used, but only for a single axle load which is located directly above one of the supports, i. e. a <b>sleeper.</b> For the <b>beam</b> element model the diagrams for the rail deflection, rail seat load and vertical stress between sleeper and ballast are almost identical to the ones for the BOEF model, while the diagrams for the rail moment and tensile rail base stress are somewhat different. A beam element model with Euler-Bernoulli beam elements resting on nonlinear discrete supports was developed for a single axle load. The discrete supports, which were located at the sleeper positions, were modelled by a two-parameter power function. The model takes advantage of a measured load-deflection relationship, which is also modelled by a two-parameter power function. These latter parameters are generally found by regression of the measured data, while the two parameters for the discrete supports are found as part of the overall solution to the problem. The present version of the model only takes into account a short track section and further development of the model is therefore needed. The track ladder weight and a no tension option in the uplift region are not incorporated in the present version. The model is useful when the BOEF model cannot be used because of nonlinear track response. Regarding constitutive behaviour it is argued that the plastic strain per load cycle in a well functioning railway track must be very small and normally below 1 / 100 000 of the elastic strain per load cycle. If also the hysteresis of the material during a load cycle is small, then an elastic approximation could be justified when it comes to calculating the stresses. The plastic strains may then be detached from the stress-strain calculation and modelled separately on the basis of laboratory or field measurements. Several elastic constitutive models are described: The Hooke's law generalised to three dimensions, the cross anisotropic elastic model, two versions of the k-model, and two hyperelastic models. The general elasto-plastic framework with isotropic hardening is also described. The basics of repeated loading of a frictional system is described by analogy to a simple model with springs and frictional sliders. This model can be viewed as the basis for the pure kinematic multisurface model by Mróz and Iwan. Through energy considerations in cyclic loading of the frictional system the concept of reclaimed plastic strain is rejected. The concept of initial stresses and strains is discussed. It is argued that initial stresses cannot be large in the upper part of a road or railway embankment. The main reason for this is that granular materials cannot self equilibrate stresses through tension. The development and construction of triaxial equipment for testing railway ballast in its original grading is described. The specimens are 300 mm by 600 mm (diameter by height). A new and direct way of applying the confining load was developed, which allowed faster variation of the confining stress. A new instrumentation concept was invented where instrumentation rings are fastened to material particles instead of being attached to the outer membrane or to plugs embedded in the material. This arrangement measures the horizontal deformation. The vertical deformation has to be measured over the whole specimen length as resilient particle rotations prevented on-sample instrumentation. A test series on Vassfjell railway ballast was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the new apparatus and to characterise the ballast material. The overall performance of the apparatus was found to be good with a reliable repeatability, but some modifications were suggested to improve the loading procedure in the beginning of the load steps. The test series on Vassfjell ballast was rather limited and no advanced modelling of the results was found to be appropriate. Instead an isotropic linear elastic approach was followed. Moisture was added, to the natural retention capacity, to some of the specimens. It was found that the added moisture only slightly affected the mechanical behaviour of the material. A somewhat denser grading was also tested, but the observed effect on the material properties was limited. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
