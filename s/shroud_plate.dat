40|$|A flow {{straightener}} has {{been incorporated into}} a rotary liquid separator that originally comprised an inlet tube, a <b>shroud</b> <b>plate,</b> an impeller, an inner drum, an outer drum, a housing, a pitot tube, and a hollow shaft motor. As {{a consequence of the}} original geometry of the impeller, shroud, inner drum, and hollow shaft, swirl was created in the airflow inside the hollow shaft during operation. The swirl speed was large enough to cause a significant pressure drop. The {{flow straightener}} consists of vanes on {{the back side of the}} <b>shroud</b> <b>plate.</b> These vanes compartmentalize the inside of the inner drum in such a way as to break up the flow path and thereby stop the air from swirling; as a result, the air enters the hollow shaft with a predominantly axial velocity instead of a swirl. Tests of the rotary liquid separator at an airflow rate of 10 cu ft/min (0. 0047 cu m/s) revealed that the dynamic pressure drop was 8 in. of water (approx. = 2 kPa) in the absence of the flow straightener and was reduced to 1 in. of water (approx. = 0. 25 kPa) in the presence of the flow straightener...|$|E

50|$|Core shrouds crack {{because the}} heat from the nuclear {{reactions}} combined with the constant flowing water eventually wear out the steel plates. One method used to fix this problem is reinforcing the core <b>shroud</b> <b>plates.</b> This is done using an anchor bolt, which is used to attach additional steel plates to the core shroud surface, thereby reinforcing the structure. This is the most common method used to fix cracks in the core shroud since it is easy and relatively safe. Replacement of the core shroud is also an option, but it is not recommended because the cracked plates must be removed manually, leaving the laborers susceptible to radiation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{approved}} Natural convection {{liquid cooling}} from three uniformly heated protruding elements, simulating evenly spaced, ver-tical, plate-mounted electronic components facing an oppos-ing unheated plate within an enclosure maintained at con-stant temperature, was numerically investigated. Two-dimensional coupled conduction and natural convection gov-erning equations were solved, based upon finite control volumes {{for a wide}} range of Rayleigh numbers. Dielectric liquids, including distilled water, FC- 75, and ethylene glycol, were employed as coolants for a Prandtl number range from 5. 9 to 103. Modified channel Rayleigh numbers and channel Rayleigh numbers from 104 to 1010, based on five channel spacing to vertical plate height ratios (b /h), respectively, 0. 2, 0. 267, 0. 333, 0. 4, and 0. 5, were ana-lyzed. Redacted for Privacy Protruding surface temperatures of the uniformly heated elements were lowest for water, followed by ethylene glycol, and were highest for FC- 75. Three distinct flow patterns were observed for the protruding heated channels: reversed flows due to the effect of circulation at the top portion of the enclosure, relatively high velocity flows at the front of the heated elements, and relatively weak flows adjacent to the unheated <b>shrouding</b> <b>plate.</b> Optimum channel spacing to height ratios were analyzed to determine effective temperature reductions for the pro-truding heated surfaces. For water, FC- 75, and ethylene glycol, subject to varied heat input levels, optimal ratios were, respectively, 0. 333, 0. 4, and greater than 0. 4. The most favorable correlations of protruding vertical channels for all cooling liquids combined were an...|$|R
40|$|Space Simulation Tests are {{performed}} in spacecraft {{in order to}} verify equipment proper operation under thermal vacuum conditioning and to verify the correct workmanship in the assembling of the flight spacecraft as a whole. This paper presents the space simulation (thermal vacuum test) developed in the China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite, Flight Model no. 2, that {{took place at the}} Integration and Tests Laboratory â€“ LIT, INPE. Measuring approximately 1. 8 x 2. 0 x 2. 2 m, weighting 1, 500 kg and carrying three cameras as the main payload, this spacecraft is scheduled to be launched in China. The spacecraft was installed in the 3 x 3 m space simulation chamber and the tests run 24 hours a day completing a total of 350 hours. Using the technique of skin-heaters complemented by the thermal vacuum chamber thermally conditioned <b>shrouds</b> and cold <b>plates,</b> dedicated heat inputs and heat sink where applied at the spacecraft surfaces in order to obtain the required high and low acceptance values of temperature and, subsequently, simulating the operational conditions for the necessary electronic subsystems functioning tests of the spacecraft. This test campaign included teams from both China and Brazil, summing a total of 67 people directly involved...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Recent {{discoveries in}} {{subduction}} zones worldwide [...] including here in Cascadia [...] have illuminated the once <b>shrouded</b> process of <b>plate</b> convergence below the seismogenic zone. Early geodetic [Dragert, et al., 2001] and seismic [Obara, 2002] signals were observed to correlate {{in space and}} time, and were associated with periodic episodes of deep slow slip, termed Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) [Rogers and Dragert, 2003]. In this dissertation, I present evidence further detailing the process of where, how, and how often deep slow slip occurs using several catalogs of low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) as slow slip indicators. In the first section I compare four distinct LFE families that span {{the range of the}} ETS zone beneath western Washington State. I find that LFE behavior varies systematically with depth: LFE moments, swarm durations, and swarm recurrence intervals are all largest in the updip portion of the ETS zone, and smallest in the downdip portion. I interpret these systematic differences as a result of variation in fault strength on the subduction interface [...] with the strongest coupling found updip (near the seismogenic zone), and the weakest coupling found downdip. In the second section I look within individual LFE families and perform double-difference event relocations to map out the spatial extent of the LFE patch (or patches) responsible for LFE generation. I determine LFE locking efficiency from estimates of LFE density and released seismic moment. I also track LFE migrations over time in an effort to map the progression of slow slip fronts, rapid tremor reversals (RTRs), and other phenomena...|$|R
