Medicaid is a government insurance program that provides health insurance to the poor. Children currently make up nearly half of Medicaid enrollees. While the impact of Medicaid coverage on the use of medical care has been extensively examined, few studies have addressed the impact of Medicaid on children's health and schooling. This thesis reports estimates of the effect of Medicaid enrollment on children's <b>absences</b> from <b>school.</b> Schooling is particularly important because it influences children's productivity and earnings as adults. The thesis is divided into two parts. First, I used cross sectional data from National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to analyze the effect of Medicaid on <b>school</b> <b>absences.</b> Four econometric models are used to fully analyze the effect of Medicaid eligibility on children's <b>school</b> <b>absences.</b> The four models are probit model, triprobit model, negative binomial model and endogenous negative binomial model. To complement this study, the paper also analyzes the effect of private insurance on children's <b>school</b> <b>absences.</b> Medicaid eligibility and days missed of school due to illness or injury are positively correlated in all four models, suggesting that Medicaid enrollment increases <b>school</b> <b>absences.</b> To improve on the above estimation by controlling for omitted variable bias, I next used panel data from five years of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to estimate the impact of Medicaid enrollment on the number of <b>school</b> <b>absences</b> in reduced form and structural equation models. The structural model includes equations for children's medical care use, health status, and <b>school</b> <b>absences.</b> Econometric methods employed include instrumental variable techniques, fixed effects estimation, and coarsened exact matching. In this more sophisticated analysis, I found that children with Medicaid coverage have significantly more doctor visits, doctor visits are significantly associated with better health, and children in better health miss significantly fewer days of school. I concluded that Medicaid enrollment significantly reduces <b>school</b> <b>absences.</b> When confounding factors are controlled for using panel data, the effect is larger and more significant...|$|R

Most cases {{have little or no}} interaction with health services and are therefore missed by the majority of existing surveillance systems. As part of a public engagement with science project, this study aimed to establish a web-based system for the collection of routine <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> data and determine if <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> prevalence was correlated with established surveillance measures for circulating influenza. We collected data for two influenza seasons (2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13). The primary outcome was daily <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> prevalence (weighted to make it nationally representative) for children aged 11 to 16. <b>School</b> <b>absence</b> prevalence was triangulated graphically and through univariable linear regression to Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) influenza like illness (ILI) episode incidence rate, national microbiological surveillance data on the proportion of samples positive for influenza (A+B) and with Rhinovirus, RSV and laboratory confirmed cases of Norovirus. 27 schools submitted data over two respiratory seasons. During the first season, levels of influenza measured by <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> prevalence and established surveillance were low. In the 2012 / 13 season, a peak of <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> prevalence occurred in week 51, and week 1 in RCGP ILI surveillance data. Linear regression showed a strong association between the <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> prevalence and RCGP ILI (All ages, and 5 - 14 year olds), laboratory confirmed cases of influenza A & B, and weak evidence for a linear association with Rhinovirus and Norovirus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} how often children with asthma are absent from school {{compared to the}} 'average' child and to assess the validity of <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> as a marker of morbidity for asthma. DESIGN: Case control study. SETTING: Children registered with 12 general practices, attending 98 primary and secondary schools in the Tayside region. SUBJECTS: 773 children with asthma or related symptoms and 773 controls from school registers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Episodes of <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> and days absent per term, recorded from school registers. RESULTS: Comparing children taking asthma medication against their controls showed a significant difference for both days absent and episodes of absence. This increase in absence was approximately one school day each term. Severity of asthma {{was not related to}} increased <b>school</b> <b>absence.</b> Children receiving no asthma medication, but with asthma related symptoms, were absent no more than their age/sex matched controls. Applying a deprivation index to the cases on asthma medication, gave a significant difference in episodes of absence between Primary children classified as highly deprived and other Primary children. CONCLUSION: The increase in <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> of around one day per term for children with asthma is less than previously reported and could be caused by clinic attendance rather than ill health due to asthma. Recorded absence varied according to deprivation index but not asthma severity. The use of <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> as a marker of morbidity in childhood asthma needs to be reassessed...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To do a comparative analysis of {{academic performance of}} Nigerian children with SCA and their siblings. METHODS: We studied sessional aggregate scores, pass rates and percentage scores in four core subjects (mathematics, English language, integrated science and social studies), as well as the total number of days of <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> of 52 school-age children (6 - 17 years) with sickle cell anemia and 42 siblings of similar sociodemographic characteristics, over one academic session. FINDINGS: <b>School</b> <b>absence</b> among the SCA patients was significantly higher than that of siblings (9. 3 +/- 5. 5 days/school year and 4. 3 +/- 2. 6 days/school year, respectively, mean+/-SD, p< 0. 05). Although the mean sessional aggregate score for patients was comparable with that of the siblings, there was a significantly larger proportion of below-average pupils among the patients. The mean percentage scores of the patients on mathematics, English language, integrated science and social studies compared well with those of the siblings. There was no significant correlation between <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> and academic achievement of the study population.

A postal screening questionnaire was sent to 5100 parents, and 11. 1 % of the children were reported to have had wheezing illness over the previous 12 months. A sample of 284 parents were subsequently interviewed at home about their child's illness. <b>School</b> <b>absence</b> over the past year caused by wheezing illness was reported by 58 %; and in 12 % of children this amounted to more than 30 school days. <b>School</b> <b>absence</b> was strongly associated with all other indicators of morbidity [...] short and long term. The proportion described as having "asthma' rose from 22 % in those with no absence, to 50 % in those with more than 30 days absence.

40|$|<b>School</b> <b>absence</b> {{has become}} a growing concern in some regions of the United States, {{particularly}} in rural and low-SES environments (Hammond, 2014). <b>School</b> <b>absence</b> and chronic absenteeism are related {{to a variety of}} negative outcomes including poor academic achievement and behavioral problems (Eaton, Brener, 2 ̆ 6 Kann, 2008; Houck, Hadley, Tolou-Shams, 2 ̆ 6 Brown, 2012; Kearney, 2008). Therefore, it is important to examine risk and protective factors affecting school absenteeism. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine several risk and protective factors associated with absence from school and school achievement in a rural community within the state of Oregon, including mental health, sense of belonging in school, and physical health, as well as a variety of demographic variables. Factors associated with living in a rural environment were also examined in relation to <b>school</b> <b>absence.</b> The Psychological Sense of School Membership (Goodenow, 1993) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 2005), as well as a demographics questionnaire, were administered to 132 high school students and follow-up attendance data were obtained from the school.

The objective of this study is to estimate direct and indirect costs of asthma in school-age children. Methods Using data from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we estimated direct medical costs and <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> days among school-age children who had treatment for asthma during 1996. We estimated indirect costs as costs of lost productivity arising from parents loss of time from work and lifetime earnings lost due to premature death of children from asthma. All costs were calculated in 2003 dollars. Results In 1996, an estimated 2. 52 million children aged five to 17 years received treatment for asthma. Direct medical expenditure was $ 1009. 8 million ($ 401 per child with asthma), including payments for prescribed medicine, hospital inpatient stay, hospital outpatient care, emergency room visits, and office-based visits. Children with treated asthma had a total of 14. 5 million <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> days; asthma accounts for 6. 3 million <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> days (2. 48 days per child with asthma). Parents loss of productivity from asthma-related <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> days was $ 719. 1 million ($ 285 per child with asthma).

40|$|Objective: To study {{associations}} between pain, {{the use of}} analgesics, reduction in spare time activities and <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> because of pain among 15 - 16 -year-olds in Norway and high school dropout five years later. Background: Most Norwegian 15 - 16 -year-olds report that they have good health, but pain among adolescents is common and identified as an important health problem. The use of over-the-counter analgesics has increased, also among adolescents. High school dropout is a challenge for the society and put young people at risk for later work marginalization and social exclusion. The etiology is multifactorial and dependent of variables like gender, grades, ethnicity and the parents socioeconomic status. The role of pain and its associations with high school dropout have not been studied before. Method: 14063 Norwegian 15 - 16 -year-olds from six different counties completed a questionnaire and were followed up for five years. Logistic regression was used to compute ORs for high school dropout. Results: 15 - 16 -year-olds who reported pain, frequent use of analgesics, experienced reduced spare time activities and had <b>school</b> <b>absence</b> because of pain, had higher odds of high school dropout five years later. Moderate use of over-the counter analgesics implied lower odds of high school dropout.
