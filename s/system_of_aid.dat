40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} {{the scale}} and scope of {{emerging}} donors, many of which are developing economies themselves. On the basis of a survey of the literature, we find that estimates of annual aid flows from new donors (so-called non-DAC donors) vary greatly and are somewhere between $ 11 billion and $ 41. 7 billion, or 8 and 31 percent of global gross ODA. We find that new donors are not a monolithic group but instead represent three distinct models of aid delivery, which we describe as the DAC Model, the Arab Model and the Southern Model. While we see the need to increase transparency and accountability of aid flows across these delivery models, we do not see a convergence to the DAC model. Rather, emerging donors may follow different paths, in accordance with their own traditions and standards. We argue that encouraging aid transparency, especially reporting data on project-level assistance, must be the core focus of the aid community. To engage the non-DAC donors, the forum for international aid coordination might need to be moved away from the OECD-DAC platform; DAC could instead serve as one donor caucus within a larger international <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> reporting.

In this relatively brief time frame, Koenders prioritised development cooperation in ‘fragile states’ 3 and his policies coincided and aligned themselves with wider international tendencies toward increased attention to conflict affected regions or emergency situations.    We start by outlining the rationale and main policy developments regarding Dutch aid to education in conflict affected situations, emergencies and fragile states. Aid to conflict and education from the government of the Netherlands is characterised by a very diverse <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> channelled through multilateral, bilateral and non‐governmental/private channels. Furthermore, various (development, humanitarian and fragile states departments) departments within (and outside) the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) are involved in providing funding and policy advice in education sectors in conflict affected regions. We then turn to discuss the country or area selection processes, and the various labels and lists that are used to distinguish fragile states or conflict affected regions. The UNICEF Education in Emergencies and Post‐Crisis Transition Programme, totalling over 200 million US dollars, has been the largest investment of the Dutch government directed to foster education in emergencies and crisis situations. The paper elaborates on the rationale and the genealogy of the UNICEF programme, {{as well as some of}} the initial lessons learnt since its inception. Following on from that we provide an overview of the variety of multilateral, bilateral and non‐governmental/private initiatives supported by the Dutch MFA in the case of Afghanistan and Sudan, including both short term and immediate responses, as well as longer term capacity building programmes. Throughout the paper, we draw from evidence of the involvement of the Netherlands in other countries such as Colombia, Pakistan, Haiti and Yemen.

Na busca das razões subjacentes à exposição procurar-se-ão identificar os constrangimentos económicos, políticos e sociais que motivaram o fenómeno. Tendo como pano de fundo o cenário da Guerra Peninsular, tentar-se-á, igualmente, analisar e relacionar a exposição de crianças com a época conturbada vivida naquela região fronteiriça e determinar as possíveis convergências entre a guerra, a pobreza e as motivações pessoais e familiares subjacentes. Um outro ângulo de análise deste estudo será a forma como a posição geoestratégica da região, na cena política, moldou o novo modelo de assistência aos expostos e os esforços que o concelho, apesar de arruinado, desenvolveu para cumprir o estipulado pela Ordem de Pina Manique, isto é, garantir a sobrevivência dos inocentes abandonados.

Five resource systems have been selected: physical-environmental; landscape-visual; historical-cultural; agricultural-productive; Demographic-tourism. A further source of information comes from the analysis carried out during the drawing up of the Vast Area Environmental Landscape Territorial Plans and we have defined the criteria for the selection of the indicators. These indicators will be useful for an evaluation of transformations through time of the territories, in order to prepare the documents for the strategic environmental assessment procedures too. ...|$|E
40|$|The defended {{thesis is}} the result of a {{partnership}} enters on one hand the group Parisot, and particularly the corporation Parisot Furnishes, and on the other hand the team of research technological TRACILOG of the Center of Research in Automatic of Nancy. The consumption typology in terms of goods and of services evolved during the last years, with notably the emergence of e-business. If even then the consumers satisfied themselves weakly differentiated products down with costs, the tendency is at personalization, implying an increase of the variety and requirements of the final customer in terms of costs, quality, functionalities and delays. The production systems generally were conceived to be effective in a context of production of mass: they must evolve to adapt itself to this new typology of the market. They must improve their flexibility to be able to reply to the various ones ask customers. It is necessary for them to be equally reactive, in order to satisfy quickly the customers. At last, the business in his global nature one must become agile, able itself to reconfigure according to the evolutions of his environment or of his market (Nof and Al, 2006), (Koren and Al, 1999). The industries that produce big series of customised products, and particularly the furniture industry, undergo equally this evolution: the number of references does not stop increasing and the volumes by reference diminish. The one of the major issues for the Parisot Meubles company consists of improving flexibility of an industrial tool initially sized to produce important quantities of products with a weak differentiation, in order to reply to the requirements of the customers, so in terms of product diversification that of quality, costs and delays. The investments in production infrastructures being recent and important, the perspectives of flexibilisation have first to lean on an evolution of the structures of piloting. The centralized and hierarchical systems, originally developed to respond to a market of mass consumption, do not allow the agility of the production system. Indeed, if such architectures are rated efficient, many authors (Duffie et al, 1986) (Valckenaers et al, 1997) have stressed their lack of robustness to perturbations (commercial management of emergencies, breakdowns, ruptures of 'supply) and rigidity (difficulty of reconfiguration when introducing new products for example). This has led many companies to turn to strategies Steering type Just in Time, based on a production driven by customer demand and a flight control system of physical flow field, usually at the using labels (paper) kanban (Monden, 1981). They provide solutions satisfying the constraints of responsiveness, these systems do not provide optimal management of flows, and make it complicated by the difficulty to have an overview of the situation. In order to improve the agility of production systems, research activities have focused in recent years to hybrid control systems combining a system of centralized decision predictor with a medium or long term and a distributed system where decisions are taken in real time to the flow over a short term. The quality and complementarity of both approaches, centralized and distributed, promises considerable benefits for hybrid architectures that would reconcile the capacity of global optimization of hierarchical systems with the responsiveness and robustness potential heterarchical systems. Moreover, recent developments in technology INFOTRON (RFID, wireless communications networks [...] .) provide the tools for the implementation of automated steering. It is realistic to imagine that the "product information" to ensure the synchronization of the flow of physical objects and the process flow of software objects of the information system representing the process. Mac Farlane (MacFarlane et al, 2003) showed that the instrumentation of the product and increasing the visibility inherent allow input for both systems of production management systems for emerging (Figure 4). First, collecting real-time data on the flow of products and production system used to power tools effectively centralized (APS, ERP, MES), particularly consumer data in order to ensure consistency and overall optimization of the production process. The automatic identification technologies can solve the problem of synchronization of physical flows and information from Plössl in 1985 (Plössl, 1985). The instrumentation of the product is also a sure way to maintain the link-information and material to improve visibility on the physical flow. The availability of information on both the process and the product itself leads to an improvement in the visibility (or observability) in the space of states of the controlled transaction (MacFarlane et al, 2003). Auto ID is a complement to information from sensors directly to the process. The possibility of accurate information in real time on the identity, status and product specifications to help reduce delays and the risk of errors in the management of stocks of raw material, production operations and management finished products. It becomes realistic to imagine the "active" participant in decisions about production, and seen as the linchpin of the flight control system, ensuring the synchronization and consistency between a centralized system to ensure the overall optimization of production at the enterprise level and all the decision-making centers distributed over the execution of the production. As stated by Valckenaers in (Morel et al, 2007) : "These recent and ongoing developments finally promised to deliver the best of both worlds: the ability of centralized planning older solutions and the ability to cope with the real-factory dynamics of the self -organizing multi-agent systems. In particular, (Thomas et al, 2008) shows the relevance of the concept of control by the product in a production-driven just-in-time, allowing to maintain a global vision system and ensure the consistency of local decisions. Current issues in the field are therefore the proposed modeling frameworks and development of agile production system, proof of concept and the efficiency of such systems on an industrial scale and the transfer application on real world industry. Within the CRAN, the project team "system controlled by the Product" considering whether to allocate the proceeds an active role in the organization, ensuring the link between the performance of production and the center "business" of the company. Our work was conducted jointly with the thesis of Rémi Pannequin (Pannequin, 2007) whose purpose was to demonstrate the validity of the concept of active, developing a multi-platform control agents by the product architecture and emulation and with the thesis of Hind El Haouzi (to be defended in 2008), which exploits this concept to synchronize the flow of a main line with assembly lines (feeders) in a production unit. Compared to these two theories, our contribution is based on the physical flows infotronisation to assist in the management of different points of decoupling relative to a goal, in a context of high-volume production batches. Our work aims to explore new opportunities provided by the identification technologies in the management of workflow, and especially the automatic identification technologies in a production system controlled by kanban. Specifically, as part of a thesis CIFRE, we address the problem of flow management products within the company Parisot Meubles. During this thesis, we studied the production system as a whole (physical system and steering system), to identify industrial problems pilot production to Parisot Meubles. Of these industrial problems, we have induced a more general search. Then we could validate the proposals by the application in real industrial cases. This work has focused on a study of the opportunities provided by new information technologies on the procedures of production and the proposal of a decision support steering flow on the ground. The proposed architecture relies on the flow infotronisation kanban, which become "kanban assets and ensure interoperability and synchronization between a centralized system of decision-making and different decision-making distribution entities, to coordinate all decisions. These proposals have been validated through an architecture emulation, allowing the use of a flight control system under real conditions. In addition, some proposed structures have been validated in the real production system. The contributions of this thesis work based on: • The proposal of an architecture evaluation emulation control systems of production on an industrial scale, and the method of construction. • The proposal of a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> to the management of the production to ensure the overall coherence of the decision system. La thèse défendue est le résultat d'un partenariat entre d'une part le groupe Parisot, et plus particulièrement la société Parisot Meuble, et d'autre part l'équipe de recherche technologique TRACILOG du Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy. La typologie de la consommation en termes de biens et de services a évolué au cours des dernières années, avec notamment l'émergence du e-commerce. Si jusqu'alors les consommateurs se sont satisfaits de produits faiblement différenciés à bas coûts, la tendance est à la personnalisation, impliquant une augmentation de la diversité et des exigences du client final en termes de coûts, qualité, fonctionnalités et délais. Les systèmes de production ont généralement été conçus pour être efficaces dans un contexte de production de masse : ils doivent évoluer pour s'adapter à cette nouvelle typologie du marché. Ils doivent gagner en flexibilité pour être capable de répondre aux diverses demandes des clients. Il leur faut également être réactifs, afin de satisfaire rapidement les clients. Enfin, l'entreprise dans sa globalité doit devenir agile, capable de se reconfigurer en fonction des évolutions de son environnement ou de son marché (Nof et al, 2006), (Koren et al, 1999). Les industries qui produisent en grande série des produits personnalisables, et notamment l'industrie du meuble, subissent également cette évolution : le nombre de références ne cesse d'augmenter et les volumes par référence diminuent. L'un des enjeux majeurs pour l'entreprise Parisot Meubles consiste à flexibiliser un outil industriel initialement dimensionné pour produire des quantités importantes de produits avec une faible différenciation, afin de répondre aux exigences des clients, tant en terme de diversification des produits que de qualité, coûts et délais. Les investissements dans les infrastructures de production étant récents et importants, les perspectives de flexibilisation doivent d'abord s'appuyer sur une évolution des structures de pilotage. Les systèmes centralisés et hiérarchiques, initialement développés pour répondre à un marché de consommation de masse, ne permettent pas l'agilité du système de production. En effet, si de telles architectures se montrent performantes en régime nominal, de nombreux auteurs (Duffie et al, 1986) (Valckenaers et al, 1997) ont souligné leur manque de robustesse aux perturbations (gestion d'urgences commerciales, pannes, ruptures d'approvisionnements) et leur rigidité (pénibilité de la reconfiguration lors de l'introduction de nouveaux produits par exemple). Ce constat a conduit beaucoup d'entreprises à se tourner vers des stratégies de pilotage de type Juste-à-Temps, reposant sur une production tirée par la demande du client et un système de pilotage des flux physiques par le terrain, généralement à l'aide d'étiquettes (papier) kanban (Monden, 1981). S'ils apportent des solutions satisfaisant aux contraintes de réactivité, ces systèmes ne proposent pas une gestion optimale des flux, et rendent celle-ci complexe par la difficulté à disposer d'une vue globale de la situation. Dans le but d'améliorer l'agilité des systèmes de production, les activités de recherche se sont orientées ces dernières années vers des systèmes de pilotage hybrides combinant un système de décision centralisé prédictif avec un horizon à moyen ou long terme et un système distribué où les décisions sont prises en temps réel à même le flux sur un horizon court terme. La qualité et la complémentarité des deux approches, centralisées et distribuées, laisse entrevoir des bénéfices considérables pour les architectures hybrides qui concilieraient les capacités d'optimisation globale des systèmes hiérarchiques avec la réactivité et la robustesse potentielle des systèmes hétérarchiques. Par ailleurs, les développements récents dans le domaine des technologies infotroniques (RFID, réseaux de communication sans fil [...] .) apportent les outils concrets permettant la mise en œuvre de systèmes automatisés de pilotage. Il devient réaliste d'imaginer que le « produit informant » puisse assurer la synchronisation du flux d'objets physiques du procédé et le flux des objets logiciels du système d'information représentant ce procédé. Mac Farlane (MacFarlane et al, 2003) a montré que l'instrumentation du produit et l'augmentation de la visibilité inhérente permettent un apport, tant pour les systèmes classiques de gestion de production que pour les systèmes émergents (Figure 4). D'abord, la collecte en temps-réel de données pertinentes sur l'état du flux de produits et de système de production permettent d'alimenter efficacement les outils centralisés (APS, ERP, MES), particulièrement consommateurs de données, dans le but d'assurer cohérence et optimisation globale du processus de production. Les technologies d'identification automatique permettent de résoudre le problème de synchronisation des flux physiques et d'informations adressée par Plossl en 1985 (Plossl, 1985). L'instrumentation du produit représente également un moyen sûr d'assurer le lien matière-information et permet d'améliorer la visibilité sur le flux physique. La disponibilité d'informations à la fois sur le process et sur le produit lui-même amène à une amélioration de la visibilité (ou observabilité) dans l'espace des états de l'opération contrôlée (MacFarlane et al, 2003). L'Auto ID est donc un complément aux informations capteurs provenant directement du process. La possibilité d'information précise et en temps réel sur l'identité, le statut et les spécifications du produit aident à réduire les délais et les risques d'erreurs dans la gestion des stocks de matière première, les opérations de production et la gestion des produits finis. Il devient alors réaliste d'imaginer le « produit actif », participant aux décisions concernant la fabrication, et de le considérer comme le pivot du système de pilotage, assurant la synchronisation et la cohérence entre un système centralisé assurant l'optimisation globale de la production au niveau de l'entreprise et l'ensemble des centres de décisions distribués en charge de l'exécution de la production (Figure 5). Comme énoncé par Valckenaers dans (Morel et al, 2007) : « These recent and ongoing developments finally promise to deliver the best of both worlds: the planning ability of centralized older solutions and the ability to cope with the real-factory dynamics of the self-organizing multi-agent systems ». Notamment, (Thomas et al, 2008) montre la pertinence du concept de contrôle par le produit dans un contexte de production pilotée en Juste-à-Temps, en permettant de maintenir une vision globale du système et d'assurer la cohérence des décisions prises localement. Les enjeux actuels du domaine sont donc la proposition de cadres de modélisation et de développement de système de production agiles, la preuve du concept et de l'efficience de tels systèmes à l'échelle industrielle et le transfert par application sur des cas réels du monde industriel. Au sein du CRAN, l'équipe projet « Systèmes Contrôlé par le Produit » étudie l'opportunité d'allouer au produit un rôle actif dans l'organisation, assurant le lien entre l'exécution de la production et le pôle « business » de l'entreprise. Notre travail a été mené conjointement avec la thèse de Rémi Pannequin (Pannequin, 2007) dont l'objet était de démontrer la validité du concept de produit actif, en développant une plateforme multi-agents de contrôle par le produit et une architecture d'émulation, et avec la thèse de Hind El Haouzi (sera soutenue en 2008), qui exploite ce concept pour synchroniser les flux d'un ligne principale d'assemblage avec des lignes secondaires (feeders), dans un contexte de production unitaire. Par rapport à ces deux thèses, notre contribution s'appuie sur l'infotronisation des flux physiques pour aider à la gestion des différents points de découplage par rapport à un objectif global, dans un contexte de production de gros volumes batchés. Nos travaux ont pour but d'étudier les nouvelles opportunités apportées par les technologies d'identification dans le pilotage des flux de production, et plus particulièrement les technologies d'identification automatique dans un système de production contrôlé en kanban. Plus particulièrement, dans le cadre d'une thèse CIFRE, nous adressons la problématique de gestion des flux de produits au sein de l'entreprise Parisot Meubles. Au cours de ce travail de thèse, nous avons étudié le système de production dans son ensemble (système physique et système de pilotage), afin d'identifier les problématiques industrielles de pilotage de la production propres à Parisot Meubles. De ces problématiques industrielles, nous avons induit une problématique plus générale de recherche. Nous avons ensuite pu valider les propositions par l'application au cas industriel réel. Ce travail a porté sur une étude des opportunités apportées par les nouvelles technologies de l'information sur les processus de pilotage de la production, ainsi que la proposition d'un système d'aide à la décision de pilotage des flux sur le terrain. L'architecture proposée s'appuie sur l'infotronisation du flux de kanbans, qui deviennent des « kanbans actifs » et assurent l'interopérabilité et la synchronisation entre un système de décision centralisé et les différentes entités décisionnelles distribuées, afin de coordonner l'ensemble des décisions. Ces propositions ont été validées à l'aide d'une architecture d'émulation, permettant d'utiliser un système de pilotage dans les conditions réelles. Par ailleurs, certaines structures proposées ont pu être validées sur le système de production réel. Les contributions de ce travail de thèse reposent sur : • la proposition d'une architecture d'évaluation par émulation de systèmes de pilotage de la production, à une échelle industrielle, ainsi que la méthode de construction. • La proposition d'un système d'aide au pilotage de la production permettant d'assurer la cohérence globale du système de décision...|$|E

Emphasis is placed upon {{the operation of the}} buoy tender class cutter to maintain buoys and minor aids. Based on the realization that the Coast Guard exists to serve more than one operational function and that these functions at times compete for the resources made available to the Service, the assumption is made that the Coast Guard needs a method to measure present accomplishment <b>of</b> its <b>aids</b> to navigation functions and a way to test proposed changes before they are adopted.

40|$|In many respects, the {{experiences}} of the Italian Welfare State represent a particular case. The comparatively late industrial development, the continuity of the workers' struggles and social movements, the high levels of Mafia activity and political corruption, and above all the radical division between the northern and southern parts of the country all make Italy an anomaly with respect {{to the rest of the}} developed capitalist countries. Precisely because of these anomolous conditions, however, the Italian experience may paradoxically prove to be exemplary for the future <b>of</b> all welfare <b>systems.</b> The need to manage an internal relationship between North and South, for example, has now become a generalized condition for all capitalist economies. Most important, the Italian experiences, especially those emanating from the social movements of the 1970 s, show the possibilities of alternative forms of welfare in which <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> and socialization are separated from State control and situated, instead in autonomous social networks. These alternative experiments may show how <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> social welfare will survive the crisis of the Welfare State...|$|R
25|$|Another {{problem was}} navigation. As night-flying aids {{in a day}} fighter were rudimentary, an {{elaborate}} <b>system</b> <b>of</b> visual <b>aids</b> to navigation had to be established, encompassing light beacons, searchlight patterns, flak guns firing combinations of various tracer colours through the clouds and parachute flares. To {{make up for the}} lack <b>of</b> visual <b>aids</b> initially, converted bomber pilots had to be used, because they already had experience with navigating at night. Another navigation aid was simply the Allied bombing target; a city illuminated as it burned would guide the fighters to their target.|$|R

S. and all other major industrialized countries, except Japan, have sharply increased ODA in hopes of reducing poverty in developing countries, which they see as a main factor inflaming Islamic fundamentalism and therefore as the hotbed of terrorism. This {{is a far cry from}} the 1990 s when all major aid donors but Japan were suffering from ‘aid fatigue’ in the wake of the Cold War and either cut back on or failed to significantly increase aid. After attending the International Conference of Asian Political Parties in Southwest China’s Kunming City (July 17, 2010), Japan has indicated it wants to exit from the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>aiding</b> poor countries. The move comes at a time of weakening U. S. economy, and China’s drive to enlarge its role in the arena <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> politics in both Africa and Asia. This paper attempts to explore how is changing Japan’s role within the international aid system from a historical perspective aimed to highlight the domestic and structural factors that led to the rise and fall of the country as aid-donor. Particular attention has been paid to the gaiatsu (external pressure) exerted during the Cold War years by the U. S. on the Japanese decision-making process as part of the reassessment of its geopolitical priorities...|$|R
