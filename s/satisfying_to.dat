5|$|Lord Pitfour {{was widely}} admired and often dined with fellow lawyer and biographer James Boswell, who {{declared}} Pitfour {{to be one}} of the greatest Scottish lawyers. This was endorsed by the diarist John Ramsay of Ochtertyre (1736–1814), who remarked that Pitfour was one of a small number of barristers who he found <b>satisfying</b> <b>to</b> hear speak. Pitfour practised law in Edinburgh at the height of the Scottish Enlightenment and was a member of The Poker Club.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan {{disagreed}} {{several times}} over {{the choice of a}} subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically <b>satisfying</b> <b>to</b> him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not <b>satisfying</b> <b>to</b> the fellows; the room to store the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient {{and there was not}} enough room to store the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} in their {{opinions}} of the Escape sections. Edge and Wallace thought that the Escape sections were <b>satisfying</b> <b>to</b> solve, while Robinson did not find them fun. Boosinger called them dull and uninspired, but appreciated their connections to the game's mathematical and scientific themes. Several reviewers noted that the controls for both the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation Vita were awkward and oversensitive, and Molie L. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly found the limited camera movement disappointing as well. Kemps commented that the user interface was improved from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. Many reviewers praised the flowchart for not forcing the player to replay previously completed sections or restart the game from the beginning, but Boosinger and Edge criticized it for removing the tension of making wrong decisions.|$|E

25|$|He also {{produced}} {{a series of}} small paintings in what was known as the Troubador style, idealized portrayals of events in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In 1815 he painted Aretino and Charles V's Ambassador as well as Aretino and Tintoretto, an anecdotal painting whose subject, a painter brandishing a pistol at his critic, may have been especially <b>satisfying</b> <b>to</b> the embattled Ingres. Other paintings in the same style included Henry IV Playing with His Children (1817) and the Death of Leonardo.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{characteristics}} that defined Insaniquarium influenced the development of Plants vs. Zombies. Players advance in a similar pace by receiving new plants. Also, the way plants are chosen {{at the beginning of}} each level was derived from the way pets are chosen in Insaniquarium. Other inspiration for the game's mechanics came from the film Swiss Family Robinson, especially where the family defends against pirates. This was the inspiration for the Potato Mine; Fan stated that it was <b>satisfying</b> <b>to</b> watch a zombie step on the mine, being defeated and covered in mashed potatoes.|$|E

25|$|Retirement {{housing and}} {{communities}} {{became a major}} area {{of work in the}} 1970s. A project in Cincinnati, at the Pilot Center in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood became a milestone in its professional development. It was here that Evans Woollen and Larry O’Connor first initiated the firm’s “live-in” approach to design process and client participation, which continues today. Particularly <b>satisfying</b> <b>to</b> the firm was its work in New Harmony, Indiana where it produced designs for an inn and the renovation of a community auditorium. In 1973, the firm incorporated and changed its name to Woollen Associates, Inc.|$|E
25|$|But {{with these}} {{potential}} hazards, Clayton and Bell consistently turned out windows {{in which the}} balance of colour is eminently <b>satisfying</b> <b>to</b> the eye. They had the happy knack of selecting exactly the right tonal values so that difficult colour combinations, (such as red and green laid side by side as the cloth and lining of a cloak) appear inevitable. Moreover, their colour choices are rarely timid. (A “safe” choice is to line every cloak with yellow {{in the form of}} an applied silver-stain.) Although most of the colours in their windows are primaries- basic red, yellow and blue with a mid-tone grassy green, they introduced judiciously placed tertiary colours such as russet, brownish purple and a sort of mustard colour. The mustard colour often appears in conjunction with a bright intense blue. They frequently clothed a central figure in a robe of this bright blue, in contrast to the dark blue of the background and the bright red of surrounding robes.|$|E
25|$|A set {{of similar}} paradoxes occurs within {{the area of}} physics {{involving}} arrow of time and causality. One of these, the grandfather paradox, deals with the peculiar nature of causality in closed time-like loops. In its most crude conception, the paradox involves a person traveling {{back in time and}} murdering an ancestor who hadn't yet had a chance to procreate. The speculative nature of time travel to the past means that there is no agreed upon resolution to the paradox, nor is it even clear that there are physically possible solutions to the Einstein equations that would allow for the conditions required for the paradox to be met. Nevertheless, there are two common explanations for possible resolutions for this paradox that take on similar flavor for the explanations of quantum mechanical paradoxes. In the so-called self-consistent solution, reality is constructed {{in such a way as}} to deterministically prevent such paradoxes from occurring. This idea makes many free will advocates uncomfortable, though it is very <b>satisfying</b> <b>to</b> many philosophical naturalists. Alternatively, the many worlds idealization or the concept of parallel universes is sometimes conjectured to allow for a continual fracturing of possible worldlines into many different alternative realities. This would mean that any person who traveled back in time would necessarily enter a different parallel universe that would have a different history from the point of the time travel forward.|$|E
