5|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical front-wheel <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> those with strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E

5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A rigid-elastic {{coupling}} multi-body {{dynamic model}} of a car was established. The controllability and stability including constant cornering, <b>steering</b> returnability <b>and</b> <b>steering</b> effort performances are analyzed. Results {{show that there is}} still a feasibility to enhance the understeer. By optimizing the suspension parameters using DOE method, the characteristic of understeer was improved. Simulation analysis indicated that the characteristics of <b>steering</b> effort <b>and</b> <b>steering</b> returnability were not affected due to change of suspension parameters...|$|R
5|$|Determined {{to avoid}} battle, Lacrosse turned southeast, hoping {{to use his}} wider spread of sail to outrun his {{opponent}} in the strong winds. Pellew, however, manoeuvred to cut the Droits de l'Homme off from the French coast, at this stage still unsure {{of the nature of}} his opponent. As the chase developed, the weather, which had been violent for the entire preceding month, worsened. An Atlantic gale swept the Ushant headland, driving a blizzard eastwards and whipping the sea into a turbulent state, making <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> aiming more difficult. At 16:15, two of Droits de l'Hommes topmasts broke in the strong winds. This dramatically slowed the French ship, and allowed Pellew, who had recognised his opponent as a French ship of the line, to close with Droits de l'Homme.|$|E
5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, <b>steering,</b> <b>and</b> turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|The U-1-class design {{had several}} {{features}} typical of Lake's designs, including a diving chamber under {{the bow and}} two variable pitch propellers. Lake's design also called for two retractable wheels that, in theory, could allow travel over the seabed. The design also placed the diving tanks above the waterline of the single, cylindrical hull, which necessitated a heavy ballast keel for vertical stability. The propulsion system for the U-1 class consisted of two gasoline engines for surface running and two electric motors for running while submerged. For underwater <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> maneuverability, the design featured four pairs of diving planes.|$|E

5000|$|... === Integration of {{business}} segments === The Company is organized in several functional segments. The Company’s organization consists of Financial Support <b>and</b> <b>Steering</b> Function, Technical Functions, Human Resources Support <b>and</b> <b>Steering</b> Function, Support <b>and</b> <b>Steering</b> Functions of the President of the Management Board and two Business Units: Customer Facing Unit Residential and Customer Facing Unit Business. Financial Support <b>and</b> <b>Steering</b> Function {{is headed by}} the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Human Resources Support <b>and</b> <b>Steering</b> Function is headed by the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) <b>and</b> Support <b>and</b> <b>Steering</b> Functions of the President of the Management Board is headed by the President of the Management Board (CEO). These functions are common for the entire Company and they ensure that all business segments of the Company are aligned and that the Company can operate as one entity.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this, suspension <b>and</b> <b>steering</b> settings <b>and</b> geometry have been altered, while the vehicle {{has had its}} ride height reduced to the minimum ADR permitted height.|$|R
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} {{based on the}} sport of demolition derby. The game contains three vehicles. Collisions in the game affect the controls of each car, limiting their <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> maximum speed. Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's radiator, which causes the car to overheat and stop running. Four game modes are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial. In Destruction Derby, the player earns points by destroying other cars in a large, trackless arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car Racing, the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' Racing is a hybrid of the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and by destroying other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power <b>steering,</b> <b>and</b> electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
