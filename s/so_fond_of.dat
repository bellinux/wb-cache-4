5|$|In 1584 Skarga was {{transferred}} to the new Jesuit College at Kraków. On 26 March 1587 he founded the Polish version of the Mount of Piety, a pawnbroker run as a charity and called in Polish the Bank Pobożny (lit. the Pious Bank). In 1588 the newly elected King Sigismund III Vasa established the new post of court preacher, and Skarga became the first priest to hold it. Skarga became a valued adviser to the King, and Sigismund became <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> him that when the priest considered retirement, Sigismund rejected this, requesting that he remain at court for as long as possible.|$|E
5|$|The name durian {{comes from}} the Malay word duri (thorn) {{together}} with the suffix -an (for building a noun in Malay). D. zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated {{on a large scale}} and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree phenology. In the species name, zibethinus refers to the Indian civet, Viverra zibetha. There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by Linnaeus, refers to civets being <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like the civet.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} {{she arrived in}} Paris to attend the École Normale de Neuilly. The school {{provided}} its female pupils with classes in chemistry and bookkeeping, in addition to traditionally feminine arts such as embroidery. Her roommate was Noémie, the daughter of Henri Rochefort, who had been imprisoned in New Caledonia for his support of the Paris Commune. The girls shared tales of their parents' political exploits, and remained good friends for years. Pankhurst was <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> Noémie and the school that after graduating she returned with her sister Mary as a parlour boarder. Noémie had married a Swiss painter and quickly found a suitable French husband for her English friend. When Robert Goulden refused to provide a dowry for his daughter, the man withdrew his offer of marriage and Pankhurst returned, miserable, to Manchester.|$|E

25|$|The {{early period}} kanto were largely nourished by Istanbul culture. It was {{much the same}} in the Post-Republican period. The city's large and diverse {{population}} provided both the characters and the events that were the mainstay of kanto. Kanto was heavily influenced by musical theatre. Roman (gypsy) music and culture, which was itself the subject of satire, left its mark on kanto form. Another major influence was Rum music. The importance of the Istanbul Rum, who were <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> entertainment and of singing and playing, must not be underestimated. It is a natural and inevitable resuit of cultural exchange. As it was, almost all the kanto singers were either Rum or Armenian, artists like Pepron, Karakas, Haim, Samran and Peruz who performed during the period following 1903.|$|E
25|$|Legenden om Ljusets rike or Sagnet om Lysets rike in some Scandinavian {{language}} (in English The Legend of the Realm of Light; {{this novel}} {{has not been}} translated into English) {{is a set of}} fantasy novels by Norwegian-Swedish writer Margit Sandemo. It includes twenty titles. This set of novels can be read in Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic and Polish. Margit Sandemo says that she wrote this series of novels because she wanted, like many other fiction writers, to portray her own view about an idealized world. Another reason to write Legenden om Ljusets rike was for the character called Marco who Sandemo created in the end of The Legend of the Ice People. She was <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> him that she wanted to write more about Marco in the following series of novels. Those ideas took shape in her mind when she had written around half of Häxmästaren.|$|E
500|$|The show's {{cast and}} crew {{repeatedly}} praised Vincent Kartheiser for his professionalism and ability to bring much to his character. [...] "You can bet the family fortune on this kid, he can really do it," [...] stated director Vern Gillum. Producer Tim Minear described Vincent {{as one of the}} main reasons of their avoidance of giving the character a ghastly send-off as planned before, “We’ve all grown <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> the character and the actor that we didn’t want do that.” Although fans and critics reception to Kartheiser’s portrayal of the disturbed teen was also very positive, the character and his storylines turned out to be controversial.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{reaching}} [...] at {{the summit}} of the glacier, at 85°36′S, Amundsen prepared for the final stage of the journey. Of the 45dogs who had made the ascent (7 had perished during the Barrier stage), only 18 would go forward; the remainder were to be killed for food. Each of the sledge-drivers killed dogs from his own team, skinned them, and divided the meat between dogs and men. [...] "We called the place the Butchers' Shop", Amundsen recalled. [...] "here was depression and sadness in the air; we had grown <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> our dogs". Regrets did not prevent the team from enjoying the plentiful food; Wisting proved particularly skilful in his preparation and presentation of the meat.|$|E
500|$|Auerbach {{was known}} for his love for cigar smoking. Because Red made his victory cigars a cult in the 1960s, Boston {{restaurants}} would often say [...] "no cigar or pipe smoking, except for Red Auerbach". In addition, Auerbach was well known for his love of Chinese food. In an interview shortly before his death, he explained that since the 1950s, Chinese takeout was the most convenient nutrition: back then, NBA teams travelled on regular flights and had a tight time schedule, so filling up the stomach with heavier non-Chinese food meant wasting time and risking travel-sickness. Over the years, Auerbach became <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> this food that he even became a part-owner of a Chinese restaurant in Boston. Despite a heart operation, he remained active in his 80s, playing racquetball and making frequent public appearances.|$|E
500|$|... "All in Love Is Fair" [...] was {{released}} as the album's second single in March 1974, {{a cover of}} the Stevie Wonder original for his 1973 album, Innervisions. Columbia also released it as a 7" [...] single paired alongside the medley of [...] "My Buddy" [...] and [...] "How About Me". Matthew Greenwald from AllMusic was <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> her rendition that he wrote: [...] "It is no doubt {{one of the most}} graceful and memorable hooks from the era, and Streisand's performance – particularly her phrasing of this line – is unforgettable". It failed to replicate the success of [...] "The Way We Were", but it managed to peak at numbers 63 and 60 in the United States and Canada, respectively. It additionally reached the top ten of the Adult Contemporary chart, also compiled by Billboard.|$|E

500|$|In 1921, {{after years}} of {{pleading}} for proper schooling, Nancy was allowed a year's boarding at Hatherop Castle, an informal private establishment for young ladies of good family. Laura Thompson, in her biography of Nancy, describes Hatherop as not so much [...] a school, [...] "more a chaste foretaste of debutante life". Here Nancy learned French and other subjects, played organised games and joined a Girl Guide troop. It was her first extended experience of life away from home, and she enjoyed it. The following year she was allowed to accompany four other girls on a cultural trip to Paris, Florence and Venice; her letters home are full of expressions of wonder at the sights and treasures: [...] "I had no idea I was <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> pictures... if only I had a room of my own I {{would make it a}} regular picture gallery".|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} include Kirstie Alley as Saavik, Spock's protégée and a Starfleet commander-in-training {{aboard the}} Enterprise. The movie was Alley's first feature film role. Saavik cries during Spock's funeral. Meyer said that during filming someone asked him, [...] "'Are {{you going to}} let her do that?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and they said, 'But Vulcans don't cry,' and I said, 'Well, that's what makes this such an interesting Vulcan.'" [...] The character's emotional outbursts can be partly {{explained by the fact that}} Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan-Romulan heritage in the script, though no indication is given on film. Alley was <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> her Vulcan ears that she would take them home with her at the end of each day. Bibi Besch plays Carol Marcus, the lead scientist working on Project Genesis, and the mother of Kirk's son, David (played by Merritt Butrick). Meyer was looking for an actress who looked beautiful enough that it was plausible a womanizer such as Kirk would fall for her, yet who could also project a sense of intelligence. Meyer liked that Butrick's hair was blond like Besch's and curly like Shatner's, making him a plausible son of the two. John Winston reprises his series role as Kyle, the Enterprise transporter chief now Commander Kyle aboard Reliant.|$|E
500|$|The Verbruggens were {{essential}} to the play, not least because Vanbrugh had customised the sprightly temptress Berinthia to Susanna's talents and reputation for witty, roguish, sexually enterprising characters, most recently Mrs Buxom in Thomas D'Urfey's Don Quixote (a success thanks to [...] "the extraordinary well acting of Mrs Verbruggen", wrote D'Urfey). Although John was less well known, his acting skills were considerable and would flourish after January 1697 in the cooperative company, where commentators even started to compare him with the great Betterton. Verbruggen was considered a more natural, intuitive or [...] "careless" [...] actor, with [...] "a negligent agreeable wildness in his action and his mien, which became him well." [...] Anthony Aston vividly described Verbruggen as [...] "a little in-kneed, which gave him a shambling gait, which was a carelessness, and became him." [...] Modern critics do not find the Loveless part very lively or irresistible, but Vanbrugh was able to count on Verbruggen's shambling male magnetism and [...] "agreeable wildness" [...] to enrich the character. This would originally have worked even in print, since cast lists {{were included in the}} published plays: most 1690s play readers were playgoers also, and aware of the high-profile Verbruggens. Happily married in private life and playing the secret lovers Loveless and Berinthia, the Verbruggens have left traces of their charisma and erotic stage presences in Vanbrugh's dialogue. The Relapse even alludes to their real-life relationship, in meta-jokes such as Berinthia's exclamation, [...] "Well, he is a charming man! I don't wonder his wife's <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is singular," [...] {{said the}} Lady, {{addressing}} Warden; [...] "the animal {{is not only}} so good-natured to all, but <b>so</b> particularly <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> children. What can ail him at the little fellow whose life he has saved?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Hine {{frequently}} visited here, {{and eventually}} obtained a lifetime lease {{of the building}} from the vicars of Hitchin. <b>So</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> the chapel was he, that he even bade [...] "trespassers and sacrilegious persons take warning, for I will proceed against them with the utmost rigour of the law, and, after my death and burial, I will endeavour, in all ghostly ways, to protect and haunt its hallowed walls".|$|E
2500|$|From the Whitehall Evening Post (Thurs 20 July) [...] "Nothing can {{exceed the}} vogue that Cricket has {{in some parts}} of Surrey and Hampshire: the people are <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> it that it is common for them to ride 40 miles to be mere spectators at a Cricket match. A few days ago 22 expert players played a match not far from Godalming when each side got the same number of notches at both innings, which was esteemed very extraordinary".|$|E
2500|$|Antonio Bonfini {{writes of}} Hunyadi's {{service in the}} retinue of one [...] "Francis Csanádi" [...] who [...] "became <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> him that treated {{him as if he}} were his own son". Historian Engel {{identifies}} Francis Csanádi with Franko of Talovac, Ban of Severin who was also Ispán of Csanád County around 1432. Engel says that Hunyadi served in the Ban's retinue for at least one and a half years from around October 1434. A Vlach district of the Banate of Severin was mortgaged to Hunyadi in this period.|$|E

2500|$|Sheeler owned a {{farmhouse}} in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, about 39 miles outside Philadelphia. He {{shared it with}} his longtime friend the artist Morton Schamberg (1881–1918), {{who died in the}} influenza epidemic of 1918. He was <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> the home's 19th century stove that he called it his [...] "companion" [...] and made it a subject of his photographs. The farmhouse serves a prominent role in many of his photographs, including shots of the bedroom and kitchen and stairway. At one point he was quoted as calling it [...] "my cloister." ...|$|E
2500|$|Travis {{could open}} doors using keys, dress himself, water plants, feed hay to his owners' horses, eat {{at a table}} {{with the rest of the}} family, and drink wine from a stemmed glass; he was <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> ice cream that he learned the {{schedules}} of passing ice cream trucks. He logged onto the computer to look at pictures, watched television using a remote control, and brushed his teeth using a Water Pik. [...] He enjoyed watching baseball on television. [...] Travis had also driven a car on several occasions.|$|E
2500|$|... "If {{you intend}} to mount heavy {{mathematical}} artillery again during your coming year in Europe, I would ask you not only not to come to Leiden, but if possible not even to Holland, and just because I am really <b>so</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> you and {{want to keep it}} that way. But if, on the contrary, you want to spend at least your first few months patiently, comfortably, and joyfully in discussions that keep coming back to the same few points, chatting about a few basic questions with me and our young people- and without thinking much about publishing (!!!)-why then I welcome you with open arms!!
