50|$|The engrailed and <b>small</b> <b>engrailed</b> (Ectropis crepuscularia) are moths of {{the family}} Geometridae found from the British Isles through Central and Eastern Europe to the Russian Far East and Kazakhstan. The western Mediterranean and Asia Minor and the Caucasus {{represent}} the southern limit of the distribution (with the Balkan countries). In the north, the distribution area ends at the Arctic circle. It also occurs in North America. Debate exists {{as to whether they}} make up one species, or whether E. crepuscularia actually refers only to the <b>small</b> <b>engrailed,</b> with the engrailed proper being separable as E. bistortata.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Engrailed- 1 and Engrailed- 2 are homeoproteins – {{transcription}} factors {{implicated in}} the morphogenesis of discrete structures. Engrailed proteins {{have a role in}} patterning the midbrain–hindbrain region and are expressed in the nuclei of rat embryo midbrain–hindbrain cells. We have previously found that both endogenous and exogenously expressed Engrailed proteins also associate with membrane regions implicated in signal transduction and secretion. Within total membrane fractions, a <b>small</b> proportion of <b>Engrailed</b> – about 5 % – is protected against proteinase K proteolysis, suggesting that Engrailed has access to a luminal compartment. Together with our finding that homeodomains and homeoproteins can be internalized by live cells, these observations suggest that Engrailed might act as a polypeptidic messenger. In order to investigate this possibility, we looked to see if Engrailed could be secreted. Results: Engrailed expressed in COS cells can be recovered in abutting primary neurons and this is dependent on a short sequence in its homeodomain distinct from ‘classical’ secretion signals. This sequence, which overlaps with the sequence necessary for Engrailed internalization and which is highly conserved among homeoproteins, is the first example of an ‘unconventional’ sequence necessary for secretion. Less than 5 % of total intracellular Engrailed is secreted and there is a correlation between secretion and access to the membrane compartment where the protein is protected against proteinase K. Conclusions: Our results lend weight to the proposal that Engrailed, and possibly other homeoproteins, might act as intercellular polypeptidic messengers...|$|R
40|$|Current {{questions}} in protein folding mechanisms include how fast can a protein fold {{and are there}} energy barriers for the folding and unfolding of ultrafast folding proteins? The <b>small</b> 3 -helical <b>engrailed</b> homeodomain protein folds in 1. 7  μs to form a well-characterized intermediate, which rearranges in 17  μs to native structure. We found that the homologous pituitary-specific transcription factor homeodomain (Pit 1) folded in a similar manner, but in two better separated kinetic phases of 2. 3 and 46  μs. The greater separation and better fluorescence changes facilitated a detailed kinetic analysis for the ultrafast phase for formation of the intermediate. Its folding rate constant changed little with denaturant concentration or mutation but unfolding was very sensitive to denaturant and energy changes on mutation. The folding rate constant of 3  ×  105  s- 1 in water decreased with increasing viscosity, and was extrapolated to 4. 4  ×  105  s- 1 at zero viscosity. Thus, {{the formation of the}} intermediate was partly rate limited by chain diffusion and partly by an energy barrier to give a very diffuse transition state, which was followed by the formation of structure. Conversely, the unfolding reaction required the near complete disruption of the tertiary structure of the intermediate in a highly cooperative manner, being exquisitely sensitive to individual mutations. The folding is approaching, but has not reached, the downhill-folding scenario of energy landscape theory. Under folding conditions, there is a small energy barrier between the denatured and transition states but a larger barrier between native and transition states...|$|R
