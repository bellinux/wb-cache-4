5000|$|When {{a stator}} pole is energized, the rotor torque {{is in the}} {{direction}} that will reduce reluctance. Thus the nearest rotor pole is pulled from the unaligned position into alignment with the stator field (a position of less reluctance). (This is the same effect used by a solenoid, or when picking up ferromagnetic metal with a magnet.) In order to sustain rotation, the stator field must rotate {{in advance of the}} rotor poles, thus constantly [...] "pulling" [...] the rotor along. Some motor variants will run on 3-phase AC power (see the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> variant below). Most modern designs are of the switched reluctance type, because electronic commutation gives significant control advantages for motor starting, speed control, and smooth operation (low torque ripple).|$|E

Previous {{studies show that the}} performance of the pure <b>reluctance</b> <b>synchronous</b> machine drive deteriorates fast in the flux-weakening speed region. To address this problem, thin bonded permanent-magnet sheet material is used inside the flux barriers of the reluctance rotor to improve the performance of the drive, especially in the flux-weakening speed region. A design optimization algorithm is implemented to minimize the volume and hence the cost of the permanent-magnet material, subject to voltage and torque constraints.

40|$|<b>Synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> generator, {{because of}} its {{inherent}} advantages, is coming up as an alternative for the conventional electrical generators. Performance of <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> machine is greatly influenced by the effect of saturation in its ferromagnetic core under both steady-state and transient operations. Thus, the proper representation of saturation in the modelling of <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> generator is of great importance for practical and reliable analysis. In the steady-state and transient modelling of <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> generator, saturation in the direct axis is usually considered, while the saturation in the quadrature axis is ignored due to modelling complexity and unavailability of the q-axis saturation characteristic. In this research work, a new method of modelling the magnetic saturation in <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> machine has been proposed. A linearized steady-state model and a transient model of saturated <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> generator have been developed considering the effect of saturation both in the direct and quadrature axes by using the proposed saturation model.

A model of the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> machine is presented which incorporates both winding and core losses.
