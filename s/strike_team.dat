5|$|Joanna is then {{ordered to}} snoop around and {{investigate}} the crash site. In the process, she is captured {{and taken to}} the Pelagic I ship, along with the alien wreckage. Nevertheless, a mysterious alien rescues her and convinces her to sink the Pelagic I with the wreckage and escape. She succeeds and when she contacts Carrington, she tells him that she discovered that the wreckage belonged to an alien race called the Skedar. The situation changes abruptly when the Carrington Institute is stormed by a dataDyne <b>strike</b> <b>team</b> who hopes to destroy any clues of the conspiracy. Joanna manages to defend the Institute and her work earned her enough recognition {{to take part in}} her next mission. The game ends with the Carrington Institute carrying out further investigations of dataDyne, setting the stage for the Nintendo 64 game.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{regional}} <b>strike</b> <b>teams.</b> These <b>strike</b> <b>teams</b> are put together {{when there are}} high fire danger days coming up and the CFS {{does not want to}} stretch a group's resources.

5|$|Ms. Hartman and Jackie {{are taken}} by the Cybermen for conversion, but the Cyber Leader orders the Doctor held aside because he has {{valuable}} information about the Daleks. The Cyber Leader is destroyed by a <b>strike</b> <b>team</b> led by Jake Simmonds, who have travelled from their universe {{in pursuit of the}} Cybermen. Ms. Hartman is converted, but Jackie escapes into a stairwell. Jake uses a device around his neck to take the Doctor to the parallel universe and their version of Torchwood. The Doctor meets with the alternate universe Pete Tyler, who tells him that after he left the Cybermen were sealed in their factories while humanity decided what to do with them. In the meantime, the Cybermen vanished and the breach began causing unprecedented global warming on the parallel Earth, which the Doctor theorises is the start of the process that will lead to both planets falling into the Void. Pete demands the Doctor seal the breach before his Earth is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fires crew awakens from cryosleep at the Ark and {{receives}} a UNSC {{signal from the}} surface of the installation. Spartan Red Team is deployed to investigate the signal. They recover Isabel from a base but during the exfiltration, Spartan Douglas-042 is injured in an engagement with Atriox and Spartan Alice-130 is left stranded on the Ark. Back on the Spirit of Fire, Isabel reveals to Captain Cutter how Atriox and the Banished invaded the Ark, which leads Cutter to declare war on the Banished. A <b>strike</b> <b>team</b> manages to set up a forward base and defeat Decimus, who is salvaging the Ark’s resources. Decimus escapes and orders a bombardment upon his own base. Upon investigating the wreckage, Isabel discovers information about the Cartographer, a map of key systems and weapons upon the Ark.

5|$|Two {{years after}} the Battle of New York, Steve Rogers works in Washington, D.C. for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. under Director Nick Fury, while {{adjusting}} to contemporary society. Rogers and Agent Natasha Romanoff are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s counter-terrorism <b>S.T.R.I.K.E.</b> <b>team,</b> led by Agent Rumlow, to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from Georges Batroc and his mercenaries. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. Rogers returns to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce to delay the project.|$|E
5000|$|Opponent(s) MAY NOT hinder striker {{by moving}} during the strikers swing {{if they are}} between striker and wall.

5|$|As the President of the United States {{refuses to}} loan dataDyne the Pelagic II, the conspirators plot {{to kill him}} and replace him with a dataDyne-grown clone. To {{accomplish}} their plans, an NSA <b>strike</b> <b>team</b> led by Trent Easton invades the air base from which Air Force One will depart. When Joanna foils this strike, the NSA along with some Scandinavians take over the plane itself, which crashes after an attempt to detach a craft attached to it. Having survived the crash, Joanna eliminates the President's clone and rescues the real President. Meanwhile, Easton is killed by one particular Scandinavian known as Mr. Blonde, who is revealed to be a Skedar in disguise. Without permission from the President, dataDyne decides to hijack the Pelagic II and reach the ancient spacecraft. However, unbeknownst to dataDyne, the Carrington Institute learns that the spacecraft contains a powerful weapon capable of destroying a planet and that the conspirators are actually Skedar aliens disguised as Scandinavian humans who intend to test the weapon on Earth before using it against the Maian homeworld.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the Waking Sands, {{the heroes}} {{discover}} a few Scions who escaped the attack, {{as well as}} the location of their abducted comrades. They mount a rescue mission to the Garlean Castrum Centri, stealing uniforms and a magitek reaper for disguise. Minfilia and the others are retrieved but they also learn that Lahabrea had possessed Thancred during the course of his investigation into the Ascian threat. Minfilia and Alphinaud barge into a meeting between the three Grand Company leaders who had been considering surrender in the face of Ultima Weapon's power and convince them to fight against Garlean oppression. Using the combined forces of all three nations as well as other allied groups, the Eorzean Alliance executes Operation Archon—a massive counteroffensive that aims to assault every Garlean Castrum simultaneously. The player leads a <b>strike</b> <b>team</b> into the Praetorium where the Ultima Weapon is housed. Using Hydaelyn's blessing of light, the adventurer strips Ultima Weapon of its primal aether. The weapon destroys the Praetorium using Ultima magic but the player's team is protected by Hydaelyn's light and dismantles it. Lahabrea attacks personally but the player fulfills the vision {{at the beginning of his}} or her adventure by striking Thancred free from Lahabrea's possession using a blade of light. With the threat of Garlean invasion lifted, the Grand Company leaders declare the beginning of the Seventh Astral Era. The player's character is hailed as a hero of the same caliber as the Warriors of Light.|$|E

25|$|A Coast Guard <b>Strike</b> <b>Team,</b> {{specially}} trained to manage oil spills, was {{flown in from}} California. A containment boom was placed around the ship, {{and some of the}} oil was vacuumed off the beach. The cost of the cleanup was at least $140,000, and oil continued to wash up for several weeks, up to 100 miles from the crash site.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, 2000, a fire {{destroyed}} a seven-story aging warehouse {{at the company}} in Anderson County, Kentucky. It contained more than 17,000 wooden barrels of whiskey. Burning whiskey flowed from the warehouse, setting the woods on fire, causing limestone deposits to explode. Firefighters saved Lawrenceburg's water treatment plant from destruction. However, an estimated 20% of the whiskey flowed into the Kentucky River. The river contamination required the temporary shutdown of the water treatment plant. Officials ordered water usage restrictions. Businesses and schools were closed because of the water shortage. The alcohol spill also depleted the oxygen in the river, killing an estimated 228,000 fish along a 66-mile stretch. The EPA and the Coast Guard's Gulf <b>Strike</b> <b>Team</b> aerated the river using equipment mounted on barges. The company paid $256,000 to the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife {{in an effort to}} restore the fish population in the river.|$|E
25|$|After {{playing the}} first two games of the season in 1987, players went on strike for free agency. In {{response}} to the <b>strike,</b> <b>team</b> owners brought in replacement players and continued the regular season after one week. Several well-known players, including Joe Montana, Lawrence Taylor and Tony Dorsett crossed the picket lines to rejoin their teams alongside these new replacements. On October 15, players voted to end the strike, to instead pursue a legal challenge to the free agency restrictions in court. In January 1988 Judge David Doty sided with the players in ruling that the clubs' continuance of the first refusal and compensation restrictions on free agents was not protected by the labor exemption to the antitrust laws. But in July 1988 Doty refused to grant an injunction which would have freed the players from the restrictions, ruling that the federal Norris-LaGuardia Act prevented courts from issuing injunctions in labor disputes. He urged both sides of the conflict to return to the bargaining table while in preparation for an anti-trust trial.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{game for}} 2 players per team. The first player bowls his or her first ball. If it is a <b>strike,</b> the <b>team</b> scores a <b>strike.</b> If not, the second player {{has a chance to}} make a strike, and scores a <b>strike</b> for the <b>team</b> if successful. If neither player <b>strikes,</b> the <b>team</b> has to decide which spare to shoot at, and gets only one spare attempt, thrown by {{whichever}} player left the spare. This format was originally developed by bowling legend Don Carter, and is compared to the scramble format in golf.|$|R

25|$|In late 1990 {{and early}} 1991, another series of arson fires {{broke out in}} {{southern}} California, this time {{in and around the}} Los Angeles metropolitan area. As a result, a large task force, nicknamed the Pillow Pyro Task Force (a reference to the arson fires set in pillows) was formed to apprehend the arsonist. On March 29, 1991, Tom Campuzanno of the Los Angeles Arson Task Force circulated a flier {{at a meeting of the}} Fire Investigators Regional <b>Strike</b> <b>Team</b> (FIRST), an organization formed by a group of smaller cities in and around Los Angeles County that did not have their own staff of arson investigators. The flier described the modus operandi of the suspected serial arsonist in the Los Angeles area. Scott Baker of the California State Fire Marshal's Office was at that meeting and told Campuzanno about the series of arsons investigated by Captain Casey of the BFD and about Casey's suspicions that the perpetrator was an arson investigator from the Los Angeles area. Consequently, Campuzanno and two of his colleagues met with Casey, obtained a copy of the fingerprint that Casey had recovered, and matched it to John Leonard Orr on April 17, 1991 with improved fingerprint technology this time.|$|E
500|$|In Knoxville, Tennessee, {{a mysterious}} train car {{is left in}} a rail yard. After dark, a group of Japanese {{scientists}} enter the car and conduct an autopsy on an alien body.

Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) purchases an edited video of the autopsy. He believes the tape is authentic, but Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical.|$|E
500|$|The city of San Diego {{constructed}} SR56 from Black Mountain Road to Carmel Mountain Road, and Caltrans {{built the}} remaining {{portion of the}} route to Carmel Creek Road. The bridges were still under construction in November2000 on the city portion. San Diego mayor Dick Murphy commissioned the San Diego Freeway Congestion <b>Strike</b> <b>Team</b> to attempt to accelerate stalled freeway projects such as SR56 in 2001. In May2001, the City Council allocated another $5.1million (about $ in [...] dollars) to purchase land to build the freeway. Critics stated that the construction of SR56 was a short-term solution, and that traffic would return by 2020.|$|E
50|$|The native Montagnards of Vietnam's Central Highlands {{were also}} {{known to have}} used crossbows, as both a tool for hunting, and later, an {{effective}} weapon against the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. Montagnard fighters armed with crossbows proved a highly valuable asset to the US Special Forces operating in Vietnam, {{and it was not}} uncommon for the Green Berets to integrate Montagnard crossbowmen into their <b>strike</b> <b>teams.</b>|$|R

500|$|Also in April 2017, Blizzard {{launched}} [...] "Uprising", {{a seasonal}} event which included an eponymous player versus environment (PvE) co-op game mode. The Uprising game mode's default version allowed players to pick from four characters: Tracer, Torbjörn, Reinhardt, and Mercy. The limitation to these characters {{was due to}} the mode being a portrayal of the King's Row Uprising event from the Overwatch narrative. In this story element, set [...] "seven years into the past", Tracer—then known as Cadet Oxton—is thrust alongside Mercy, Reinhardt, and Torbjörn, into her first mission as a member of Overwatch. The <b>strike</b> <b>team</b> was tasked with subduing an attack on London's King Row from the Omnic extremist group, Null Sector.|$|E
500|$|In April 2017, Tracer {{appeared}} in the origin story video detailing {{the events of the}} in-universe King's Row Uprising event, which Blizzard has described as [...] "a pivotal moment in history from before the fall of Overwatch." [...] Tracer, known as Cadet Oxton during this time in the narrative, is also heard as the narrator of the video, where she details that [...] sent her in {{as a part of a}} <b>strike</b> <b>team</b> to stop an attack from Null Sector, an Omnic extremist group. In July, Blizzard released another animated origin story video, this time focusing on the character Doomfist. The video features Tracer, along with Genji and Winston, battling Doomfist; at one point, Doomfist is seen disabling Tracer's chronal accelerator, causing her to lose her synchronization with the flow of time.|$|E
500|$|Refusing {{to assume}} Al-Asad dead, Price's <b>strike</b> <b>team</b> {{supported}} by Russian loyalists raids a potential safe {{house in a}} village in Azerbaijan to eradicate the occupying Russian forces and capture Al-Asad. Shortly into the interrogation, Al-Asad's phone rings. After hearing {{the voice of the}} caller, Price executes Al-Asad and reveals that the caller was the leader of the ultranationalists: Imran Zakhaev. [...] Price informs his squad about his assassination mission against Zakhaev in Pripyat, Ukraine in 1996. In the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Zakhaev took advantage of the turmoil to profit from nuclear proliferation and used his new wealth to lure soldiers from the Soviet Army to form his ultranationalist party. Price, then a lieutenant, and his superior, Captain MacMillan, were sent on a black operation to eliminate him. Making their way through Pripyat and into Chernobyl, evading enemy guards along the way, the two reached their vantage point in an abandoned hotel, with Price firing upon Zakhaev with a Barrett M82 sniper rifle; however, the shot only severed Zakhaev's arm. After a large shootout, Price and MacMillan barely escaped Zakhaev's henchmen.|$|E
50|$|Special Forces Command (Özel Kuvvetler Komutanlığı), nicknamed Maroon Berets (Bordo Bereliler) {{because of}} their {{distinctive}} service headgear, are the special operations unit of the Turkish Armed Forces. Special Forces Command is not aligned to any force command in TSK, getting orders directly from General Staff of the Republic of Turkey. Its forerunner was the Special Warfare Department (Özel Harp Dairesi). The Berets also work along with Underwater Defence Teams (SAS) and Underwater <b>Strike</b> <b>Teams</b> (SAT).|$|R
