40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in River Nile State to investigate, the prevalence of mastitis in dairy cows and the economical implication of bovine mastitis, through the reduction in milk yield, milk dumped after antibiotic treatment and the costof drugs and other costs inferred with mastitis. California mastitis test was performed in dairy farms to identify the infected quarters. The result revealed that about 87. 5 % of herd individuals were mastitic. The bacteria isolated from milk samples were staphylococci, streptococci, micrococci; coliform bacteria together with mycotic infection. The economical implication of mastitis was evaluated through the calculation of milk yield reduction. Reduction, which represented 67. 2 % from the total loss, had been assessed through the direct and indirect estimation of somatic cell count. It represented more than 12 % of milk yield for one infected quarter. Also the reduction percentage had been assessed through comparison between infected and healthy quarter for the same cow. The reduction percentage of one infected quarters was about 12. 5 %. The reduction as average was 14. 2 % (234 kg /cow/season). The milk reduction cost was 27325 <b>Sudanese</b> <b>Dinars.</b> The discarded milk due to treatment with antibiotic was 14. 5 % of the total loss, withtotal cost 5670 S. D. Drug cost was estimated as 5167 SD(13. 2 %.). Veterinary services cost 2000 Sudanese Dinnars. Represented 5. 1 % of total financial loss. The total financial loss was estimated as 30252 SD per cow/year. Cows were investigated to confirm the effect of mastitis on milk yield. The average of total and daily milk yield had been adopted. The V results showed irregularity in average of total and daily milk yield for the mastitic cows comparedto healthy ones. The effect of mastitis on milk yield was confirmed statistically and. The milk yield curve verified the differences in milk yield between mastitic and healthy cows...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{descriptive}} cross-sectional facility based study, meant {{to describe the}} {{demographic characteristics of the}} contraceptive acceptors, investigate their medical history, to identify their fears and convictions and to determine their contraceptive method of choice. A total of 165 acceptors were covered by the study. A detailed questionnaire was designed for this purpose. In the study 56. 36 % of the sample were at the age group 20 - 29. 22 % were Kawahla tribe, 15. 8 % Alarakeen, 14 % Galeen and the rest were Shaigia, Hadandawa, Bija, fowr, Hamar and Halfawieen. Most of their husbands were Kwahla 19 %, Galeen 18. 8 % and Arakeen 10. 9 %. 81. 2 % of the study sample were housewives, 60 % were from rural areas, 63. 65 % received higher secondary education and above. 85. 46 % had a family monthly income of less than 60, 000 <b>Sudanese</b> <b>Dinars.</b> The study showed that, 50. 92 % of the sample had 3 - 6 children and 10. 91 % had more than 6 children. About 7. 27 % had medical history of jaundice, 3. 64 % were diabetic, 1. 82 % were hypertensive, 1. 82 % had cardiac disease, 9. 1 % had other medical history and 76. 36 % had no medical history. The study revealed that, 12. 73 % of the acceptors had health fears (menstrual disorders, other side effect and inability to conceive quickly after stopping use of contraceptives), 1. 82 % had social fears (husband objection) {{and the rest of the}} sample had no fears from use of contraceptives. 36. 36 % of the acceptors were convinced to use contraceptives due to social reasons (spacing and have enough children), 34. 55 % for health reasons (medical disease with pregnancy like PIH, caeserean section, and for mother and child health wellbeing), 23. 64 % had economic, health and social reasons, 3. 64 % had economic reasons and 1. 82 % were not convinced. The study showed that 65. 46 % of acceptors preferred to use pills, 14. 55 % injectable contraceptive, 10. 91 % IUD, 1. 82 % barrier methods and 7. 27 % had no preferable method. The study recommendations are encourage used of contraceptives through small designed, focused information, education and communication program. Strengthening of the primary health care, family planning units, especially in poor rural areas. Activate the women empowerment programm like illiteracy alleviation and income generating projects. Encourage private sector and non-governmental organization to become a real stock holder in the Family Planning Program...|$|R
40|$|Malaria {{represents}} {{a major public}} health problem in Khartoum State. It is responsible for 24 % of disease episodes seen at outpatient departments., 13. 4 % of inpatients admittance and 10 % of hospital deaths. Combating malaria needs mutual efforts from both {{the government and the}} community. For the successful implementation of control measures, the economic impact of malaria on households as a whole, and in different subgroups of the population need to be known. This is needed first to target the population by equitable and efficient interventions. And second to promote the uptake of preventive measures by the households and guide them in their care seeking practices. This study was conducted to estimate the out-of-pocket expenditure related to malaria prevention and treatment by households, and the effects of care seeking behaviour, socioeconomic status, health insurance coverage and residential area on these expenditures, during the transmission season in Khartoum State during the year 2003. A total of 904 households, selected by the stratified, cluster sampling techniques, were included in the study. Two pre-tested questionnaires were used to collect retrospective data about prevention practices and prevention expenditure. Data about care seeking behaviour during simple malaria episodes and expenditure on malaria treatment during September 2003 were also collected. The results revealed a low use of preventive measures in all sectors of the population and especially among those of low socioeconomic status and residents of rural areas and camps. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of malaria among the different income groups. On the other hand rural areas and camps had a significantly higher incidence than urban areas. There was a high rate of health facility use and low rate of self treatment for malaria management. Use of governmental health facilities was higher than use of private facilities. The mean annual expenditure on malaria prevention was 2944 VII <b>Sudanese</b> <b>Dinars</b> (SD) (5517) per household, and the median was 1400 SD. This depleted 0. 6 % of the annual income of the population. The mean monthly expenditure on malaria treatment per household was 2710 SD (2191) and the median was 1100 SD, depleting 5. 9 % of the monthly income of the population. In both instances, and in absolute terms, the expenditures were low for low income groups and for those residing in rural areas and camps. However, on relative terms households from low income groups and rural areas and camps suffer a greater burden. The expenditure on treatment per fully cured patient was 1391 SD (1334) and the median was 1070 SD. It was lower for those with Health Insurance Corporation coverage. It was higher for those who used health facilities, especially those of the private sector. Expenditure on drugs comprised the greatest proportion of all treatment expenditure (45. 1 %), and this proportion is anticipated to increase even more after the adoption of new combination therapy. It was concluded that malaria places a tremendous economic burden on households of Khartoum state especially those of low socioeconomic status and those residing in rural areas and camps. The relatively high treatment expenditure compared to preventive expenditure can be due to the high accessibility to health services in the Khartoum and low coverage by health insurance in one hand and low preventive measures uptake by the population on the other hand. It is thus recommended that this economic burden should be reduced through: • Increasing coverage by preventive measures to reduce treatment costs in long run. • Expanding coverage by health insurance. • Educating the population on how to channel their expenditure rationally and insuring rational use of drug at facility level. VIII • Studies to quantify the indirect cost of malaria including cost of treating malaria on an inpatient bases, should be conducted to reflect the whole burden that falls on households...|$|R
