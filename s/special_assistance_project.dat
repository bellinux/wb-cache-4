40|$|Recently, {{universities}} in Japan {{are expected to}} provide educational development assistance to developing countries. However, {{in the area of}} special education, no universities has yet carried out <b>assistance</b> <b>projects</b> to developing countries. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the <b>special</b> education <b>assistance</b> <b>project</b> Nepal, being conducted by Kangnam University (KU) in Korea. It was found that (1) the project is conducted in cooperation with an organization called I LOVE NEPAL (ILN) which is mainly run by Korean school teachers, (2) the inter-university exchange agreement among KU and Tribhuvan University (TU), Nepal has been utilized as a tool to nourish human resources in the area of special education in Nepal, (3) direct supporting progams have been provided by teachers of ILN to two special schools/institutes near Kathmandu, (4) students of KU have also been given the opportunity to take part as on-site volunteers for supporting children with disabilities overseas. It was found that having ties with a university in the country under an inter- university agreement was important for KU in conducting <b>assistance</b> <b>project</b> effectviely-especially in the area of human resources development in special education. At the same time conducting assitance project in cooperaiotn with TU and with ILN seemed to be crucial. Additionally, it can be pointed out that the <b>assistance</b> <b>project</b> was also benefical to KU by motivating its own students and cheating a positive image of the university from both inside and outside the university...|$|R

5000|$|The most {{significant}} achievement of Lacy's short time in government was his {{establishment of the}} <b>Special</b> <b>Assistance</b> Program in Victorian Primary Schools.https://archive.org/stream/AddressingDecliningLiteracyAndNumeracySkillsInVictorianPrimarySchools#page/n0/mode/1up [...] He outlined his ambitious program in a speech he made at a seminar of <b>Special</b> <b>Assistance</b> Resource Teachers in December 1980. In it he announced the {{most significant}} development in remedial education in Victoria with a strategic plan for addressing a reported decline in literacy and numeracy skills amongst secondary students. The totally new component of the <b>Special</b> <b>Assistance</b> Program was the provision of 1000 <b>Special</b> <b>Assistance</b> Resource Teachers [...] "in the delivery of services to children with special needs." [...] They were given [...] "a major on-site responsibility facilitating a productive relationship between parents and pupils and teachers."https://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech_862/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech#page/n0/mode/1up The program involved the training of these primary teachers as <b>Special</b> <b>Assistance</b> Resource Teachers and their placement in schools. Their role was the early detection and remediation of children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy.https://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement_912/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement#page/n0/mode/1up Lacy's greatest political disappointment came from the Cain Labour Government's actions after their 1982 election directed at de-emphasising and largely dismantling this educationally highly significant and ground breaking program.|$|R
