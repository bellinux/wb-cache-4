Units worked to complete protective and dispersal measures, while interceptors were armed and placed on alert status.|$|E

25|$|Unaware of the {{situation}} on the beaches because of a smoke screen laid by the supporting destroyers, Major General Roberts sent in the two reserve units: the Fusiliers Mont-Royal and the Royal Marines. At 07:00 the Fusiliers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Dollard Ménard in 26 landing craft sailed towards their beach. They were heavily engaged by the Germans, who hit them with heavy machine gun, mortar and grenade fire, and destroyed them; only a few men managed to reach the town. Those men were then sent in towards the centre of Dieppe and became pinned down under the cliffs and Roberts ordered the Royal Marines to land in order to support them. Not being prepared to support the Fusiliers, the Royal Marines had to transfer from their gunboats and motor boat transports onto landing craft. The Royal Marine landing craft were heavily engaged on their way in with many destroyed or disabled. Those Royal Marines that did reach the shore were either killed or captured. As he became aware of {{the situation}} the Royal Marine commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Phillipps, <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the stern of his landing craft and signalled {{for the rest of his}} men to turn back.

500|$|The clay for {{the bricks}} was dug from river banks (of the Waal, Rhine, and IJssel rivers) and other open-air locations, and was left outside (in a mound called the kleibult) {{through the winter}} so that any organic {{material}} could decay; the weather (rain, frost, drought) helped make the clay more manageable. At {{the end of this}} period the clay was mixed with sand and other materials, a process done by foot, by workers stomping on the clay. It was then molded into the proper shape by an artisan, the tichelaar ("brickmaker"). Children handed the brickmaker the raw material and removed the shaped bricks. Child labor was common in the industry: until well into the nineteenth century children eight years old and younger worked 16 hours per day, and children four years old stacked and carried bricks for hours at a stretch. Molds were moistened with water and strewn with sand to enable the shaped brick to be more easily removed. The [...] "raw" [...] or [...] "green" [...] stones were laid out in long rows to dry and when they were dry enough they were <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> their side so the bottom could dry; this work was often done by women and children. Often it was the women who did the much heavier labor of moving the dried bricks to the ovens, hauling wheelbarrows with loads of up to 80 kilograms, and stacking and preparing the ovens and tending to the fire (which burned peat or coal). Ovens came in two types—a single-use construction of the kind used in the production of charcoal, and a more permanent type, basically consisting of two walls one meter and a half thick. Ovens could hold up to a million bricks. Masonry bricks were fired between [...] and , klinkers between [...] and [...] Typically, bricks were baked at low heat for two weeks to remove all remaining moisture from the clay, and then for four weeks at a higher temperature, followed by two weeks of cooling down.|$|E

2500|$|The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) {{was created}} by act of Congress on 14 May 1942, {{permitting}} them to serve, but not as Soldiers. [...] At that time, women did not have military status and were not integrated into the Army. [...] Their ranks, pay, and benefits were different than the Army, along with all administration. [...] But, being a military organization that was modeled after, and parallel, to the Army, it required a way to train Officers; therefore it created its own WAAC OCS, which <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> 20 July 1942 at Fort Des Moines, Iowa. The course was six-weeks long, its first class consisting of 440 candidates. Upon graduation, the women were commissioned as third officers (equivalent to a second lieutenant). It is worth noting, that among the first candidates were 40 black women. [...] Initially, black women were segregated, but in keeping with Army policies, integrating officer training, and with pressure from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), by November 1942, they were being trained in integrated units.|$|E

2500|$|Luxury medieval {{books for}} the library had leather covers decorated, often all over, with tooling (incised lines or patterns), blind stamps, and often small metal pieces of furniture. [...] Medieval stamps showed animals and figures {{as well as the}} vegetal and {{geometric}} designs that would later dominate book cover decoration. [...] Until the end of the period books were not usually <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> shelves in the modern way. The most functional books were bound in plain white vellum over boards, and had a brief title hand-written on the spine. Techniques for fixing gold leaf under the tooling and stamps were imported from the Islamic world in the 15th century, and thereafter the gold-tooled leather binding has remained the conventional choice for high quality bindings for collectors, though cheaper bindings that only used gold for the title on the spine, or not at all, were always more common. Although the arrival of the printed book vastly increased the number of books produced in Europe, it did not in itself change the various styles of binding used, except that vellum became much less used.|$|E
2500|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} men who stayed in their places {{suffered}} less than those who ran away, as any movement worsened {{the effects of the}} gas, and that those who <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the fire step suffered less—indeed they often escaped any serious effects—than those who lay down or sat {{at the bottom of a}} trench. Men who stood on the parapet suffered least, as the gas was denser near the ground. The worst sufferers were the wounded lying on the ground, or on stretchers, and the men who moved back with the cloud. Chlorine was less effective as a weapon than the Germans had hoped, particularly as soon as simple countermeasures were introduced. The gas produced a visible greenish cloud and strong odour, making it easy to detect. It was water-soluble, so the simple expedient of covering the mouth and nose with a damp cloth was somewhat effective at reducing the effect of the gas. It was thought to be even more effective to use [...] urine rather than water, as it was known at the time that chlorine reacted readily with urea (present in urine) to form dichloro urea.|$|E

When a piece has been moved to a certain place it is <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> end, and called an [...] "owl (梟or驍) [...] ".
