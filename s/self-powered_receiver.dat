40|$|Employing a 40 -kW {{radio-frequency}} transmitter {{just west}} of Delta, UT, and operating at 54. 1 MHz, the TARA (Telescope Array RAdar) experiment seeks radar detection of extensive air showers (EAS) initiated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR). For UHECR with energies in excess of $ 10 ^{ 19 }$ eV, the Doppler-shifted "chirps" resulting from EAS shower core radar reflections should be observable above background (dominantly galactic) at distances of tens of km from the TARA transmitter. In order to stereoscopically reconstruct cosmic ray chirps, two remote, autonomous <b>self-powered</b> <b>receiver</b> stations have been deployed. Each remote station (RS) combines both low power consumption as well as low cost. Triggering logic, the powering and communication systems, and some specific details of hardware components are discussed. Comment: version accepted for publication in Nucl. Instr. Meth. ...|$|E
50|$|EnOcean GmbH is a venture-funded {{spin-off}} company of Siemens AG founded in 2001. It is a German company headquartered in Oberhaching, near Munich, which currently employs 60 employees in Germany and the USA. It is a technology supplier of <b>self-powered</b> modules (transmitters, <b>receivers,</b> transceivers, energy converter) to companies (e.g. Siemens Building Technologies, Distech Controls, Zumtobel, Omnio, Osram, Eltako, Wieland Electric, Pressac, Peha, Thermokon, Wago, Herga), which develop and manufacture products used in building automation (light, shading, hvac), industrial automation, and automotive industry (replacement {{of the conventional}} battery in tyre pressure sensors).|$|R
40|$|Decreasing {{size and}} power {{requirements}} of wearable microelectronics {{make it possible}} to replace batteries with systems that capture energy from the userâ€™s environment. Unobtrusive devices developed at the MIT Media Lab scavenge electricity from the forces exerted on a shoe during walking: a flexible piezoelectric foil stave to harness sole-bending energy and a reinforced PZT dimorph to capture heel-strike energy. Consumer reliance on wearable electronic devices has grown significantly in the past decade. With increasing use come demands for decreased size and enhanced capabilities, necessitating new ways to supply electric energy to these devices. Until now, chemical-cell batteries have been sufficient, but replacing them is a costly nuisance, and this solution will become less practical as demands evolve. Another approach is a centralized, body-worn power pack, with multiple distribution lines, but such a system will be cumbersome and impractical as the user wears more devices. Fortunately, as power requirements drop for body-worn devices, a third approach, which eliminates the power wiring problem, is emerging: developing and storing electric energy at the devices themselves by scavenging waste energy from human activities. For example, the average person spends {{a significant part of the}} day on foot, dissipating abundant energy into the insole of a shoe. Harnessed unobtrusively, this wasted energy could be used in a variety of low-power applications, such as pagers, health monitors, <b>self-powered</b> emergency <b>receivers,</b> radi...|$|R
