50|$|The bogies were {{slightly}} changed. They are supported, {{as on the}} 634's, by air bags, but are controlled by 4 air <b>suspension</b> <b>valves</b> on each coach (apart from 614 001 to 004). The resulting four-point support changes over to a three-point support at speeds below 25 km/h using a pressure control on the wheelset bearing, which deactivates one of the valves.|$|R

5000|$|The Honda NSR 150 SP is {{considered}} an introductory-level motorcycle, and featured technology unprecedented before on such a small bike. This includes Honda's famous pro-Arm <b>suspension,</b> RC <b>valves,</b> and Nika-Sil coated cylinders. The model was designed with a [...] "big bike" [...] look, and featured Repsol colours in a tribute to Michael Doohan.It has a power of [...] from its 150 cc engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{company also}} markets the {{patented}} Multimatic DSSV (Dynamic <b>Suspension</b> Spool <b>Valve)</b> damper through its Dynamic Suspensions brand. DSSV dampers {{are characterized by}} the use of spool valves in place of conventional flexible shims. Primary among benefits cited in the 2010 patent filing is the elimination of performance ambiguity associated with flexible shims, resulting in mathematically predictable, repeatable, and robust pressure-flow characteristics. Multimatic also claims damper-to-damper manufacturing variance within two percent in the case of their hand-built racing dampers (with closer-to-typical variance in road car applications), as compared to contemporary industry variance of up to twelve percent for shim dampers.|$|R
40|$|The nasal alar {{collapse}} is {{a common}} cause of respiratory obstruction. We report the case of 62 years woman with right nasal obstruction. Physical examination reveals the existence of nasal valve stenosis with right predominance. Surgical correction is performed by the <b>valve</b> <b>suspension</b> with surgical thread, using {{a variation of the}} Paniello´s technique, obtaining satisfactory results from the completion of surgery. This technique is proposed {{as an alternative to the}} different surgical techniques existing to date...|$|R
30|$|Figure 8 b {{shows the}} {{dependence}} of number of cycles on graphene concentration (P[*]=[*] 20  MPa, Ci[*]=[*] 10  mg/ml). As expected, the concentration was increased with increasing number of cycles. With 16  cycles, the concentration reached a maximum value of 0.4  mg/ml. However, further {{increasing the number of}} cycles, the concentration was basically unchanged. In the exploitation process by needle <b>valve,</b> passing the <b>suspension</b> through the <b>valve</b> more than once could result in the fragmentation of graphite, which was favorable for exploitation {{due to the fact that}} smaller graphite pieces are easier to delaminate into graphene than larger ones [25]. However, as the graphite flakes become smaller, the size of graphite was comparable with that of cavitation bubbles [39]. Therefore, the formation of new graphene flakes becomes difficult.|$|R
30|$|High {{pressure}} homogenization (HPH) is the pumping or {{movement of}} a slurry or cell <b>suspension</b> through a <b>valve</b> at high velocity resulting in shear forces that disrupt cell walls and membranes (Show et al. 2015; Günerken et al. 2015). Advantages include scalability and reproducibility and being chemical/enzyme/toxic substance (solvent) free (GEA Niro Soavi 2011). Disadvantages of HPH include {{the need for}} low dry cell weight concentrations (dilute suspensions) which increase energy demand (Lee et al. 2012) {{and the creation of}} small cell debris which increases separation costs (Barba et al. 2015). HPH is commonly used for disruption of Haematococcus cells for fish feed formulations (Chisti and Moo-Young 1986). Additionally, species containing cellulose, algaenan, or sporopollenin such as Chlorella and Nannocholorpsis could be disrupted with HPH. While HPH has proven utility in large-scale operation, high energy demands may limit the technique to recovery of high value products (Yap et al. 2015). HPH could additionally be applicable when cell lysates will be included as part of feed formulation and don’t require component fractionation. The technique is also suitable for cells with ECM that are thick-walled, exhibit limited permeability, and are resistant to lower energy mechanical treatments.|$|R
40|$|The {{abilities}} of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2 -mm sections of excised valve leaflets {{were obtained by}} punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in <b>suspensions</b> of bacteria. <b>Valve</b> sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques {{were used to determine}} the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. Comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51 Cr-labeled bacteria. For each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. Strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0. 003 - 0. 017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0. 00002 - 0. 00004). The organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man...|$|R
50|$|The British Motor Corporation {{was also}} an early adopter of {{interconnected}} suspension. A system dubbed Hydrolastic was introduced in 1962 on the Morris 1100 {{and went on to}} be used on a variety of BMC models. Hydrolastic was developed by suspension engineer Alex Moulton and used rubber cones as the springing medium (these were first used on the 1959 Mini) with the suspension units on each side connected to each other by a fluid filled pipe. The fluid transmitted the force of road bumps from one wheel to the other (on the same principle as the Citroen 2CV's mechanical system described above) and because each <b>suspension</b> unit contained <b>valves</b> to restrict the flow of fluid also served as a shock absorber. Moulton went on to develop a replacement for Hydrolastic for BMC's successor, British Leyland. This system manufactured under licence by Dunlop in Coventry, called Hydragas worked on the same principle but instead of rubber spring units it used metal spheres divided internally by a rubber diaphragm. The top half contained pressurised gas and the lower half the same fluid as used on the Hydrolastic system. The fluid transmitted suspension forces between the units on each side whilst the gas acted as the springing medium via the diaphragm. This is the same principle as the Citroen hydropneumatic system and provides a similar ride quality but is self-contained and doesn't require an engine-driven pump to provide hydraulic pressure. The downside is that Hydragas is, unlike the Citroen system, not height adjustable or self-levelling. Hydragas was introduced in 1973 on the Austin Allegro and was used on several models, the last car to use it being the MG F in 2002. The system was changed in favour of coil springs over dampers, due to cost reasons, {{towards the end of the}} vehicle's life. When it was decommissioned in 2006 the Hydragas manufacturing line was over 40 years old.|$|R
50|$|The pre-war European car {{market was}} not one market. Trade {{barriers}} fragmented it into national markets, apart from luxury cars where the extra cost of tariffs could actually make cars more exclusive and desirable. The only way for a car maker to enter another national market of a major European car making country, (and their colonial markets of the time), was to open factories there. For example, Citroen and Renault opened factories in England in this period. This situation only really changed with the post-war growth of the EEC (European Community) and EFTA. The British RAC (Royal Automobile Club) horsepower taxation system had the secondary function of excluding foreign vehicles. It was specifically targeted at the Ford Model T, which the then government feared would wipe out the fledgling indigenous motor industry. It crippled car engine design in Britain in the inter-war period, causing British car makers to produce under-square, low revving, long stroke engines. It was abolished after World War II {{as part of the}} British export drive for desperately needed, hard foreign currency, because it made British cars uncompetitive internationally. The technologically conservative 1930s Morris Eight, Ford Eight (Ford Model Y which was related to the German Ford Köln), and Standard Eight (Standard, later became Triumph) were named after their RAC horsepower car tax rating. The Ford Model Y had replaced the Model A in Europe in 1932 and ran until 1937. It was a much smaller and lighter car weighing a third less, with an engine two thirds smaller in capacity than the Model A. The basic Model Y 'Popular' was an important milestone in British economy cars, being the first steel-bodied four-seater saloon to sell for £100; previously the only four-wheeled car to sell for that price had been the two-seater tourer model of the Morris Minor. The Model Y was reworked into the more streamlined Ford 7Y for 1938-1939. This was restyled again into the 1939 launched Ford Anglia. Initial sales in Britain actually began in early 1940. Production was suspended in early 1942, and resumed in mid-1945. Production ceased in 1948 after a total of 55,807 had been built. The Anglia was restyled again in 1948. Including all production, 108,878 were built. When production as an Anglia ceased in October 1953, it continued as the extremely basic Ford Popular entry level car until 1959. The Ford Prefect was a differently styled and slightly more upmarket version of the Anglia launched in October 1938 and remained in production until 1941, returning to the market in 1945. The car was face lifted in 1953 from its original perpendicular or sit-up-and-beg style to a more modern three-box structure. It was sold until 1961. The Anglia, Popular and Prefect sold well for a long time despite their old fashioned technology using transverse leaf springs and beam axles for front and rear <b>suspension,</b> side <b>valve</b> engines and only partly synchromeshed three speed gearboxes. They sold on price because of limited car supply on the used car market due to the Second World War, and new car market because of the British government's post war policy of exporting cars. The Morris Eight, introduced in 1935, was a deliberate close copy of the Ford and served as a lower cost, more profitable replacement for the 1928-vintage Morris Minor which had not achieved the hoped-for success. Prices for the Morris started at £112 and it offered more equipment than the Ford and a much more modern design than the ageing Austin Seven, which meant it became the UK's bestselling car by 1939.|$|R
