5|$|Sejanus was {{so great}} a person by reason both of his {{excessive}} haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself {{seemed to be the}} emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> on the island of Capreae.|$|E
5|$|As Dean of Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan Swift {{spent every}} fifth Sunday preaching from the pulpit. Although {{many of his}} friends {{suggested}} that he should publish these sermons, Swift felt that he lacked the talent as a preacher to make his sermons worthy of publication. Instead, Swift <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> working more on political works, such as Drapier's Letters, and justified this by his lacking in religions areas.|$|E
5|$|Bammera Potana {{who lived}} in Vontimitta wrote his magnum opus Maha Bhagavatham in Telugu {{language}} and dedicated it to Rama. Vavilakolanu Subba Rao, known as ‘Andhra Valmiki’ for translating Valmiki’s Ramayana (the Hindu epic that narrates Rama's tale) into Telugu also <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> here worshipping Rama. The saint-poet Annamacharya {{is said to have}} visited the temple and composed and sang songs or kirtans in praise of Rama.|$|E

5|$|When Champollion {{submitted}} his Coptic {{grammar and}} dictionary {{for publication in}} 1815, it was blocked by Silvestre de Sacy, who {{in addition to his}} personal animosity and envy towards Champollion also resented his Napoleonic affinities. During his exile in Figeac, Champollion <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> revising the grammar and doing local archeological work, being for a time cut off from being able to continue his research.|$|E
5|$|Percy Shaw Jeffrey FRGS (14 March 1862 Cheltenham, England – 22 February 1952) was a {{respected}} English schoolmaster {{and author of}} several books on a range of topics, including significant contributions towards the teaching of phonetics in schools. Shaw Jeffrey taught at a variety of schools before spending sixteen years as headmaster at Colchester Royal Grammar School. With his wife, Alice, he retired first to South Africa, then to the town of Whitby, North Yorkshire, in 1916, where he <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> between numerous trips to countries around the world.|$|E

5|$|Soegija and {{his classmates}} sailed to Uden, in the Netherlands, {{to further their}} studies in 1919. In Uden Soegija spent a year further {{studying}} Latin and Greek, necessary for his preaching back in the Indies. He and his classmates adapted to Dutch culture. On 27September 1920 Soegija began his novitiate to join the Jesuits, {{the first of his}} classmates. While completing his studies at Mariëndaal in Grave, he was separated from much of the world and <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> in introspection. He completed his novitiate on 22September 1922 and was initiated into the Jesuits, taking their oath of poverty, chastity and obedience.|$|E
5|$|The Angels {{released}} Ramírez in March 2004, {{without being}} promoted beyond the Class A level. Disappointed, Ramírez considered retiring from baseball. With {{the advice of}} his father, Ramírez decided that as Major League Baseball pitchers often relied on a slider or curveball as a complimentary pitch to their fastball, he would develop a different pitch. Ramírez <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> that year learning a changeup on baseball fields in Miami, Florida, and did not pitch professionally during the 2004 season. Working with Maximo Soto, a fellow minor league pitcher released by the Angels, Ramírez developed his changeup to provide him with a new weapon in his pitching arsenal.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha {{spent his}} days near the hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, he <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} the sage Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha waited in that forest for Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the tale to be a later interpolation arguing {{that it does not}} appear in all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E

5|$|The Third Doctor {{was portrayed}} by Jon Pertwee. Sentenced to exile on Earth and {{forcibly}} regenerated {{at the end}} of The War Games, the Doctor <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> working for UNIT. After The Three Doctors, the Time Lords repealed his exile; however, the Doctor still worked closely with UNIT from time to time. The Third Doctor regenerated into his fourth incarnation as a result of radiation poisoning in the last moments of Planet of the Spiders.|$|E
5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E

5|$|Eliot {{began working}} on The Dry Salvages during World War II {{at a time when}} London was {{experiencing}} air-raids near the end of 1940. During the time, he moved around often and <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> writing mostly lectures or tiny poems. However, he was able to find time to work on the third poem that would become part of the Four Quartets: Eliot envisioned that Burnt Norton, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and a fourth, yet uncreated poem would be united in a set. Eliot wrote the poem quickly and sent the first draft off on 1 January 1941 to John Hayward. After Hayward received the draft, the two began corresponding about corrections and alterations to the poem. Geoffrey Faber joined in and then the poem was soon finished. It was published in the February 1941 issue of the New English Weekly.|$|E
5|$|In April 1876 he {{returned}} to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate. When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a Methodist minister's assistant. His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten; in 1876 {{he returned}} home at Christmas {{for six months and}} took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the position and <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French and German. He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic. According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.|$|E
5|$|In September 1989, Ferguson signed left-winger Danny Wallace from Southampton. Wallace {{was not a}} {{particularly}} successful buy for United, and was soon himself struggling to hold down {{a place in the}} first team, but the progression of Lee Sharpe meant that Milne was forced out of the first team picture at Old Trafford in 1989–90, making one substitute appearance in the league. During that season, as United struggled in the league but won the FA Cup, Milne was loaned out to Lou Macari's West Ham United, where he made the final appearance of his career in a League Cup tie on 24 January 1990 away to Derby County at the age of 28. His season was ended shortly afterwards after he picked up groin injury that required surgery. Despite being given a new one-year contract he began missing reserve team games during the 1990–91 season and instead <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> drinking.|$|E
60|$|But {{the cause}} of it,--as I came to know,--was that he was perpetually {{concerned}} with thinking about the next world. In fact he <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> whole <b>time</b> brooding over it.|$|R

5|$|It is {{not quite}} clear where Gaveston <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> abroad; the {{conditions}} of his exile banned him from staying {{in any of the}} lands of the English king. This precluded both Aquitaine and Ireland, where he had spent his previous exiles. There is some evidence that he might have gone to France initially, but considering the French king's hostile attitude towards him, he is not likely to have stayed there long. Flanders is a much more likely candidate for Gaveston's third and final exile. This time his absence was even shorter than the second time, lasting no more than two months. Returning around Christmas 1311, he was reunited with the King early in 1312, probably at Knaresborough on 13 January. The reason for his quick return might have been the birth of his child, a daughter named Joan, around this time. On 18 January, Edward declared the judgement against Gaveston unlawful, and restored all lands to him.|$|E
5|$|Politics was a {{frequent}} subject of discussion in the Bradley household, {{and some of his}} relatives held local and county political offices. He majored in history at Princeton, and was present in the Senate chamber when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. Van Breda Kolff and many others who knew him predicted that Bradley would be Governor of Missouri, or President, by 40. He <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> at Oxford focusing on European political and economic history. In 1978, he said that congressman Mo Udall, himself a former professional basketball player, had told him ten years earlier that professional sports could help prepare him for politics, depending on what he did with his non-playing time.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Berkman turned 12, {{his father}} died. The {{business}} {{had to be}} sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise {{as a student at}} the gymnasium, but his studies began to falter as he <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> reading novels. One of the books that interested him was Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, What Is to Be Done?, and Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.|$|E
