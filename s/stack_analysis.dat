The American Society of Mechanical Engineers Power Test Codes date back to 1915, but do not directly approach the subject of multiple fuels.

A set of ray-tracing simulations of gravitational lensing in f(R) gravity enables us to explore cosmological information on (i) stacking analyses of weak lensing observables and (ii) peak statistics in reconstructed lensing mass maps. For the f(R) model proposed by Hu & Sawicki, the measured lensing signals of dark matter haloes in the <b>stacking</b> <b>analysis</b> would show a 10 % difference between the standard ΛCDM and the f(R) model when the additional degree of freedom in f(R) model would be |f_ R 0 |∼ 10 ^- 5.

We obtain the full IR spectral energy distributions (SED) of subsamples of LBGs and derive the mean IR luminosity as a function of UV luminosity, UV slope, and stellar mass.
