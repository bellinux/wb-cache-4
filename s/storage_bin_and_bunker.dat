40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} lot {{aggregation}} optimization model for minimizing the traceability effort at a grain elevator. The problem involves blending of bulk grain to meet customer specifications. A mathematical multi-objective mixed integer programming (MIP) model is proposed with two objective functions. The objective functions allow in calculating the minimum levels of lot aggregation and minimum discounts {{that need to}} be applied to a shipment when the customer contract specifications are not met. Constraints on the system include customer contract specifications, availability of grain at the elevator and the blending requirements. The solutions include the quantities of grain lots from different bins to be used for blending for a shipment while using the minimum number of <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> <b>and</b> the total discounts to be applied. The numerical results are presented for two shipment scenarios to demonstrate the application of this model to bulk grain blending. The Pareto optimal solutions were calculated that represent the different optimal solutions for the blending problem. This provides the elevator management with a set of blending options. This model provides an effective method for minimizing the traceability effort by minimizing the food safety risk. Besides minimizing the lot aggregation, this model also allows in using the maximum volume of grain present in a given bin which leads to emptying of the <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> <b>and</b> the extent of aggregation of old grain lots with the new incoming lots can decrease considerably. Use of fewer bins for blending shipments is also easier logistically and can lead to additional savings in terms of grain handling cost and time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Provision of {{food has}} always been a {{challenge}} facing mankind. A major cornerstone in this challenge is the competition from insect pests. While some pestassociated losses occur when the crops are standing in the farms or greenhouses, others are caused during storage in grain elevators, <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> <b>and</b> granaries. These plant secondary metabolites may serve as repellents, antifeedants, phagostimulants or toxins against the insect pests. The worldwide trend to minimize the use of toxic substances on crops has led to several studies focusing on alternative post harvest technologies for crop preservation during storage. Studies of the use of secondary metabolites have been on the increase. This paper reviews some of the identified and isolated compounds from plant materials and their effects on numerous insect pests in post harvest storage...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This Screw {{conveyors}} {{are widely}} used for transporting and / or elevating particulates at controlled and steady rates.

This mixture can withstand the [...] temperature needed to pop corn and it produces little smoke. A fire under a boiler created steam that drove a small engine; that engine drove the gears, shaft, and agitator that stirred the corn and powered a small automated clown puppet-like figure, [...] "the Toasty Roasty Man," [...] an attention attracting amusement intended to drum up business. A wire connected {{to the top of the}} cooking pan allowed the operator to disengage the drive mechanism, lift the cover, and dump popped corn into the <b>storage</b> <b>bin</b> beneath. Exhaust from the steam engine was piped to a hollow pan below the corn <b>storage</b> <b>bin</b> <b>and</b> kept freshly popped corn uniformly warm for the first time. Excess steam was also used to operate a small, shrill whistle to further attract attention.|$|R

2500|$|Retiring {{from such}} a run early 5 April, O'Bannon sighted the Japanese {{submarine}} [...] {{on the surface and}} made to ram it. At the last moment, the officers decided that the sub may be a minelayer, and the rudder was turned hard to avoid the collision. [...] This action brought the destroyer directly alongside the sub. [...] As the Japanese sailors attempted to man their three-inch deck gun, the O'Bannons deck hands, not having side arms, grabbed potatoes from nearby <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> <b>and</b> pelted the Japanese with them. Thinking the potatoes were hand grenades, the submarine's sailors were too occupied with throwing them away from the sub to fire.
