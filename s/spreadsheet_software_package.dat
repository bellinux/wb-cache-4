50|$|Incremental computing, {{also known}} as {{incremental}} computation, is a software feature which, whenever a piece of data changes, attempts to save time by only recomputing those outputs which depend on the changed data. When incremental computing is successful, it can be significantly faster than computing new outputs naively. For example, a <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>software</b> <b>package</b> might use incremental computation in its recalculation feature, to update only those cells containing formulas which depend (directly or indirectly) on the changed cells.|$|E

40|$|Two {{equations}} {{are currently}} available for estimating soil volumetric heat capacity (pc) with the dual-probe heat-pulse (DPHP) method. One is simple but gives only approximate results because {{it assumes that}} the DPHP sensor releases an impulse of heat instantaneously. The other explicitly accounts for the finite duration of heating and gives exact results. Unfortunately, the equation that gives exact results involves the exponential integral function, which is not available in most computer <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> or data logger function libraries. In this note we introduce an approximation of the exact equation that contains only simple algebraic functions. The approximation consists of the first five terms of a Taylor series, which are written as a telescoped polynomial for computational purposes. For most applications of the DPHP method, the polynomial approximation gives estimates of pc that are at least {{an order of magnitude}} more accurate than estimates obtained from the simple equation based on instantaneous heating...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that graduates from a college of business curriculum should be proficient in the use three productivity tools: word-processing <b>software,</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>software,</b> and database software. In a prior study the consensus among both faculty and students in all disciplines was that application knowledge of productivity packages {{was the most important}} topic {{to be included in the}} business school computer literacy course. Two curriculum models are reviewed as to their views on the need to have a full course in the business school curriculum that includes instruction in the productivity tools of word-processing, spreadsheet, and database. The results of two student surveys, separated by two years, taken at a major mid-south university's college of business are presented and discussed. It was found that a majority of students enrolled in the computer literacy course reported having prior experience with word-processing and <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> and more than one half has prior experience with a microcomputer database package. It is also evident that the high schools that prepare our students for college are offering courses in all three of these productivity software systems. This raises two questions that need to be addressed. First, should a computer literacy course covering these three <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> still be a part of a student's for-credit program for graduation? And if not, how does the university ensure that its graduates are competent in these skills that their future employers expect them to have?

The convenience for passengers at this area is essential in order to gain more customers using the airports. In estimating the check-in counter arrangements, this thesis introduces a method that is based on <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> Two programs are developed to assist the optimization computations. The programs provide the optimum number of servers required at the airport. This will help airport management to select the number of counters at a given time. The results of the execution process of these two programs indicate the variables, such as earliness distribution, service time, queue system, and the check in counter sizes and configurations have strong influence to overall cost. A number of applications have been attempted and distribution has been explored. The results also demonstrated that under the condition imposed the multiple queue system provides less maximum queue length but longer waiting time compared to single queue system...|$|R

40|$|The {{repair kit}} {{problem is that}} of finding the optimal set of parts in the kit of a repairman. An {{important}} aspect of this problem, in many real-life situations, is that several job-sites are visited before a kit is restocked. In this paper, we present two heuristics for solving the multiple-job repair kit problem. Both heuristics {{can be used to}} determine a solution under the service-objective (minimal holding cost for a required job-fill rate) as well as the cost-objective (minimal expected total cost, including a penalty cost for each `broken' job). The `Job Heuristic (JH) ' almost always determines the exact optimal solution, as is shown in an extensive numerical experiment. However, it can not (easily) be used in cases where several parts of the same type may be needed on a job, or part failures are dependent, or the number of jobs in a tour varies. The `Part Heuristic (PH) ' is simpler and easy to use in these cases also. In fact, it can be applied in a <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>software</b> <b>package,</b> as we illustrate. The numerical experiments show that it s leads to near-optimal solutions (average `cost error' of less than 0. 1 per cent). Therefore, the PH is an excellent method for solving repair kit problems in practise...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{minimizing}} total energy usage {{is well known}} (if not well documented), and the techniques are widely practiced. Because {{of the way in}} which energy is sold, the total cost incurred may be affected even more strongly by the time-distribution of the energy usage, than by the total quantity used. A major subject of ECM is the MANAGEMENT of this time-distribution of energy usage, with the objective of minimizing of total energy costs to the user. A software package (named ECMES, Energy Cost Management Expert System) has been developed using the Lotus Symphony integrated <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>software</b> <b>package.</b> The ECMES application consists (currently) of three modules offering analyses of several aspects of electrical energy cost management (plus three corresponding modules for gas costs, which are not considered further). The Symphony ECM application modules have been developed over the last few years, largely on a spare time basis, by Professor W Monteith of Massey University's Production Technology Department. The analysis of Energy Cost Management on a PC is one which requires functions supplied by several standard software packages, particularly spreadsheet, graphics, database and expert system. The relatively recent availability of moderately priced and user-friendly expert system development packages has brought an additional set of powerful tools within the reach of the application developer. A Decision Support System (using an Expert System shell) has been developed, which is well integrated with the spreadsheet data, and with a database, to expand the functions of the original spreadsheet ECM analysis tool. Theoretical work on the data requirements and the production rules has opened up possibilities for future work...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the course}} of the last few decades {{simulation}} has evolved into one of the most powerful tools of operations research with applications in a wide range of fields. Despite the increasing usage of simulation, a number of inherent limiting factors have inhibited its growth and prevented it from developing into a technology of true mass appeal. The focus of this work is a method for overcoming many of the traditional limitations of simulation. ^ A formal treatise of modelling principles is presented in this study and given the name Generalized Integrated Simulation Technique or GIST. GIST models are based on a methodology involving the integration of a <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>software</b> <b>package</b> with a simulation language model and a base processing language. The synergy resulting from the interaction of the various software programs yields a relatively inexpensive, yet surprisingly powerful modelling system which has several substantial advantages over conventional simulation systems. The GIST methodology offers a significant contribution to the field of microcomputer simulation. ^ The principles of GIST are demonstrated in the work through their application to the development of a generic Airport Simulation System which is tailored to the Munich-Riem Airport. The large and complex nature of the airport plus the circumstances forcing it to operate almost continuously at a level very close to its maximum physical capacity make it an ideal subject for a simulation study of this type. ^ Among the most important feature of the Airport Simulation System are the stages of pre-processing, intermediate processing, and post-processing conducted by the spreadsheet software before, between, and after the various phases of simulation network and discrete event processing. In addition, the easy-to-operate and quick-to-update nature of the modelling system opens the door for non-experts in simulation to make frequent use of the system. ...|$|E

The development and use of a computer simulation program incorporating an interactive <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>software</b> <b>package</b> to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of cogeneration systems is described. Three hypothetical case studies including a comprehensive sensitivity analysis were completed to demonstrate the employment of the simulation program. The simulation can model cogeneration systems using either a gas turbine, internal combustion (IC) engine or steam turbine prime mover for both electrical and thermal load matching. The modeled systems can be arranged in either a simple or combined cycled configuration. The heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) model developed for the program incorporates a fixed surface effectiveness calculation and includes correlations for off-design performance. The HRSG can also be operated in a fired or unfired mode. The IC engine prime mover model also includes a water jacket energy recovery unit. The program simulates the system on an hourly and monthly basis using variable predefined daily and monthly profiles. The program also includes hourly and annual energy balances for the combined system. The economic results are in terms of conventional parameters including the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and the years to zero net present value (payback time). The three cases studies compared the operating costs of the current system to the cost of constructing and operating a cogeneration system and investigated their sensitivity to variations in the design condition parameters. The proposed cogeneration systems included: (1) a commercial laundry with a 400 kW IC engine with a waste heat recovery hot water heater in a simple cycle configuration, (2) a medium sized medical complex with a 1, 600 kW gas turbine prime mover with an HRSG in a simple cycle configuration, and (3) an industrial plant with a 17. 5 MW gas turbine prime mover, a 4 MW extraction steam turbine and a natural gas fired HRSG unit in a combined cycle configuration. The sensitivity analyses investigated the effect of the variations in at least 22 design and economic parameters for the percent change in the number of years to zero net present value for each case...|$|E

Although field work often goes smoothly, many surveys become bogged down in the analysis stage. With the availability of microcomputers and contemporary software, investigators in developing countries can use rapid survey methodology (RSM) to process, analyze, and report survey findings more quickly than ever before.
