40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop novel results on <b>self</b> <b>triggered</b> control of {{nonlinear}} systems, subject to perturbations, and sens-ing/computation/actuation delays. First, considering an unperturbed nonlinear system with bounded delays, we provide con-ditions that guarantee {{the existence of}} a <b>self</b> <b>triggered</b> control strategy stabilizing the closed–loop system. Then, considering parameter uncertainties, disturbances, and bounded delays, we provide conditions guaranteeing {{the existence of a}} <b>self</b> <b>triggered</b> strategy, that keeps the state arbitrarily close to the equilibrium point. In both cases, we provide a methodology for the compu-tation of the next execution time. We show on an example the relevant benefits obtained with this approach, in terms of energy consumption, with respect to control algorithms based on a constant sampling, with a sensible reduction of the average sampling time...|$|E
40|$|In {{networked}} systems, particularly over wireless or shared channels, {{the scarcity}} of communication resources makes the application of traditional control strategies with periodic sampling problematic. Alternative approaches with aperiodic sampling, such as: event triggered control and <b>self</b> <b>triggered</b> control, have been recently proposed to reduce network usage. Nonetheless, their features have not been exploited to propose less conservative hardware designs. Because hybrid nature of embedded systems along with aperiodic control executions lead to complicated infinite-state systems. In other words, deriving formal approaches for behavioral analysis of these systems is cumbersome. In this study, modeling the traffic generated by aperiodic control systems is of interest. By doing so, one can use the resulting models to guarantee correct functioning of networked control systems, for example in appropriate dimensioning of the underlying communication system or conducting schedulability analysis. We propose a technique to remove temporal and spatial dependencies to derive a timed automaton (or a quotient system) inspired by approaches in the literature. Based on the proposed construction technique, the timed automaton captures {{the behavior of the}} controlled system. The derivation of transitions in the timed automaton are based on reachability analysis of each region in the state space using the following facts: the state space is abstracted to a finite number of convex regions and the convexity of a set is preserved under a linear map. Two cases are considered and for each, LMI-based conditions are derived. First, a <b>self</b> <b>triggered</b> strategy, that is state dependent and based on Lyapunov Razumikhin stability conditions, is considered. The <b>self</b> <b>triggered</b> technique is modified to a more suitable formulation inspired by an approach in stability analysis of switched systems. We show that it suffices to only derive the sampling function for half of the state space and then generalize it to the whole state space with an appropriate mapping. Then, reachability analysis is used to derive the automaton. Second, it is shown that for a class of event triggered control systems, the triggering mechanism can be formulated as a quadratic function of states at triggering instants. Then, one can abstract away temporal and spatial dependencies in the triggering mechanism to derive a quotient system. For each region of the state abstraction, the lower and upper bounds of inter-execution intervals are derived. Then, a reachability analysis of dynamical systems is applied to outer approximate the reachable sets over the derived time intervals. Using the results from reachability analysis, the timed automaton is constructed. Delft Center for Systems and ControlMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a time}} {{dependent}} {{decrease in}} amplitude of H- and T-reflexes during Zero-G exposure and subsequently {{an increase in the}} amplitude of the H-reflex 2 - 4 hours after return to a 1 -G environment. These alterations have been attributed to the adaptation of the human neurosensory system to gravity. The Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) is an acknowledged method to determine the integrity of the monosynaptic reflex arc. However deep tendon reflexes (DTR's or T-reflexes), elicited by striking the tendon also utilize the entire reflex arc. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the variability in latency and amplitude of the two reflexes in healthy subjects. Methods: Nine healthy male subjects, 27 - 43 years in age, 161 - 175 cm in height plus 60 - 86 Kg in weight, underwent weekly testing for four weeks with a Dan-Tec EMG counterpoint EMG system. Subjects were studied prone and surface EMG electrodes were placed on the right and left soleus muscles. The H-reflex was obtained by stimulating the tibial nerve in the politeal fossa with a 0. 2 msec square wave pulse delivered at 2 Hz until the maximum H-reflex was obtained. The T-reflex was invoked by tapping the achilles tendon with a <b>self</b> <b>triggering</b> reflex hammer connected to the EMG system. The latencies and amplitudes for the H- and T-reflexes were measured. Results: These data indicate that the amplitudes of these reflexes varied considerably. However, latencies to invoked responses were consistent. The latency of the T-reflex was approximately 3 - 5 msec longer than the H-reflex.

40|$|Event-based state {{estimation}} can achieve estimation quality comparable to traditional time-triggered methods, {{but with a}} significantly lower number of samples. In networked estimation problems, this reduction in sampling instants does, however, not necessarily translate into better usage of the shared communication resource. Because typical event-based approaches decide instantaneously whether communication is needed or not, free slots cannot be reallocated immediately, and hence remain unused. In this paper, novel predictive and <b>self</b> <b>triggering</b> protocols are proposed, which give the communication system time to adapt and reallocate freed resources. From a unified Bayesian decision framework, two schemes are developed: self-triggers that predict, at the current triggering instant, the next one; and predictive triggers that indicate, at every time step, whether communication will be needed at a given prediction horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed triggers in trading off estimation quality for communication reduction is compared in numerical simulations.

Results indicated that the self-activated group learned the hitting task less effectively than controls. The findings reported here provide initial support for the self-invoking trigger hypothesis and future research directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{children}} with developmental disorders but without intellectual retardation are being enrolled in special supports schools. This {{research focuses on}} teachers who have the experience of supervising such children at special supports schools, conducting a questionnaire survey consisting of open-ended questions regarding the difficulties involved in providing support. Listed as issues posing difficulties in supporting {{children with}} developmental disorders were, for example, violent behavior for <b>self</b> defense, <b>triggered</b> by {{a strong sense of}} insecurity, and inconsiderate and thoughtless remarks made to other students, caused by difficulty in understanding others, stirring great impact on other students, it was found that. These teachers endured great hardships in dealing with various　behavior　problems　triggered by these disorders and were forced to deal with them {{with a high level of}} strain and tension, feeling their limitations as private individuals. The findings show that support of children with developmental disorders should not be entrusted only to their homeroom teachers. Positive supports should be provided to these teachers while creating a school-wide system for dealing with such children...|$|R
40|$|Financial- and Energy {{markets have}} one {{predominant}} characteristic in common: A large degree of uncertainty {{that drives the}} value of an investment in them. The thesis criticises the poor decision making support for investments into new generation capacity on base of pure cost comparison and NPV evaluations that is still prevalent in academic literature to judge nuclear energy systems. In order to separate investments into nuclear generation capacity from other real or financial investments, a classification into Very Large Industrial Real Investments, VLIRI, has been made. This special type of Giga investments acknowledges a high degree of irreversibility, a fuzzy economic assessment horizon and a long preparation and construction time. Additionally, evaluation of profitability is more complex as revenue streams are highly uncertain with often long lead times to achieve these risky cash flows. Regarding the nuclear fuel cycle there are numerous technical alternatives at all stages during the project lifetime, which create a high degree of optionality to react on this financial risk. The presented cross-disciplinary thesis explores Real Option Modelling as simulation tool to assess nuclear energy systems from a statistical and finance-mathematical point of view. Different numerical examples explain the idea of risk management in volatile energy markets and show why decision makers intuitively defer irreversible investments into new nuclear capacity. Heart of the analytical part of the thesis is the nuclear fuel cycle and the numerous Real Options that arise at its front- and back end. Although there are ambitious goals {{for the next generation of}} nuclear energy systems regarding sustainability, life-cycle cost advantages and the level of financial risk, there is little incentive for the generating industry to deviate from the once-through fuel cycle strategy. The thesis claims that a shift from a maximizing mean-rate of return attitude towards optimizing mean-variance behaviour might be a <b>self</b> <b>triggering</b> aspect for a more resource friendly fuel cycle. The thesis recognizes trade-offs between costs and financial risk in the nuclear fuel cycle and seeks to capture uncertain input parameters with geometric Brownian motion. The results are in coherence with current behaviour in nuclear energy markets: as costs for different fuel cycle steps fluctuate unpredictably over time, a delay of the decision on reprocessing and storage of spent nuclear fuel pays off. Diversification of the fuel cycle proves to be an efficient tool for risk management, such that a rational and risk aware investor would behave indifferently but not neglecting on behalf the use of MOX fuel and reprocessing strategies.

40|$|Losing {{a patient}} to suicide {{is one of the}} most taxing {{emotional}} issues psychiatrists, psychiatry trainees, and other mental health workers ever face. Balon (1) noted that “we find it emotionally more tolerable to see our patients dying of cancer than of suicide. ” Some psychiatrists reported stress levels in the weeks after a patient’s suicide comparable to levels reported in people seeking treatment after the death of a parent (2). Younger, less-experienced clinicians are more affected by patient suicide than older clinicians (2), and the psychological impact of patient suicide may be especially pronounced in trainees (3). The most junior psychiatry trainees often care for the most challenging patients in minimally-structured settings (3). Poor outcomes may have profound effects on the trainee’s developing sense of <b>self</b> and may <b>trigger</b> feelings of persona...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrimary Sjögren's {{syndrome}} is an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates {{and destruction of}} the salivary and lacrimal glands, and systemic production of autoantibodies to the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La, leading to clinical symptoms of dryness of the mouth and eyes (sicca syndrome). Autoreactive T cells bearing the CD 4 molecule may recognize an unknown <b>self</b> antigen, <b>triggering</b> autoimmunity in the salivary and lacrimal glands. Although several candidate autoamigens including α fodrin {{have been reported in}} Sjögren's syndrome, the pathogenic roles of the autoantigens in initiation and progression of SS are still unclear. It is possible that individual T cells activated by an appropriate self antigen can proliferate and form a restricted clone. Recent evidence suggests that the apoptotic pathway plays a central role in making T cells tolerant to tissue-specific self antigen, and may drive the autoimmune phenomenon. We recently reported that tissue-specific apoptosis in estrogen-deficient mice may contribute to autoantigen cleavage, leading to the development of autoimmune exocrinopathy. The studies reviewed imply that tissue-specific apoptosis and caspase-mediated α fodrin proteolysis are involved in the progression of autoimmune lesions in Sjögren's syndrome. Moreover, Fas ligand (FasL) and its receptor Fas are essential in the homeostasis of the peripheral immune system. It is considered that a defect in activation-induced cell death (AICD) of effector T cells may result in the development of autoimmune exocrinopathy in Sjögren's syndrome...|$|R
40|$|This {{study of}} the {{dynamics}} of shafi’ite school tried to uncover the diversity of the views regarding certain problems among the scholars of Shafi’ite school and between particular scholar and the imam Shafi’i himself. This focus deal with the dynamics existed in the Shafi’ite books. It should be done in the wise manner, for the dynamics it <b>self</b> was <b>triggered</b> by the certain situation and condition, different contexts, space, time, geography, circumstance and the condition of the nature that give birth to the different legal regulation. To understand the dynamics that occurred in those Shafi’ite books easily, we may borrow the rules of Arabic syntax namely ‘ilm nahw, associated with the rule of istitsna’ which consisted of six letters; illa, ‘adaa, siwa, ghairu, khala and hasya. Those six letters have the same function that is the exemption, but the usage of each letter in the sentence has different rule in Arabic grammar. The dynamics rise dualism of Islamic jurisprudence in Aceh, in which the sharia court refer to the Compilation of Islamic Jurisprudence, while tengku (local muslim scholars) in Dayah refer to the turas book of Shafi’ite school. Slowly, the friction started between the legal decision issued by the sharia court and the fatwas issued by the tengku of Dayah (local Islamic boarding school), for instance, the issue of talaq, inheritance and other legal issues...|$|R
