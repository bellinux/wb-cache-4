50|$|There {{were many}} {{shapes and sizes}} for scalders {{depending}} on materials used to construct it and how much was spent on it. In general, a pig <b>scalder</b> looks like a very large pot or tub. It would be made of wood or metal, though a metal <b>scalder</b> meant that you could build a fire beneath the <b>scalder</b> in order to heat the water inside. In New Zealand, many farmers use their old cast iron bathtubs for this job, but the tubs are becoming harder to acquire. Metal scalders were also easier to clean after use.|$|E

It was closely connected with other offices of the kitchen, such as the saucery and the scullery.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, pigs {{are first}} {{rendered}} unconscious {{using one of}} the following means: stunning using electric current applied with electrodes, or stunning using captive bolt pistol, and inhalation of CO2, then in some cases a [...]22 pistol/rifle which is shot directly into the brain. They are then hoisted on a rail, after which they are exsanguinated, usually via the carotid artery and the jugular vein. After the blood is gone, the carcass is drenched in hot water in a device called a pig <b>scalder</b> which helps in the removal of hair, which is subsequently completed by using scissor-like devices and then if necessary with a torch. However, in many countries across the world, rendering the pig unconscious is not standard practice and exsanguination occurs whilst the pigs are fully conscious.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Scald {{water and}} whole carcass rinse samples were {{collected}} on 9 different d in a commercial broiler processing plant operating adjacent lines that processed birds from the same flock simultaneously. A conventional, single-tank, two-pass <b>scalder</b> was installed on one line and the other line had a three-tank, two-pass, counterflow <b>scalder</b> in which water mixed across the two lines of carcasses within each tank. Water samples from the turn around point in each tank were analyzed for aerobic bacteria and suspended solids. At {{the same time that}} water samples were taken, six carcasses were removed from the processing line immediately after feather removal and rinsed in 100 mL of phosphate-buffered saline; recovered rinse solution was analyzed for aerobic bacteria using a most probable number procedure. Estimated numbers of aerobic bac-teria were significantly reduced in the third tank of the counterflow <b>scalder</b> compared to the second tank, or compared to the single tank of the conventional <b>scalder.</b> Despite the differences in aerobic bacteria between scald tanks, numbers of aerobic bacteria in carcass rinses were not affected by <b>scalder</b> design.

40|$|THE {{tenderness}} {{of turkey}} meat {{has been reported}} to be affected by various processing techniques. Shannon et al. (1957) observed that length of time in the <b>scalder</b> and scald temperature had a marked effect upon the shear values obtained from the breast muscles of chickens. Similar results were reported by Wise and Stadelman (1959) who ob-served that toughening was due to the length of time in the <b>scalder,</b> the scald temperature, and the depth to which the temperature had penetrated. By aging turkeys for 24 hours before processing, Wise and Stadelman (1961) were able to eliminate any toughening effects due to overscalding even when the skin was re-moved from the breast area. From these results, these workers concluded that the toughening effect of excessive scalding was a direct function of tissue temperature during the early post-mortem period, and that the presence of any substance such as skin or an environment of lower tem-perature during the early post-mortem period tended to reduce or overcome the scald effect. Wise and Stadelman (1957) reported on the toughening effect produced by me-chanical feather pickers. The more severe the beating process or the longer the pe-riod of beating, the tougher the meat be-came. Pool et al. (1959) confirmed the earl...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the timing and duration of slaughter processes on pork quality was evaluated. The results demonstrate that reducing the time to evisceration {{is less important than}} reducing the time to the initiation of carcass chilling. A shortened interval between stunning and cooling can be accomplished by decreasing time allowed for blood removal (dwell time) and scalding. A dwell time of 3 min should allow harvest facilities to maximize profits from blood yields and allow carcasses to enter the <b>scalder</b> at an earlier time postmortem. Lengthening the duration of scalding may result in a more rapid postmortem pH decline.

40|$|Proceedings of the 2011 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11, 12, and 13, 2011, Athens, Georgia. In 2009, Georgia’s poultry {{industry}} slaughtered and further processed more than 1. 3 billion chickens, {{more than any}} other state, utilizing 7 gallons (26 L) of potable water per carcass and generating over 9 billion gallons of high-strength poultry processing wastewater (PPW). The conversion of a live chicken into safe and wholesome meat products suitable for human consumption takes place in a series of processing steps. Each step of the process utilizes potable water and generates by-products that combine to form the facility’s wastewater stream. Research within the Poultry Science and Bio & Ag Engineering Departments at the University of Georgia is establishing both the variation individual birds have effecting PPW, as well as determining which by-products have the greatest PPW impact. Early experiments have shown that blood plays a major role impacting PPW. Results show that PPW <b>scalder</b> samples collected from groups of broilers bled for 60 seconds had average chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total solids (TS) levels of 9. 86 g and 8. 12 g, respectively. Conversely, carcasses bled for 120 seconds averaged COD and TS levels of 6. 49 g and 5. 43 g, respectively. Increasing bleed time to 120 sec from 60 sec resulted in mean percent reductions of COD 34 %, TS 33 %, TSS 34 %, TVS 36 %, and TKN 29 % in <b>scalder</b> PPW.

40|$|Upon {{entering}} a poultry processing facility, birds are already contaminated {{with a variety}} of microorganisms. It {{is the responsibility of the}} processor to reduce these numbers to deliver a wholesome product to customers. This is not an easy task as there are ample opportunities for further microbial contamination. Some of these opportunities are obvious. For example, any areas where contaminants could be washed off one bird and onto another are always an area for concern, i. e. the <b>scalder</b> or the chiller. There are numerous opportunities for contamination that are not so obvious. These incidents of contamination are not necessarily due to the process itself, but could possibly be more related to the management of the process or a lack of understanding of how each part of the process affects the entire system. This includes practices related to water usage, water content, temperature management, and chemical usage. This review will describe common practices from live hang to post chill that could possibly be contributing to elevated microbial counts on whole bird carcasses (WBCR) at post chill. This will give a better understanding of environmental factors, practices, and situations within the processing facility that could be fostering or encouraging increased levels of bacterial contamination. Identifying these areas will enable processors to take a more informed examination of each facility with the intention of reducing microbial populations on broiler carcasses...|$|E

Raw poultry and poultry products are {{a significant source of}} zoonotic bacterial pathogen transmission; thus the sensitive detection of major zoonotic pathogens (Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, and Listeria monocytogenes) is a vital food safety issue. Recently, third generation PCR technology, known as droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has been devel-oped to be more accurate and sensitive to detect genetic targets than current quantification methods, but this technology has not been tested within an industrial setting. There is an on-going study within our laboratory is investigating the effects of sampling times and sampling methods on the cultural and molecular (via qPCR) quantification of dominant zoonotic pathogens within a poultry processing facility. This presents a unique opportunity to compare the quantification resulted from this emerging, third generation technology to traditional quantification methods currently employed by the poultry industry.

The system involved chlorination of cooling water from compressorsand its successive reuse as feed water for the chiller, prechiller, washer and finally for makeup in the <b>scalder.</b> In all four units poultry carcasses are immersed in water. Process waters in the prechiller and washer were purified alternatively by a pressure leaf filter. Response-surface analysis demonstrated variable interacting effects of water rate, chlorine dosage and process time on the chemical and bacterial qualities of the processed carcasses, and water used in the immersion processes. Models were developed for prediction {{of the effect of}} operating conditions on poultry quality. Long-term studies at the plant indicated that successive utilization of prechlorinated water in a multiple system did not result in significant buildup of contaminants (total and coliform counts) and organic pollutants (grease, nitrogen compounds, BOD and COD) in the immersion tanks.

40|$|Suspended {{bacteria}} were enumerated in scald {{water and}} carcass rinse samples from a commercial broiler chicken processing plant with a multiple-tank, counterflow <b>scalder.</b> Coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter were enumerated and the Most Probable Number (MPN) of salmonellae was determined in water samples {{from each of}} three scald tanks, from a dip tank located between defeathering machines, and in rinses of carcasses removed from the processing line immediately after defeathering. Mean coliform concentrations in Tanks 1, 2, and 3 were 4. 6, 2. 5, and 1. 6 log 10 (cfu/ml), respectively. E. coli concentrations followed the same pattern with means of 4. 4, 2. 1, and 1. 4 in Tanks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with significant differences (P< 0. 05) in the concentrations of both coliforms and E. coli between tanks. Mean Campylobacter concentration in four positive samples from Tank 1 was 4. 0 log 10 (cfu/ml), but only one water sample from Tank 2 and none from Tank 3 were Campylobacter positive. Coliforms and E. coli were found in dip tank samples in only two instances, with no isolations of Campylobacter or salmonellae. Mean numbers of coliforms, E. coli, and Campylobacter in carcass rinses were 3. 1, 2. 7, and 3. 3 log 10 (cfu/ml).

40|$|Poultry {{slaughtering}} {{encompasses a}} series of processing steps {{with the objective of}} harvesting the consumable meat. The scalding process consists of the submersion of carcasses in hot water tanks to facilitate the removal of feathers during slaughter. However, the use of a common scalding tank increases the likelihood of carcass cross contamination considering that dirt, fecal material and even digestive and intestinal contents carrying pathogens and other bacteria are widely spread during this operation. Similar cross contamination occurs in the process of chilling carcasses, which also requires submersion of broilers in communal tanks filled with ice and cold water. A plausible approach to reduce contamination in scalders or chillers is the use of Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) to decontaminate scalder/ chiller water. PEF uses electricity to kill bacteria suspended in liquid media and could be utilized in poultry scalders and chillers to reduce bacterial contamination on carcasses and reduce the potential risk of pathogens reaching the final consumer. A pilot scale system was assembled by the use of a pulse electric field generator (Model SF- 700, Simmons. Eng. Co., Dallas, GA) coupled with a commercial scalding tank (Dunkmaster?, Knase Company Inc, MI). C. coli and C. jejuni along with marker strains of Novobiocin and Nalidixic acid resistant S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis strains were used in challenge studies evaluating the effects of the PEF on carcasses, <b>scalder</b> and chiller water contamination. The system was evaluated with 0, 0. 5, and 1 % sodium chloride in the water with 40 volts of electric current and 0. 54 of amperage. Samples were collected at 0, 40, 80, 160, 200 s of treatment with a 10 s on, 5 s off cyclical pulses. The use of PEF in regular scalder/chiller water showed little effect on Salmonella and Campylobacter reductions. However, with the addition of 0. 5 % NaCl caused a significant (P< 0. 5) log CFU/ml reduction of Salmonella and Campylobacter within the scalder/chiller water at 40, 80, and 160 seconds respectively...|$|E
40|$|One {{objective}} of the present investigation was to compare Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery incidence from commercially processed turkeys immediately prior to and following pre-chill and immersion chiller intervention strategies being used in three distinct turkey processing facilities. In each plant, on a single day of processing, 100 carcass rinse samples prior to and following each post-evisceration, pre-chill intervention and following immersion chilling were obtained for Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery. Two of three plants demonstrated a trend of decreased Salmonella on carcasses following the Inside Outside Bird Wash (IOBW), with reductions of 13 %, and 11 % being observed for Plants 1 and 2, respectively. Results for reductions of Campylobacter contamination were not as straightforward, with only Plant 3 showing decreased levels (11 % reduction) following the IOBW. Plant 2 used an additional pre-chill intervention, a low pressure, acetic acid final wash, which was not shown {{to be effective in}} causing an additional reduction in either Salmonella or Campylobacter on carcasses. In all three plants, properly managed immersion chilling systems were the most effective microbial intervention for achieving Salmonella andCampylobacter reduction on processed turkey carcasses. While not as effective, the IOBW present in each plant likely contributed to the effectiveness of immersion chiller interventions. If managed properly these intervention points have demonstrated themselves as a viable means to effectively reduce Salmonella and Campylobacter on processed turkeys. Another objective was to modify the <b>scalder</b> environment to an alkaline pH and determine the effects of thermal killing of Salmonella and Campylobacter. In each plant, on a single day of processing, 50 carcass rinse samples prior to and following scald tank immersion and following feather removal were obtained for Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery. Modification of the scald water to alkaline conditions (pH 9 - 10) did not result in increased thermal killing of Salmonella or Campylobacter on turkey carcasses, as hypothesized before the investigation. Alkaline conditions are known to facilitate a more efficacious pluck and aid in the detachment of bacteria. Due to this, the bacteria that were recovered at these points on the processing line could have {{had an impact on the}} observed data...|$|E
