Since the condition was not met, Princess Benedikte's children are not deemed to have <b>succession</b> <b>rights</b> and are not included in the official line of succession. It is unclear when exactly they lost their <b>succession</b> <b>rights,</b> whether their own descendants will have <b>succession</b> <b>rights</b> if raised in Denmark and whether their exclusion from the line of succession is constitutional, leading the Danish jurist Henrik Zahle to argue that the children of the Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg do have <b>succession</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

50|$|The 1297 {{feoffment}} of Sardinia by Pope Boniface VIII led to {{the creation}} of the Aragonese Kingdom of Sardinia and a long period of war between the Aragonese and Sardinians, ending with a Catalan victory at Sanluri in 1409 and the renunciation of any <b>succession</b> <b>right</b> signed by William III of Narbonne in 1420. During this period the clergy adopted Catalan as their primary language, relegating Sardinian to a secondary status. According to attorney Sigismondo Arquer (Cagliari, 1530 - Toledo, 4 giugno 1571), author of Sardiniae brevis historia et descriptio in Sebastian Münster's Cosmographia Universalis, Sardinian prevailed in rural areas and Catalan was spoken in the cities, where the ruling class eventually became bilingual in both languages; Alghero is still a Catalan-speaking enclave on Sardinia to this day.|$|E

In 1258 John of Ibelin, lord of Jaffa, and Bohemund VI of Antioch brought Hugh and Plaisance to Acre, where Hugh was set up as regent for Conradin, and Plaisance was chosen to carry out Hugh’s regency while he remained underage, becoming Lord of Jerusalem.|$|E
50|$|On 27 February 1971, at Lyngby, Denmark, Christian married Anne Dorte Maltoft-Nielsen (3 October 1947, Frederikssund - 2 January 2014, Copenhagen) who thus became Her Excellency Countess Anne Dorte of Rosenborg. Although {{lacking the}} prior royal assent of the monarch {{given in the}} Council of State that the law required, the king {{expressed}} no personal opposition to his nephew's choice of bride and, according to Christian, the king's private consent later had to be formally registered by the King-in-Council. In a 1985 interview with Billed-Bladet, Count Christian had explained (translated from Danish):As protocol dictates, I had to ask my uncle, King Frederick IX, {{if he had any}} objections to my getting engaged...I knew I would have to renounce my title of prince and my right of succession if I married her. I was number four in the line of succession after Princess Margrethe, Princess Benedikte, and my father.

50|$|After {{the death}} of Haakon VI of Norway in 1380, his son Olav IV of Norway succeeded to both the thrones of Norway and Denmark and also claimed the Kingdom of Sweden, holding its westernmost provinces already. Only after his death {{at the age of}} 17 his mother Margaret managed to oust their rival, king Albert, from Sweden, and thus united the three Scandinavian kingdoms in {{personal}} union under one crown, in the Kalmar Union. Olav's death extinguished yet one Norwegian male royal line; he was also the last Norwegian king to be born on Norwegian soil for the next 567 years.After {{the death of}} Olav IV of Norway in 1387, the closest in line to the succession was the Swedish king Albert of Mecklenburg.

5000|$|Danish law never {{required}} that royal spouses be of aristocratic origin. Nonetheless, no prince's {{marriage to a}} woman who lacked male-line descent from royalty or titled nobility had been accepted as dynastic by the sovereign in the course of Denmark's history as a hereditary monarchy, prior to the marriage of the heir to the throne, Princess Margrethe, in June 1967. Moreover, six months later Margrethe's first cousin, Prince Ingolf of Denmark, married an untitled commoner and was demoted to a count, and another cousin, Prince Christian of Denmark, also wed a Dane, Anne Dorte Maltoft-Nielsen, in 1971, forfeiting his dynastic position. Christian later commented on the dynasty's marital rules in the Danish periodical, Billed-Bladet: As protocol dictates, I had to ask my uncle, King Frederick IX, if he had any objections to my getting engaged ...
