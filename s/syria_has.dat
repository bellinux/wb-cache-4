5|$|Syria {{missed a}} 15 March {{deadline}} for destroying its 12 chemical weapons production facilities. <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> proposed to instead render the facilities inoperable by sealing their entrances; the U.S. {{and its allies}} oppose this proposal and insist on destruction.|$|E
5|$|Also {{exceptionally}} challenging will be {{the movement}} and destruction of deadly agents such as sarin, VX nerve agents and mustard agent during the civil war. The chemical weapons convention disallows movement of such deadly agents outside the country holding them, but Security Council Resolution 2118 allows extraordinary measures {{to be taken in}} Syria. Some of the chemicals will need to be transported along the highway between Damascus and Homs, which is still contested as of December 2013. <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in safe transport of the chemicals. In February 2014, Syria stated that rebels had attempted to attack two convoys transporting chemical weapons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> {{publicly}} hanged people, such as two Jews in 1952, Israeli spy Eli Cohen in 1965, and {{a number}} of Jews accused of spying in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|Ever since {{war broke}} out in the country, <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> been banned from playing home games in their own country and in fact were one day away from being thrown out of the 2018 World Cup only for Malaysia to swoop in the last minute and host all of <b>Syria's</b> home games. <b>Having</b> said that, <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> had a large upturn in fortune as they made it to 2018 FIFA World Cup {{qualification}} - AFC Third Round and are now within touching distance of qualifying {{for the first time in}} their history.|$|R
5000|$|... gave $24 {{million for}} {{refugees}}. and granted asylum to over 1,000. About 5,000 refugees have settled in Russia since 2012. Five hundred Christian refugees settled in Sochi. Circassians in <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> been {{returning to their}} historic homelands in Circassia. The Chechen and Ossetian diasporas in <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> also sought {{to return to their}} Caucasus homelands.|$|R
50|$|Western {{non-governmental}} organizations stated they believed <b>Syria</b> <b>had</b> an active chemical weapons program.|$|R
25|$|Turkey's {{boundary}} with <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> {{not been}} accepted by Syria. As {{a result of}} the Treaty of Lausanne, the former Ottoman Sanjak (province) of Alexandretta (present-day Hatay Province) was ceded to the French which administered it on behalf of the League of Nations. However, in June 1939 the people of Hatay had formed a new independent State and immediately after, the parliament voted to unite with Turkey. Since achieving independence in 1946, <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> harbored a lingering resentment and this issue has continued to be an irritant in Syrian-Turkish relations.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. National Air and Space Intelligence Center {{reported}} in 2009 that Syria possessed road-mobile Scud-D and Tochka missiles, {{with fewer than}} 100 launchers. In addition <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> aircraft and artillery delivery systems.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> signed written {{agreements}} {{with its neighbors}} on transboundary rivers, none of these agreements is an international treaty {{that would have to}} be ratified by the Parliaments of the respective countries. The agreements are rather non-binding memorandums of understanding.|$|E
5000|$|Lebanon and Syria: Israel's borders with Lebanon and <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> {{sophisticated}} security barriers.|$|R
50|$|By {{the first}} half of 2013, 432 {{citizens}} of <b>Syria</b> <b>had</b> requested asylum in Serbia.|$|R
50|$|The {{governments of}} Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> honored Capucci with postage stamps.|$|R
25|$|One {{tenth of}} one percent of female workers in Bangladesh are {{employers}} despite the nation's sizable female labor pool. This number is one eighth of the percentage of Syrian women who are employers. <b>Syria</b> <b>has,</b> of course, only one eighth the population of Bangladesh. In majority Muslim countries, very few women and a small percentage of women who do work are employers.|$|E
25|$|Syria is a {{signatory}} to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and {{has repeatedly}} attempted to purchase small research type nuclear reactors from China, Russia, Argentina, or other countries. Despite these purchases being openly disclosed and IAEA monitored, international pressure has caused all these reactor purchases to be cancelled. <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> open and IAEA monitored nuclear research programs including a Chinese made non-reactor miniature neutron source.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Israel began {{operating}} a pumping station that diverts {{water from the}} Sea of Galilee to the National Water Carrier. Also in 1964, Jordan constructed a channel that diverted water from the Yarmouk River, another main tributary of the Jordan River to the East Ghor Canal. <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> also built reservoirs that catch the Yarmouk's waters. Environmentalists blame Israel, Jordan and Syria for extensive damage to the Jordan River ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Jews in <b>Syria</b> <b>had</b> {{distinctive}} dialects of Judaeo-Arabic. They are {{not known}} to have any current speakers.|$|R
50|$|Populations in Turkey and <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> {{long been}} treated as Bembecia pontica, which is now {{considered}} a synonym.|$|R
25|$|By {{the sixth}} and final day (June 10) <b>Syria</b> <b>had</b> lost {{approximately}} 100 combat aircraft and the fighting was over.|$|R
25|$|<b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> {{been home}} to Christianity from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE onwards. The {{majority}} of Syrian Christians are once Western Aramaic speaking but now largely Arabic speaking Arameans-Syriacs, with smaller minorities of Eastern Aramaic speaking Assyrians and Armenians also extant. While religious persecution has been relatively low level compared to other Middle Eastern nations, many of the Christians have been pressured into identifying as Arab Christians, with the Assyrian and Armenian groups retaining their native languages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> {{repeatedly}} {{requested that}} Israel re-commence peace {{negotiations with the}} Syrian government. The United States demanded that Israel desist from even exploratory contacts with Syria to test whether Damascus is serious in its declared intentions to hold peace talks with Israel. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was forceful in expressing Washington's view on the matter to Israeli officials that even exploratory negotiations with Syria {{are not to be}} attempted. Israel has thus far obeyed Washington's demand to desist.|$|E
25|$|Since 2004, <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> {{accepted}} {{the import of}} apples from farmers in the Golan Heights, territory that it claims, through the Quneitra crossing. This {{was a result of}} the ongoing Israeli refusal to accept apples from Golan farmers (reportedly due to over-supply), which led to a plea by the farmers to the Syrian government to accept their produce before it became spoiled in order to prevent economic collapse. In 2010, some 10,000 tons of apples grown by Druze farmers in the Golan Heights were sent to Syria.|$|E
50|$|The Scouts of <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> a {{national}} training center at Al-Zabadani, {{where the first}} Arab Jamboree was held in 1954.|$|R
50|$|<b>Syria</b> <b>had</b> 528,616 {{registered}} Palestinian {{refugees in}} January 2015. There were 9 UNRWA refugee camps with 178,666 official Palestinian refugees.|$|R
50|$|As Iran and <b>Syria</b> <b>had</b> {{indicated}} {{they would not}} travel to Palestine, {{they would not be}} drawn into the group hosted by Palestine.|$|R
25|$|On 30 January 2013, {{about ten}} jets bombed a convoy {{believed}} to be carrying Russian-made SA-17 anti-aircraft missiles to Lebanon. The attack, attributed by some media reports to Israeli airforce, {{did not result in}} any counterattacks from Syria, although <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> said it reserves the right to retaliate. Western intelligence sources reported that Iranian general Hassan Shateri had been killed in the airstrike. Iran acknowledged his death {{at the hands of the}} Israelis without further details. Israel refused to comment on its involvement in the incident.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} {{there seemed to}} be {{confusion}} {{about the extent to which}} Syria was willing to withdraw from Lebanon. Arab League head Amr Moussa declared that Syrian president Assad promised him a phased withdrawal over a two-year period, but the Syrian Information Minister Mahdi Dakhlallah said that Moussa had misunderstood the Syrian leader. Dakhlallah said that Syria will merely move its troops to eastern Lebanon. Since then, <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> declared that Resolution 1559 will be fully complied with, and in a matter of months rather than years.|$|E
25|$|Research in <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> {{shown that}} {{developments}} there were {{quite different from}} those in the Diyala Region or Southern Iraq, rendering the traditional Lower Mesopotamian chronology useless. During the 1990s and 2000s, attempts were made by various scholars to arrive at a local Upper Mesopotamian chronology, resulting in the Early Jezirah (EJ) 0–V chronology that encompasses everything from 3000–2000 BC. The use of the ED I–III chronology is now generally limited to Lower Mesopotamia, with the ED II sometimes being further restricted to the Diyala Region, or discredited altogether.|$|E
50|$|The Turkish-Syrian {{relationship}} showed great improvement when Turkey and <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> cancelled entry visas {{and signed}} joint declaration of strategic council in 2009.|$|R
50|$|On 26 July 2012, Firas Tlass {{expressed}} {{his support for}} Bashar Assad’s resignation. He further declared that he had provided the Farouq Brigades in the Free Syrian Army, commanded by his cousin Abdul Razzak Tlass, with the humanitarian and relief aid. On 8 March 2013, he told Al Arabiya that <b>Syria</b> <b>had</b> had secret business deals with Israel.|$|R
50|$|Palestinians in <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> {{the right}} to own more than one {{business}} or commercial enterprise as well as {{the right to}} lease properties. These rights extend to trade and commerce. Union membership in Syria is also open to Palestinians. Palestinians are free to travel throughout <b>Syria</b> and <b>have</b> the right to establish residence in Syrian villages and cities.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of the ongoing Syrian Civil War since March 2011, <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> the largest refugee {{population}} in the world, and voting for refugees in certain foreign countries began at Syrian embassies several days before voting took place in Syria itself. Domestic and foreign-based Syrian opposition groups boycotted the election, and the vote did not take place in large parts of Syria under rebel control. The areas under Kurdish militia control also did not allow voting due to the refusal of the government to recognize their regional autonomy, though some people still traveled to the government–controlled areas to vote.|$|E
25|$|For {{decades the}} {{international}} diplomatic community has requested that Syria and Lebanon {{take steps to}} determine the exact boundary and officially register the demarcated border with the United Nations. However, President Bashar al-Assad of <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> refused to do so. On 31 October 2007, {{the definition of the}} physical extent of the Shebaa Farms area by former UN cartographer Miklos Pinther was released by the UN. This could be a prelude to an eventual negotiated demarcation of the territory. However, as of October 2013, neither Israel nor Syria had given an official response to the proposal.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Lebanese Civil War and the 1993 {{signing of}} the Oslo Peace Agreement, as-Sai'qa has largely lost its {{usefulness}} to the Syrian government, and the state and size of the organization has deteriorated. Today, it is wholly insignificant outside Syria, although it retains a presence in Lebanon (its future is uncertain after the end in 2005 of the Syrian Army's presence in Lebanon). It is extremely weak in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, non-existient in the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israel within the Green Line, and has not been active during the al-Aqsa Intifada. Its importance to <b>Syria</b> <b>has</b> lessened, both because the PLO has diminished in importance compared to the Palestinian National Authority (which as-Sai'qa boycotts).|$|E
50|$|Since the {{outbreak}} of the Syrian Civil War, a growing number of Armenian refugees from <b>Syria</b> <b>have</b> chosen to settle in this town, many of them farmers.|$|R
5000|$|Syria {{maintained}} that Israel had bombed a [...] "scientific research center" [...] at Jamraya, several {{miles northwest of}} Damascus, and Syria’s ambassador to Lebanon said <b>Syria</b> <b>had</b> the option of retaliating against Israel. According to a security analyst, Amir Rapaport, footage broadcast on Syrian television showed a damaged armored vehicle that seemed {{to belong to the}} SA-8 missile system. He speculated that the vehicle may have been placed on the scene after the attack, because <b>Syria</b> <b>had</b> guaranteed the Russians not to transfer the more advanced SA-17 system to Lebanon.|$|R
25|$|Raqqa in <b>Syria</b> <b>had</b> {{been under}} ISIL control since 2013 and in 2014 {{it became the}} group's de facto capital city. In October 2017, ISIL lost control of Raqqa.|$|R
