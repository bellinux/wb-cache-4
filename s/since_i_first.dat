500|$|On {{its next}} album, In My Own Dream, {{released}} in 1968, the band continued {{to move away}} from its roots in Chicago blues towards a more soul-influenced, horn-based sound. With Butterfield singing only three songs, the album featured more band contributions. It reached number 79 in the Billboard album chart. By the end of 1968, both Bishop and Naftalin had left the band. In April 1969, Butterfield took part in a concert at Chicago's Auditorium Theater and a subsequent recording session organized by record producer Norman Dayron, featuring Muddy Waters backed by Otis Spann, Mike Bloomfield, Sam Lay, Donald [...] "Duck" [...] Dunn, and Buddy Miles. Such Waters warhorses as [...] "Forty Days and Forty Nights", [...] "I'm Ready", [...] "Baby, Please Don't Go", and [...] "Got My Mojo Working" [...] were recorded and later released on the album Fathers and Sons. Waters commented, [...] "We did {{a lot of the things}} over we did with Little Walter and Jimmy Rogers and Elgin [...] on drums ... It's about as close as I've been [...] <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> recorded it". To one reviewer, these recordings represent Paul Butterfield's best performances.|$|E

On June 27 he was reported saying, [...] "I haven't had a moment of peace <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> told the story." [...] He then said a preacher had called and told him that the objects he saw were [...] "harbingers of doomsday" [...] and that the preacher was preparing his congregation [...] "for the end of the world." [...] In another encounter, a woman in a Pendleton cafe noticed him and dashed out shrieking, [...] "There's the man who saw the men from Mars." [...] She ran out [...] "sobbing she would have to do something for the children," [...] Arnold was reported as saying [...] "with a shudder".|$|E

Despite the disruption, Cleverly, who had been awarded the full title following Brähmers pullout, made a successful first defence to retain the title. The fight ended in the fourth round after a cut to the Kuziemski was deemed bad enough for the referee to stop the fight. [...] Speaking of his achievement Cleverly said [...] "I felt it was my destiny tonight... Ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> put the gloves on when I was 11 this was the night I've been dreaming of... Now I'll say Nathan Cleverly is the light-heavyweight champion of the world".|$|E

2500|$|<b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> became {{interested}} in high-speed networking almost seventeen years ago, {{there have been many}} major advances both in the technology and in public awareness. Articles on high-speed networks are commonplace in major newspapers and in news magazines. In contrast, when as a House member in the early 1980s, I called for creation of a national network of [...] "information superhighways," [...] the only people interested were the manufacturers of optical fiber. Back then, of course, high-speed meant 56,000 bits per second. Today we are building a national information infrastructure that will carry billions of bits of data per second, serve thousands of users simultaneously, and transmit not only electronic mail and data files but voice and video as well.|$|E
2500|$|Goddard {{had already}} {{said that it would}} be his last series. Immediately after the Third Test ended, while the players were celebrating in the {{dressing}} room, one of the selectors told Goddard he had been left out of the team for the final Test now that the series was won, in order that the team should consist only of players who would be touring England later that year. The decision and its timing were widely unpopular. Peter Pollock said [...] "it was no way to say thanks to {{a man who had been}} involved almost from the start in South Africa's rise to cricketing glory". Trevor Chesterfield described it as [...] "cruel and unnecessary; an act which took some of the sparkle out of the 4–0 whitewash". The captain, Ali Bacher, said that despite the team's success, the day was [...] "one of the saddest <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> played Test cricket for South Africa". Goddard himself simply said, [...] "I wouldn't be human if I did not say I was disappointed. But that's life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} well-received critically. Vincent Eldefors of Tartarean Desire stated [...] "ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> heard my first Opeth song [...] "To Bid You Farewell"... {{they have been}} among my {{favorite}} bands". [...] "Dan Swanö helped record this epic piece", said John Chedsey of Satan Stole My Teddybear in his review, and also mentioned that [...] "generally the songs flow well from one part to the next, though individual songs are not immediately noticeable. The twin guitars work well with each other, creating some great melodies in the guitars, and often lasping into very tasteful acoustic moods. In my opinion, it's difficult to write on guitar intricate songs that fully involve the listener, but Opeth manages to keep your attention." [...] Murat Batmaz of Sea of Tranquility wrote that [...] "the melodies, both on this song [...] and the entire album, are immortal." [...] He also wrote, [...] "Though I prefer their current lineup, I don't believe Morningrise {{would have been so}} amazing without Johan De Farfalla and Anders Nordin adding their touches. They both incorporate subtle jazz harmonies in their playing enriching the psychedelic passages on the album." [...] He was also impressed with the guitar riffs, saying [...] "it is almost shocking how many godlike riffs Opeth are using in their songs. They literally employ tens of changing riff patterns and incomparable melodies on a single track, with which other bands could more than likely write two full albums" [...] and claimed that the song [...] "Black Rose Immortal" [...] is a [...] "magnum opus".|$|E

2500|$|Megan Lehmann, {{writing in}} The Hollywood Reporter, {{said that the}} film [...] "defies {{all but the most}} cynical not to get carried away by the force of its grandiose imagery and storytelling", and it is [...] "much less earnest than the trailer suggests, layered with a thin veneer of camp and a nod and a wink to {{accompany}} the requisite Aussie clichés", {{and the bottom line is}} [...] "In epic style, Baz Luhrmann weaves his wizardry on Oz". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting [...] "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian Gone with the Wind, and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious. In a solemn season, Australias bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite". In her review for the New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Australia is clearly a labor of love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit of a mess. I must confess that I might have been harder on Mr Luhrmann's film if I had not remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> saw her in Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Have you seen everything Australia has on offer a dozen times before? Sure you have. It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?" [...] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, opines that, [...] "in its heart of hearts Australia is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it." [...] Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, [...] "Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves." [...] Ann Hornaday, in her review for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, [...] "The second half of Australia, Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime weeper, is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left Australia feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist".|$|E
