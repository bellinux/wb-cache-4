5|$|Returning to the FBI, Reddington {{offers to}} provide {{information}} {{on a number of}} the world’s dangerous criminals, his “blacklist,” in order to commute sentence and work with Keen. At home, Keen discovers a hidden box of cash, passports, and a gun, all belonging to her husband. She confronts Reddington to find out what he knows and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|Afonja {{sees him}} {{lying on the}} road and takes him to his residence. Afonja and his wife gave him herbs for relief of his {{constant}} catarrh. During the process of his recovery from his fever, he recollects the face of the killer. The next morning, he goes to the market square to observe the body language of Prince Aderopo, who suspiciously <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in confidence and even winks at him that {{there is no evidence to}} prove he indeed killed the girls. Danladi visits Tawa in the school she works as a teacher, in order to question her about the relationship she has with the Prince. Danladi discovers that Aderopo and Agbekoya are both recipients of a scholarship from a Reverend Father in the town, Father Dowling (Colin David Reese). Danladi visits Agbekoya, who reveals to him that they were constantly molested by the Reverend Father in Lagos city. At a celebration on the eve of Independence, Prince Aderopo invites Tawa to their childhood hideout, which has been renovated. Danladi and Afonja try to trail them, but are unsuccessful; Agbekoya, the only other person who knows the location of the hideout, leads them to it. On getting there, Aderopo is about to make Tawa his sixth victim, representing the end of the six years of violation he received from the Reverend Father. Tawa is saved.|$|E
60|$|Sir Leicester raises {{himself in}} his seat and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> fiercely. Mr. Bucket brings the finger into play as an emollient.|$|E
60|$|Ditmar <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> uncomprehendingly. Orcutt {{repeated}} the information.|$|R
60|$|Fischer <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> searchingly {{from behind}} his spectacles.|$|R
60|$|She <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quickly; then shrugged her {{shoulders}} again.|$|R
60|$|Mortimer <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and unfolds the paper. Reads it, {{reads it}} twice, turns {{it over to}} look at the blank outside, reads it a third time.|$|E
60|$|BURGOYNE (rising in amazement). Satisfactory, sir! Satisfactory!! (He <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for a moment, {{and then}} adds, with grim intensity) I am glad {{you take that}} view of them.|$|E
6000|$|... (Raina <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{unable to}} utter her [...] feelings. Then she sails away scornfully to the [...] chest of drawers, and returns with {{the box of}} [...] {{confectionery}} in her hand.) ...|$|E
60|$|She swung {{about with}} a start, her music {{dropping}} to the floor, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Her tattered blue kimono fell away at her elbows, her full throat was bare, and a slipper she had kicked off {{lay on the}} floor beside her. He recoiled a little, breathing deeply. She <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|The doctor <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> blankly, and Walker went on, smiling.|$|R
60|$|She <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> a second, then laughed, {{a thought}} unpleasantly.|$|R
6000|$|LARRY--She'll maybe be comin' here to {{look for}} you, I s'pose. [He returns to the bar, whistling. Left alone with MARTHY, who <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a twinkle of {{malicious}} humor in her eyes, CHRIS suddenly becomes desperately ill-at-ease. He fidgets, then gets up hurriedly.] ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{stands at}} the window, through which the evening {{sunlight}} is [...] powdering the room with smoky gold. The stolid Boy has again [...] come in. MALISE <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> then {{goes back to the}} table, [...] takes up the MS., and booms it at him; he receives the charge, [...] breathing hard.|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT. Well, {{a moment}} ago I caught a name which is new to me: a Miss Nora Reilly, I think. [Doyle stops dead and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{something}} like awe]. I don't wish to be impertinent, as you know, Larry; but are you sure she {{has nothing to do}} with your reluctance to come to Ireland with me? ...|$|E
60|$|John Henry Menton <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for {{an instant}} without moving.|$|R
60|$|Lord Julian <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> realizing {{exactly what}} he had refused.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Miller, {{shocked at}} his {{grasping}} spirit, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> mournfully.|$|R
60|$|It is {{not until}} they are gone, that Mr. Jasper moves. But then he turns to Durdles, and bursts into a fit of laughter. Durdles, who still has that {{suspended}} something in his cheek, and who sees nothing to laugh at, <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> until Mr. Jasper lays his face down on his arms to have his laugh out. Then Durdles bolts the something, as if desperately resigning himself to indigestion.|$|E
6000|$|CHRIS--Ay sign on steamer sail to-morrow. Ay gat my ole yob--bo'sun. [ANNA <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> As he goes on, {{a bitter}} smile comes over her face.] Ay tank dat's best tang for you. Ay only bring you bad luck, Ay tank. Ay make your mo'der's life sorry. Ay don't vant make yours dat way, but Ay do yust same. Dat ole davil, sea, she make me Yonah man ain't {{no good for}} nobody. And Ay tank now it ain't no use fight with sea. No man dat live going to beat her, py yingo! ...|$|E
60|$|GAYNOR. Positive. (Nicholls <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with vaguely frightened eyes.) It's {{had a good}} start--thanks to her father's blind selfishness--but let's {{hope that}} can be overcome. The {{important}} thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the safety of those around her as well as her own.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Snitchey {{stopped and}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Mr. Craggs also stared.|$|R
60|$|Sir Isaac <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for {{a moment}} with eyes vacantly thoughtful.|$|R
60|$|The clerk <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> blinked, {{cleared his}} throat, and said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|CHRIS--[Shaking in his boots.] Py golly. [He {{takes her}} drink in to MARTHY {{and sits down}} at the table. She sips it in silence. LARRY moves quietly close to the {{partition}} to listen, grinning with expectation. CHRIS seems {{on the verge of}} speaking, hesitates, gulps down his whiskey desperately as if seeking for courage. He attempts to whistle a few bars of [...] "Yosephine" [...] with careless bravado, but the whistle peters out futilely. MARTHY <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> keenly, taking in his embarrassment with a malicious twinkle of amusement in her eye. CHRIS clears his throat.] Marthy-- ...|$|E
60|$|DUKE. But I {{shall be}} the magistrate. [CONJURER <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again.] That's the system, my dear Hastings, that's the {{advantage}} of the system. Not a logical system--no Rousseau in it--but see how well it works! I {{shall be the}} very best magistrate that could be on the Bench. The others would be biassed, you know. Old Sir Lawrence is a Vegetarian himself; and might be hard on the Anti-Vegetarian roughs. Colonel Crashaw would be sure to be hard on the Vegetarian roughs. But if I've paid both of 'em, of course I shan't be hard on either of 'em--and there you have it. Just perfect impartiality.|$|E
6000|$|ANDERSON (impetuously). Off {{with you}} {{as hard as you}} can run, to the inn. Tell them to saddle the fastest and strongest horse they have (Judith rises breathless, and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> incredulously)--the {{chestnut}} mare, if she's fresh--without a moment's delay. Go into the stable yard and tell the black man there that I'll give him a silver dollar if the horse is waiting for me when I come, and that I am close on your heels. Away with you. (His energy sends Essie flying from the room. He pounces on his riding boots; rushes with them to the chair at the fire; and begins pulling them on.) ...|$|E
60|$|Bo <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and then, {{giving a}} little gasp, she drooped.|$|R
60|$|Brooke <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{divided between}} indignation and {{appreciation}} of his assurance.|$|R
60|$|She <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> doubting her senses, her pupils {{wide with}} terror.|$|R
6000|$|RICHARD. Stop, stop, stop, I tell you. Don't do that. (Putting {{his hand}} to his breast as if to a wound.) He wrung my heart by being a man. Need you tear it by being a woman? Has he not raised you above my insults, like himself? (She stops crying, and recovers herself somewhat, looking at him with a scared curiosity.) There: that's right. (Sympathetically.) You're better now, aren't you? (He puts his hand encouragingly on her shoulder. She {{instantly}} rises haughtily, and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> defiantly. He at once drops into his usual sardonic tone.) Ah, that's better. You are yourself again: so is Richard. Well, shall we go to tea like a quiet respectable couple, and wait for your husband's return? ...|$|E
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS, dryly: [...] "You shall do {{whatever}} you like, Miss Galbraith, when I've set you free; for I see your dress is caught in the window. When it's once out, I'll shut the window, and you can call the porter to raise it." [...] He leans forward over her chair, and while she shrinks back {{the length of her}} tether, he tugs at the window-fastening. [...] "I can't get at it. Would you be so good as to stand up,--all you can?" [...] Miss Galbraith stands up, droopingly, and Mr. Richards makes a movement towards her, and then falls back. [...] "No, that won't do. Please sit down again." [...] He goes round her chair and tries to get at the window from that side. [...] "I can't get any purchase on it. Why don't you cut out that piece?" [...] Miss Galbraith <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in dumb amazement. [...] "Well, I don't see what we're to do: I'll go and get the porter." [...] He goes {{to the end of the}} car, and returns. [...] "I can't find the porter,--he must be in one of the other cars. But"-- brightening with the fortunate conception--"I've just thought of something. Will it unbutton?" ...|$|E
50|$|The bailiff {{shakes his}} head and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{started to}} her feet and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with bewildered eyes.|$|R
60|$|Castell <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> then {{a single}} word broke from his lips.|$|R
60|$|Esmond <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> fiercely, {{though his}} face was awry with pain.|$|R
