5|$|By February, Candice Michelle had {{announced}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{on the cover}} of the April edition of Playboy magazine, and tension began to grow between Candice Michelle and Torrie Wilson. After winning a number one contender's Diva battle royal on Raw in which she first eliminated Wilson and then Mickie James and Ashley at the same time, Candice Michelle received her first singles WWE Women's Championship match, but she lost to champion Trish Stratus on February 27. After the match, Candice Michelle slapped Wilson, blaming her, in storyline, for the loss. As a result of the tension between the women, Wilson became a fan favorite, while Candice Michelle and Victoria continued to act as villains on-screen.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, in 1903 {{at the age}} of 24, {{her plans}} to study to become a teacher in Tokyo came to nothing. In a letter to Mrs. Abendanon, R.A.

25|$|The {{original}} {{police investigation}} had explored {{the possibility of}} a contract killing, but since Dando was living with her fiancé and was only rarely visiting her Gowan Avenue house, it was considered unlikely that a professional assassin would have been sufficiently well informed about Dando's movements to have known at what time <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there. CCTV evidence of Dando's last journey (mainly security video recordings from a shopping centre in Hammersmith, which she visited on her way to Fulham) did not show any sign of her being followed.|$|E

In August 2006, executive producer Lorne Michaels announced that Dratch would be replaced as Jenna but would portray different roles in other episodes. [...] In the re-tooled pilot, Dratch appears as The Girlie Shows cat wrangler. Later in the month, NBC announced that Jane Krakowski had replaced Dratch in the role of Jenna, and that the character was renamed Jenna Maroney. Michaels said that [...] "everyone is thrilled that she is joining the cast", and thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a [...] "perfect fit".|$|E

500|$|Patrick Duffy, {{who would}} play Pamela's {{on-screen}} love, knew the part was ideal for Principal {{the minute he}} set his eyes on her.

I just went, 'Hello, Pam'. I knew <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Pam Ewing." [...] Producer Michael Filerman (Knots Landing and Falcon Crest) offered insight, [...] "Principal really wanted that role...and worked very hard to get it. And there's a humanity about her that's just winning. And the camera likes her very much. The camera just loves her. That's real important." [...] During the pilot filming, Principal became very close with teenaged actress Charlene Tilton, who played Lucy Ewing. Principal explained that [...] "the location shooting was hard on Tilton, who was only seventeen and had never been away from home".|$|E

500|$|Though the [...] "gritty realism" [...] of Wilson's novels was {{different}} from Dakota Blue Richards's first role as Lyra Belacqua in The Golden Compass, she was happy {{to take on the}} character of April. She said she [...] "can really relate to the characters" [...] in Wilson's novels, but found that April was [...] "a really different person" [...] to her. Wilson, who had previously seen Richards in The Golden Compass, was [...] "over the moon to hear <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in Dustbin Baby. Richards was to play the 14-year-old April, but other actresses were required to play younger versions of the character. Lucy Hutchinson, who was five at the time of filming, played the youngest April. Director Juliet May described her as [...] "one of the most remarkable five year olds I have ever met", saying that [...] "it's like she's not acting at all". Alex Hewitt was selected to play the [...] "middle April". May described her as having [...] "utter truth in her acting". Though ten years old, Hewett plays April at eight.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was like a movie star, right then and there... She said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a movie star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E
500|$|Shark {{sightings}} increased {{along the}} Mid-Atlantic Coast following the attacks. On July 8, armed motorboats patrolling {{the beach at}} Spring Creek chased an animal they {{thought to be a}} shark, and Asbury Park's Asbury Avenue Beach was closed after lifeguard Benjamin Everingham claimed to have beaten off a [...] long shark with an oar. Sharks were spotted near Bayonne, New Jersey; Rocky Point, New York; Bridgeport, Connecticut; Jacksonville, Florida; and Mobile, Alabama, and a columnist from Field & Stream captured a sandbar shark in the surf at Beach Haven. Actress Gertrude Hoffmann was swimming at the Coney Island beach shortly after the Matawan fatalities when she claimed to have encountered a shark. The New York Times noted that Hoffman [...] "had {{the presence of mind to}} remember that she had read in the Times that a bather can scare away a shark by splashing, and she beat up the water furiously." [...] Hoffman was certain <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> devoured by the [...] "Jersey man-eater", but later admitted she was [...] "not sure... whether she had had her trouble for nothing or had barely escaped death." ...|$|E

500|$|Takumi only spent {{little time}} on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the game's story, and instead made up {{dialogue}} and developed Phoenix's personality {{as he went}} along. Takumi said that Phoenix is Shu Takumi in everything but name, with dialogue similar to what Takumi would have said in each situation in the games; he attributed this to him being a first-time writer who did not think about developing characterization prior to writing the story. Takumi didn't write a backstory for Dick Gumshoe; instead, Gumshoe's character and personality just [...] "fell into place" [...] after Takumi decided that the character would end his sentences with [...] "pal". Other aspects of the character came about organically as Takumi wrote the story; for instance, at one point Edgeworth says that he will cut Gumshoe's salary, which became part of Gumshoe's backstory. Takumi {{came up with the}} partner character Maya because {{he thought it would be}} more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own. Originally, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a lawyer-in-training, preparing to take the bar exam.|$|E
500|$|The next day, on 14 July 1999, Cameron's {{daughter}} Avril took Climbié to see Marie Cader, a French {{teacher at}} her son's school. Cader advised that Climbié {{be taken to}} hospital. At 11:00 am the same day, Avril took Climbié to the emergency department of Central Middlesex Hospital. At 11:50am, Climbié was seen by Dr Rhys Beynon, a senior house officer in the department. Beynon took Climbié's history from Avril and {{thought that there was}} a strong possibility that the injuries were non-accidental. Due to hospital child protection guidelines, he referred the case to Dr Ekundayo Ajayi-Obe, the on-call paediatric registrar. Beynon conducted only a cursory examination of Climbié because he believed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> examined by the paediatric team. The Laming report said that [...] "he exhibited sound judgement in his care of Victoria by referring her immediately to a paediatric registrar." [...] Climbié arrived at Barnaby Bear ward where she was examined by Ajayi-Obe, who noted various injuries. When asked about the injuries, Climbié said they were self-inflicted, a claim the paediatrician did not think was credible. Ajayi-Obe's notes were detailed and thorough, in contrast to those of the other doctors that examined her. Having examined Climbié, the paediatrician was [...] "strongly suspicious" [...] that the injuries were non-accidental, and she decided to admit Climbié onto the ward.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Greg Hernandez, Mills explained: [...] "I knew that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a trouble maker but actually knowing the writers and the producers, I knew that the character would be rounded and have dimension {{and that was really}} fun for me to play. It wasn’t one-note all the time, {{it was a lot of}} different colors." [...] Television personality Julie Chen said, [...] "The women of Knots, Michele Lee, Joan Van Ark, and Donna Mills have been compared to earth, wind, and fire, with Donna Mills bringing the heat as Abby, the conniving vixen that everybody loved to hate." [...] According to Mills, many people were wary of meeting her in person because they assumed she would be like Abby. She said, [...] "They were very trepedacious about what I was going to do." [...] Mike Celizic of NBC said that her character was [...] "the archetypal predatory female", while Meredith Vieira said [...] "even the bad girl could show a tender side every once in a while", in reference to her daughter's on-screen drug addiction. It was this very storyline that showed Abby at her most vulnerable and human, a story which audiences recall as perhaps one of her most desperate and motherly of moments. In addition to that, Abby also helped Val get her kidnapped babies back, even though she was blamed she said she [...] "could never do a thing like that to anyone". When Karen and Mack began to have some problems in their marriage and Karen distanced herself from Mack, Abby confronted Karen aggressively and told her she was wrong for doing so to him.|$|E

500|$|Fi {{was created}} before the {{implantation}} of Wii MotionPlus, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{part of some}} different undefined gameplay concepts unrelated to motion control. Her design {{was based on the}} design of the Master Sword, referencing her origins as the sword's spirit. [...] She also served as an alternative explanatory voice as Link was a silent protagonist. According to staff, Fi's technical dialogue for each area of the game was written by different people, verbal inconsistencies arose that needed addressing, so Fujibayashi adjusted them all so she sounded consistent. Nearly all of Fi's dialogue was ultimately written by Fujibayashi. Ghirahim was designed to be similar to the Dark Link character from Ocarina of Time: he could read Link's movements, requiring players to think strategically to defeat him rather than simply swinging Link's sword around randomly. Character designs were far more detailed than in previous Zelda titles. Clothing was frequently designed to complement backgrounds, such as Zelda's pink and red dress in the opening. The game's use of warm colors and brushstroke-like aesthetics was inspired by impressionist artwork, pioneered in the 19th century by painters such as Claude Monet: a particular element cited by Miyamoto was the sky, which he called a tribute to the work of Paul Cézanne. The basic starting point for the art style was the fact of it being a fantasy world. The final version was referred to as a balance between the more overt cartoon styling of [...] and Twilight Princess, where the cartoon shading was transferred onto an older version of Link. The team settled this artstyle as it would properly portray the more exaggerated actions of some characters and general swordplay while preserving Link's mature appearance.|$|E
