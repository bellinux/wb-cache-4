40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{technique for}} understanding, analyzing and developing optical systems is presented. The approach is statistical in nature, where information about an object under investigation is discovered, by examining deviations from a known reference statistical distribution. A Fourier optics framework and a scalar {{description of the}} propagation of monochromatic light is initially assumed. An object (belonging to a known class of objects) is illuminated with a speckle field {{and the intensity of}} the resulting scattered optical field is detected at a series of spatial locations by point <b>square</b> <b>law</b> <b>detectors.</b> A new speckle field is generated (with a new diffuser) and the object is again illuminated and the intensities are again measured and noted. By making a large number of these statistical measurements - an ensemble averaging process (which in general can be a temporal or a spatial averaging process) - it is possible to determine the statistical relationship between the intensities detected in different locations with a known statistical certainty. It is shown how this physical property of the optical system can be used to identify different classes of objects (discrete objects or objects that vary continuously as a function of several physical parameters) with a specific statistical certainty. The derived statistical relationship is a fourth order statistical process and is related to the mutual intensity of scattered light. A connection between the integration time of the intensity detectors and temporal coherence and hence temporal bandwidth of a quasi-monochromatic light source is discussed. We extend these results to multiple wavelengths and polarizations of light. We briefly discuss how the results may be extended to non-paraxial optical systems...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1976 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe paper {{develops}} {{some new}} {{results for the}} degradation in SNR, due to unwanted phase jitter, for a FSK receiver system. The unwanted phase modulation {{is assumed to be}} present equally on either FSK tone and is modeled as a sample function of a Gaussian random process. Results are derived based on a standard type FSK system employing bandpass filters, <b>square</b> <b>law</b> envelope <b>detectors,</b> a subtractor, and a post detection lowpass data filter. The degradation was found to depend on the mark-space filter bandwidths, the doppler frequency of the received tones, the nominal SNR and the post detection filter bandwidths. The degradation is minimal for small doppler shifts; however, once the tones, in the predetection filters were displaced to within the post detection filter bandwidth of the predetection filter band edge, the degradation increased dramatically. This was {{due to the fact that}} the filtering of the phase noise caused the envelope detectors to produce self noise. In fact, at high SNR's the degradation is primarily due to self noise or envelope distortion due to filtering of the phase jitter spectrum. It is important to point out that the degradation found here is due only to phase noise effects and not sin χ/χ losses. The results derived here are accurate for phase jitter variances ≲ 0. 1. In addition, it is assumed that the lowpass equivalent filter impulse response of the bandpass filter be real, that is, the lowpass equivalent transfer function must be hermetian symetric...|$|R

The optimal detector decides based on two-dimensional decision regions in the amplitude/phase-variance space. Suboptimal detectors combine two one-dimensional decisions.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA current trend in radar technology is automatic detection and tracking systems. An {{integral part of}} these automatic systems is the CFAR (constant False Alarm Rate) detector. A CFAR detector is the signal process algorithm that controls {{the rate at which}} target detections are falsely declared. Given the current state of radar technology, CFAR algorithms are necessary elements of any automatic radar system. Unfortunately, CFAR systems are inherently vulnerable to degradation caused by large clutter edges multiple targets and jamming environments.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the theoretical performance of recently proposed optical coding (OC) technology for fiber fault monitoring of a PON through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR), and the falsealarm probability. First, we develop {{a mathematical model}} and expressions for the detected monitoring signals considering a <b>square</b> <b>law</b> <b>detector</b> and using realistic parameters. Second, we address {{the effect of the}} transmitted pulse power, network size and light source coherence on the performance of both one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) OC monitoring systems. We show that the transmitted pulse width can be optimized to trade-off the interference and the detection noises. We give simple analytic equations for this optimal pulse width as a function of network parameters. Both 1 D and 2 D coding schemes are considered. We find that, under perfect dispersion compensation, an incoherent source performs better than lasers for 1 D coding. In addition, 2 D coding using lasers offer very good performance and supports networks up to 128 customers with SNIR≥ 10 dB a promising candidate for future high capacity PON.

The receiver testing and observation technique chapters describe: the results and methods used to calibrate the two receivers, namely 2. 5 -cm and 4. 5 -cm, with central frequencies of 6668 MHz and 12178 MHz respectively, as well as data cap- ture methods for spectroscopic observations.

40|$|Non-coherent on-off keying (OOK) {{receivers}} are preferred in ultra {{low power}} (ULP) wireless devices as they consume less power {{when compared to}} receivers based on other modulation schemes. However, these devices are highly susceptible to co-channel interference (CCI). Therefore, interference cancellation (IC) techniques for ULP non-coherent OOK receivers are investigated in this thesis. Various IC techniques are discussed in literature. However, the non-coherent OOK receiver architecture calls {{for the design of}} new low complexity IC techniques. The main constraint of the system is imposed by the analog front end that uses a simple <b>square</b> <b>law</b> <b>detector</b> to down-convert the RF signals to baseband and there is also only single radio frequency (RF) chain. The challenge is to mitigate CCI under these constraints and improve the detection performance. The non-coherent detection of OOK signals requires the knowledge of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the incoming signal. Therefore, SNR estimation {{plays an important role in}} non-coherent OOK receivers. Thus the scope of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, the SNR estimation and non-coherent detection techniques are proposed for OOK signals. Secondly, the interference mitigation techniques are proposed for the case of continuous wave (CW) CCI and OOK modulated interferers. The problems of the proposed techniques for the case of M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) modulated interferers are also investigated. Finally, the implementation of the SNR estimation techniques on real time hardware platform is discussed.
