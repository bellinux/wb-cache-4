These overload situations can have a severe and unpredictableimpact on the accuracy of monitoring applications, right when they are most valuable to network operators. Load shedding via traffic sampling has recently been proposed as an effective alternative to overprovisioning for efficiently handlingoverload situationsinnetworkmonitoring. However, not all monitoring applications are robust against sampling and often other techniques can be devised to <b>shed</b> <b>load</b> more effectively. In order to provide a generic solution for arbitrary applications,we proposealoadsheddingschemethat,besidessupporting standard sampling techniques, allows network monitoring applicationstodefinecustomloadsheddingmethods.
