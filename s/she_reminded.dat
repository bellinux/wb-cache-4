5|$|In 1931, Fatima Jinnah {{joined her}} brother in England. From then on, Muhammad Jinnah would receive {{personal}} care {{and support from}} her as he aged and began to suffer from the lung ailments which would kill him. She lived and travelled with him, and became a close advisor. Muhammad Jinnah's daughter, Dina, was educated in England and India. Jinnah later became estranged from Dina after she decided to marry a Christian, Neville Wadia from a prominent Parsi business family. When Jinnah urged Dina to marry a Muslim, <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> {{him that he had}} married a woman not raised in his faith. Jinnah continued to correspond cordially with his daughter, but their personal relationship was strained, and she did not come to Pakistan in his lifetime, but only for his funeral.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E

500|$|In June 2010, {{attorney}} Britney Horstman {{was barred}} from visiting her client in the Federal Detention Center at Miami, Florida [...] when her underwire bra {{set off the}} metal detector. Although <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> guards of a detention center memo that permitted female attorneys visiting clients to wear an underwire bra, the guard refused her entry. That memo existed {{as a result of}} an agreement negotiated by the Federal Public Defender's Office, which represents inmates held at the institution before trial. That agreement allows female lawyers entry if her underwire bra is detected by a metal-detecting wand. Horstman removed her bra in a bathroom and returned to the security checkpoint braless, but was then turned away because she did not meet the facility's dress code. Horstman had previously worn an underwire bra into the facility without problems. Warden Linda McGrew later promised the incident would not happen again.|$|E

After Jack Warner criticized her {{tendency}} to cajole crowds into buying, <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> him that her audiences responded most strongly to her [...] "bitch" [...] performances. She sold $2 million worth of bonds in two days, as well as a picture of herself in Jezebel for $250,000. She also performed for black regiments as the only white member of an acting troupe formed by Hattie McDaniel, which included Lena Horne and Ethel Waters.|$|E

Lady Bird decided to expand by buying a television station in 1952, despite Lyndon's objections. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> him that she could do as she wished with her inheritance. [...] The station, KTBC-TV/7 (then affiliated with CBS as well), was Austin's monopoly VHF franchise and generated revenues that made the Johnsons millionaires. Over the years, journalists have revealed that Lyndon used his influence in the Senate to influence the Federal Communications Commission into granting the monopoly license, which was in Lady Bird's name.|$|E

2500|$|Túrin {{is said to}} {{have been}} greatly {{affected}} by the deaths of his friends; thus after overcoming pestilence himself and the death of Lalaith, Túrin's character was hardened and he became even more reserved. Tolkien also stated that Túrin ever after [...] "sought in all faces of women the face of Lalaith," [...] that he did not love Finduilas because [...] "his mind and heart were elsewhere, by rivers in springs long past," [...] and that Túrin did fall in love with Níniel because <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> him of Lalaith. The grief that he had slain Beleg [...] "was graven on the face of Túrin and never faded"; early Tolkien's writings add that after this time [...] "wild and black was his hair yet streaked with grey, and his face was pale and marked as with deep sorrows of the past." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the cast}} were {{relative}} newcomers, whom the director said he chose because he felt established stars {{would not be able}} to handle the old-style dialog. Chartchai Ngamsan and Supakorn Kitsuwon had previously had supporting roles in Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters. Italian-born, Thailand-raised model and actress Stella Malucchi was acting in a music video in Bangkok, which was noticed on television by Wisit. He then sought out Malucchi, saying he thought she had the right look for the part of Rumpoey. He told her later <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> him of Elizabeth Taylor. Through costuming and makeup, Malucchi, a [...] "plain farang", in the words of Wisit, was transformed into the daughter of a Thai noble family. There are experienced actors in the cast as well, including Sombat Metanee and Naiyana Sheewanun, who worked in the era of Thai filmmaking that Wisit was trying to recreate.|$|E

Later, they spoke more; Smith's record of what she said to him is fragmentary and enigmatic. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> him of the [...] "courtesies she had done", saying, [...] "you did promise Powhatan what was yours would be his, and he the like to you". She then discomfited him by calling him [...] "father", explaining Smith had called Powhatan [...] "father" [...] when a stranger in Virginia, [...] "and by the same reason so must I do you".

2500|$|Diane Settegast and Eunice Woolen, {{who stayed}} with the Hills as house guests a week before Joan's death, would later {{describe}} how Hill brought home pastries, but insisted on choosing which ones each of them would eat. Hill would return home with the pastries in the evenings after being called away by a message on his pager. On Friday, March 14, the Hills attended Houston's annual wild game dinner, where John played a concert with the Heartbeats. They left early, {{and on the way}} home Joan asked her husband if he would be staying out all night again. When he said that he probably would, <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> him that he had done this on two previous occasions that week. The conversation quickly descended into an argument in which she told him that if he did stay out, he should not bother to come back.

2500|$|In 2008, Brooks {{returned}} to EastEnders for a guest stint. She was later confirmed {{to be coming}} back as a regular character. She said, [...] "I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on EastEnders can be, and then there's that stigma {{about going back to}} a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. I was just going to go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine".

2500|$|Russian Indologist Yevgenia Vanina of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences {{wrote an}} article {{severely}} criticizing the court case over the Bhagavad Gita, which [...] "is revered by millions in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and wherever Hindus live". <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> that in Europe, the Gita was [...] "admired by many great philosophers and thinkers, such as Herder, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy" [...] and thought it ironic that while the Hindu scripture was first translated into Russian in 1788, [...] "nobody put the book and its translators on trial in the Orthodox Russian Empire in 1788, but it’s being judged in secular democratic Russia". Vanina also argued that charges of extremism [...] against Prabhupada's [...] "copious" [...] commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita are fallacious and based on a [...] "primitive" [...] screening of the religious text for negative words (such as “fool,” “enemy,” “demon, [...] "kill”). According to Vanina, using this approach, any ancient text, from the Greek myths to the Bible, and the Koran, can be found extremism, especially when [...] "specialists in philosophical suicidology are entrusted with passing judgement on ancient Indian texts". Vanina concluded by opining that, despite people's right to their attitudes towards [...] "a Russian lad wearing Indian clothes and singing Hare Krishna", ISKCON followers {{have the right to}} practice their religion, and that the Russian Orthodox Church, instead of calling for a ban on competitors or attempting to legally equate their holy [...] book to Mein Kampf, should introspect as to the reasons that deter young Russians from joining the Church. Otherwise, Vanina predicted, [...] "people will again start being burned alive".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} two months (prior to the minor {{escalation}} phase of 23–24 July), the protests did not receive significant coverage in international media, especially relative to the more numerous and violent demonstrations in Turkey, Brazil as well as the anti- and post-Morsi unrest in Egypt. The protest activities and messages have been endorsed by prominent European Union politicians such as European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Viviane Reding and also garnered the approval of the French and German ambassadors to Bulgaria, Philippe Autié and Matthias Höpfner. The latter two welcomed Rosen Plevneliev's call for a new morality in politics that is in accordance with European values, also emphasizing that there is a crisis of trust {{when it comes to the}} institutions and elites in the country as well as some worrying signs pertaining a concentration of media ownership, which could herald risks for the continued thriving of freedom of speech. The ambassadors praised both the protesters and the Bulgarian police for behaving in a way that is conducive to the peaceful expression of the civil society spirit. In addition, Autié and Höpfner stressed that the [...] "oligarchic model" [...] is not suitable for any country and could only lead to the creation of a [...] "state within a state". Dutch ambassador to Bulgaria Karel van Kesteren has referred to the protests as a [...] "sign of hope" [...] and the first clear instance of civil society rearing its head to clamor for the observance of European values since Bulgaria's accession to the EU. He also expressed disquiet about the role of Attack as well as its ability to influence proceedings and reminded the government that election wins are just one component of democracy that should not be a substitute for responsible governance and lack of secrecy in decision-making. His Belgian counterpart to Bulgaria Anik van Kalster stated that [...] "the best solution [...] is the one that is widely supported by the society as a whole" [...] and also played down the concerns that Belgian investments in Bulgaria could be negatively affected due to the political uncertainty. In relation to the Peevski situation, <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> the government of the European Commission's insistence for certain standards to be respected when high-level appointments are made and the need for the primacy of the legal order to remain unchallenged. Van Kalster has lauded the peaceful character of the protests and depicted them as a continuation of the February demonstrations, but with a higher premium placed on ideals and principles rather than economic issues. In June 2013, Hannes Swoboda, President of the group of the S in the European Parliament, stated that the Oresharski government deserves support, maintaining that the social measures suggested by the cabinet were necessary for the country. He also commended Stanishev for being forward-looking and having a long record in promoting modernization. However, Swoboda criticized the appointment of Delyan Peevski as well as the decision to elect Volen Siderov as chairman of the Parliamentary commission for fighting corruption, warning the governing BSP party that it would need to go to extra lengths in order to preserve its values and provide a true [...] "left alternative" [...] to the Borisov cabinet (due to the BSP's alliance with the MRF and Ataka). He also emphasized that Bulgaria needs fundamental changes in its political system and urged the government to be constantly engaged in a dialogue with the wider society and prioritize the promotion of political transparency and democratic principles. In Antoniy Galabov's view, PES' support for Stanishev was a risky strategy, as it could negatively affect the electoral fortunes for the European political party in the 2014 European election. The EU has urged BSP and GERB to exhibit cooperative behaviour towards each other. French ambassador to Bulgaria, Xavier Lapeyre de Cabanes, has diagnosed Bulgaria's corruption problems as deeply rooted, stipulating that the underlying motivations for such protests have been brewing under the surface since the 1990s. He also acknowledges that a variety of anti-corruption measures have been implemented since the collapse of communism and observes that the country's xenophobia has not reached dangerous levels. Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a leading personality during the 1968 student protests in France, sent out a note, in which he expressed support for the Bulgarian student occupiers. Polish historian and prominent former anti-communist dissident Adam Michnik has been more cautious in his assessment of the protests, stating that the main reason for them is the [...] "lack of a political culture as well as an absence of a culture of compromise", which from his standpoint is still an issue for other Eastern European countries besides Bulgaria because of the effects of communism on the mentality of citizens and the paucity of democratic traditions. He sees the political elites as a reflection of society and emphasizes that in cases when fair elections bring unsympathetic [...] "old [...] apparatus" [...] members to power, this needs to be accepted, as [...] "democracy should apply to all, not only to those who are intelligent and have perfectly sound moral qualities".|$|E
