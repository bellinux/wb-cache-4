When asked about his {{interpretation}} on the character, McCormack commented that his first instinct was to make Ted Lewis more alien, <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> Spock. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Common names include gillbird, gilly warbler, barkingbird, muttonbird, butcherbird, what's o {{clock and}} chock. Unlike many species in southwestern Australia, the red wattlebird was given names {{by the local}} {{indigenous}} people that were onomatopoeic (<b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> the calls they make). Names recorded include wodjalok, durdal, doongorok, and djoongong (this last name is also applied to the western wattlebird). In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, the local Barngarla people knew it as ngarkarko or ngarkabukko. The local people of Denial Bay in South Australia called it noggal, and the Ngarrindjeri people of the Lower Murray region in South Australia knew it as rungkan.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E

25|$|The Duga {{systems were}} {{extremely}} powerful, over 10MW in some cases, and broadcast in the shortwave radio bands. They appeared without warning, <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> a sharp, repetitive tapping noise at 10Hz, {{which led to}} it being nicknamed by shortwave listeners the Russian Woodpecker. The random frequency hops disrupted legitimate broadcasts, amateur radio operations, oceanic commercial aviation communications, utility transmissions, and resulted in thousands of complaints by many countries worldwide. The signal became such a nuisance that some receivers such as amateur radios and televisions actually began including 'Woodpecker Blankers' in their circuit designs {{in an effort to}} filter out the interference.|$|E
25|$|Around 2007, a {{new type}} of strings were {{produced}} made of mostly a nylon core coiled with nylon like the metal-nylon strings, possibly in imitation of Western catgut strings. The sound is similar to the metal-nylon strings but without the metallic tone to them (one of the main reasons why traditionalists do not like the metal-nylon strings). The nylon strings are able to be turned to standard pitch without breaking and can sustain their tuning whatever the climate unlike silk. The strings have various names in China but they are advertised as <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> silk strings prior to the 1950s when silk string production stopped.|$|E
25|$|Balakirev's {{eventual}} undoing was his {{demand that}} his students' musical tastes coincide exactly with his own, with the slightest deviation prohibited. Whenever {{one of them}} played {{one of his own}} compositions for Balakirev, Balakirev would seat himself at the piano and show, through improvisation, how he felt the composition should be changed. Passages in other people's works came out <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> his music, not their own. By the late 1860s, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov stopped accepting what they now considered his high-handed meddling with their work, and Stasov began to distance himself from Balakirev. The other members of The Five also became interested in writing opera, a genre Balakirev did not consider highly, after the success of Alexander Serov's opera Judith in 1863, and gravitated toward Alexander Dargomyzhsky as a mentor in this field.|$|E

25|$|Detail {{notes from}} {{visitors}} to the Constantia estate in the 18th century give evidence of the Dutch influence on South African winemaking. As they did for the French centuries earlier, the Dutch introduced the technique of adding sulphur to halt fermentation before all the residual sugar has been completely converted into alcohol. This allowed the wine to maintain its sweetness without increasing the alcohol level, similar to adding brandy {{in the production of}} fortified sweet wines; another technique pioneered by the Dutch. To {{keep an eye on the}} ongoing process of fermentation, Cape winemakers would listen near the bunghole of the wine barrel for noise and irritation in the barrel, described as <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> the barrel was full of crabs. When the barrel was completely quiet and no longer making crab-like noises the wine would finally be racked for clarification and stabilization.|$|E
25|$|After the Children of God album, Gira professed himself tired {{with the}} band's fearsome {{reputation}} for noise, feeling that their audience now had expectations {{that he had}} no intention of fulfilling. He made a conscious decision to tone down the band's sound, introducing more acoustic elements and increasingly emphasizing Jarboe as a singer. The first results of this shift in direction were the two records recorded by Gira and Jarboe under the names Skin (in Europe) and World of Skin (in the US). The first, Blood, Women, Roses, featured Jarboe on lead vocals, and the second, Shame, Humility, Revenge, featured Gira on lead vocals. Both were recorded together in 1987, although Shame, Humility, Revenge was not released until 1988. These albums are full of slow, ethereal, melancholy, dirge-like songs, <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> stripped down acoustic versions of the Children of God songs.|$|E
25|$|As {{the band}} and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member's stylistic {{contribution}} became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but opted for more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at {{the upper end of}} the Dead's sound. The two drummers, Mickey Hart and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a new dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its emerging style. Garcia's lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his training in fingerpicking and banjo.|$|E

500|$|However, {{there has}} also been {{critical}} condemnation of the cast performances. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone commented that Matthew Morrison [...] "couldn't rap his way out of a 98° rehearsal", and Allmusic's Andrew Leahey wrote that Cory Monteith and Dianna Agron [...] "can't sing nearly as well as their co-stars". E! Online's Joal Ryan criticized the show for its [...] "overproduced soundtrack" [...] and complained that many songs rely too heavily on the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune: [...] "For every too-brief moment of Lea Michele sounding raw—and lovely—on a [...] "What a Girl Wants", or Monteith singing a perfectly credible REO Speedwagon in the shower, there's Michele and Monteith <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> 1990s-era Cher on [...] "No Air", or Monteith <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> the Monteith XRZ-200 on the out-of-the-shower version of [...] "Can't Fight This Feeling".|$|E
