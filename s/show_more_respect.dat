However, Dwight's loyalty is {{put to the test}} as Charles Miner (Idris Elba) seems to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> for Dwight than Michael ever did. Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} book released in 1992, midway through his second term, Weizsäcker voiced a harsh {{critique of the}} leading political parties in Germany, claiming that they took {{a larger role in}} public life than was awarded to them by the constitution. He criticized the high number of career politicians (Berufspolitiker), who [...] "in general are neither expert nor dilettante, but generalists with particular knowledge only in political battle". The immediate reactions toward this interview were mixed. Prominent party politicians such as Rainer Barzel and Johannes Rau criticized the remarks, as did Minister of Labour Norbert Blüm, who asked the president to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> towards the work done by party members. Former chancellor Helmut Schmidt, on the other hand, conceded that Weizsäcker was [...] "essentially right". While comments from politicians were mainly negative, a public poll conducted by the Wickert-Institut in June 1992 showed that 87.4 per cent of the population agreed with the president. Political commentators generally interpreted the remarks as a hidden attack on the incumbent chancellor Helmut Kohl, since Weizsäcker's relationship with his former patron had cooled over the years. In a column for the German newspaper Der Spiegel, chief-editor Rudolf Augstein criticized the president for his attack, writing: [...] "You cannot have it both ways: on the one hand giving a right and seminal political incentive, {{but on the other hand}} insulting the governing class and its chief".|$|E

Snowboarding has become a sport that encompasses a very diverse international based crowd and fanbase of many millions, so much so that it is no longer possible to stereotype such a large community.

December 1999, Wat Phra Dhammakaya sued the news papers Matichon, Siam Rath, Khao Sod, Daily News and the television station ITV. The temple laid civil and criminal charges for slander, accusing the media outlets for depicting the temple in a distorted way. In 2001 and 2003, ITV, Siam Rath, and Matichon were found guilty of slander and forced by verdict to issue a public apology in their newspapers, admitting to publishing distorted information about Luang Por Dhammajayo trading in stock, transferring money to mistresses, and other accusations. Siam Rath was also found guilty of violating the authority of the court, by publishing incorrect information on a verdict. The charges laid against Daily News were dismissed, however, because of being laid too late.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether armed groups’ courts are suitable to enforce international humanitarian law. The ensuing question of whether the existence of these courts conforms to international law is answered in the affirmative: international humanitarian law and human rights law do not in principle prohibit the operation of such courts. Adjudication by armed groups has a relatively high potential to deter the groups’ fighters from committing violations of international humanitarian law. This is to a large extent because convictions by armed groups’ courts gain more attention among fighters than convictions by national or international criminal courts. However, the empirical record of armed groups’ courts is mixed. The African armed groups examined in this paper violated international humanitarian law, including due process guarantees. Yet, they <b>showed</b> <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> for civilians than many armed groups without their own jurisdiction...|$|R
