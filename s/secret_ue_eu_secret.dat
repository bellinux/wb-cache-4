The paper investigates the development of intra-industry trade (IIT) of the NMS with major partners between 2000 - 2007. IIT is separated into horizontal and vertical components on the basis of differences in unit values. We have found that although inter-industry trade still accounts for almost 50 % of the EU- 10 countries’ trade, its share has been declining to the benefit of IIT shares (except for Malta). IIT accelerated in the post-accession period. In 2007, Slovenia and the Czech Republic recorded the highest IIT indices. Intra-industry trade of the EU- 10 + 2 has been dominated by vertical-IIT, usually by low-quality VIIT. However, in almost all NMS, the share of high-quality vertical-IIT, as well as of horizontal-IIT in total trade increased. Thus, the pattern of NMS’ trade specialization has improved. Growing shares of IIT, in that of HIIT, reflect increasing similarities between EU- 10 and the EU- 15 and the convergence process of the NMS vis-à-vis EU- 15 countries. In the automotive sector, the IIT indices were – generally – higher than in total trade, meaning deeper specialization. This phenomenon can be largely attributed to the high FDI penetration.

We introduce the SyMo/Ready modeling and simulation system – an agent-based system especially dedicated to complex system modeling, simulations, and analysis. We demonstrate this system’s capabilities with an example from the <b>EU</b> project <b>SECRET</b> dealing with resilient railway communication architectures. We show the different kinds of agents, their behaviors, their communication, and how various scenarios can be modeled and simulated for an analysis of such complex system dynamics under various conditions. We demonstrate how agent-based models and simulations of complex technical systems are well-suited for behavior analysis and resilience estimations...|$|R

The CJEU held in this judgment that Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights requires that the essence of the grounds of the decision to restrict an EU citizen’s right to free movement on national security grounds, is disclosed. According to the Court this requirement cannot yield to the protection of the Member State’s national security. The article argues that the judgment in ZZ is relevant for other fields of <b>EU</b> law where <b>secret</b> information plays a role. Furthermore it examines how the CJEU’s judgment relates to the ECtHR’s case law and what the requirement to disclose the essence of the case entails...|$|R

Special attention {{is given to}} the major urban centres, for the most related to national and/or EU policy (EC, 2003; EC 004). A number of important questions are emerging between the reinforcement of the bigger areas, both metropolitan and urban, and the smaller centres. Moreover, according with different institutional actors it would be better more balanced process of anthropization because environmental and social reasons (APAT, 2004). In Calabria there are very few towns with more then 15. 000 residents, often they are isolated and in the internal land. It requires to connect these areas by network, to push the diffusion of innovation and technology, to build up the “educated technology ” (Del Nord, 1991).

40|$|Abstract—There {{are false}} {{objects in the}} {{information}} hiding field. The embedder can deploy false objects into digital signal to increase the hiding capability per embedded unit, protect its embedded secret information and minimize the expected damage, while the attacker hopes to maximize it. In this paper, 2 -phase game {{can be applied to}} build the embedder-attacker system to analyze this conflicted issue. In the system, the embedder consumes its resource to build embedded units (<b>EU)</b> and insert <b>secret</b> information or false objects into EU. The attacker distributes its resource evenly to the attacked EU. The expected equilibrium damage, which is maximum damage in value from the point of the view of the attacker and minimum from the embedder, is evaluated by 2 -phase game theory. Finally, compute the expected equilibrium damage, the optimal number of building EU and the optimal number of EU with the embedded secret information (ESI). The optimal equilibrium capacity of hiding information on the basis of false objects and attack strategies is calculated through the optimal number of EU with ESI...|$|R
