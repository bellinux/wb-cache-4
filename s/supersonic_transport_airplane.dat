40|$|Crack {{growth in}} Ti- 8 Al- 1 Mo- 1 V was {{measured}} and calculated for real-time and accelerated simulations of supersonic airplane loading and heating. Crack-growth rates calculated {{on the assumption}} that an entire flight could be represented by a single cycle predicted the experimental rates poorly. Calculated crack-growth rates were slower than the experimental rates for all tests with flight-by-flight loading. For room-temperature accelerated tests, the calculated rates agreed well with the experimental rates; but the calculations became progressively less accurate for progressively more complex test conditions (tests that included elevated temperature). Calculations of crack growth using the crack-closure concept can probably be improved through study of crack-opening stresses using finite-element models that account for variable-amplitude loading, residual stresses, and temperature effects. The calculations of crack growth could also be improved through detailed studies of material properties and interactions among stress, temperature, and time as appropriate for the real-time operating conditions of a <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> <b>airplane...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{applicability}} of sonic boom minimization concepts {{in the design}} of large <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> <b>airplanes</b> capable of a 2500 -nautical-mile range at a cruise Mach number of 2. 7 is considered. Aerodynamics, weight and balance, and mission performance as well as sonic boom factors, have been taken into account. The results indicate that shock-strength nominal values of somewhat less than 48 newtons/sq m during cruise are within the realm of possibility. Because many of the design features are in direct contradiction to presently accepted design practices, further study of qualified airplane design teams is required to ascertain sonic boom shock strength levels actually attainable for practical <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports...</b>|$|R
40|$|The flutter model {{represented}} the aft fuselage and empennage {{of a proposed}} <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> <b>airplane</b> and had an all movable horizontal tail with a geared elevator. It was tested mounted from a sting in the transonic dynamics tunnel. Symmetric flutter boundaries were determined experimentally at Mach numbers from 0. 7 to 1. 14 for a geared elevator configuration (gear ratio of 2. 8 to 1. 0) and an ungeared elevator configuration (gear ratio of 1. 0 to 1. 0). Gearing the elevator increased the experimental flutter dynamic pressures about 20 percent. Flutter calculations were made for the geared elevator configuration by using two analytical methods based on subsonic lifting surface theory. Both methods analyzed the stabilizer and elevator as a single, deforming surface, but one method also allowed the elevator to be analyzed as hinged from the stabilizer. All analyses predicted lower flutter dynamic pressures than experiment with best agreement (within 12 percent) for the hinged elevator method. Considering the model as mounted from a flexible rather than rigid sting in the analyses, had only a slight effect on the flutter results but was significant in that a sting related vibration mode {{was identified as a}} potentially flutter critical mode...|$|E
40|$|Two engine {{research}} {{experiments were}} recently completed in Moscow, Russia using an engine from the Tu- 144 <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> <b>airplane.</b> This was a joint project between the United States and Russia. Personnel from the NASA Lewis Research Center, General Electric Aircraft Engines, Pratt & Whitney, the Tupolev Design Bureau, and EBP Aircraft LTD worked {{together as a}} team to overcome the many technical and cultural challenges. The objective was to obtain large scale inlet data {{that could be used in}} the development of a supersonic inlet system for a future High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT). The-first experiment studied the impact of typical inlet structures that have trailing edges in close proximity to the inlet/engine interface plane on the flow characteristics at that plane. The inlet structure simulated the subsonic diffuser of a supersonic inlet using a bifurcated splitter design. The centerbody maximum diameter was designed to permit choking and slightly supercritical operation. The second experiment measured the reflective characteristics of the engine face to incoming perturbations of pressure amplitude. The basic test rig from the first experiment was used with a longer spacer equipped with fast actuated doors. All the objectives set forth at the beginning of the project were met...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the primary}} goals of NASA's {{high-speed}} research program {{is to determine the}} feasibility of designing an environmentally safe commercial <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> <b>airplane.</b> The largest environmental concern is focused on the amount of ozone destroying nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) that would be injected into the lower stratosphere during the cruise portion of the flight. The limitations placed on NO(x) emission require more than an order of magnitude reduction over current engine designs. To develop strategies to meet this goal requires first gaining a fundamental understanding of the combustion chemistry. To accurately model the combustor requires a computational fluid dynamics approach that includes both turbulence and chemistry. Since many of the important chemical processes in this regime involve highly reactive radicals, an experimental determination of the required thermodynamic data and rate constants is often very difficult. Unlike experimental approaches, theoretical methods are as applicable to highly reactive species as stable ones. Also our approximation of treating the dynamics classically becomes more accurate with increasing temperature. In this article we review recent progress in generating thermodynamic properties and rate constants that are required to understand NO(x) formation in the combustion process. We also describe our one-dimensional modeling efforts to validate an NH 3 combustion reaction mechanism. We have been working in collaboration with researchers at LeRC, to ensure that our theoretical work is focused on the most important thermodynamic quantities and rate constants required in the chemical data base...|$|E
40|$|Integration of {{propulsion}} {{and flight}} control systems will provide significant performance improvements for <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> <b>airplanes.</b> Increased engine thrust and reduced fuel consumption {{can be obtained}} by controlling engine stall margin as a function of flight and engine operating conditions. Improved inlet pressure recovery and decreased inlet drag can result from inlet control system integration. Using propulsion system forces and moments to augment the flight control system and airplane stability can reduce the flight control surface and tail size, weight, and drag. Special control modes may also be desirable for minimizing community noise and for emergency procedures. The overall impact of integrated controls on the takeoff gross weight for a generic high speed civil transport is presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} low-boom <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> <b>airplanes</b> with conventional configurations {{was made to}} identify the features of specific configurations that promise relatively low sonic boom overpressures (less than 47. 9 N/sq m). The range of values considered was gross weight from 28, 300 to 170, 000 kg; cruise Mach numbers of 2 to 3. 2; and wing loadings of 1436, 2870, and 4309 N/sq m. Fuselage length was varied from 49. 1 to 102. 4 m and fuselage diameter from 2. 75 to 3. 98 m. A nominal Mach 2 configuration weighing 56, 700 kg and having a wing loading of 2870 N/sq m was selected; and its gross geometric, aerodynamic, and structural features were estimated. At a cruise altitude of 18, 300 m, lift-drag ratio {{was estimated to be}} 7. 35, while sonic boom overpressure was 41. 7 N/sq m. Takeoff thrust loading using four afterburning turbojet engines at maximum dry thrust was 0. 32. Payload for a 4440 -km range was 16. 7 percent of gross weight, giving a direct operating cost of 0. 82 cent per seat statute mile...|$|R
40|$|A {{leading edge}} flap (16) for <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> <b>airplanes</b> is disclosed. In its stowed position, {{the leading edge}} flap forms the lower surface of the wing leading edge up to the {{horizontal}} center of the leading edge radius. For low speed operation, the vortex leading edge flap moves forward and rotates down. The upward curve of the flap leading edge triggers flow separation on the flap and rotational flow on the upper surface of the flap (vortex). The rounded shape of the upper fixed leading edge provides the conditions for a controlled reattachment of the flow on the upper wing surface and therefore a stable vortex. The vortex generates lift and a nose-up pitching moment. This improves maximum lift at low speed, reduces attitude for a given lift coefficient and improves lift to drag ratio. The mechanism (27) to move the vortex flap consists of two spanwise supports (24) with two diverging straight tracks (64 and 68) each and a screw drive mechanism (62) {{in the center of}} the flap panel (29). The flap motion is essentially normal to the airloads and therefore requires only low actuation forces...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} viability of a <b>supersonic</b> commercial <b>transport</b> <b>airplane</b> {{would be much}} enhanced ifitcould y supersonically over land. E orts to design an airplane to produce a minimized sonic boom at the ground require knowledge {{of the impact of}} sonic booms on people. Loudness, being a fundamental and well-understood characteristic of human hearing, was chosen as a means of quantifying the magnitude of sonic boom impact on people. This paper describes in detail a procedure that can be used tocalculate the loudness of sonic booms. The procedure is applied {{to a wide range of}} sonic booms, both classical N-waves and a variety of other shapes of booms. The loudness of N-waves is controlled by overpressure and the associated rise time. The loudness of shaped booms is highly dependent on the characteristics of the initial shock. A comparison of the calculated loudness values indicates that shaped booms may have signi cantly reduced loudness relative to N-waves having the same peak overpressure. This result implies that a <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> designed to yield minimized sonic booms may be substantially more acceptable than an unconstrained design...|$|R
40|$|A video-based photogrammetric model {{deformation}} system was {{established as a}} dedicated optical measurement technique at supersonic speeds in the NASA Langley Research Center Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel. This system {{was used to measure}} the wing twist due to aerodynamic loads of two <b>supersonic</b> commercial <b>transport</b> <b>airplane</b> models with identical outer mold lines but different aeroelastic properties. One model featured wings with deflectable leading- and trailing-edge flaps and internal channels to accommodate static pressure tube instrumentation. The wings of the second model were of single-piece construction without flaps or internal channels. The testing was performed at Mach numbers from 1. 6 to 2. 7, unit Reynolds numbers of 1. 0 million to 5. 0 million, and angles of attack from - 4 degrees to + 10 degrees. The video {{model deformation}} system quantified the wing aeroelastic response to changes in the Mach number, Reynolds number concurrent with dynamic pressure, and angle of attack and effectively captured the differences in the wing twist characteristics between the two test articles...|$|R

This work, supported by the NASA and the FAA, includes an in-depth analysis of sonic boom measurements recorded at the BREN tower, a summary and evaluation of sonic boom investigations {{done in the last}} decade and a half, and configuration studies to determine practical lower bound sonic boom limits. The BREN tower test program yielded unique and valuable data {{because it was the first}} time that vertical profile measurements were made through caustics produced by maneuvers and atmospheric refraction. The objective of the second effort is to compile in a single reference an annotated abstract, including significant results, for each published sonic boom study and to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of the art to aid future researchers.
