The spring {{in the present case}} was the artistic commendation she deserved and craved. At this particular moment she was engaged with the man on her own right, a representative of Family, who talked positively and hollowly, as if shouting down a vista of five hundred years from the Feudal past. The lady on Jocelyn's left, wife of a Lord Justice of Appeal, was in like manner talking to her companion on the outer side; so that, for the time, he was left to himself. He took advantage of the opportunity, drew out his letter, and read it as it lay upon his napkin, nobody observing him, so far as he was aware.|$|E

60|$|In {{the same}} gale that wrecked the {{above-mentioned}} vessel, {{a portion of}} a ship's mast was driven ashore, after evidently having been a very long time in and under water; for it was covered with great barnacles, and torn sea-weed, insomuch that there was scarcely a bare place along its whole length; clusters of <b>sea-anemones</b> were sticking to it, and I know not what strange marine productions besides. J----- at once recognized the <b>sea-anemones,</b> knowing them by his much reading of Gosse's Aquarium; and though they must now have been two or three days high and dry out of water, he made an extempore aquarium out of a bowl, and put in above a dozen of these strange creatures. In a little while they bloomed out wonderfully, and even seemed to produce young anemones; but, from some fault in his management, they afterwards grew sickly and died. S----- thinks that the old storm-shattered mast, so studded with the growth of the ocean depths, is a relic of the Spanish Armada which strewed its wrecks along all the shores of England; but I hardly think it would have taken three hundred years to produce this crop of barnacles and <b>sea-anemones.</b> A single summer might probably have done it.|$|R

But {{even if there are}} such, which planetoscopists doubt, they must be very different creatures in form and function from any we know on this one small world of ours. For just consider, Frida, what we mean by life. We mean a set of simultaneous and consecutive changes going on in a complex mass of organised carbon compounds. When most people say 'life,' however,--especially here with you, where education is undeveloped--they aren't thinking of life in general at all (which is mainly vegetable), but only of animal and often indeed of human life. Well, then, consider, even on this planet itself, how special are the conditions that make life possible. There must be water in some form, for there's no life in the desert. There must be heat up to a certain point, and not above or below it, for fire kills, and there's no life at the poles (as among Alpine glaciers), or what little there is depends upon the intervention of other life wafted from elsewhere--from the lands or seas, in fact, where it can really originate. In order to have life at all, as WE know it at least (and I can't say whether anything else could be fairly called life by any true analogy, until I've seen and examined it), you must have carbon, and oxygen, and hydrogen, and nitrogen, and many other things, under certain fixed conditions; you must have liquid water, not steam or ice: you must have a certain restricted range of temperature, neither very much higher nor very much lower than the average of the tropics. Now, look, even with all these conditions fulfilled, how diverse is life on this earth itself, the one place we really know--varying as much as from the oak to the cuttle-fish, from the palm to the tiger, from man to the fern, the sea-weed, or the jelly-speck. Every one of these creatures is a complex result of very complex conditions, among which you must never forget to reckon the previous existence and interaction of all the antecedent ones. Is it probable, then, even a priori, that if life or anything like it exists on any other planet, it would exist in forms at all as near our own as a buttercup is to a human being, or a <b>sea-anemone</b> is to a cat or a pine-tree?" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the early}} morning I hear a sort of call or jodel under my window: and know 'tis the matutinal milkman leaving his can at my gate. O {{household}} gods! have I lived all these years and don't know the price or the quantity of the milk which is delivered in that can? Why don't I know? As I live, if I live till to-morrow morning, as soon as I hear the call of Lactantius, I will dash out upon him. How many cows? How much milk, on an average, all the year round? What rent? What cost of food and dairy servants? What loss of animals, and average cost of purchase? If I interested myself properly about my pint (or hogshead, whatever it be) of milk, all this knowledge would ensue; all this additional interest in life. What is this talk of my friend, Mr. Lewes, about objects at the seaside, and so forth?* Objects at the seaside? Objects at the area-bell: objects before my nose: objects which the butcher brings me in his tray: which the cook dresses and puts down before me, and over which I say grace! My daily life is surrounded with objects which ought to interest me. The pudding I eat (or refuse, that is neither here nor there; and, between ourselves, what I have said about batter-pudding may be taken cum grano--we are not come to that yet, except {{for the sake of}} argument or illustration)--the pudding, I say, on my plate, the eggs that made it, the fire that cooked it, the tablecloth on which it is laid, and so forth--are each and all of these objects a knowledge of which I may acquire--a knowledge of the cost and production of which I might advantageously learn? To the man who DOES know these things, I say the interest of life is prodigiously increased. The milkman becomes, a study to him; the baker a being he curiously and tenderly examines. Go, Lewes, and clap a hideous <b>sea-anemone</b> into a glass: I will put a cabman under mine, and make a vivisection of a butcher. O Lares, Penates, and gentle household gods, teach me to sympathize with all that comes within my doors! Give me an interest in the butcher's book. Let me look forward to the ensuing number of the grocer's account with eagerness. It seems ungrateful to my kitchen-chimney not to know the cost of sweeping it; and I trust that many a man who reads this, and muses on it, will feel, like the writer, ashamed of himself, and hang down his head humbly.|$|E

50|$|Anthopleurin {{functions}} {{both as a}} toxin {{as well as a}} pheromone. When {{a predator}} approaches the anemone, their reaction is to withdraw their tentacles and oral disc.

The body region of the <b>sea-anemone</b> that is exposed to the predator contains the highest concentration of anthopleurin. After consuming the <b>sea-anemone,</b> the predator travels through the water and actually helps to spread the anthopleurin. This functions as an alarm pheromone for the other anemones, so they can hide certain body parts and defend themselves.|$|E

6000|$|You find one: {{and in a}} moment, what a change! The deep has {{suddenly}} become shallow; the blue white, from the gleam of the white coral at the bottom. But the coral is not all white, only indeed a little of it; for as you look down through the clear water, you find that the coral is starred with innumerable live flowers, blue, crimson, grey, every conceivable hue; and {{that these are the}} coral polypes, each with its ring of arms thrust out of its cell, who are building up their common habitations of lime. If you want to understand, by a rough but correct description, what a coral polype is: all who have been to the sea-side know, or at least have heard of, <b>sea-anemones.</b> [...] Now coral polypes are <b>sea-anemones,</b> which make each a shell of lime, growing with its growth. As for their shapes, the variety of them, the beauty of them, no tongue can describe them. If you want to see them, go to the Coral Rooms of the British or Liverpool Museums, and judge for yourselves. Only remember that you must re-clothe each of those exquisite forms with a coating of live jelly of some delicate hue, and put back into every one of the thousand cells its living flower; and into the beds, or rather banks, of the salt-water flower garden, the gaudiest of shell-less <b>sea-anemones,</b> such as we have on our coasts, rooted in the cracks, and live shells and sea-slugs, as gaudy as they, crawling about, with fifty other forms of fantastic and exuberant life. You must not overlook, too, the fish, especially the parrot-fish, some of them of the gaudiest colours, who spend their lives in browsing on the live coral, with strong clipping and grinding teeth, just as a cow browses the grass, keeping the animal matter, and throwing away the lime {{in the form of an}} impalpable white mud, which fills up the interstices in the coral beds.|$|R

5000|$|CgNa is a {{polypeptide}} toxin with {{a measured}} mass of 5046 Da.

It has six cysteine amino acids. They are linked by three disulfide bonds between residues at positions 4- 44, 6 -34 and 27- 45.The structure consists of four β-strands formed by residues at position 1-3, 21-23, 32-33 and 43-46. Furthermore, the polypeptide has three β-turns at residues 13-16, 27-30 and 31-34. The first two β-strands are connected by a long loop.CgNa {{is a member of}} a family of <b>sea-anemone</b> sodium-channel type 1 toxins. CgNa shares structural similarities and sequence homology with other anemone type 1 toxins such as ApA, ApB and ATX, but, interestingly, also with the type 2 sodium channel toxin Sh1 of Stichodactyla helianthus. The most distinctive feature in the primary structure between CgNa and its related proteins lies in its difference in the distribution of electrostatic charge; CgNa contains more negatively charged residues and a lower percentage of exposed hydrophobic residues than is typical for type I and II toxins. This is likely to effect the binding of the toxin to sodium channels.|$|E
