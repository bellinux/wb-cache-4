25|$|The {{first round}} of the 2010 general {{election}} was held in December. Mirlande Manigat and Jude Celestin qualified for {{the second round of the}} presidential election, but its results were contested. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> that the first round was a fraud and that Michel Martelly should replace Jude Celestin, René Préval's chosen successor. There was some violence between the contending parties. On 4 April 2011, the Provisional Electoral Council announced preliminary results indicating that Martelly had won the presidential election.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the spy plane {{incident}} and the attempted cover-up, the Four Power Paris Summit was not completed. At the beginning of the talks on 16 May, there was still hope that the two sides could come together even after the events that took place earlier in May, but Eisenhower refused to apologize and Khrushchev left the summit one day after it had begun. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> that Khrushchev had overreacted to the event in an attempt to strengthen his own position, and for that, he was the one to blame for the collapse of the Four Power Paris Summit.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{man called}} Bronckhorst--a three-cornered, middle-aged man in the Army--gray as a badger, and, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said,</b> {{with a touch of}} country-blood in him. That, however, cannot be proved.|$|E

5000|$|I've heard how <b>some</b> <b>people</b> have <b>said</b> that I've changed That I'm {{not what}} I was, how {{it really is}} a shame The {{thoughts}} in their heads manifest on their brow Like bad scars from ill feeling they themselves arouse.|$|R
60|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> that Sir Thomas Ryder was a {{man without}} any sentiment; others {{that he was a}} slave to red tape; but no one denied the uncontrovertible fact that he was the right man in the right place.|$|E
60|$|It {{was never}} even known {{just how much}} money was stolen from the bank. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> ten {{thousand}} dollars, others more. The bank, no doubt for business motives, claimed that {{the contents of the}} safe were intact and that the robber had been foiled in his design.|$|E
60|$|Maggie Hatfield, who had {{not been}} at prayer meeting the night {{beforehand}} knew nothing of what had occurred, looked at her curiously, wondering what Lawrence Eastman could see in her to be as crazy about her as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> he was. Bessy was looking her oldest and plainest just then, with her hair combed severely back from her pale, dispirited face.|$|E
500|$|Alistair Taylor (Epstein's assistant) later {{admitted}} that financial mistakes were made: [...] "We did our best; <b>some</b> <b>people</b> have <b>said</b> it wasn't good enough. That's {{easy to say}} with 20/20 hindsight but remember {{that there were no}} rules. We were making it up as we went along." ...|$|R

60|$|There was a {{man called}} Bronckhorst--a three-cornered, middle-aged man in the Army--gray as a badger, and, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said,</b> {{with a touch of}} country-blood in him. That, however, cannot be proved. Mrs. Bronckhorst was not exactly young, though fifteen years younger than her husband. She was a large, pale, quiet woman, with heavy eyelids, over weak eyes, and hair that turned red or yellow as the lights fell on it.|$|E
60|$|So the Dormouse stood impatiently {{tapping his}} boots till the Mole should be ready. The Dormouse {{was dressed in}} the height of fashion, and thought himself a rather {{handsome}} fellow. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> that he was conceited, and indeed a Spider that was near at hand plainly told him so; but, whether this was true or not, {{there is no doubt}} that he was a very kind little fellow, because he came to lead his poor blind cousin to the feast.|$|E
60|$|And so {{she felt}} herself to be. Nor was she in the least ashamed of her {{position}} in that respect. If there was aught of shame about her, as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said,</b> it certainly {{did not come from}} {{the fact that she was}} in the receipt of a salary for the performance of certain prescribed duties. Such remuneration was, she thought, as honourable as the Doctor's income; but to her American intelligence, the acceptance of a present of money from a Marchioness would have been a degradation.|$|E
60|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> have <b>said</b> since, that he {{only thought}} what has been herein set down; others, that he {{read it in the}} fire, one winter night about the {{twilight}} time; others, that the Ghost was but the representation of his gloomy thoughts, and Milly the embodiment of his better wisdom. I say nothing.|$|R

6000|$|... "This cat {{was very}} mischievous and very sly. She was very sly: very indeed. In fact {{she used to}} go about the house so very slyly, getting into all sorts of {{mischief}} which the people could never find out till afterwards, that they gave her the name of Sligo. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> that the reason why she had that name was because she came from a place called Sligo, in Ireland. But {{that was not the}} reason. It was veritably and truly because she was so sly." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a {{sufficiently}} easy task. Hicks was born honest; I, without that incumbrance--so <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said.</b> Hicks {{saw what he}} saw, and reported accordingly; I saw more than was visible, and added to it such details as could help. Hicks had no imagination, I had a double supply. He was born calm, I was born excited. No vision could start a rapture in him, and he was constipated as to language, anyway; but if I saw a vision I emptied the dictionary onto it and lost the remnant of my mind into the bargain.|$|E
60|$|All England {{was eager}} with {{expectancy}} {{over the new}} expedition. It was {{to be commanded by}} Sir John Franklin, the greatest sailor of the day, who had just returned from his five years in Van Diemen's Land and carried his fifty-nine winters as jauntily as a midshipman. The era was auspicious. A new reign under a {114} queen already beloved had just opened. There was every hope of a long, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> a perpetual, peace: it seemed fitting that the new triumphs of commerce and science, of steam and the magnetic telegraph, should replace the older and cruder glories of war.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> have <b>said,</b> “In {{their new}} book, 'The Lost Gospel,' Jacobovici and Wilson have {{uncovered}} {{one of the}} greatest ancient literary and archaeological mysteries.

[...] - Rabbi Dr. Richard Freund, Maurice Greenberg Professor of Jewish History, University of Hartford.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the act was passed, the UK miner's strike had just started and, as a result, the {{government}} passed acts like this to limit the effect caused by strikes by this. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> have <b>said</b> that the law was passed {{after the start of}} the Falkland's war due to the increase in popularity for the government brought on by the conflict.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Delaplaine was angry, {{intensely}} angry. Such a shameful, wicked trick {{had never}} before been played upon a loving daughter. There were no words in which to express his most justifiable wrath. Again he went to the town to learn more, but there was nothing more to learn except that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> they had reason to believe that Bonnet had gone to follow Blackbeard. From things they had heard they supposed that the vessel which had sailed away in the night had gone to offer herself as consort to the Revenge; to rob and burn in the company of that notorious ship.|$|E
6000|$|Martin readily {{undertook}} this task, and Mr Pecksniff forthwith {{proceeded to}} entrust {{him with the}} materials necessary for its execution; dwelling meanwhile on the magical effect of a few finishing touches from {{the hand of a}} master; which, indeed, as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> (and these were the old enemies again!) was unquestionably very surprising, and almost miraculous; as there were cases on record in which the masterly introduction of an additional back window, or a kitchen door, or half-a-dozen steps, or even a water spout, had made the design of a pupil Mr Pecksniff's own work, and had brought substantial rewards into that gentleman's pocket. But such is the magic of genius, which changes all it handles into gold! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{news was}} carried to Mr. Mulcahy the next day, and that unfortunate artist went mad immediately! He had set his whole {{reputation}} upon this miniature, {{and declared that}} it should be faultless. Such was the effect of the announcement upon his susceptible heart! When Mrs. Hoggarty died, your uncle took the portrait and always wore it himself. His sisters said it was {{for the sake of the}} diamond; whereas, ungrateful things! it was merely on account of their hair, and his love for the fine arts. As for the poor artist, my dear, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> it was the profuse use of spirit that brought on delirium tremens; but I don't believe it.

50|$|Tar Baby is a {{story about}} a fox and a rabbit. The fox {{attempts}} to trick his arch enemy, the rabbit, by placing a doll made from tar in its path, which is the tar baby. After the rabbit gets stuck to the doll, he tricks the fox into helping him escape. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> have <b>said</b> that the rabbit represents an African American slave who out thinks his master.|$|R

I want them on Guantanamo, where they don't get the access to lawyers that they get when they're on our soil. I don't want them in our prisons.

6000|$|Whilst he {{was lying}} sick in this way, there came to the Court of Paflagonia a famous painter, whose name was Tomaso Lorenzo, and who was Painter in Ordinary to the King of Crim Tartary, Paflagonia's neighbour. Tomaso Lorenzo painted all the Court, who were delighted with his works; for even Countess Gruffanuff looked young and Glumboso good-humoured in his pictures. 'He flatters very much,' <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said.</b> 'Nay!' says Princess Angelica, 'I am above flattery, and I think he did not make my picture {{handsome}} enough. I can't bear to hear a man of genius unjustly cried down, and I hope my dear papa will make Lorenzo a knight of his Order of the Cucumber.' ...|$|E
60|$|The bailiffs and brokers {{seized upon}} poor Raggles in Curzon Street, {{and the late}} fair tenant of that poor little mansion was in the meanwhile--where? Who cared! Who asked after a day or two? Was she guilty or not? We all know how {{charitable}} the world is, and how the verdict of Vanity Fair goes {{when there is a}} doubt. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> she had gone to Naples in pursuit of Lord Steyne, whilst others averred that his Lordship quitted that city and fled to Palermo on hearing of Becky's arrival; some said she was living in Bierstadt, and had become a dame d'honneur to the Queen of Bulgaria; some that she was at Boulogne; and others, at a boarding-house at Cheltenham.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{contrast}} to its neighbours {{on either side of}} its pink and gray limestone wall. On one side began the grounds of the Great Rockstone Hotel; on the other was Cliff House, the big and seldom- inhabited house of one of the chief partners in the marble works, which went on {{on the other side of}} the promontory, and <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>said</b> would one day consume Rockstone altogether. It was a very fine house, and the gardens were reported to be beautifully kept up, but the owner was almost always in Italy, and had so seldom been at Rockstone that it was understood that all this was the ostentation of a man who did not know what to do with his money.|$|E
50|$|It was {{probably}} in the 19th century that the Ca de Bou acquired its look and typicity. The sport of bullbaiting was an expensive one, and the new sport and trend of dog fighting was spreading across Europe and the colonies. Different areas and countries had their fighting dogs. Their shape and sizes would depend on taste, climate, or surroundings. Even still in recent times, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> have <b>said</b> this breed is stronger than another.|$|R
