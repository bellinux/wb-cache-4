40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} a causal {{link between the}} limited time of unemployment benefits recipiency and the behavior <b>of</b> <b>re-employment</b> wages. We use a quasi-natural experiment that originates in an exogenous increase of the unemployment insurance entitlement period in Portugal to collect causal evidence. We find that a more generous UI has a tiny positive impact on re-employment wages. More importantly, our contribution shows that the average treatment effect varies widely with the moment <b>of</b> <b>re-employment.</b> The larger impacts are obtained around the pre-reform exhaustion date. This behavior {{seems to be the}} consequence of the spike in the job finding rate close to benefit exhaustion that generates a trough in re-employment wages. In this period, UI generates treatment effects on re-employment wages in excess of 20 percent, relatively to a counterfactual without the UI extension. These gains are larger in the upper quantiles of the distribution of reemployment wages. As predicted by non-stationary job search models, our results highlight the role of UI in shaping the search behavior of the unemployed, working as a life vest <b>of</b> <b>re-employment</b> wages, possibly through its impact on the reservation wage...|$|R

Using temporary personnel is becoming considerably more common throughout the Swedish workplace.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the job prospects of displaced industrial workers in Switzerland. Based on a survey of 1, 203 workers who were dismissed after their manufacturing plants closed down, we analyse the determinants <b>of</b> <b>re-employment,</b> the sector <b>of</b> <b>re-employment</b> and the change in wages. Two years after displacement, a majority of workers were back in employment: 69 % were re-employed, 17 % un-employed and 11 % retired. Amongst re-employed workers, two thirds found a job in manufacturing and one third in services. Contrary to a common belief, low-end services are not the collecting vessel of redundant industrial workers. Displaced workers aged 55 and older seem particularly vulnerable after a plant closes down: over 30 % were long-term unemployed, and those older workers who found a new job suffered disproportionate wage losses. Advanced age-and not low education-appears as the primary handicap after mass redundancy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} on the time use and emotional well-being of unemployed individuals {{in the weeks before}} and after starting a new job. The major findings are: (1) time spent on home production drops sharply at the time <b>of</b> <b>re-employment,</b> even when controlling for individual fixed effects; (2) time spent on leisure-related activities, which the unemployed find less enjoyable, drops on re-employment, but less so when controlling for individual fixed effects; (3) the unemployed report higher levels of sadness during specific episodes of the day than the employed; and (4) sadness decreases abruptly at the time of reemployment. How do unemployed individuals allocate and experience their time? How does their time use and emotional experience change once they find a job? This paper provides new {{evidence on the}} time use and emotional well-being of unemployed and employed individuals in the U. S., using longitudinal data from a survey of unemployed workers in New Jersey. We find evidence that the time spent on home production activities drops sharply at the time <b>of</b> <b>re-employment,</b> with the magnitude of the shift in line with previous research using cross-sectional time use surveys (Hamermesh and Burda, 2010; Krueger and Mueller, forthcoming). 1 Leisure activities also decrease at the time <b>of</b> <b>re-employment,</b> though somewhat less than in cross-sectional time use data, partly because those finding a job were spending more time on job search activities in the weeks prior to re-employment. We also investigate the relationship between unemployment and emotional well-being in connection with time use. Despite the fact that the unemployed spend relatively more time in leisure-related activities, we find that the unemployed enjoy these activities to a lesser degree than their employed counterparts and thus, on an average day, report higher levels of sadness than the employed. Moreover, using the longitudinal data from the NJ survey, we find that the sadness decreases significantly at the time <b>of</b> <b>re-employment...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between individual characteristics of displaced workers and the probability <b>of</b> <b>re-employment.</b> A competing risks hazard model is used, distinguishing between exits from joblessness to self-employment and to paid-employment. All individuals between 25 and 55 years of age, {{at the time of}} displacement, that suffered from at least one year of joblessness after being displaced between 1990 and 1998 due to establishment closures that occurred between 1990 and 2001 are included. This allows for the closure procedure to be between one and three years long. Each individual is followed, from the year of displacement until the year <b>of</b> <b>re-employment</b> or at the latest, ten years after displacement. Semi-parametric estimation techniques for discrete time data are used, and in consistency with previous research the results show that subgroups of the jobless individuals experience different re-employment probabilities. The results suggest that a non-immigrant, high income-earner in the mid-thirties, with short tenure at the closing establishment, and who was not displaced early in the closure process and who has lived in the same city for a long time, faces the greatest probability of becoming re-employed. Furthermore, men and individuals with self-employment experience face lower probabilities <b>of</b> <b>re-employment</b> in paid-employments compared to their counterparts. This relationship is however reversed when studying the probability of leaving joblessness for self-employment. Men, immigrants, high income-earners, displaced from smaller establishments, previously self-employed and those with shorter tenure in previous employment are found to be more likely to enter self-employment than their counterparts. A positive duration dependency is prevalent in re-employment probability, suggesting that search activity is increased over time. The probability of self-employment entry is however decreasing the first years of joblessness following displacement, displaying an initial negative duration dependency...|$|R

Our findings showed that re-employed people did not have less distress than those still unemployed and outside the labour force when other factors were controlled for.

High risk of distress was especially persistent among those who experienced financial hardship and marital break-up and who had not had previous psychological distress. Women exhibited higher distress than men, and older persons higher distress than younger. To a certain extent, psychological distress was unrelated to the unemployment situation itself, but seemed instead {{to be due to}} a selective process ending in long-term unemployment experienced by persons with psychological distress at the outset ofjoblessness.

40|$|PURPOSE: Many {{workers have}} been {{dismissed}} {{in the past few}} years, either becoming unemployed or finding re-employment. The current study examined whether dismissal and its follow-up for the employee (re-employment versus unemployment) could be predicted from workers' employment contract and age, and their health status, work ability, work performance, work satisfaction and employee investments at baseline. METHODS: Our sample comprised a selection of participants from the Netherlands Working Conditions Survey 2010 who participated in a follow-up questionnaire in 2012 (N= 2, 644). We used logistic regression analyses to test our hypotheses. RESULTS: Temporary employment, low health status, low work ability, poor work performance, low work satisfaction and no employee investments in terms of training predicted future dismissal. Furthermore, older workers and workers reporting decreased work performance due to impaired health at baseline had a lower chance <b>of</b> <b>re-employment</b> after being dismissed. Interestingly, after taking into account all predictors, former temporary workers without permanent employment prospects had much better chances <b>of</b> <b>re-employment</b> after their dismissal than former permanent workers.

40|$|Reduced trade {{barriers}} and lower costs {{of transportation and}} information have meant that a growing {{part of the economy}} has been exposed to international trade. In particular, this is the case in the service sector. We divide the service sector into a tradable and a non-tradable part using an approach to identify tradable industries utilizing a measure of regional concentration of production. We examine whether the probability of displacement is higher and income losses after displacement greater for workers in tradable services and manufacturing (tradable) than in non-tradable services. We also analyze whether the probability <b>of</b> <b>re-employment</b> is higher for workers displaced from tradable services and manufacturing than from non-tradable services. We find that in the 2000 s the probability of displacement is relatively high in tradable services in comparison to non-tradable services and manufacturing. On the other hand, the probability <b>of</b> <b>re-employment</b> is higher for those displaced from tradable services. The largest income losses are found for those who had been displaced from manufacturing. Interestingly, the income losses of those displaced from manufacturing seems mainly to be due to longer spells of non-employment, whereas for those displaced in tradable services lower wages in their new jobs compared to their pre-displacement jobs appears to play a larger role.

Therefore, at some stage during the lengthy course of RA, institution of traditional DMARDs that have previously been applied may have to be reconsidered. In the present study we investigated the effectiveness of re-employed methotrexate in patients with a history of previous methotrexate failure (original course). A total of 1, 490 RA patients (80 % female, 59 % rheumatoid factor positive) were followed from their first presentation, yielding a total of 6, 470 patient-years of observation. We identified patients in whom methotrexate was re-employed after at least one intermittent course of a different DMARD. We compared reasons for discontinuation, improvement in acute phase reactants, and cumulative retention rates of methotrexate therapy between the original course of methotrexate and its re-employment. Similar analyses were peformed for other DMARDs. Methotrexate was re-employed in 86 patients. Compared with the original courses, re-employment was associated with a reduced risk for treatment termination because of ineffectiveness (P = 0. 02, by McNemar test), especially if the maximum methotrexate dose of the original course had been low (< 12. 5 mg/week; P = 0. 02, by logistic regression). In a Cox regression model, re-employed MTX was associated with a significantly reduced hazard of treatment termination compared with the original course of methotrexate, adjusting for dose and year of employment (hazard ratio 0. 64, 95 % confidence interval 0. 42 – 0. 97; P = 0. 04). These findings were not recapitulated in analyses <b>of</b> <b>re-employment</b> <b>of</b> other DMARDs. <b>Re-employment</b> <b>of</b> MTX despite prior inefficacy, but not <b>re-employment</b> <b>of</b> other DMARDs, is an effective therapeutic option, especially in those patients in whom the methotrexate dose of the original course was low...|$|R
