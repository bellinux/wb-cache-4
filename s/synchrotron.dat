5|$|With the {{development}} of the particle accelerator {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles. The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst.

In 1947, <b>synchrotron</b> radiation was discovered with a 70MeV electron <b>synchrotron</b> at General Electric.

However, in 1946 Bacher was appointed to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the new United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, along with fellow United States representatives Tolman and Oppenheimer.

The most powerful source in existence, ISIS in the UK, delivers a 160 -kW proton beam to a neutron-generating target. Several recently proposed facilities require proton beams in the MW range to produce intense short-pulse neutron beams. In some proposals, a linear accelerator provides the beam power and an accumulator ring compresses the pulse length to the required {approx} 1 {micro}s. In others, RCS technology provides {{the bulk of the}} beam power and compresses the pulse length.
