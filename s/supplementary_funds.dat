40|$|Abstract Background Guided by the {{evidence}} that delaying coronary revascularization may lead to symptom worsening and poorer clinical outcomes, expansion in cardiac surgery capacity has been recommended in Canada. Provincial governments started providing one-time and recurring increases in budgets for additional open heart surgeries to reduce waiting times. We sought {{to determine whether the}} year of decision to proceed with non-emergency coronary bypass surgery had an effect on time to surgery. Methods Using records from a population-based registry, we studied times between decision to operate and the procedure itself. We estimated changes in the length of time that patients had to wait for non-emergency operation over 14 calendar periods that included several years when <b>supplementary</b> <b>funding</b> was available. We studied waiting times separately for patients who access surgery through a wait list and through direct admission. Results During two periods when <b>supplementary</b> <b>funding</b> was available, 1998 – 1999 and 2004 – 2005, the weekly rate of undergoing surgery from a wait list was, respectively, 50 % and 90 % higher than in 1996 – 1997, the period with the longest waiting times. We also observed a reduction in the difference between 90 th and 50 th percentiles of the waiting-time distributions. Forty percent of patients in the 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2005 cohorts (years when <b>supplementary</b> <b>funding</b> was provided) underwent surgery within 16 to 20 weeks following the median waiting time, while it took between 27 and 37 weeks for the cohorts registered in the years when <b>supplementary</b> <b>funding</b> was not available. Times between decision and surgery were shorter for direct admissions than for wait-listed patients. Among patients who were directly admitted to hospital, time between decision and surgery was longest in 1992 – 1993 and then has been steadily decreasing through the late nineties. The rate of surgery among these patients was the highest in 1998 – 1999, and has not changed afterwards, even for years when <b>supplementary</b> <b>funding</b> was provided. Conclusions Waiting times for non-emergency coronary bypass surgery shortened after <b>supplementary</b> <b>funding</b> was granted to increase volume of cardiac surgical care in a health system with publicly-funded universal coverage for the procedure. The effect of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>funding</b> was not uniform for patients that access the services through wait lists and through direct admission. </p...|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{cultural}} institutions everywhere are increasingly market-driven in {{their need for}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>funds</b> and as a justification for continued public support. The American model of an essentially privatized culture is increasingly attractive to governments seeking to curtail their cultural subsidies. In a system of mixed funding, public culture can nurture the arts groups and cultural activities that contribute to individual self-worth and community definition even if counting for less in the economic bottom-line. At root, a cultural policy is about creating public spheres that are not dependent upon profit motives nor validated by commercial values. As political democracy is dependent upon the existence of civil society and socio-economic pluralism, cultural policy stands as an essential public commitment in realizing these fundamental preconditions.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} the failure of this project to achieve {{sustainability}} can be attributed to many factors. Because the project started off on a different path, the final route that it took was disorganized and lacked clear objectives once the facilities were built. The villagers of Chungungo formed a committee to see to the maintenance and repair of the collectors, funded by collections from the village households, but, ironically, the new water supply caused the population of the village to triple and the committee was unable to acquire the <b>supplementary</b> <b>funds</b> to expand the array of collectors and the reservoir, which would have solved any new water shortage problems easily and cost effectively. It is also suggested that this and other methods of water supply are shunned by the people of Chungungo and towns in other developing countries, who feel that collecting one’s own water lacks prestige and think that the state should pay for such services. In fact, this is exactly what the people of Chungungo wanted as of 2003 - a pipeline costing around US$1 million to be built from Los Choros river, 20 km away.|$|E
50|$|The IDA is {{a unique}} part of the World Bank as it {{requires}} continuous replenishment of its resources. Member countries replenish its funds through contributions in addition to <b>supplementary</b> <b>funds</b> provided by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Whereas the IBRD acquires most of its funds by raising capital on international financial markets, the IDA heavily depends on contributions from its member states. The IDA received 2 billion in special drawing rights ($3 billion USD) from the IBRD and IFC. Approximately half of the IDA's resources come from the 45 donating member countries. In its early years, the IDA received most of its replenishments from the United Kingdom and United States but, {{because they were not}} always reliable sources of funding, other developed nations began to step in and fill the economic gaps not met by these two countries. Every three years, member nations that provide funds to the IDA gather together to replenish the IDA's resources. These funds come primarily from well-developed countries including the United States, Japan, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom with 58% from the US, 22% from France, and 8% from the UK. As of 2014, there have been 17 IDA replenishment rounds. Fifty one member countries participated in the IDA's 16th replenishment of $49.3 billion USD. The IDA's loans and grants are usually not paid in full to the borrower at the outset, but rather disbursed incrementally as needed by the project. Most of the donor countries such as the United States commit letters of credit to the IDA which bear no interest and are not able to be transferred or revoked, and which are exchanged for cash as needed for project disbursal. Other countries pay their contributions in full on the date of commitment to the IDA so that it may cover its operating expenses. Donors receive no return of funds and repayments from borrowers are again loaned to future projects such that donors won't need to commit those funds again in the future.|$|E
40|$|Community {{financing}} is {{an important}} source of <b>supplementary</b> <b>funds</b> for education, particularly where governments are unable to meet all the needs of their peoples. While this is widely recognised, little empirical research has been conducted on the topic. This paper analyses patterns in Bhutan. It observes that until the 1990 s few resources for education were provided by communities, but that the scale of financing has increased during the present decade. The paper notes that although communities have in general responded positively to government calls for local inputs, local resourcing has some problematic aspects. The paper focuses particularly on issues of regional, rural/urban and socio-economic equity, and shows how discussion of Bhutanese experiences contributes to the international literature. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This research (as its objectives) exposes the condition of amenities, identifies associated socio-economic benefits and reveals problems confronting the Lokoja Confluence Beach in Kogi State, Nigeria. A survey design (with the aid of questionnaires and interview guide) was employed to obtain data from tourists, managers of the Confluence Beach and government officials at the State Tourism Board. Purposive sampling technique was adopted to select respondent tourists. Univariate analysis was employed to obtain relevant information from collated data.

40|$|Decentralization {{throughout}} {{the developing world}} raises questions about how local political processes affect the provision of local public goods. To investigate this, I conducted a randomized field experiment in 48 Indonesian villages that were each {{in the process of}} applying for village infrastructure funds. Villages were randomly assigned one of two political mechanisms for choosing projects, either a representative meeting-based mechanism or a direct election-based mechanism. I find that the election-based mechanism resulted in dramatically higher satisfaction, increased knowledge about the project chosen, greater perceived benefits from the project, and higher reported willingness among villagers to contribute <b>supplementary</b> <b>funds</b> and labor to the project. The political mechanisms used had much smaller effects on the actual types and locations of project chosen, with some evidence that direct elections resulted in projects located in poorer, but less isolated, areas of villages. The results show that direct participation in political decision making can substantially increase legitimacy, even if it has relatively little effect on the ultimate decisions taken...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a monthly domestic demand and supply equilibrium model for Washington apples {{that can be}} used to assess the effectiveness of price and non-price promotional activities. The econometric methodology employed takes into account market differences across the U. S. and is based on data pertaining to individual retail stores located throughout the U. S. The period of analysis is from September 1990 through August 2000 on a regional basis. A unique feature of the model is its explicit allowance for multiplier effects to exist between the level of print media (newspaper ad and flyers) expenditures provided by the Washington State Apple Commission (WAC) in support of apple demand and <b>supplementary</b> <b>funds</b> provided by retailers in support of apple promotion. In particular the model allows for the fact that Commission funds oftentimes represent only a relatively small fraction of the overall print media expenditures made in support of apple sales, and that Commission funds are often effectively only “pump priming ” or serve as inducements for additional promotional activities by other entrepreneurs in the marketing chain. Also, the subset of promotional activities (print media and price reductions) provided by retailers is modeled in a dynamic fashion...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{presence}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been assessed in both wild and human-related environments. Social wasps {{have been shown to}} maintain and vector S. cerevisiae among different environments. The availability of strains isolated from wasp intestines represents a striking opportunity to assess whether the strains found in wasp intestines are characterized by peculiar traits. We analysed strains isolated from the intestines of social wasps and compared them with strains isolated from other sources, all collected in a restricted geographic area. We evaluated the production of volatile metabolites during grape must fermentation, the resistance to different stresses and the ability to exploit various carbon sources. Wasp strains, in addition to representing a wide range of S. cerevisiae genotypes, also represent large part of the phenotypes characterizing the sympatric set of yeast strains; their higher production of acetic acid and ethyl acetate could reflect improved ability to attract insects. Our findings suggest that the relationship between yeasts and wasps should be preserved, to safeguard not only the natural variance of this microorganism but also the interests of wine-makers, who could take advantage from the exploitation of their phenotypic variability.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{framed by a}} wider {{interest}} in how literary careers are made: what mechanisms other than the personal/biographical and the text-centred evaluations of scholars influence a writer’s choices in persisting in building a succession of works that are both varied and yet form a consistently recognizable “brand. ” Translation is one element in the wider network of “machinery” that makes modern literary publishing. It is a marker of success that might well keep authors going despite lack of sales or negative reviews at home. Translation rights can provide useful <b>supplementary</b> <b>funds</b> to sustain a writer’s output. Access to new markets overseas might also inspire interest in countries and topics other than their usual focus or the demands of their home market.
