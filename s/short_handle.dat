2500|$|The Astrologer's {{instruments}} (horologium and palm) are a {{plumb line}} and sighting instrument. They {{have been identified}} with two inscribed objects in the Berlin Museum; a <b>short</b> <b>handle</b> from which a plumb line was hung, and a palm branch with a sight-slit in the broader end. The latter was held close to the eye, the former in the other hand, perhaps at arms length. The [...] "Hermetic" [...] books which Clement refers to are the Egyptian theological texts, which probably {{have nothing to do}} with Hellenistic Hermetism.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys were}} {{astonished}} {{at the power}} and accuracy with which the driver whirled his whip; this had a <b>short</b> <b>handle</b> and a lash of twenty yards long, and with it {{he was able to}} hit any animal of the team with absolute certainty, and indeed to make the thong alight on any part of their bodies at which he aimed.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of Manvetti; the Manvetti with the <b>shorter</b> <b>handle</b> and the Manvetti with the longer <b>handle.</b> The <b>short</b> <b>handled</b> Manvetti exerts more {{pressure}} but tiresome to use continuously. The long handled Manvetti is less strenuous and useful for long and continued work. The <b>short</b> <b>handled</b> Manvetti is widely used in wet lands for trenching, bunding etc. Its important to mention that though the long handled Manvetti is used in states like Kerala in India, the shorter one is preferred or widely used.|$|R

60|$|Partially {{concealed}} in a cavern {{at the base}} of a stupendous, almost perpendicular, cliff, stood the wizard Ujarak and his pupil Ippegoo. The former silently watched the latter as he fitted a slender spear, or rather giant arrow, to a <b>short</b> <b>handle,</b> and prepared to discharge it at a flock of sea-birds which were flying about in front of them within what we would call easy gunshot.|$|E
60|$|As {{the clock}} struck seven, Frank, who ruled the club with a rod of iron when Chairman, {{took his place}} behind the study table. Seats stood about it, and a large, shabby book lay before Gus, who was Secretary, and kept the records with a lavish {{expenditure}} of ink, {{to judge by the}} blots. The members took their seats, and nearly all tilted back their chairs and put their hands in their pockets, {{to keep them out of}} mischief; for, as every one knows, it is impossible for two lads to be near each other and refrain from tickling or pinching. Frank gave three raps with an old croquet-mallet set on a <b>short</b> <b>handle,</b> and with much dignity opened the meeting.|$|E
60|$|Under {{sanction}} of the Pontiff, Hevaneva, {{in addition to}} his large commerce in idols, also carried on the highly lucrative business of canoe-building; the profits whereof, undivided, he dropped into his private exchequer. But Mohi averred, that the Pontiff often charged him with neglecting his images, for his canoes. Be that as it may, Hevaneva drove a thriving trade at both avocations. And in demonstration of the fact, he directed our attention to three long rows of canoes, upheld by wooden supports. They were in perfect order; at a moment's notice, ready for launching; being furnished with paddles, out-riggers, masts, sails, and a human skull, with a <b>short</b> <b>handle</b> thrust through one of its eyes, the ordinary bailer of Maramma; besides other appurtenances, including on the prow a duodecimo idol to match.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} spontoon-style axes. These {{used the same}} shaped blades mounted {{on the side of}} the weapon, and had a <b>shorter</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R

60|$|Early in the {{afternoon}} we overtook another procession of pilgrims; but in this one was no merriment, no jokes, no laughter, no playful ways, nor any happy giddiness, whether of youth or age. Yet both were here, both age and youth; gray old men and women, strong {{men and women of}} middle age, young husbands, young wives, little boys and girls, and three babies at the breast. Even the children were smileless; there was not a face among all these half a hundred people but was cast down, and bore that set expression of hopelessness which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with despair. They were slaves. Chains led from their fettered feet and their manacled hands to a sole-leather belt about their waists; and all except the children were also linked together in a file six feet apart, by a single chain which led from collar to collar all down the line. They were on foot, and had tramped three hundred miles in eighteen days, upon the cheapest odds and ends of food, and stingy rations of that. They had slept in these chains every night, bundled together like swine. They had upon their bodies some poor rags, but they could not be said to be clothed. Their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and made sores which were ulcerated and wormy. Their naked feet were torn, and none walked without a limp. Originally there had been a hundred of these unfortunates, but about half had been sold on the trip. The trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried a whip with a <b>short</b> <b>handle</b> and a long heavy lash divided into several knotted tails at the end. With this whip he cut the shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain, and straightened them up. He did not speak; the whip conveyed his desire without that. None of these poor creatures looked up as we rode along by; they showed no consciousness of our presence. And they made no sound but one; that was the dull and awful clank of their chains from end to end of the long file, as forty-three burdened feet rose and fell in unison. The file moved in a cloud of its own making.|$|E

5000|$|Drilling hammer - a <b>short</b> <b>handled</b> {{sledgehammer}} originally {{used for}} drilling in rock with a chisel. The name usually {{refers to a}} hammer with a 2 to 4 lb head and a 10 in handle, also called a [...] "single-jack" [...] hammer because it was used by one person drilling, holding the chisel {{in one hand and}} the hammer in the other. In modern usage, the term is mostly interchangeable with [...] "engineer's hammer", although it can indicate a version with a slightly <b>shorter</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R
