60|$|So long {{therefore}} as {{a species}} remains undivided, and in occupation of a continuous area, its fertility is kept up by natural selection; but the moment it becomes separated, either by geographical or <b>selective</b> <b>isolation,</b> or by diversity of station or of habits, then, while each portion must be kept fertile inter se, {{there is nothing to}} prevent infertility arising between the two separated portions. As the two portions will necessarily exist under somewhat different conditions of life, and will usually have acquired some diversity of form and colour--both which circumstances we know to be either the cause of infertility or to be correlated with it,--the fact of some degree of infertility usually appearing between closely allied but locally or physiologically segregated species is exactly what we should expect.|$|E

According to the regime parameters measurement for the most difficult case, the line with tap, the analytical dependences for determination of isolation conductivity concerning the earth is given. Errors of the network conductivity determination concerning the earth in case of lines with tap in it are analyzed. It is shown that at isolation conductivity determination of a network concerning the earth by the formulas offered the error won’t exceed 10 %. The increase of measurement accuracy can be provided with measurement of regime parameters at the beginning of the tap line...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) modulates the spontaneous activity of the sinoatrial node (SAN). Previously we have shown that several calcium regulatory proteins are expressed at a lower level in {{the centre of the}} SAN compared with the periphery. Such differences may produce heterogeneity of intracellular calcium handling and pacemaker activity across the SAN. <b>Selective</b> <b>isolations</b> showed that the centre of the SAN is composed of smaller cells than the periphery. Measurements of cytosolic calcium in spontaneously beating cells showed that diastolic calcium, systolic calcium, the calcium transient amplitude and spontaneous rate were greater in larger (likely to be peripheral) cells compared with smaller (likely to be central) SAN cells. The SR calcium content was greater in larger cells, although SR recruitment was more efficient in smaller cells. The sodium–calcium exchanger and sarcolemmal calcium ATPase had a lower activity and the exchanger was responsible for a larger proportion of sarcolemmal calcium extrusion in smaller cells compared with larger cells. Ryanodine had a greater effect on the spontaneous calcium transient in larger cells compared with smaller cells, and slowed pacemaker activity in larger cells but not smaller cells, thus abolishing the difference in cycle length. This study shows heterogeneity of intracellular calcium regulation within the SAN and this contributes to differences in pacemaker activity between cells from across the SAN. The smallest central cells of the leading pacemaker region of the SAN do not require SR calcium for spontaneous activity nor does disruption of the SR alter pacemaking in these primary pacemaker cells...|$|R

5000|$|Granada medium was {{developed}} for <b>selective</b> <b>isolation</b> and identification of GBS from clinical specimens [...] at the Service of Microbiology in the Hospital Virgen de las Nieves in Granada (Spain). Production of a red pigment (granadaene) on granada medium is unique to β-hemolytic group B streptococci isolated from humans. Granadaene is a non-isoprenoid polyenic pigment (ornithinrhamnododecaene) with a conjugated system of 12 double bonds. [...] β-hemolysis and pigment production are encoded in GBS by a gene cluster of 12 genes, the cyl cluster. Moreover, {{it has been suggested}} that GBS pigment and hemolysin are identical or closely related molecules and it has also been reported that they are important factors contributing to GBS virulence. Nevertheless, 1-5% of GBS strains are non-hemolytic and do not produce pigment., however these non-hemolytic and non-pigmented GBS strains (lacking pigment and hemolysin) are considered less virulent.|$|E
5000|$|Mannitol salt agar or MSA is a {{commonly}} used selective and differential growth medium in microbiology. It encourages {{the growth of}} a group of certain bacteria while inhibiting the growth of others. This medium is important in medical laboratories by distinguishing pathogenic microbes {{in a short period of}} time.It contains a high concentration (about 7.5%-10%) of salt (NaCl), making it selective for Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus and Micrococcaceae) since this level of salt is inhibitory to most other bacteria. It is also a differential medium for mannitol-fermenting staphylococci, containing carbohydrate mannitol and the indicator phenol red, a pH indicator for detecting acid produced by mannitol-fermenting staphylococci. [...] Staphylococcus aureus produces yellow colonies with yellow zones, whereas other coagulase-negative staphylococci produce small pink or red colonies with no colour change to the medium. If an organism can ferment mannitol, an acidic byproduct is formed that causes the phenol red in the agar to turn yellow. [...] It is used for the <b>selective</b> <b>isolation</b> of presumptive pathogenic (pp) Staphylococcus species.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnoses of}} geotrichosis cannot be {{determined}} without using culture or microscopic measurements. The laboratory diagnosis of geotrichosis involves collected fungi samples areas of infections without contamination.

Arthrospores appear rectangular with flat or rounded ends. Under the microscope the arthroconidia size range from 6-12μm x 3-6μm. Arthroconidia and coarse true hyphae can be observed can be observed under the microscope. Another identification method for G. candidum is <b>selective</b> <b>isolation</b> method.

40|$|Phosphorylation is {{the most}} widely studied posttranslational modification. Its role within the cell {{has been the focus}} of {{numerous}} large-scale studies. Recently there is growing evidence on the biological significance of extracellular phosphorylation. The analysis of these phosphopeptides is complicated by the abundance of glycosylation in the extracellular space, since glycopeptides are also enriched by the methods used for phosphopeptide isolation. Thus, we optimized IMAC for phosphorylation analysis of secreted proteins, specifically in human serum. Selectivity and efficiency of different enrichment conditions used in earlier large-scale phosphoproteomic studies were evaluated. We found that minimizing hydrophilic interactions in the enrichment allowed <b>selective</b> phosphopeptide <b>isolation.</b> Using a two-step IMAC enrichment protocol under these conditions led to the identification of similar to 100 phosphorylation sites from the tryptic digest of as little as 40 mu L human serum...|$|R

Herein we describe a rapid screening technique for proteins in biological matrices that combines <b>selective</b> protein <b>isolation</b> with direct surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection. Magnetic core gold nanoparticles were synthesised, characterised, and subsequently functionalized with {{recombinant human erythropoietin}} (rHuEPO) -specific antibody.

The selective binding between the protein and the functionalized nanoparticles was monitored by SERS. The purified protein was then released from the nanoparticles’ surface and directly spectroscopically identified on a commercial nanopillar SERS substrate. ELISA independently confirmed the SERS identification and quantified the released rHuEPO. Finally, the direct SERS detection of the extracted protein was successfully demonstrated for in-field screening by a handheld Raman spectrometer within 1 minute sample measurement time...|$|R
