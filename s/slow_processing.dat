For non-immediate family members, the process may take up to 10 years. Paperwork is processed on a first-come, first-served basis, so new applications may go untouched for several months. To address the issue of <b>slow</b> <b>processing</b> times, USCIS has made a policy allowing applicants to submit the I-130 and I-485 forms at the same time. This has reduced the processing time. Another delay in the process comes when applications have mistakes. In these cases papers are sent back to the applicant, further delaying the process. Currently the largest issue creating long wait times is not processing time, but rather immigrant visa quotas set by Congress.|$|E

The Trace Deletion account (Grodzinsky, 1995, 2000, 2006) attributes this deficit to an impairment in syntactic representations, whereas others (e. g., Caplan, Waters, Dede, Michaud, & Reddy, 2007; Haarmann, Just, & Carpenter, 1997) propose that the underlying structural representations are unimpaired, but sentence comprehension is affected by processing deficits, such as slow lexical activation, reduction in memory resources, <b>slowed</b> <b>processing</b> and/or intermittent deficiency, among others.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the relation of}} vascular risk factors, subclinical, and manifest vascular disease with four domains of cognitive functioning in a large sample of clinically depressed older persons. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was used, and depressed patients were recruited from general practices and mental healthcare institutes. Presence of a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, depressive episode was established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Framingham Risk Score (FRS) {{was used as a}} measure for vascular risk profile, ankle-brachial index for subclinical vascular disease, and history of a cardiovascular event as a measure for manifest vascular disease. Three neurocognitive tasks evaluated processing speed, working memory, verbal memory, and interference control. RESULTS: In 378 participants, linear regression analysis showed that FRS was related to poorer interference control (t = - 2. 353; df = 377; p < 0. 05) but to no other cognitive domain after adjustment for age, sex, education level, and depressive symptom severity. Lower ankle-brachial index and history of cardiovascular event were related to <b>slower</b> <b>processing</b> speed (t = 2. 659; df = 377; p < 0. 05 and t = - 3. 328; df = 377; p < 0. 01, respectively) but to no other cognitive domain. In 267 participants without manifest vascular disease, higher FRS was related to <b>slower</b> <b>processing</b> speed (t = - 2. 425; df = 266; p < 0. 05) and poorer interference control (t = - 2. 423; df = 266; p < 0. 05), and lower ankle brachial index was related to <b>slower</b> <b>processing</b> speed (t = 2. 171; df = 266; p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: In depressed older persons, vascular burden is related to <b>slower</b> <b>processing</b> speed also in the absence of manifest vascular disease.

40|$|This study {{examined}} comprehension of verb particle constructions in persons with aphasia (PWA) and young and older typical adults {{according to the}} semantic classes by Jackendoff (2002).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} evaluation of three hypotheses about sources of deficit in sentence comprehension in aphasia: <b>slowed</b> <b>processing,</b> intermittent deficiency, and resource reduction. The ACT-R based Lewis and Vasishth (2005) model {{is used to}} implement these three proposals. <b>Slowed</b> <b>processing</b> is implemented as slowed default production-rule firing time; intermittent deficiency as increased random noise in activation of chunks in memory; and resource reduction as reduced goal activation. As data, we considered subject vs. object rela- tives whose matrix clause contained either an NP or a reflexive, presented in a self-paced listening modality to 56 individuals with aphasia (IWA) and 46 matched controls. The participants heard the sentences and carried out a picture verification task to decide on {{an interpretation of the}} sentence. These response accuracies are used to identify the best parameters (for each participant) that correspond to the three hypotheses mentioned above. We show that controls have more tightly clustered (less variable) parameter values than IWA; specifically, compared to controls, among IWA there are more individuals with low goal activations, high noise, and slow default action times. This suggests that (i) individual patients show differential amounts of deficit along the three dimensions of <b>slowed</b> <b>processing,</b> intermittent deficient, and resource reduction, (ii) overall, there is evidence for all three sources of deficit playing a role, and (iii) IWA have a more variable range of parameter values than controls. In sum, this study contributes a proof of concept of a quantitative implementation of, and evidence for, these three accounts of comprehension deficits in aphasia.

40|$|People with {{schizophrenia}} exhibit wide ranging cognitive deficits, including <b>slower</b> <b>processing</b> speed (i. e., {{speed of}} executing task components). Speech symptoms, such as disorganized speech and alogia, {{have been associated}} with cognitive control deficits, but the exact nature of their relationship to specific cognitive deficits is unclear. In the current study, people with schizophrenia (n = 51) and non-psychiatric controls (n = 26) completed speech interviews allowing for assessment of speech symptoms. Participants also completed two tasks strongly involving working memory and two tasks strongly involving goal maintenance. In addition, measures of processing speed for highly automatic prepotent responses and a measure of general poor task performance were also obtained. For disorganized speech, it was significantly associated with poor performance in all cognitive domains (all r's > -. 29), with the largest association found with <b>slower</b> <b>processing</b> speed (r = -. 46). Further, disorganized speech was even associated with a non-cognitive control measure of poor general task performance (BY errors on the AX-CPT, r = -. 43). In contrast, alogia was not significantly related to any cognitive domain, with the largest association with goal maintenance tasks (r = -. 24).

40|$|Two dual-task {{experiments}} are reported {{bearing on the}} issue of <b>slower</b> <b>processing</b> time for severe chronic closed-head injury (CHI) patients compared to matched controls. In the first experiment, a classical psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm was employed, in which two sequential stimuli, a pure tone and a colored dot, were presented at variable stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), each associated with a distinct task. The task on the tone required a speeded vocal response based on pitch, and the task on the colored dot required a speeded manual response based on color. In the second experiment, either one or three masked letters was presented, followed by a pure tone at variable SOAs. The task on the letters required a delayed report of the letters {{at the end of each}} trial. The task on the tone required an immediate manual response based on pitch. In both experiments, both CHI patients and matched controls reported an SOA-locked slowing of the speeded response to the second stimulus, a PRP effect.

Cardiovascular pathologies included myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or myocar-dial ischemia, claudicatio intermittens, and arterial surgery. Global cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination), attention (Stroop Test), processing speed (Letter Digit Coding Test), immediate recall memory (Word Learning Test– Immediate Recall), delayed recall memory (Word Learning Test–Delayed Recall), and depressive symptoms (15 -item Geriatric Depression Scale) were assessed each year from ages 85 through 90.
