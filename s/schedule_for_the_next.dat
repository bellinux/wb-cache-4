25|$|Lacking {{the medium}} {{artillery}} and air strikes required to successfully assault the fortified position, B Company withdrew {{to a safe}} distance and kept the position under observation and fire. A follow-up attack <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day was also cancelled due to the unavailability of American artillery. During the night a large Viet Cong force was observed withdrawing, with one party of about 30 men passing close to a concealed Centurion; frustrated, the Australians observed the truce and held their fire. The next morning, 17 January, with the area now stripped bare of vegetation the devastation caused to the bunker system was obvious {{and it was clear}} that the position had been hit heavily by the Australian tanks and artillery. Although there were numerous signs of casualties, with a large number of blood trails and some damaged weapons the Australians found only three dead, with the Viet Cong once again having cleared the battlefield of the dead and wounded during the night. Later intelligence suggested that the position had been occupied by the headquarters of 274 VC Regiment and one of its battalions and the Australians considered it likely that the Viet Cong battalion had fought a delaying action in order to allow the headquarters to withdraw, before itself retiring under cover of darkness. A thorough search of the area by the Australians was not possible however, and B Company was ordered to return to their patrol area in order to prepare for redeployment. The fighting had been one of the more significant actions of Operation Goodwood and for his leadership during this action Reynolds was awarded the Military Cross. Corporal Wayne Brown—the B Company Medical Assistant—was awarded the Military Medal, while Sullivan and Brett were both Mentioned in Despatches.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, {{legislation}} {{was passed in}} Florida to index toll rates across the state to the national Consumer price index (CPI), to be enacted {{by the end of}} June 2012. As a result, the toll rates on roads on Florida's Turnpike Enterprise were raised on June 24, 2012, an increase of 11.7% to reflect the previous five years. [...] The legislation allows for SunPass rates to be raised slightly each year, with cash rates going up every five years, with SunPass rates staying about a quarter cheaper than cash rates. [...] In keeping with the legislation, SunPass and toll-by-plate rates were raised again on July 1, 2013 by 2.1%, with cash toll rates projected to stay the same through at least 2014. Toll rate increases were scheduled for every five years, and mid-2017 was the next scheduled date for such an increase. However, a combination of a low inflation rate and problems within the relevant state authorities caused multiple cancellations and changes in <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> increase. The final projected date for an increase in tolls was eventually set for October 29, 2017.|$|E
