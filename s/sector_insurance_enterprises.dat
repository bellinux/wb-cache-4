40|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>sector</b> in India was privatised to {{publicise}} insurance products. After privatisation of {{this industry}} in India {{in the year}} 2000, the next important step taken in the general insurance industry was the removal of tariffs on the non-life insurance products with effect from January 1, 2007. The introduction of the free price regime has provided an impetus to the non-life sector. Before the introduction of de-tariffication almost 70 % {{of the business of}} the non-life sector was driven by various tariffs prescribed by the Tariff Advisory Committee (TAC). The TAC was established under the Insurance Act, 1938, to control and regulate the rates, terms, conditions of general insurance business. TAC has been playing a significant role to specify the tariffs for the product offered by the various insurers in India. Withdrawal of the administered price mechanism from January 1, 2007 has led insurers to design new and innovative suitable products to sustain in the competitive market. The public <b>sector</b> <b>insurance</b> companies enjoyed the monopoly status as a result they lacked flexibility and were not much concerned with profitability. This resulted in erosion of underwriting skills and income of the public <b>sector</b> <b>insurance</b> companies So, the present study is an attempt to examine the growth and performance of the public <b>sector</b> <b>insurance</b> companies operating in India in the competitive scenari...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} compares {{systemic risk}} in the banking <b>sector,</b> the <b>insurance</b> <b>sector,</b> the construction sector, and the food sector. To measure systemic risk, we use extreme negative returns in stock market data for a time-varying panel of the 20 largest U. S. firms in each sector. We find that systemic risk is significantly larger in the banking sector relative to the other three sectors. This result is robust to separating out correlations with an economy-wide stock market index. For the non-banking sectors, the ordering from high to low systemic risk is: <b>insurance</b> <b>sector,</b> construction sector, and food sector. The difference between the <b>insurance</b> <b>sector</b> and the construction sector is no longer significant after correcting for correlations with {{the economy as a}} whole. The correction has a large effect for the banking <b>sector</b> and the <b>insurance</b> <b>sector,</b> and a smaller effect for the other two sectors. ...|$|R

This had been begun as the Mercer's Hall Marine Company, or Undertaking kept at the Royal Exchange for insuring ships and merchandise at sea. A similar enterprise sought incorporation in 1718, but the Attorney-General reported against this. Lord Onslow then sought a means of avoiding the difficulty by his company acquiring the charters of Society of Mines Royal and Company of Mineral and Battery Works, which declared itself open for assuring ships and merchandise in March 1719. Their opponents petitioned against this and the Attorney-General reported in May 1719 that the use made of the charters was [...] "unwarrantable". The directors admitted this mistake but requested their own charter in January 1720. They and another <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprise</b> each offered £300,000 towards the king's Civil List debts. The king then encouraged the House of Commons to permit their incorporation. This {{was done in the}} Bubble Act.
