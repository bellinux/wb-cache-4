25|$|GCHQ was {{originally}} established after the First World War as the Government Code and Cypher School (GC) and was known under that name until 1946. During the Second World War it was located at Bletchley Park, {{where it was}} famed for {{its role in the}} breaking of the German Enigma codes. Currently there are two main components of the GCHQ, the Composite Signals Organisation (CSO), which is responsible for gathering information, and the National Cyber <b>Security</b> <b>Centre</b> (NCSC), which is responsible for securing the UK's own communications. The Joint Technical Language Service (JTLS) is a small department and cross-government resource responsible for mainly technical language support and translation and interpreting services across government departments. It is co-located with GCHQ for administrative purposes.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth {{volume of}} the handbook: Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area (known as BMP4) is the current {{authoritative}} guide for merchant ships on self-defense against pirates. The guide is issued and updated by Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF), a consortium of interested international shipping and trading organizations including the EU, NATO and the International Maritime Bureau. It is distributed primarily by the Maritime <b>Security</b> <b>Centre</b> – Horn of Africa (MSCHOA), the planning and coordination authority for EU naval forces (EUNAVFOR). BMP4 encourages vessels to register their voyages through the region with MSCHOA as this registration is {{a key component of}} the operation of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC, the navy-patrolled route through the Gulf of Aden). BMP4 contains a chapter entitled [...] "Self-Protective Measures" [...] which lays out a list of steps a merchant vessel can take on its own to make itself less of a target to pirates and make it better able to repel an attack if one occurs. This list includes [...] rigging the deck of the ship with razor wire, rigging fire-hoses to spray sea-water {{over the side of the}} ship (to hinder boardings), having a distinctive pirate alarm, hardening the bridge against gunfire and creating a [...] "citadel" [...] where the crew can retreat in the event pirates get on board. Other unofficial self-defense measures that can be found on merchant vessels include the setting up of mannequins posing as armed guards or firing flares at the pirates.|$|E
