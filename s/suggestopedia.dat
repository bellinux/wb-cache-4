50|$|<b>Suggestopedia</b> {{produced}} {{four main}} offshoots. The first was still called <b>Suggestopedia</b> but {{was developed in}} eastern Europe and used different techniques from Lozanov's original version.

Superlearning and SALT originated in North America, while Psychopädie was developed in West Germany. While all four are slightly different from the original <b>Suggestopedia</b> and from each other, they still share the common traits of music, relaxation, and suggestion.

Lozanov never admitted that <b>Suggestopedia</b> can be compared to a placebo. He argues, however, that placebos are indeed effective. Another point of criticism is brought forward by Baur who claims that the students only receive input by listening, reading and musical-emotional backing, while other important factors of language acquisition are being neglected. Furthermore, several other features of the method, like the 'nonconscious' acquisition of language, or bringing the learner into a childlike state are questioned by critics.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{dominant}} {{theories and}} points of research include 2nd language acquisition studies (which examine if L1 findings {{can be transferred}} to L2 learning), verbal behaviour (the view that constructed linguistic stimuli can create a desired speech response), morpheme studies, behaviourism, error analysis, stages and order of acquisition, structuralism (approach that looks at how the basic units of language {{relate to each other}} according to their common characteristics), 1st language acquisition studies, contrastive analysis (approach where languages were examined in terms of differences and similarities) and inter-language (which describes L2 learners’ language as a rule-governed, dynamic system) (Mitchell, Myles, 2004). [...] These theories have all influenced second-language teaching and pedagogy. There are many different methods of second-language teaching, many of which stem directly from a particular theory. Common methods are the grammar-translation method, the direct method, the audio-lingual method (clearly influenced by audio-lingual research and the behaviourist approach), the Silent Way, <b>Suggestopedia,</b> community language learning, the Total Physical Response method, and the communicative approach (highly influenced by Krashen’s theories) (Doggett, 1994). Some of these approaches are more popular than others, and are viewed to be more effective. Most language teachers do not use one singular style, but will use a mix in their teaching. This provides a more balanced approach to teaching and helps students of a variety of learning styles succeed.|$|E

The experiment was held in Tampereen Normaalikoulu during the springtime between 21. 3. - 1. 4. 2016 for seven lessons. <b>Suggestopedia</b> is a teaching method, which was developed by a Bulgarian psychiatrist George Lozanov in 1970. <b>Suggestopedia</b> is a portmanteau of the words “suggestion” and “pedagogy". In <b>Suggestopedia</b> the physical surroundings and the atmosphere in a classroom are the vital factors {{to make sure that}} the students feel comfortable and confident, including art and music. In practice, during the implementation, the suggestopedic lesson was divided into three main parts: the warm up, the active concert and the passive concert. The experiment had the following structure: students were taught during the first three lessons with a normal teaching method and the next four lessons with <b>Suggestopedia.</b> In the end of both teaching methods, tests were given to the students. Furthermore, in the end of the experiment, the students were given a questionnaire, where they were asked their opinion about the method. According to the results from both tests, the student's performance of solving exercises is dropping with the use of <b>Suggestopedia,</b> while the results of the questionnaire are showing that more than half of the students liked the Suggestopedic method.

The theoretical foundations of the article are views and concepts of the Bulgarian researcher, teacher and psychologist, G. Lozanov; he had studied out the <b>suggestopedia</b> method for foreign language teaching, and the theory of meta-subject education on the basis of artistic-creative activity and appeal to masterpieces of art. Monitoring and surveillance over non-verbal behavior of children, surveys and discussions were used as practical methods.   Results. Musical experience of the child is considered as the process of the development of musical memory. Many <b>suggestopedia</b> techniques developed by Bulgarian and Russian researchers were selected and tested; those that involve the use of involuntary memorization of music when performing creative tasks: free movement or plastic intonation, paint color schemes, music and organizational tasks related to the preparation and conduct music lessons. Three series of diagnostic tasks associated with memory, remembering and recognition of classical pieces of music unknown for preschoolers were worked out to test the effectiveness of these methods and its integration into the process of preschoolers’ music education. The conducted experiment has shown that methods of <b>suggestopedia</b> provide memory activation – children keep in memory classical music.   Scientific novelty. The research demonstrates the application reasonability of <b>suggestopedia</b> methods used at foreign language teaching, music education of preschool children and juniors. It has been proved that involuntary memorizing of classical music by children listening to background sounding during the artcreative activities such as free movement and drawing has the greatest degree of efficiency.   Practical significance. Results and implementations of the research proposed in the present study are topical subjects to review of the musical content while giving classes to upcoming first grade pupils, and also integration of <b>suggestopedia</b> elements into an organizational component and directly to music educational process and its content (such as free movement, drawing of colourful diagrams and charts of musical compositions, applique work, performance of theatrical etudes, etc.).

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2007. <b>Suggestopedia</b> (also {{sometimes}} referred to as "Accelerated Learning") is a teaching methodology that claims to remove barriers to learning rather than teach students how to learn. Developed by Bulgarian psychotherapist and medical doctor Georgi Lozanov (1926 -), it utilizes a detailed, three-phase cycle of teaching in which about 75 % of teaching time is devoted to "Activations", games and activities in which students rehearse material previously presented in unique "Concert Sessions" (which make up the other 25 % of contact time). <b>Suggestopedia</b> highlights factors often forgotten in the classroom: the design of an "optimum" learning environment, high expectations of success from the teacher, the use of music and art, the importance of enjoying the learning process, and the fostering of an atmosphere of "relaxed alertness". The method has been used with some success, particularly in the teaching of foreign languages. Ostensibly based on the way we learn naturally, <b>Suggestopedia</b> has developed a number of incarnations, in some cases because Lozanov's work was not freely available in the West during the Cold War. This dissertation outlines the salient features of both <b>Suggestopedia</b> and some of its incarnations. Additionally, it suggests ways in which the method may be utilized in the high school English classroom in South Africa. In particular, it describes an intervention in which elements of <b>Suggestopedia</b> were used to teach creative writing in a multilingual environment. In short, this intervention involved the creation of a traditional two page creative "essay" inspired by, inter alia, the teacher's high expectations, the meditative atmosphere created by music, and the posters in the students' peripheral vision. A total of 158 Grade 9 and Grade 11 (mainly isiZulu speaking) students in an "ex-model C" school wrote, edited, and submitted such essays, the main criterion of success being whether each essay was deemed by the teacher to be of a sufficiently high standard to be reproduced here. The project, based on a qualitative research design using the process approach to writing and a Suggestopedicbased pedagogy, elicited many engaging pieces of writing from students. The spirit of their writing as well as the writers' own comments about the process will hopefully suggest the genius and versatility of the Lozanov methodology...|$|E
