5000|$|Many {{conventional}} coaxial cables use braided {{copper wire}} forming the shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, {{but it also means}} there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better shield performance, some cables have a double-layer shield. The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two shield layers, such as [...] "quad-shield", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other shield designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some shields are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the shield will kink, causing losses in the cable. When a foil shield is used a small wire conductor incorporated into the foil makes soldering the <b>shield</b> <b>termination</b> easier.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} {{of the effectiveness of}} various <b>shield</b> <b>termination</b> techniques. Each termination technique is evaluated by two independent noise injection methods; transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell operated from 3 MHz 400 MHz, and bulk current injection (BCI) operated from 50 kHz 400 MHz. Both single carrier and broadband injection tests were investigated. Recommendations as to how to achieve the best shield transfer impedance (i. e. reduced coupled noise) are made based on the empirical data. Finally, the noise injection techniques themselves are indirectly evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the TEM Cell to those from BCI...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} factors {{influencing}} installation of aircraft flight test instrumentation is presented. Requirements, including {{such factors as}} environment, reliability, maintainability, and system safety are discussed. The assessment of the mission profile is followed by an overview of electrical and mechanical installation factors with emphasis on shock/vibration isolation systems and standardization of the electric wiring installation, two factors often overlooked by instrumentation engineers. A discussion of installation hardware reviews the performance capabilities of wiring, connectors, fuses and circuit breakers, and a guide to proper selections is provided. The discussion of the installation is primarily concerned with the electrical wire routing, <b>shield</b> <b>terminations</b> and grounding. Also inclued are some examples of installation mistakes that could affect system accuracy. System verification procedures and special considerations such as sneak circuits, pyrotechnics, aircraft antenna patterns, and lightning strikes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{steps and}} {{procedures}} are described which {{are necessary to}} achieve a successful lightning-protection design for a state-of-the-art Full-Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system. The engine and control systems used as examples are fictional, but the design and verification methods are real. Topics discussed include: applicable airworthiness regulation, selection of equipment transient design and control levels for the engine/airframe and intra-engine segments of the system, the use of cable shields, terminal-protection devices and filter circuits in hardware protection design, and software approaches to minimize upset potential. <b>Shield</b> <b>terminations,</b> grounding, and bonding are also discussed, as are the important elements of certification and test plans, {{and the role of}} tests and analyses. Also included are examples of multiple-stroke and multiple-burst testing. A review of design pitfalls and challenges, and status of applicable test standards such as RTCA DO- 160, Section 22, are presented...|$|R
40|$|N-Heterocyclic carbene boranes (NHC-boranes) {{are a new}} "clean" {{class of}} {{reagents}} suitable for reductive radical chain transformations. Their structures are well suited for their reactivity to be tuned by inclusion of different NHC ring units and by appropriate placement of diverse substituents. EPR spectra were obtained for the boron-centered radicals generated on removal {{of one of the}} BH 3 · hydrogen atoms. This spectroscopic data, coupled with DFT computations, demonstrated that the NHC-BH 2 radicals are planar Π-delocalized species. tert-Butoxyl radicals abstracted hydrogen atoms from NHC-boranes more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than did C-centered radicals, although the rate decreased markedly for sterically shielded NHC-BH 3 centers. Combinations of two NHC-boryl radicals afforded 1, 2 -bisNHC-diboranes at rates which also depended strongly on steric <b>shielding.</b> The <b>termination</b> rate increased to the diffusion-controlled limit for sterically unhindered NHC-boryls. Bromine atoms were rapidly transferred to imidazole-based NHC-boryl radicals from alkyl, allyl, and benzyl bromides. Chlorine-atom abstraction was, however, much less efficient and only observed for sterically unhindered NHC-boryls reacting with allylic and benzylic chlorides. For an NHC-borane containing a bulky thexyl substituent at boron, the tertiary H atom of the thexyl group was selectively removed. The resulting ß-boron- containing alkyl radical rapidly underwent ß scission of the B-C bond with production of an NHC-boryl radical and an alkene. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|R
50|$|The {{supposed}} {{death of}} the Doctor, however, has not solved the situation. Unbeknownst to the High Council, his mind has been taken into the Time Lord living repository of knowledge, the Matrix, while his body is hidden behind a force <b>shield</b> in the <b>termination</b> cubicle. The Renegade, who demands an opportunity {{to return to the}} Universe it once inhabited, contacts him. The truth of the aborted execution is discovered by the wily Castellan, who tells first Nyssa and Damon that the Doctor is alive; and then the High Council.Meanwhile, in Amsterdam, the Doctor’s former companion Tegan Jovanka arrives looking for her cousin Colin Frazer. She is greeted by his friend Robin Stuart, who explains that Colin has disappeared while they were crashing in the crypt of the Frankendael mansion. When neither of them can persuade the police to take an interest, they decide to investigate the crypt themselves. They find a hypnotised Colin working for a birdlike creature, which is armed with a deadly weapon. They are rendered unconscious and their minds scanned, revealing to the Renegade, who has established its base in a TARDIS hidden at the Frankendael, that Tegan knows the Doctor. The Renegade uses Tegan as bait to force the Doctor to obey him, also releasing Colin from his slavery as a reward. The Doctor is returned to normal space on Gallifrey where he makes for the High Council Chamber. Lord President Borusa has fallen under suspicion of being a traitor because the Castellan reveals it was his codes that were used to transmit the bio-data. The truth, however, is that Councillor Hedin is the Time Lord in league with the Renegade. He is in awe of his master, the mighty Omega, first of the Time Lords and pioneer of time travel (see The Three Doctors). Hedin wishes to release Omega from his exile in a universe of antimatter, not realising the great Time Lord has been driven mad by his years of solitary confinement. The Castellan kills Hedin, but this does not prevent Omega using the Arc of Infinity to seize total control of the Matrix and, therefore, the organisation of Gallifrey.|$|R
