2500|$|The person {{leading the}} {{congregation}} in public prayers {{is called the}} shaliaḥ tzibbur (Hebrew for [...] " [...] of the congregation"). Jewish law restricts this role to adult Jews. In theory, any lay person can be a shaliaḥ tzibbur; most synagogue-attending Jews will serve in this role every now and again. Someone with good Hebrew pronunciation is preferred. In practice, those with the best voice and the most knowledge of the prayers serve most often. As public worship {{was developed in the}} Geonic period and as the knowledge of the Hebrew language declined, singing gradually superseded the didactic and hortatory element in the worship in the synagogue. Thus, while the idea of a cantor as a paid professional does not exist in classical rabbinic sources, the office of the hazzan increased in importance with the centuries, evolving a specialized <b>skill</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> becoming a career in itself.|$|E
