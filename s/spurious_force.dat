Understanding such phenomena requires modeling techniques that locally retain atomistic information while transitioning to the relevant macroscopic length scales. We recently introduced a fully-nonlocal energy based quasicontinuum (QC) method equipped with new summation rules. This technique accurately bridges across scales from atomistics to the continuum through a thermodynamically-consistent coarse-graining scheme. Beyond minimizing energy approximation errors and <b>spurious</b> <b>force</b> artifacts, the new method also qualifies to describe free surfaces, which is reported here. Surfaces present a major challenge to coarse-grained atomistics, which has oftentimes been circumvented by costly ad hoc extensions of the traditional QC method. We show that our new coarse-graining scheme successfully and automatically reduces <b>spurious</b> <b>force</b> artifacts near free surfaces. After discussing the computational model, we demonstrate its benefits in the presence of free surfaces by several nanomechanical examples including surface energy calculations, elastic size effects in nano-rods and in plates with nano-sized holes. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of surface effects as well as a new strategy to accurately capture those computationally via coarse-grained atomistics...|$|E

40|$|The quasicontinuum (QC) method coarse-grains {{crystalline}} atomic ensembles {{in order}} to bridge the scales from individual atoms to the micro- and mesoscales. A crucial cornerstone of all QC techniques, summation or quadrature rules efficiently approximate the thermodynamic quantities of interest. Here, we investigate summation rules for a fully nonlocal, energy-based QC method to approximate the total Hamiltonian of a crystalline atomic ensemble by a weighted sum over a small subset of all atoms in the crystal lattice. Our formulation does not conceptually differentiate between atomistic and coarse-grained regions and thus allows for seamless bridging without domain-coupling interfaces. We review traditional summation rules and discuss their strengths and weaknesses {{with a focus on}} energy approximation errors and <b>spurious</b> <b>force</b> artifacts. Moreover, we introduce summation rules which produce no residual or <b>spurious</b> <b>force</b> artifacts in centrosymmetric crystals in the large-element limit under arbitrary affine deformations in two dimensions (and marginal force artifacts in three dimensions), while allowing us to seamlessly bridge to full atomistics. Through a comprehensive suite of examples with spatially non-uniform QC discretizations in two and three dimensions, we compare the accuracy of the new scheme to various previous ones. Our results confirm that the new summation rules exhibit significantly smaller force artifacts and energy approximation errors. Our numerical benchmark examples include the calculation of elastic constants from completely random QC meshes and the inhomogeneous deformation of aggressively coarse-grained crystals containing nano-voids. In the elastic regime, we directly compare QC results to those of full atomistics to assess global and local errors in complex QC simulations. Going beyond elasticity, we illustrate the performance of the energy-based QC method with the new second-order summation rule by the help of nanoindentation examples with automatic mesh adaptation. Overall, our findings provide guidelines for the selection of summation rules for the fully nonlocal energy-based QC method...|$|E
30|$|Generally, IBMs can be {{classified}} into two categories, i.e., the continuous force approach and discrete force approach [1]. The continuous force approach is not suitable for computing the high Reynolds number flows. Therefore, many researchers focus on the discrete force approach. Fadlun et al. [2] implemented the discrete-time forcing approach on a standard marker- and -cell (MAC) staggered grid. Tseng et al. [3] extended the idea of Verzicco et al. [4] and proposed the ghost-cell IBM (GCIBM) for simulating turbulent flows in complex geometries. Mittal et al. [5] used a sharp interface IBM to simulate incompressible viscous flows past three-dimensional immersed bodies. Using the ghost point treatment as a starting point, Gao et al. [6] improved the method of Tseng et al. [3]. The method effectively eliminates numerical instabilities caused by matrix inversion and flexibly. To improve the accuracy at the boundaries, Shinn et al. [7] implemented the immersed boundary method using the ghost cell approach, whereby the incompressible flows are solved on a staggered grid. To control the <b>spurious</b> <b>force</b> oscillations, Lee et al. [8] proposed a fully-implicit ghost-cell IBM for simulating flows over complex moving bodies on a Cartesian grid. The method is well capable of controlling the generation of <b>spurious</b> <b>force</b> oscillations {{on the surface of}} a moving body, thereby producing an accurate and stable solution. To simulate high-Reynolds number compressible viscous flows on adaptive Cartesian grids, Hu et al. [9] present a new ghost-cell turbulent wall boundary condition. In the frame of adaptive Cartesian grids, a cell-centered, second-order accurate finite volume solver has been developed for predicting turbulent flow fields. The robustness and accuracy of the methodology have been validated against well-documented turbulent flow test problems. Now, the IBM method is applied to many fluid dynamic problems such as heat transfer problems [10 – 12], fluid-solid interaction problems [13], complex/moving boundary problems [14], incompressible flows [15], and natural convection problems [16].|$|E
40|$|The quasicontinuum (QC) {{method was}} {{introduced}} to coarse-grain crystalline atomic ensembles in order to bridge the scales from individual atoms to the micro- and mesoscales. Though many QC formulations have been proposed with varying characteristics and capabilities, a crucial cornerstone of all QC techniques {{is the concept of}} summation rules, which attempt to efficiently approximate the total Hamiltonian of a crystalline atomic ensemble by a weighted sum over a small subset of atoms. In this work we propose a novel, fully-nonlocal, energy-based formulation of the QC method with support for legacy and new summation rules through a general energy-sampling scheme. Our formulation does not conceptually differentiate between atomistic and coarse-grained regions and thus allows for seamless bridging without domain-coupling interfaces. Within this structure, we introduce a new class of summation rules which leverage the affine kinematics of this QC formulation to most accurately integrate thermodynamic quantities of interest. By comparing this new class of summation rules to commonly-employed rules through analysis of energy and <b>spurious</b> <b>force</b> errors, we find that the new rules produce no residual or <b>spurious</b> <b>force</b> artifacts in the large-element limit under arbitrary affine deformation, while allowing us to seamlessly bridge to full atomistics. We verify that the new summation rules exhibit significantly smaller force artifacts and energy approximation errors than all comparable previous summation rules through a comprehensive suite of examples with spatially non-uniform QC discretizations in two and three dimensions. Due to the unique structure of these summation rules, we also use the new formulation to study scenarios with large regions of free surface, a class of problems previously out of reach of the QC method. Lastly, we present the key components of a high-performance, distributed-memory realization of the new method, including a novel algorithm for supporting unparalleled levels of deformation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{practitioners}} with further insight into <b>spurious</b> damping <b>forces</b> that can be generated in nonlinear seismic response history analyses (RHA). The term 'spurious' is used to refer to damping forces that are not present in an elastic system and appear as nonlinearities develop: such damping forces are not necessarily intended and appear as a result of modifications in the structural properties as it yields or damages due to the seismic action. In this paper, two types of <b>spurious</b> damping <b>forces</b> are characterized. Each type has often been treated separately in the literature, but each has been qualified as 'spurious', somehow blurring their differences.

40|$|We {{present a}} moving control volume (CV) {{approach}} to computing hydrodynamic forces and torques on complex geometries. The method requires surface and volumetric integrals over {{a simple and}} regular Cartesian box that moves with an arbitrary velocity to enclose the body at all times. The moving box is aligned with Cartesian grid faces, which makes the integral evaluation straightforward in an immersed boundary (IB) framework. Discontinuous and noisy derivatives of velocity and pressure at the fluid-structure interface are avoided and far-field (smooth) velocity and pressure information is used. We re-visit the approach to compute hydrodynamic forces and torques through force/torque balance equation in a Lagrangian frame {{that some of us}} took in a prior work (Bhalla et al., J Comp Phys, 2013). We prove the equivalence of the two approaches for IB methods, thanks to the use of Peskin's delta functions. Both approaches are able to suppress <b>spurious</b> <b>force</b> oscillations and are in excellent agreement, as expected theoretically. Test cases ranging from Stokes to high Reynolds number regimes are considered. We discuss regridding issues for the moving CV method in an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) context. The proposed moving CV method is not limited to a specific IB method and can also be used, for example, with embedded boundary methods...|$|E
40|$|Unsteady fluid {{dynamics}} at low to moderate Reynolds number, i. e. O (10 2) ∼ O (10 4), has drawn increasing attention {{during the past}} decades {{as a result of}} the growing interest in the biological and bio-inspired locomotion like the flying and swimming of different creatures. In this work, several numerical methods, including low-order modeling and high-fidelity simulations, are developed and explored, which target to explore and understand the moving capabilities observed in nature as well as provide general guidances for the future development of similar agile air/underwater vehicles. In the first part of the work, a low-order point vortex model for the two-dimenional unsteady aerodynamics of a flat plate wing section is developed. The flow field is described by several point vortices, which can be divided into two categories. A variable-strength vortex is referred to the one just released from either leading or trailing edges of the sharp edge and the strength of each is determined by enforcing the Kutta condition at the edges. The vortex is moved into the second category when its strength reaches its extremum and is frozen. The motion of the fixed-strength vortices is easy to find according to the potential flow theory, while the motion of the vortices with variable-strength requires special evolution equations. Two ways are considered in our work. In the first approach, the Brown-Michael equation is used in order to ensure that no <b>spurious</b> <b>force</b> is generated by the branch cut associated with each vortex. In the second approach, a new evolution equation for a vortex by equating the rate of change of its impulse with that of an equivalent surrogate vortex with identical properties but constant strength. The results of the new model, when applied to a pitching or perching plate, agree better with experiments and high-fidelity simulations than the Brown-Michael model, using fewer than ten degrees of freedom. The model performance is also assessed on the impulsive start of a flat plate at various angles of attack. In the second part of the work, a strong coupling algorithm is presented for simulating the dynamic interactions between incompressible viscous flows and rigid-body systems in both two- and three-dimensional problems. The incompressible flow is solved by the vorticity-based immersed boundary projection method, and dynamical equations for arbitrary rigid-body systems are also developed. The resulting partitioned system of equations is solved with a simple, physically-motivated relaxation scheme, based on an identification of virtual inertia from the fluid. Several two- and three-dimensional numerical examples are conducted to validate and demonstrate the method, including a falling cylinder, flapping of flexible wings, self-excited oscillations of a system of linked plates in a free stream, passive pivoting of a finite aspect ratio plate in a free stream and gravity and self-propelled motion of a flexible flapping tail. The results from the current method are compared with previous experimental and numerical results and good agreements are achieved...|$|E
40|$|This Study is {{concerned}} with the accurate computation of the unknown forces applied on the boundary of an elastic body using its measured displacement data with noise. Vision-based minimally intrusive force-sensing using elastically deformable grasping tools is the motivation for undertaking this problem. Since this problem involves incomplete and inconsistent displacement/force of ail elastic body, it leads to an ill-posed problem known as Cauchy's problem in elasticity. Vision-based displacement measurement necessitates large displacements of the elastic body for reasonable accuracy. Therefore, We use geometrically non-linear modelling of the elastic body, which was not considered by others who attempted to solve Cauchy's elasticity problem before. We present two methods to solve the problem. The first method uses the pseudo-inverse of an over-constrained system of equations. This method is shown to be not effective when the noise in the measured displacement data is high. We attribute this to the appearance of <b>spurious</b> <b>forces</b> at regions where there should not be any forces. The second method focuses on minimizing the <b>spurious</b> <b>forces</b> by varying the measured displacements within the known accuracy of the measurement technique. Both continuum and frame elements are used in the finite element modelling of the elastic bodies considered in the numerical examples. The performance of the two methods is compared using seven numerical examples, all of which show that the second method estimates the forces with an error that is not more than the noise in the measured displacements. An experiment was also conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the second method in accurately estimating the applied forces...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} consistent energy-based coupling of atomistic and continuum models of materials, limited to zero-temperature statics of simple crystals.

40|$|The local balance {{equation}} for {{the total}} energy in numerical ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) gen-erally possesses nonconservative production/destruction terms that result from physical inconsistencies between the dynamical and thermodynamical equations used by such models. Because such production/destruction terms {{are most likely to}} be unphysical, they are potentially responsible for <b>spurious</b> <b>forces</b> in the momentum equations and for spurious diabatic terms in the thermodynamic equations, and hence likely associated with potential errors in the simulated ocean currents and water masses. Assessing the importance of such terms requires a strategy to identify and quantify them. It is the main purpose of this paper to develop a theoretical framework forming the basis for a practical determination of such terms. At least four main sources of errors are identified. They arise from, by decreasing order of importance: 1) the kinetic energy dissipation term that in reality would be converted into heat, but which is “hanging ” in OGCMs; 2) assuming potential or conservative temperature to be a conservative quantity; 3) the interaction of the Boussinesq approximation with the parameterisations of turbulent mixing of temperature and salinity; 4) some adiabatic compressibility effects due to the Boussinesq approximation.

40|$|Material failure by crack {{propagation}} essentially involves {{a concentration of}} large displacement-gradients near a crack’s tip, even at scales where no irreversible deformation and energy dissipation occurs. This physical situation provides the motivation for a systematic gradient expansion of general nonlinear elastic constitutive laws {{that goes beyond the}} first order displacement-gradient expansion that is the basis for linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). A weakly nonlinear fracture mechanics theory was recently developed by considering displacement-gradients up to second order. The theory predicts that, at scales within a dynamic lengthscale ℓ from a crack’s tip, significant log r displacements and 1 /r displacement-gradient contributions arise. Whereas in LEFM the 1 /r singularity generates an unbalanced force and must be discarded, we show that this singularity not only exists but is necessary in the weakly nonlinear theory. The theory generates no <b>spurious</b> <b>forces</b> and is consistent with the notion of the autonomy of the near-tip nonlinear region. The J-integral in the weakly nonlinear theory is also shown to be path-independent, taking the same value as the linear elastic J-integral. Thus, the weakly nonlinear theory retains the key tenets of fracture mechanics, while providing excellent quantitative agreement with measurements near the tip of single propagating cracks. As ℓ is consistent with lengthscales that appear in crack tip instabilities, we suggest that this theory may serve as a promising starting point for resolving open questions in fracture dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Whenever linear {{eigenmodes}} of open flows are computed on {{a numerical}} domain that is truncated in the streamwise direction, artificial boundary conditions may {{give rise to}} spurious pressure signals {{that are capable of}} providing unwanted perturbation feedback to upstream locations. The manifestation of such feedback in the eigenmode spectrum is analysed here for two simple configurations. First, explicitly prescribed feedback in a Ginzburg-Landau model is shown to produce a spurious eigenmode branch, named the 'arc branch', that strongly resembles a characteristic family of eigenmodes typically present in open shear flow calculations. Second, corresponding mode branches in the global spectrum of an incompressible parallel jet in a truncated domain are examined. It is demonstrated that these eigenmodes of the numerical model depend on the presence of <b>spurious</b> <b>forcing</b> of a local k+ instability wave at the inflow, caused by pressure signals that appear to be generated at the outflow. Multiple local k+ branches result in multiple global eigenmode branches. For the particular boundary treatment chosen here, the strength of the pressure feedback from the outflow towards the inflow boundary is found to decay with the cube of the numerical domain length. It is concluded that arc-branch eigenmodes are artifacts of domain truncation, with limited value for physical analysis. It is demonstrated, for the example of a non-parallel jet, how spurious feedback may be reduced by an absorbing layer near the outflow boundary.

Changing the perspective from displacement to acceleration can benefit the data analysis of LISA Pathfinder and future detectors. The response in differential acceleration to gravitational waves is derived for a space-based detector's interferometric link. The acceleration formalism can also be integrated into time delay interferometry by building up the unequal-arm Michelson differential acceleration combination. The differential acceleration is nominally insensitive to the system free evolution dominating the slow displacement dynamics of low-frequency detectors. Working with acceleration also provides an effective way to subtract measured signals acting as systematics, including the actuation forces. Because of the strong similarity with the equations of motion, the optimal subtraction of systematic signals, known within some amplitude and time shift, with the focus on measuring the noise provides an effective way to solve the problem and marginalise over nuisance parameters. The F-statistic, in widespread use throughout the gravitation waves community, is included in the method and suitably generalised to marginalise over linear parameters and noise at the same time.

40|$|Experiments {{that measure}} {{extremely}} small gravitational forces are often {{hampered by the}} presence of non-gravitational forces that can neither be calculated nor separately measured. Among these <b>spurious</b> <b>forces</b> is electrostatic attraction between a test mass and its surroundings due to the presence of spatially varying surface potential known as the "patch effect. " In order to make surfaces with small surface potential variation, it is necessary to be able to measure it. A Kelvin probe (KP) measures contact potential difference (CPD), using the time-varying capacitance between the sample and a vibrating tip that is biased with a backing potential. Assuming that the tip remains constant, this measures the sample's surface potential variation. We examine the operation of the KP from the perspective of parameter estimation in the presence of noise. We show that, when the CPD is estimated from measurements at two separate backing potentials, the standard deviation of the optimal estimate depends on the total observing time. Further, the observing time may be unevenly divided between the two backing potentials, provided the values of those potentials are correspondingly set. We simulate a two-stage KP data analysis, including a sub-optimal estimator with advantages for real-time operation. Based on the real-time version, we present a novel approach to stabilizing the average distance of the tip from the sample. We also present the results of a series of covariance analyses that validate and bound the applicability of the suboptimal estimator, make a comparison with the results of an optimal estimator and guide the user. We discuss the application of the KP to the LISA and to a test of the weak equivalence principle. Comment: 26 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{simulation}} of diurnal variability {{is an important}} aspect of many geophysical data assimilation systems. For the Martian atmosphere, thermal tides are particularly prominent and contribute much to the Martian atmospheric circulation, dynamics and dust transport. To study the Mars diurnal variability and Mars thermal tides, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Mars Global Climate Model with the 4 D-local ensemble transform Kalman filter (4 D-LETKF) is used to perform an analysis assimilating spacecraft temperature retrievals. We find that the use of a ‘traditional’ 6 -hr assimilation cycle induces <b>spurious</b> <b>forcing</b> of a resonantly enhanced semi-diurnal Kelvin waves represented in both surface pressure and mid-level temperature by forming a wave 4 pattern in the diurnal averaged analysis increment that acts as a ‘topographic’ stationary forcing. Different assimilation window lengths in the 4 D-LETKF are introduced to remove the artificially induced resonance. It is found that short assimilation window lengths not only remove the spurious resonance, but also push the migrating semi-diurnal temperature variation at 50 Pa closer to the estimated ‘true’ tides {{even in the absence of}} a radiatively active water ice cloud parameterisation. In order to compare the performance of different assimilation window lengths, short-term to mid-range forecasts based on the hour 00 and 12 assimilation are evaluated and compared. Results show that during Northern Hemisphere summer, it is not the assimilation window length, but the radiatively active water ice clouds that influence the model prediction. A ‘diurnal bias correction’ that includes bias correction fields dependent on the local time is shown to effectively reduce the forecast root mean square differences between forecasts and observations, compensate for the absence of water ice cloud parameterisation and enhance Martian atmosphere prediction. The implications of these results for data assimilation in the Earth's atmosphere are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{have carried}} out a {{comparison}} study of hydrodynamical codes by investigating their performance in modelling interacting multiphase fluids. The two commonly used techniques of grid and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) show striking differences {{in their ability to}} model processes that are fundamentally important across many areas of astrophysics. Whilst Eulerian grid based methods are able to resolve and treat important dynamical instabilities, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz or Rayleigh-Taylor, these processes are poorly or not at all resolved by existing SPH techniques. We show that {{the reason for this is}} that SPH, at least in its standard implementation, introduces <b>spurious</b> pressure <b>forces</b> on particles in regions where there are steep density gradients. This results in a boundary gap of the size of an SPH smoothing kernel radius over which interactions are severely dampe...|$|R
40|$|The ITER in-vessel {{equilibrium}} magnetic sensors will {{be installed}} in a hostile environment having severe neutron irradiation and cyclic heat loads which could cause undesired effects that can compromise {{the accuracy of the}} measurements. The paper describes the design, construction and test of a new set of in-vessel pick-up coil prototypes for ITER developed with the aim at reducing the <b>spurious</b> electromotive <b>forces</b> due to transverse magnetic area and to internal thermal gradients while guaranteeing the required radiation hardness. The sensors have been subjected to various tests including: mechanical, electrical, magnetic and thermal characterization, micrographic analysis and vacuum out-gassing in ITER relevant conditions. In addition, specific tests have been designed for the measurement of the thermally induced electromotive force. The paper will present the development of the sensors and the results obtained...|$|R

IS- 136 dual mode phone frequency plan is outlined, using a first IF of 119. 64 MHz, and an AMPS IF of 455 kHz. Tradeoffs are needed between PLL phase detector frequency, loop bandwidth and <b>spurious</b> outputs. Brute <b>force</b> solution must switch loop filter components to control stability. A 50 Hz error in AMPS mode allows PLL to use same filter components...|$|R
