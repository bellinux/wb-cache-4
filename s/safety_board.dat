5|$|Major {{accidents}} are investigated {{by an independent}} agency, the National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident. In the National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 2 million {{pieces of}} debris were recovered and brought ashore for inspection at a secure handling facility in a marine industrial park at Sheet Harbour, where small material was hand inspected by teams of RCMP officers looking for human remains, personal effects, and valuables from the aircraft's cargo hold. The material was then transported to CFB Shearwater, {{where it was}} assembled and inspected by over 350investigators from multiple organizations, such as the Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> of Canada, U.S. National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board,</b> U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and Swissair.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, the US National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety {{recommendations}} related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders.|$|E
5|$|National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) and Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) {{investigations}} {{determined that}} evasive maneuvers undertaken by Flight 663 {{to avoid an}} oncoming Pan Am Boeing 707 caused the pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft. The accident is the third-worst accident involving a DC-7.|$|E

5|$|The National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) {{concluded}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} captain's improper execution of an instrument approach, combined with a severe downdraft at a low altitude, which resulted in the aircraft descending uncontrollably into terrain.|$|E
5|$|The National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew's operation of the airplane below the minimum descent altitude without an appropriate visual reference for the runway.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB). The Flight Data Recorder was recovered intact from the wreckage, but the Cockpit Voice Recorder had been damaged in the post-crash fire and was unusable.|$|E

It appears that insufficient oversight of {{work done by}} contractors {{also played a role}} in the accident.|$|R
5|$|The {{same week}} as the {{memorial}} dedication, the National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> held hearings related to another fatal incident in the Metro system, one which happened earlier in 2015; the juxtaposition of the two events was noted by some commentators.|$|E
5|$|According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Cirrus SR20 aircraft, tail number N929CD, {{was owned}} by Lidle. On May 1, 2007, the National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) stated that the {{probable}} cause of the crash was pilot error. The NTSB was unable to determine which person was flying the aircraft {{at the time of}} the crash.|$|E
5|$|June 20, 1998: A Greyhound bus on a {{scheduled}} trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, {{and hit a}} truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. The National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating antihistamine and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring Boards {{within the}} NIAID. 2. 0 BACKGROUND 2. 1 NIH policy {{requires}} data and safety monitoring for all NIH-funded clinical trials. Since the policy issuance, Divisions within the Institute have each established policies, procedures, and guidelines to implement and {{comply with the}} general NIH policy. Although some program variances may be appropriate/necessary, a proposal for some harmonization of key issues across Divisions was put forth at the 2005 NIAID Winter Program Retreat. A Working Group representing all Divisions collected and analyzed data on Data and <b>Safety</b> Monitoring <b>Board</b> practices. This policy specifies those operational requirements for DSMBs that are mandatory across the Institute. 3. 0 DEFINITIONS 3. 1 Data and <b>Safety</b> Monitoring <b>Board</b> (DSMB) “Data and <b>safety</b> monitoring <b>board</b> " refers to a committee of experts, independent of the trial investigators, pharmaceutical sponsor (if any), and funding agency, that periodically reviews the conduct and results of the trial and recommends continuation without change, continuation with change, or termination of the trial. (To avoid confusion, the name “data and <b>safety</b> monitoring <b>board</b> ” should only be used for structures as described herein.) 3. 2 DSMB Convening Authority "DSMB convening authority ” is the single entity with authority and responsibility to act upon {{the recommendations of the}} Data and <b>Safety</b> Monitoring <b>Board...</b>|$|R

5|$|Malaysian {{investigators}} set up {{an international}} working group—the Joint Investigation Team (JIT)—consisting of various agencies with experience in aircraft performance and satellite communications, to further analyse the signals between Flight 370 and the ground station, especially the signal at 08:19. These included representatives from the UK's Inmarsat, Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and Rolls-Royce; China's Civil Aviation Administration and Aircraft Accident Investigation Department; the US National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> and Federal Aviation Administration; and Malaysian authorities.|$|E
5|$|The National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} published a detailed final report eleven months later on March 11, 1997. From the official point of view, the pilot in command was flight instructor Reid, who {{was the only one}} on board rated to fly the aircraft. The investigation focused on his decision-making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Brazilian Air Force Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) and the U.S. National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB). The NTSB, {{in accordance with the}} provisions of ICAO Annex 13, participated in the investigation representing the state of manufacture of the Boeing, state of registry and operator of the Embraer, and state of manufacture of the Honeywell avionics equipment installed in both planes.|$|E
25|$|Despite Feynman's warnings, {{and despite}} the fact that Vaughan served on <b>safety</b> <b>boards</b> and {{committees}} at NASA, the subsequent press coverage has found some evidence that NASA's relative disregard for safety might persist to this day. For example, NASA discounted the risk from small foam chunk breakage at launch and assumed that the lack of damage from prior foam collisions suggested the future risk was low.|$|R

5|$|The {{recovery}} operation {{was guided by}} the Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> of Canada (TSB) with resources from the Canadian Forces, Canadian Coast Guard, RCMP, and other agencies. The area was surveyed using route survey sonar, laser line scanners, and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to locate items. After being located, the debris was then recovered (initially by divers and ROVs, later by dredging and trawling).|$|E
5|$|The {{search and}} rescue response, crash {{recovery}} operation, and investigation by the Government of Canada took over four years and cost CAD 57 million (at that time approximately US$38 million). The Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> of Canada's (TSB) report of their investigation stated that flammable material used in the aircraft's structure allowed a fire to spread {{beyond the control of}} the crew, resulting in a loss of control and the crash of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
25|$|Denver {{was killed}} on October 12, 1997 when his {{experimental}} Long-EZ plane, aircraft registration number N555JD, crashed into Monterey Bay near Pacific Grove, California, while making a series of touch-and-go landings at the nearby Monterey Peninsula Airport. The National Transportation <b>Safety</b> <b>Board's</b> (NTSB) accident ID is LAX98FA008. Denver was the only occupant of the aircraft. Identification was not possible using dental records; only his fingerprints confirmed that the pilot was Denver.|$|R
