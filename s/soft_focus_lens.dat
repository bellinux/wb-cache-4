5000|$|Nicola Perscheid (3 December 1864 - 12 May 1930) was a German photographer. He is {{primarily}} {{known for his}} artistic portrait photography. He developed the [...] "Perscheid lens", a <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> for large format portrait photography.|$|E
5000|$|Rolleisoft: A <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> for {{the taking}} lens only {{available}} in two grades, [...] "0" [...] and [...] "1", which softens the definition and produce striking halo effects, particularly when used with back lighting. The Rolleisoft lens has concentric circles ground in groves and is used principally for portraiture.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> {{introduce}} {{spherical aberration}} deliberately into the optical formula for an [...] effect considered pleasing, and flattering to subjects {{with less than}} perfect complexions. The degree of soft-focus effect is determined by either aperture size or special disks that fit into the lens to modify the aperture shape. Some antique lenses, and some modern SLR <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lenses,</b> provide a lever that controls the softening effect by altering the optical formula.|$|R
50|$|Some lenses utilize {{specially}} shaped diaphragms {{in order}} to create certain effects. This includes the diffusion discs or sieve aperture of the Rodenstock Tiefenbildner-Imagon, Fuji and Sima <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lenses,</b> the sector aperture of Seibold's Dreamagon, or the circular apodization filter in the Minolta/Sony Smooth Trans Focus or Fujifilm APD lenses.|$|R
50|$|The 85mm 2.8 <b>Soft</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>lens</b> is {{designed}} for portraiture. The photographer may introduce three levels of spherical aberration via a push-pull ring. Since aperture also affects {{the magnitude of the}} soft-focus effect, a wide range of results are possible. The lens may also be used as a standard short telephoto. It offers all FD features.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} a <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> is {{sometimes}} approximated {{by the use of}} diffusion filter or other method, such as stretching a nylon stocking over the front of the lens, or smearing petroleum jelly on a clear filter or on the front element or even the back element of the lens itself. The latter is less recommended because successive cleaning always introduces a risk to damage the lens's surface.|$|E
50|$|In photography, {{soft focus}} is a lens flaw, {{in which the}} lens forms images that are blurred due to spherical aberration. A <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> {{deliberately}} introduces spherical aberration {{in order to give}} the appearance of blurring the image while retaining sharp edges; it {{is not the same as}} an out-of-focus image, and the effect cannot be achieved simply by defocusing a sharp lens. Soft focus is also the name of the style of photograph produced by such a lens.|$|E

5000|$|Hinton's {{landscape}} photographs {{tend to be}} characterised by prominent foregrounds {{and dramatic}} cloud formations, often in a vertical format. [...] He typically used sepia platinotype and gum bichromate printing processes. Unlike many pictorialists, Hinton preferred sharp <b>focus</b> to <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lenses.</b> He occasionally cropped and mixed cloud scenes and foregrounds from different photographs, and was known to rearrange the foregrounds of his subjects {{to make them more}} pleasing. His favourite topic was the English countryside, especially the Essex mud flats and Yorkshire moors.|$|R
50|$|Around 1890, Stobbaerts' style {{underwent}} a considerable change likely {{under the influence}} of his discovery of Impressionism and his personal search for resolving the problem of light. Stobbaerts abandoned the detailed realism in favour of a very personal sfumato of light. His style became velvety, his brushwork looser and the paint more fluid. His paintings of the 1890s depicting scenes around the river Woluwe were made with an opaque, somewhat transparent paste. The artist concentrated on the effect of light and the forms, while they remained recognizable, became less clear as if seen through a <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens.</b> The subject matter itself became less important.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{soft focus}} results from what are {{considered}} technical flaws, typically spherical and chromatic aberration, many older lenses had soft focus built in {{as a side}} effect of their construction. Some lens makers, such as Pinkham-Smith and Busch Nicola Perscheid (see Nicola Perscheid), intentionally designed lenses to take advantage of these flaws and, as color became available, chromatic aberration was less desirable, but well-managed spherical aberration was desirable. Newer lenses are optimized to minimize optical aberrations, but there are lenses such as the Canon EF 135mm lens f/2.8 with Softfocus, [...] Pentax SMC 28mm f2.8 FA Soft Lens, Mamiya 180mm f/4.0 <b>Soft</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Lens</b> for RZ67 Cameras, and the Lensbaby Velvet 56mm lens, which have adjustable levels of spherical aberration at wide apertures. The effect can be disabled entirely as well, in which case the lens is sharp.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1935, the Daily Record, {{which was}} the Official Organ of the Scottish Photographic Federation, {{utilised}} the talent of Andrew Paterson. Writing that his [...] "name is known wherever the camera {{is regarded as a}} serious medium of expression in portraiture," [...] Paterson was brought to the photographic studios of the Daily Record in order to collaborate with their own regular staff and [...] "provide that inspirational note that keeps the newspaper picture pages continually fresh and interesting." [...] It also offered [...] "to make arrangements with prominent citizens who would like to take advantage of Mr Andrew Paterson's presence in Glasgow, to secure a portrait by his always individual hand."One particular technique Paterson used to great effect was virtually new at the time - the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens,</b> coupled with subtle lighting effects. The soft focus effect is used in glamour photography because the effect eliminates blemishes and, in general, produces a dream-like image. Many think of these lenses as merely a way to 'erase wrinkles,' and although very flattering for portraiture, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, soft focus lenses were popular for a number of subjects. A group that called themselves 'Pictorialists' used them {{on a wide range of}} subject matter. They were contemporaries of the Impressionist movement, and the soft focus lenses created a similar feeling in photographs. Paterson married Jean MacKenzie MacLennan in the Station Hotel, Inverness, in March 1901 and they had three children, a daughter Constance and twin boys Hector and Hamish.Paterson outlived his wife by six months and died on the afternoon of 15 December 1948, aged 72 years, at his home Tigh-an-Uillt in Culduthel Road, Inverness.The studio business was carried on by his son Hector G.N. Paterson until his own retirement in 1980.|$|E
5000|$|After {{attending}} Houghton College, {{where he}} studied history with plans to be a lawyer, Sheffer returned to his hometown of Youngsville, Pennsylvania to teach high school history. He often lectured against war in his class room as World War II escalated. Working for the college year book at Houghton College exposed him to photography and lead him to leave teaching {{to work as a}} photographer for a department store in Pittsburgh. He later answered a newspaper ad for a photographer in Wisconsin because he admired the work of Wisconsin architect Frank Lloyd Wright and respected that Capital punishment in Wisconsin was abolished in 1853. He moved to Milwaukee in 1945 without [...] "knowing a soul" [...] to work for the prominent society portraitist John Platz. Inspired by the artistic achievements of Yousuf Karsh, Julia Margaret Cameron, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Emily Dickinson, Sheffer approached portraiture in a poetic and artistic manner working to get close in order to isolate the subject. Using a handheld 35 mm camera, natural side lighting and dramatic darkroom techniques, the portraits he generated out of his own Jefferson Street studio were known as having the [...] "Sheffer look". His portraits of Milwaukee's mid-century social elite, artists and architecture earned him the title [...] "Photographer of Photographers" [...] from the Wisconsin Professional Photographers Association in 1955. His clients included actor Jimmy Stewart, comedian Tallulah Bankhead, and politician Joseph McCarthy who he photographed for Life (magazine). He created the [...] "Portraits of Men" [...] series in the mid-1950s for DuPont, a manufacturer of photographic film and paper, which was destroyed in a fire at his studio. He was president of the Milwaukee Photo Pictorialists and the [...] "Darlot Club" [...] which he once described as the [...] "self-appointed ten best photographers in Wisconsin." [...] The groups favored pictorial style <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lenses,</b> and deep shadows in prints. He photographed theater productions extensively for Marquette University from 1955-1968 where many of his works are preserved in a photographic archive. Several of his portraits are also held {{in the collection of the}} Milwaukee Art Museum.|$|R

40|$|Electronic version {{excludes}} illustrations {{for which}} permission {{has not been}} granted by the rights holderThe history, practice and aesthetic of the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> in photography is elucidated and developed from its earliest statements of need to the current time with a particular emphasis on {{its role in the}} development of the Pictorialist movement. Using William Crawford's concept of photographic 'syntax', the use of the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> is explored as an example of how technology shapes style. 	A detailed study of the soft focus lenses from the earliest forms to the present is presented, enumerating the core properties of pinhole, early experimental and commercial soft focus lenses. This was researched via published texts in period journals, advertising, private correspondence, interviews, and the lenses themselves. The author conducted a wide range of in-studio experiments with both period and contemporary soft focus lenses to evaluate their character and distinct features, as well as to validate source material. 	Nodal points of this history and development are explored in the critical debate between the diffuse and sharp photographic image, beginning with the competition between the calotype and daguerreotype. The role of George Davison's The Old Farmstead is presented as well as the invention of the first modern <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens,</b> the Dallmeyer-Bergheim, and its function in the development of the popular Pictorialist lens, the Pinkham & Smith Semi-Achromatic. The trajectory of the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> is plotted against the Pictorialist movement, noting the correlation betwixt them, and the modern renaissance of soft focus lenses and the diffuse aesthetic. 	This thesis presents a unique history of photography modeled around the determining character of technology and the interdependency of syntax, style and art...|$|E

50|$|Overhead {{projectors}} normally {{include a}} manual focusing mechanism which raises and lowers {{the position of}} the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> (including the folding mirror) in order to adjust the object distance (optical distance between the slide and the <b>lens)</b> to <b>focus</b> at the chosen image distance (distance to the projection screen) given the fixed focal length of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> This permits a range of projection distances.|$|R
50|$|An {{overhead}} projector {{works on the}} same principle as a 35mm slide projector, in which a <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> projects light from an illuminated slide onto a projection screen where a real image is formed. However some differences are necessitated by the much larger size of the transparencies used (generally {{the size of a}} printed page), and the requirement that the transparency be placed face up (and readable to the presenter). For the latter purpose, the projector includes a mirror just before or after the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> to fold the optical system toward the horizontal. That mirror also accomplishes a reversal of the image in order that the image projected onto the screen corresponds to that of the slide as seen by the presenter looking down at it, rather than a mirror image thereof. Therefore, the transparency is placed face up (toward the mirror and <b>focusing</b> <b>lens),</b> in contrast with a 35mm slide projector or film projector (which lack such a mirror) where the slide's image is non-reversed on the side opposite the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|R
