25|$|Benthopelagic {{fish have}} neutral buoyancy, <b>so</b> they <b>can</b> float at depth without much effort, while {{strictly}} benthic fish are more dense, with negative buoyancy <b>so</b> they <b>can</b> {{lie on the}} bottom without any effort. Most demersal fish are benthopelagic.|$|R
50|$|Specifically, {{pineapple}} {{contains the}} protease (protein cutting enzyme) bromelain, kiwi fruit contains actinidin, figs contain ficain, and papaya contains papain. Cooking or canning denatures and deactivates the proteases, <b>so</b> <b>canned</b> pineapple, for example, works fine in a gelatin dessert.|$|R

40|$|We have {{identified}} 5 use cases that comprise a useful {{definition of an}} “open or interoperable electronic health record (EHR). ” Each of these use cases represents important functionality that {{should be available to}} 1) clinicians, <b>so</b> they <b>can</b> provide safe and effective health care; 2) researchers, <b>so</b> they <b>can</b> advance our understanding of disease and health care processes; 3) administrators, <b>so</b> they <b>can</b> reduce their reliance on a single-source EHR developer; 4) software developers, <b>so</b> they <b>can</b> develop innovative solutions to address limitations of current EHR user interfaces and new applications to improve the practice of medicine; and 5) patients, <b>so</b> they <b>can</b> access their personal health information no matter where they receive their health care. Widespread access to “open EHRs ” that can accommodate at least these 5 use cases is important if we are to realize the enormous potential of EHR-enabled health care systems.

50|$|Memory {{pointers}} {{can also}} be moved into the area of memory occupied by the instructions, <b>so</b> code <b>can</b> be self modified at runtime.

5|$|While {{official}} {{report was}} actually the summary of the sporting events held at the 1900 Exposition Universelle and <b>so</b> <b>can</b> not be considered as reliable source, the IOC states that 24 nations participated in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but additional sources list up to 28 nations, with Haiti, Iran, Luxembourg, and Peru being the additions.|$|E
5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is {{not because it is}} a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, <b>so</b> <b>can</b> anyone who follows this path.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and <b>so</b> <b>can</b> be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
50|$|The stony creek frog's snout is {{very useful}} in the wild. It enables it to stay low under water <b>so</b> it <b>can</b> stay away from predators. The snout acts as a {{ventilation}} system.

5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and <b>so</b> <b>can</b> be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|Athletes {{performances}} are timed or measured at virtually all {{track and field}} competitions. Doing <b>so</b> <b>can</b> not only serve {{as a way of}} determining the winner in an event, {{but it can also be}} used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's {{performances are}} recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent—beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, <b>so</b> <b>can</b> have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
