Unlike his lawmen brothers Virgil and James, Wyatt was never wounded, although once his clothing and his saddle were <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> bullet holes. According to John H. Flood's biography (as dictated to him by Wyatt Earp), Wyatt vividly recalled a presence that in several instances warned him away or urged him to take action. This happened {{when he was on}} the street, alone in his room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, at Bob Hatch's Pool Hall, where he went moments before Morgan was assassinated, and again when he approached Iron Springs and surprised Curly Bill Brocius, killing him.|$|E

All are broadly black and white – especially when viewed in low light conditions in which their dark blue coloring is not apparent – but their upper plumage is <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> dramatic notes of cobalt, azure and other lighter shades of blue, as well as grays and purples. The head is black, or blackish-blue with a broad, pale blue eye ring.|$|E

(Blanshard held {{the law of}} causality, properly understood, to be a logical law and believed that effects logically determine their causes as well as vice versa.) Strictly speaking, he admitted, we cannot prove {{that there are no}} atomic facts, bare conjunctions, or sheer surds in nature, but we can take it as our working hypothesis that relations of necessity are always to be found; until and unless this hypothesis meets with absolute defeat, we are justified in adopting it at least provisionally.|$|E
25|$|The 32nd Infantry Division was an {{infantry}} {{division of the}} United States Army National Guard that fought primarily during World War I and World War II. It was formed with units from the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. With roots as the Iron Brigade in the American Civil War, the division's ancestral units came {{to be referred to}} as the Iron Jaw Division. The division was briefly called up during the Berlin Crisis in 1961. In 1967, the division was deactivated and reconstituted the 32nd Infantry Brigade of the Wisconsin Army National Guard only to be reorganized in 2007 as the 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team. The shoulder sleeve insignia currently worn is a red line <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> a red arrow, giving them the nickname Red Arrow Brigade, which was earned in World War I where the 32nd Division was fighting the Germans alongside the French, who noted the unit's tenacity by punching through the German lines, like an arrow and calling the unit Les Terribles, meaning The Terrors.|$|E

500|$|Akhmatova {{joined the}} Acmeist group of poets in 1910 with poets such as Osip Mandelstam and Sergey Gorodetsky, working in {{response}} to the Symbolist school, concurrent with the growth of Imagism in Europe and America. It promoted the use of craft and rigorous poetic form over mysticism or spiritual in-roads to composition, favouring the concrete over the ephemeral. Akhmatova modeled its principles of writing with clarity, simplicity, and disciplined form. Her first collections [...] Evening (1912) and Rosary (1914) received wide critical acclaim and made her famous from the start of her career. They contained brief, psychologically taut pieces, acclaimed for their classical diction, telling details, and the skilful use of colour. Evening and her next four books were mostly lyric miniatures on the theme of love, <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> sadness.|$|E
500|$|Despite Hawks's work in {{a variety}} of Hollywood genres, he still {{retained}} an independent sensibility. Film critic David Thomson wrote of Hawks: [...] "Far from being the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down. To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep, ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. Rio Bravo, apparently a Western – everyone wears a cowboy hat – is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women." [...] David Boxwell argues that the filmmaker's body of work [...] "has been accused of a historical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks's fans rejoice in his oeuvre's remarkable avoidance of Hollywood's religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.|$|E

Marie Seton describes how the film intersperses the depiction of poverty and the delights and pleasures of youth. She represents the bond between Durga and Indir, and their fate, as signifying a philosophical core: that both {{the young and the}} old die. Seton writes of the film's [...] "lyrical" [...] qualities, noting especially the imagery immediately before the onset of monsoon. Robinson writes about a peculiar quality of [...] "lyrical happiness" [...] in the film, and states that Pather Panchali is [...] "about unsophisticated people <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> great sophistication, and without a trace of condescension or inflated sentiment".|$|E

500|$|Sylvia Plath's early poems exhibit {{what became}} her typical imagery, using {{personal}} and nature-based depictions featuring, for example, the moon, blood, hospitals, fetuses, and skulls. They were mostly imitation exercises of poets she admired such as Dylan Thomas, W. B. Yeats and Marianne Moore. Late in 1959, {{when she and}} Hughes were at the Yaddo writers' colony in New York State, she wrote the seven-part [...] "Poem for a Birthday", echoing Theodore Roethke's Lost Son sequence, though its theme is her own traumatic breakdown and suicide attempt at 20. After 1960 her work moved into a more surreal landscape darkened {{by a sense of}} imprisonment and looming death, overshadowed by her father. The Colossus is <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> themes of death, redemption and resurrection. After Hughes left, Plath produced, in less than two months, the forty poems of rage, despair, love, and vengeance on which her reputation mostly rests.|$|E

[...] Steve Rose of The Guardian rated the film three stars out of five; he said, [...] "Non-devotees might struggle, but director Bryan Singer whips up the action towards a symphonic climax". David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "While it's more dramatically diffuse than the reboot and lacks a definitive villain, the new film is <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> a stirring reverence for the Marvel Comics characters and their universe". Justin Chang of Variety said, [...] "If the characters' quandaries at times feel overly circumscribed, they're also advanced with a bracing emotional directness, devoid of either cynicism or sentimentalism, that touches genuine chords of feeling {{over the course of the}} film’s fleet 130-minute [...] running time". In 2016, James Charisma of Playboy ranked the film #8 on a list of 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals.|$|E

Tim Lee from musicOMH called it [...] "an absolutely stomping pop song" [...] and [...] "possibly the best mass market pop song since Girls Aloud's heyday", complimenting its brass production and call and response. According to Lee, the track is [...] "all <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> such sassiness that you nearly forget it sounds {{an awful lot like}} 'Ain't No Other Man' by Christina Aguilera."

MTV was also positive, stating that [...] "Adele's lush song fits right in with {{classics}} by Shirley Bassey, Paul McCartney and Carly Simon". The Wall Street Journal felt similarly, writing that the song [...] "has sweep and drama, [...] orchestral support [...] gives it a classical timelessness that sets it apart from typical pop songs. Because it is a theme for a Bond film, after all, the song is also <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> the threat of violence and death". E! Online wrote that Adele's song was [...] "a cross, and a good one at that, between the 1971 Bassey classic and a more-focused version of Garbage's 'The World Is Not Enough'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the song [...] "instantly feels like a Bond theme, with the singer's sultry voice set against a minor chord progression. Done in big, orchestral style, the mood – like the singer – is all 1960s throwback, back when Bond themes like 'Goldfinger' were smooth, seductive and larger than life".|$|E

AllMusic reviewer Heather Phares {{wrote that he}} [...] "expands on those qualities in his music and reveals new ones", [...] "displays a strong and surprising classic rock streak" [...] and [...] "gets downright hippie-ish, in a good way."

Spencer Grady from BBC Music compared the music to The Byrds, Neil Young and R.E.M., and added that [...] "flaws which initially seem awkward begin to make perfect sense after a few listens". Drowned in Sound's J.R. Moores said it was [...] "advertised as his first 'rock album'" [...] and impresses sonically. Filter critic Loren Auda Poin wrote [...] "at times sounding like Hendrix operating a theremin, and elsewhere resembling the mournful cries of lonesome satellites", Ranaldo's songs [...] "are accomplished and take surprising turns, <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> a mellow fury that's endlessly appealing." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 1999, in {{the year}} {{following}} Tippett's death, A Child of Our Time received a belated New York Philharmonic premiere, at the Avery Fisher Hall. The New York Times reviewer, Paul Griffiths, expressed some astonishment {{that this was the}} orchestra's first attempt at the work. As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the composer's birth in January 2005, English National Opera staged a dramatised performance of the work, directed by Jonathan Kent—coincidentally, the first performance fell in the week of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps at Auschwitz. Anna Picard, writing in The Independent, recognised the work's sincerity but found the dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate: [...] "Do we really need to see a dozen well-fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit {{in order to understand the}} Holocaust?" [...] Anthony Holden in The Observer was more positive, commenting that [...] "If you must stage a work intended for concert performance ... it is hard to imagine a more effective version than Kent's, <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>with</b> heavy symbolism of which Tippett would surely have approved." [...] Nevertheless, Holden found the overall result [...] "super-solemn, lurching between the over-literalistic and the portentous". The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance (1–8 May) were marked at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC by a special performance of A Child of Our time, in which the Washington Chorus was directed by Robert Shafer. The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23 July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales.|$|E
