25|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> mating {{ritual is}} a lengthy (over an hour) and {{elaborate}} process with long periods during which neither the male nor the female moves considerably. When the wandering male encounters a female's web, {{there may be}} an initial confrontation where each scares the other. Upon recovering, the male then constructs a large web around the female's crevice. When this web is complete, the male pulls on its strands continuously to draw the female out of her hole, which may take several minutes. Following her emergence, each spider will tap at the other in an effort to grasp the other by the forelegs, with the male remaining suspended in his web.|$|E
25|$|Almost all spiders {{reproduce}} sexually. They are {{unusual in}} {{that they do not}} transfer sperm directly, for example via a penis. Instead the males transfer it to specialized structures (palpal bulbs) on the pedipalps and then meander about to search for a mate. These palps are then introduced into the female's epigyne. This was first described in 1678 by Martin Lister. In 1843 it was revealed that males build a nuptial web into which they deposit a drop of semen, which is then taken up by the copulatory apparatus (the palpal bulb) in the pedipalp. The structure of the copulatory apparatus varies significantly between males of different species. While the widened palpal tarsus of the <b>southern</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider,</b> Kukulcania hibernalis (Filistatidae), only forms a simple bulb containing the coiled blind duct, members of the genus Argiope have a highly complex structure.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> is a cribellate spider. That is, its spinnerets do {{not produce}} {{adhesive}} webbing. [...] Instead, to capture prey the spider uses its legs to comb webbing across its cribellum, a spiked plate near the spinnerets.

50|$|Female <b>southern</b> <b>house</b> <b>spiders</b> {{are rarely}} seen, as they build radial webs around crevices, for which reason their family (Filistatidae) is called crevice weavers.

25|$|Male <b>southern</b> <b>house</b> <b>spiders</b> {{sometimes}} appear aggressive, {{but they}} do not bite unless trapped, and their mouthparts are too small to easily penetrate human skin. They do, however, have an unnerving tendency to crawl across anything in their path regardless of whether it is alive. This is not aggression; these spiders are simply nearly blind and cannot see larger animals. Indeed, these spiders instinctively play dead if they feel threatened (a tactic which is effective against their common predators).|$|R
2500|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> is {{a species}} of large spider in the family Filistatidae. Currently given the {{scientific}} name Kukulcania hibernalis, it was formerly known as Filistata hibernalis. Found in the Americas, it exhibits strong sexual dimorphism. It occurs in southern North American states of USA, throughout Central America and some Caribbean to southern Brazil and Uruguay. The males may be mistaken for brown recluses because the two have similar coloration and body structure. However, compared to the brown recluse, male southern house spiders are typically larger in size, lack the distinctive violin shape on their cephalothorax, and have unusually long slender pedipalps. The females are dark brown or black and more compact. Both sexes may grow to be roughly [...] across (legs extended), with the males typically having longer legs, and the females often having larger, bulbous bodies. The abdomen of the <b>southern</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> is covered with fine velvety light gray hair.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} members of this family in the Americas is the <b>southern</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> (Kukulcania hibernalis). Named after the fierce Meso-American god Kukulkan, the females are large (up to nearly 20 mm) dark-colored spiders and males are light brown, smaller (about 10 mm), but more long-legged and with palps that are held together {{in front of their}} carapaces like the horn of a unicorn. The males also have a darker streak on the center of the dorsal carapace that causes them to be often mistaken for brown recluse spiders. The tiny members of the genus Filistatinella are like miniature versions of Kukulcania. The nominate genus Filistata is Afro-Eurasian in distribution. In many older books the species from the Americas now placed in the genus Kukulcania are placed in Filistata.|$|E

5000|$|Allochares azureus has an {{distinctive}} biology among spider wasps. Following mating {{the female}} hunts for a <b>southern</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> (Kukulcania hibernalis), searching for prey on foot with short rapid rushes and flicking of wings, {{it will make}} short flights of a metre or so between hunting sites. Once a spider is found the wasp move to {{the centre of the}} web where the spider has a tube like retreat which the wasp enters. The spider reacts to the wasp by retreating away from its web and finding a chiding place in a fissure or another spider's webs where it hides and tries to remain motionless, the wasp seems unable to detect the spider so long as it is still. The wasp continues to search and if it touches the spider the spider will try to retreat and the wasp will pursue it. The lack of spines and modified tarsal claws shown by A. azureus appears to be an adaptation to this as their presence could probably cause the wasp to get tangled in the velcro like threads of the spider's web. The female attacks the spider from behind, sometimes flipping it on its back and paralyses the spider with a sting in the venter [...] The paralysed spider is the dragged, sometimes vertically, back to its web or to another unoccupied web and is secured in the web by the female using the spider's own silk strands to wrap it in and lays an egg on it. The egg hatches in 2-3 days, the larva the feeds on the spider for 10-12 days before it pupates in the web, building a distinct cocoon which has its outer surface covered in long silky hairs. This species has a number of generations in a year. The adults have been observed or caught feeding on flowers of Baccharis and Solidago, and also Acacia, Asclepias, Condalia, Hyptis emoryi and Colubrina texensis.|$|E

25|$|The common <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> (Parasteatoda tepidariorum), {{referred}} to internationally as the American <b>house</b> <b>spider,</b> is a spider {{species of the}} genus Parasteatoda that is mainly indigenous to the New World, with P. tepidariorum australis (common gray <b>house</b> <b>spider)</b> also encountered {{in some parts of}} Myanmar and Pakistan. American <b>house</b> <b>spiders</b> are synanthropic and build their tangled webs in or near human dwellings, often in secluded areas such as between loose walls and behind open doors and attic windows.
