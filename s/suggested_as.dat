5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{has been}} <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> another potential cause. Insects {{are attracted to}} lights making them scarcer within the amphibian habitats.|$|E

5|$|Purity {{of heart}} is <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> the {{necessary}} quality needed {{to accomplish this}} task; common Catholic prayers and hymns include a request for this virtue.|$|E

50|$|Traditional grammar <b>suggests</b> (<b>as</b> a “rule of thumb”) {{that only}} single-syllable verbs {{can be in}} double object {{construction}} (DOC).|$|R
50|$|Research on the PDS <b>suggests</b> (<b>as</b> {{these two}} {{programmes}} show) {{that the situation}} varies quite a lot across the country.|$|R
5|$|Another {{potential}} protocarnivorous pitfall trap is {{a species}} of teasel, Dipsacus fullonum, which has been only <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> a possible carnivore. Only one major study has examined D. fullonum for carnivory and no evidence of digestive enzymes or foliar nutrient absorption was revealed.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars with a planet, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} several {{observations}} in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> a destination for interstellar travel. From Epsilon Eridani, the Sun would appear as a 2.4-magnitude star in Serpens.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{widespread}} property damage and extensive death tolls the name Isabel was retired after the 2003 season, {{and will not}} be used for future Atlantic hurricanes. It was replaced by Ida for the naming list for the 2009 season. The names Ina and Ivy were also <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> possible replacement names.|$|E

5|$|Because {{tumor cells}} are inefficient in {{processing}} ketone bodies for energy, the ketogenic diet {{has also been}} <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> a treatment for cancer, including glioma, as well as multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} habitat specificity, {{many species of}} beetles have been <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> {{suitable}} as indicators, their presence, numbers, or absence providing a measure of habitat quality. Predatory beetles such as the tiger beetles (Cicindelidae) have found scientific use as an indicator taxon for measuring regional patterns of biodiversity. They are suitable for this as their taxonomy is stable; their life history is well described; they are large and simple to observe when visiting a site; they occur {{around the world in}} many habitats, with species specialised to particular habitats; and their occurrence by species accurately indicates other species, both vertebrate and invertebrate. According to the habitats, many other groups such as the rove beetles in human-modified habitats, dung beetles in savannas and saproxylic beetles in forests have been <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> potential indicator species.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{was once}} thought innocuous; in 1931 it was <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> being {{suitable}} {{for use as a}} vehicle or solvent for injectable pharmaceutical preparations. Numerous cases of poisoning have been reported since then, and it {{has been shown to be}} toxic to humans.|$|E

50|$|Silva's {{original}} ESP {{training method}} took 40 to 48 hours to complete. The method as currently promoted {{has been reduced}} to 18 to 20 hours through an apparent refinement of technique. Contemporary reports <b>suggest</b> <b>as</b> little as 12 to 14 hours is required by especially able practitioners.|$|R
5|$|For a {{suspected}} first leg DVT in a moderate-probability scenario, a high-sensitivity D-dimer is <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> a recommended option over ultrasound imaging, with both whole-leg and compression ultrasound possible. The NICE guideline uses a two-point Wells score {{and does not}} refer to a moderate probability group.|$|E
5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint. The late Holocene eruption of the Mount Aniakchak, a volcano in Alaska, is now {{believed to be the}} source of the minute shards of volcanic glass in the Greenland ice core.|$|E
5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> {{the reason for}} this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably easier for him to write from right to left.|$|E

5000|$|Conical {{glasses are}} shaped, <b>as</b> the name <b>suggests,</b> <b>as</b> an {{inverted}} truncated cone around 6 in tall and tapering by about 1 in in diameter over its height.|$|R
5|$|Queen Meresankh IV {{has also}} been <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> a consort for Menkauhor based on the dating and {{location}} of her tomb in Saqqara. It is possible however {{that she was a}} wife of Djedkare Isesi.|$|E
5|$|Rowling's sister Dianne {{was born}} at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She {{attended}} St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> {{the inspiration for the}} Harry Potter headmaster Albus Dumbledore.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Lamiaceae can spread {{unchecked}} and become invasive plants. Planting of P.atriplicifolia near wild lands has been discouraged by some gardening guides {{out of concern for}} its potential to spread, but it is not considered invasive, and has been <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> a substitute for purple loosestrife for this reason.|$|E

5|$|Teratological (developmentally abnormal) {{forms of}} H.aurantiaca were {{reported}} {{to occur in the}} United Kingdom. The fruit bodies of these specimens were club-shaped with a wrinkled upper surface of convoluted gill tissue. The overall morphology of these forms somewhat resembles species of Clavariadelphus. Although the cause of this abnormal development is not known with certainty, environmental pollutants or virus infection have been <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> contributing factors.|$|E
5|$|The coin {{was first}} <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> a {{replacement}} for the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which proved useful for vending machine operators and mass transit systems despite being unpopular with the public. The Statue of Liberty was originally proposed as the design subject, but Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was eventually chosen.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{parentage}} of Domentziolus is unclear: Phocas had two known brothers, Comentiolus {{and another}} also named Domentziolus, who {{has sometimes been}} <b>suggested</b> <b>as</b> the younger Domentziolus's father. Shortly after the accession of Phocas, in 603, the younger Domentziolus was raised to the titles of vir gloriosissimus, patricius and curopalates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{theory that}} an {{avalanche}} caused the hikers' deaths, while initially popular, {{has since been}} questioned. Reviewing the sensationalist [...] "Yeti" [...] hypothesis (see below), American skeptic author Benjamin Radford <b>suggests</b> <b>as</b> more plausible; ...|$|R
