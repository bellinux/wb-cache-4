The problem of designing the gear unit with great speed ratio and high energy transformation efficiency, is considered. Such units of Spiroid type are of high importance for application to robotic and biomechanical systems which includes the electromechanical drives. The original theory of the <b>skew-axes</b> <b>gears,</b> proposed at IM BAS, is described. Mathematical models of that type of toothing provides the possibility to synthesize the tooth gear with desired parameters taking into account the problem of its real manufacturing.
