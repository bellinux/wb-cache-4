5|$|Sarah {{was called}} to Cambridge in 1703, where her only {{surviving}} son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with smallpox. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. Sarah was heartbroken {{over the loss of}} her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> out when Anne suffered bereavement. After the death of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at Kensington Palace to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to St James's Palace in London, which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call Abigail Masham to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself to be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.|$|E
25|$|Horn's 1993 series When Dickinson <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> eyes, {{comprises}} eight square aluminium {{poles of}} different lengths leaning casually against the gallery wall, each bearing {{a line from}} Emily Dickinson's poem A Wind that rose; following in the conceptual tradition started by Joseph Kosuth and Lawrence Weiner, Horn's homage to Dickinson investigates the possibilities of language as sculptural form. Other works in her series White Dickinson include sentences from the published letters of Dickinson.|$|E

I would like the expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane and healthy woman, <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> up and make her sit from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow her to talk or move during these hours, give her no reading and let her know nothing of the world or its doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see {{how long it will}} take to make her insane. Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck.|$|E

To speak of Portuguese colonies in East Africa is to speak of a mere fiction—a fiction colourably sustained by a few scattered seaboard settlements, beyond whose narrow littoral and local limits colonisation and government have no existence." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{senator from}} South Carolina has read many books of chivalry, and {{believes}} himself a chivalrous knight with sentiments {{of honor and}} courage. [...] Of course he has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted {{in the sight of}} the world, is chaste in his sight -- I mean the harlot, slavery. For her his tongue is always profuse in words. [...] Let her be impeached in character, or any proposition made to <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> out from the extension of her wantonness, and no extravagance of manner or hardihood of assertion is then too great for this senator.|$|E
2500|$|The {{awkward silence}} was broken when McNamara {{raised the issue}} of Madame Nhu. Diệm was a {{bachelor}} so Madame Nhu was the de facto First Lady, living in the palace. Dubbed the Dragon Lady due to her acerbic nature, she had a long history of anti-American remarks. McNamara complained about her [...] "ill-advised and unfortunate declarations". He removed a newspaper clipping from his pocket in which she was quoted as calling some US officers as [...] "acting like little soldiers of fortune" [...] which she claimed had caused the Americans to pursue a [...] "confused policy". McNamara said that such comment hurt the bilateral relationship and that the American public would be less generous in sending their officers to support the anti-communist counterinsurgency. One of the Americans lost his composure and asked Diệm whether [...] "there was not something the government could do to <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> up." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 29 September 1963 {{meeting with}} Diệm, McNamara bemoaned [...] "the ill-advised and unfortunate {{declarations}} of Madame Nhu", who had described U.S. military advisors as [...] "acting like little soldiers of fortune". McNamara said that such comments would damage bilateral military cooperation and deter American officers from helping the South Vietnamese forces. Lodge denounced the comments and said, [...] "These men should be thanked, not insulted." [...] However, {{one of his}} aides lost his composure and asked if [...] "there were not something the government could do to <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> up." [...] Diệm {{was stunned by the}} comments and retorted that [...] "one cannot deny a lady the right to defend herself when she has been unjustly attacked", saying his sister-in-law was entitled to freedom of speech. But McNamara reinforced the point, noting to Diem that [...] "This is not satisfactory. [...] The problems were real and serious. [...] They had to be solved before the war could be won." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Committee's {{report was}} {{presented}} to Parliament by Prime Minister Thatcher on 18 January 1983. Whilst criticising {{of some of the}} actions of the government, the report cleared the government of any blame for the invasion. The report concluded that the Committee [...] "would not be justified in attaching any criticism or blame to the present Government for the Argentine juntas decision to commit its act of unprovoked aggression". It argued that the invasion [...] "could not be foreseen" [...] but that some British Government policies [...] "may have served to cast doubt on British commitment to the Islands and their defence". Thatcher is reported to have been anxious over the findings of the report and was triumphant at what she considered as vindication of her view that criticism of her government's actions were unwarranted. Simon Jenkins reported that when the report arrived [...] "she sat down, <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> eyes and asked her secretary to read the last paragraph, the exoneration. She needed no caveats, just that sentence." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Siegmund Hurwitz the Talmudic Lilith is {{connected}} with the Greek Lamia, who, according to Hurwitz, likewise governed a class of child stealing lamia-demons. Lamia bore the title [...] "child killer" [...] and was feared for her malevolence, like Lilith. She has different conflicting origins and is described as having a human upper body {{from the waist up}} and a serpentine body from the waist down. One source states simply that she is a daughter of the goddess Hecate. Another, that Lamia was subsequently cursed by the goddess Hera to have stillborn children because of her association with Zeus; alternatively, Hera slew all of Lamia's children (except Scylla) in anger that Lamia slept with her husband, Zeus. The grief caused Lamia to turn into a monster that took revenge on mothers by stealing their children and devouring them. Lamia had a vicious sexual appetite that matched her cannibalistic appetite for children. She was notorious for being a vampiric spirit and loved sucking men’s blood. Her gift was the [...] "mark of a Sibyl", a gift of second sight. Zeus was said to have given her the gift of sight. However, she was [...] "cursed" [...] to never be able to <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> eyes so that she would forever obsess over her dead children. Taking pity on Lamia, Zeus gave her the ability to remove and replace her eyes from their sockets.|$|E
2500|$|The twelfth {{flotilla}} {{commanded by}} Captain Stirling on the destroyer leader Faulknor was following behind the First Battle Squadron. This had fallen behind the main fleet because damage to Marlborough had reduced her speed, so the destroyers were now some 10 miles behind Jellicoe. The flotilla had thirteen 'M' class destroyers plus Faulknor and another destroyer leader, Marksman. At 0143 Obedient sighted ships steering ESE in the slowly lightening dawn. The unidentified ships gave the incorrect challenge signal and an attack was begun in near ideal conditions on German dreadnought and pre-dreadnought battleships. The pre-dreadnought Pommern {{was struck by}} a torpedo. One of Obedient's officers reported: [...] "Right amidship in the Pommern appeared a dull red ball of fire. It spread fore and aft and flared up the masts in big red tongues of flame, uniting in a black cloud of smoke and sparks. Then one saw the ends of the ship come up as though her back was broken before the mist <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> out of view". Six destroyers fired seventeen torpedoes [...] at the German ships, the other destroyers being driven away by gunfire. Stirling attempted to report the engagement, making three reports, but none was received by Jellicoe, either because of damage to his radio aerials or because of German jamming. Had the signals been received, it would still have been possible for Jellicoe to turn his fleet and intercept the German ships before they reached the safety of their own minefields at 0330.|$|E
