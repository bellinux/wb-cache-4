5000|$|The aim of Huffaker’s 1958 {{experiment}} was to “shed light upon the fundamental nature of predator-prey interaction” [...] and to “establish an ecosystem {{in which a}} predatory and a prey species could continue living together so that the phenomena associated with their interactions could be studied in detail”. [...] He used two mite species, the <b>six-spotted</b> <b>mite</b> Eotetranychus sexmaculatus as the prey species and Typhlodromus occidentalis as the predatory species. Oranges provided a background environment and a food source for the herbivorous mites. The amount of available food on each orange was controlled by sealing off portions of each orange using damp paper and paraffin wax. Huffaker introduced patchiness into the system by replacing oranges with rubber balls of a similar size. He referred to the resultant systems as [...] "universes." [...] Huffaker created a series of 12 universes in his experiment, trying different arrangements to reach a universe in which the predator population would not annihilate the prey population, and in which, instead, the two species could coexist.|$|E
