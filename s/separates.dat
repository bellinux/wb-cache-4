5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which <b>separates</b> the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum <b>separates</b> the atria and the interventricular septum <b>separates</b> the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{two related}} structures on finite sets, namely <b>separating</b> systems and covering <b>separating</b> systems. These systems are considered {{from the point}} of view of combinatorial designs. <b>Separating</b> systems have been considered by previous authors but this is the first time that covering <b>separating</b> systems have been studied in detail. A <b>separating</b> system on [n] = { 1, [...] ., n} is a collection of subsets of [n], in which for each pair of elements of [n), there exists a set in the collection which contains the first element but not the second or vice versa. A covering <b>separating</b> system on [n] is a <b>separating</b> system on [n] in which each element of [n] occurs at least once. A covering <b>separating</b> system on [n] in which each set has cardinality k is called a (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> system. The size of a (covering) <b>separating</b> system is the number of sets in the collection. The volume of at (covering) <b>separating</b> system is the sum of the cardinalities of the sets in the collection. A minimal (covering) <b>separating</b> system on [n) is one which contains the least possible number of sets. The size of a minimal <b>separating</b> system has been determined for all n by Renyi. The size of minimal covering <b>separating</b> systems on [n] and bounds or exact values on the size of a minimal (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> system is determined here for all n and k. Various results are derived on the volume of minimal <b>separating</b> systems and minimal covering <b>separating</b> systems on [n], and on the volume of minimal (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> systems. A catalogue of all non-isomorphic minimal <b>separating</b> systems for n ≤ 8 and all non-isomorphic minimal covering <b>separating</b> systems for n ≤ 7 is given. Some conjectures concerning minimal (n, k) covering <b>separating</b> systems are made. The thesis concludes with a brief mention of the connection between covering <b>separating</b> systems and finite topologies. This provides one possible avenue for applications of the theory of covering <b>separating</b> systems...|$|R
