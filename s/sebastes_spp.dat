25|$|Multiple kelp species often co-exist {{within a}} forest; the term {{understory}} canopy {{refers to the}} stipitate and prostrate kelps. For example, a Macrocystis canopy may extend many meters above the seafloor towards the ocean surface, while an understory of the kelps Eisenia and Pterygophora reaches upward only a few meters. Beneath these kelps, a benthic assemblage of foliose red algae may occur. The dense vertical infrastructure with overlying canopy forms a system of microenvironments similar to those observed in a terrestrial forest, with a sunny canopy region, a partially shaded middle, and darkened seafloor. Each guild has associated organisms, which vary in their levels of dependence on the habitat, and the assemblage of these organisms can vary with kelp morphologies. For example, in California, Macrocystis pyrifera forests, the nudibranch Melibe leonina, and skeleton shrimp Caprella californica are closely associated with surface canopies; the kelp perch Brachyistius frenatus, rockfish <b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.,</b> and many other fishes are found within the stipitate understory; brittle stars and turban snails Tegula spp. are {{closely associated with the}} kelp holdfast, while various herbivores, such as sea urchins and abalone, live under the prostrate canopy; many seastars, hydroids, and benthic fishes live among the benthic assemblages; solitary corals, various gastropods, and echinoderms live over the encrusting coralline algae.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The use of some age {{determination}} methods {{may result in}} the incorrect age structure of fish populations. This in turn may lead to incorporation of inappropriate data into models used for stock management. Otoliths are commonly used for determining the age of fishes, and ages based on the whole otoliths (surface ages) are often lower than those based on otolith sections of long-lived, slow-growing fishes such as rockfishes (<b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.).</b> Therefore, significant overestimates in growth and mortality may occur when surface ages are used for these species. This study provides estimates of growth and total instantaneous mortality for Sebastes diploproa and S. pinniger based on ages determined from the otolith surface versus those determined from otolith sections. For both species, estimates of mortality were reduced {{by more than half}} when section rather than surface ages were used. Estimates of growth based on surface rather than section ages were nearly identical for S. diploproa but appeared higher for S. pinniger. The inclusion of posterior otolith projections in the surface counts of S. diploproa and not S. pinniger are suspected of producing these differences. Because of these revised estimates of mortality and growth the life history features and response to exploitation of these species must be re-evaluated. Maximum sustainable yields of S. ninniger and S. diploproa based on surface ages are 2 to 5 times greater for either species than yields based on section ages. Mistaken estimates such as these can lead to management errors resulting in overexploitation and may thus explain the depletion of some stocks of <b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Recruitment of pelagic larval fishes to the nearshore {{environment}} {{is dependent on}} a suite of biological and physical processes operating at many spatial and temporal scales. Nearshore circulation processes associated with coastal upwelling are widely upheld as major determinants of year class strength for many rockfishes (<b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.),</b> but the mechanism by which these processes drive recruitment is largely unknown. We used Standard Monitoring Units for the Recruitment of Fishes (SMURFs) to monitor recruitment of two rockfish complexes (<b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.)</b> and cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus) from March to September of 2004 and 2005 at 3 sites along the central California coast. We {{examined the relationship between}} recruitment of these fishes and measurements of oceanographic variability associated with upwelling dynamics, including in situ water temperature, AVHRR sea surface temperature, the Bakun upwelling index, and an index of alongshore surface water transport. We found that rockfish comprising the KCGB complex (Sebastes atrovirens, Sebastes caurinus, Sebastes carnatus, Sebastes chrysomelas) recruit during early summer, while fishes of the BYO complex (Sebastes melanops, Sebastes flavidus, Sebastes serranoides), as well as cabezon recruit during late summer. Our results provide limited support for an association between the arrival of juvenile pelagic rockfish and cabezon to the nearshore environment and physical processes related to upwelling and relaxation. Beyond the limitations of our bimonthly sampling scheme, the lack of a clear pattern {{may be related to the}} near absence of upwelling–relaxation cycles along this stretch of coast during these two study periods. Moreover, the settlement and recruitment of nearshore fishes may be closely tied to processes occurring earlier in the larval stage...|$|E

40|$|Throughout their range, <b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.</b> are {{adapted to}} a {{diversity}} of ecological niches, with overlapping spatial distributions of different species that {{have little or no}} morphological differences. Divergence of behavioural groups into depth-defined adult habitats has led to reproductive isolation, adaptive radiation, and speciation in the genus Sebastes. Recent genetic research, supported by life-history infor-mation, indicates four biological stocks of Sebastes mentella in the Irminger Sea and adjacent waters: a western stock, a deep-pelagic stock, a shallow-pelagic stock, and an Iceland slope stock. Congruent differences in fatty acids and parasites suggest that these geneti-cally distinct populations are adapted to disparate trophic habitats in pelagic waters (shallower and deeper than the deep-scattering layer) and in demersal habitats on the continental slope. Morphology of pelagic forms is also more streamlined than demersal forms. Although genetic differences and evidence for reproductive isolation are clear, these populations appear to share common nursery habitats on the Greenland shelf. We propose a redefinition of practical management units near the Irminger Sea based on geographi...|$|E
40|$|The {{black sea}} bass (Centropristis striata), a western Atlantic serranid, has been commercially {{harvested}} {{since the early}} 20 th century. This protogynous reef species is also highly sought after by recreational anglers. While C. striata stocks in the western Atlantic are not currently considered over fished, harvests have decreased slightly {{in the last two}} decades (Vaughan et al., 1995). Like other members family Serranidae, C. striata are most commonly found inhabiting areas endowed with some degree of vertical relief or physical complexity (i. e. live bottom, rocky reefs, shipwrecks, etc.) (Musick and Mercer, 1977). Centropristis striata is also one of the most common and rapid colonizers of artificial reefs deployed in waters off the southeast coast of the United States. Individuals observed inhabiting artificial reefs, however, tend to be adults. It has been recently proposed in other reef species (<b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.)</b> that habitats specifically designed for settlement and use by juveniles could aid in recruitment to adult populations (Danner et al., 1994). Additionally, it has been suggested that the use of artificial habitats in early rearing environments o...|$|E
40|$|The diet of Steller {{sea lions}} (Eumetopias jubatus) was {{determined}} from 1494 scats (feces) collected at breeding (rookeries) and nonbreeding (haulout) sites in Southeast Alaska from 1993 to 1999. The most common prey of 61 species identified were walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus), Pacific salmon (Salmonidae), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), rockfish (<b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.),</b> skates (Rajidae), and cephalopods (squid and octopus). Steller sea lion diets {{at the three}} Southeast Alaska rookeries differed significantly from one another. The sea lions consumed the most diverse range of prey categories during summer, and the least diverse during fall. Diet was more diverse in Southeast Alaska during the 1990 s {{than in any other}} region of Alaska (Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands). Dietary differences between increasing and declining populations of Steller sea lions in Alaska correlate with rates of population change, and add credence to the view that diet may {{have played a role in}} the decline of sea lions in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands...|$|E
