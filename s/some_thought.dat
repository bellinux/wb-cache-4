5|$|Also {{during the}} offseason, Ruppert had been {{sounding}} {{out the other}} clubs in hopes of finding one that {{would be willing to}} take Ruth as a manager and/or a player. However, the only serious offer came from Athletics owner-manager Connie Mack, who gave <b>some</b> <b>thought</b> to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth. However, Mack later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over.|$|E
5|$|Another major human chain, {{which was}} {{expected}} to occur 5 May, was abruptly postponed the previous night by organizers because {{of the impact of}} previous demonstrations. The cancellation was reported throughout Facebook, Twitter, Tamil television and radio stations and word of mouth. <b>Some</b> <b>thought</b> the cancellation was because of the recent swine flu outbreak. The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 May through Downtown Toronto, reminiscent of the one that occurred on 30 January.|$|E

500|$|Along with Rousseau's [...] (1762), Locke's <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> Concerning Education {{was one of}} the {{foundational}} eighteenth-century texts on educational theory. In Britain, it was considered the standard treatment of the topic for over a century. For this reason, some critics have maintained that <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> Concerning Education vies with the Essay Concerning Human Understanding for the title of Locke's most influential work. Some of Locke's contemporaries, such as seventeenth-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, believed this as well; Leibniz argued that <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> superseded even the Essay in its impact on European society.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of her husband's election, some sources {{anticipated}} that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African-Americans.

5|$|The {{game was}} created to not have direct {{connections}} to the first Shin Megami Tensei, {{to ensure that it}} was interesting independently; this led character designer Kazuma Kaneko to create the concept of a story vaguely based on Shin Megami Tensei future. Reviewers enjoyed the gameplay and the lowered difficulty compared to the prior game; some appreciated the plot and themes, but <b>some</b> <b>thought</b> that certain themes, while fresh at the time of release, felt clichéd in retrospect.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which <b>some</b> <b>thought</b> were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Fall of Cybertron {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics.

Gameplay was mostly praised, but some reviewers cited the removal of War for Cybertrons cooperative campaign as a low point. Graphics and audio also received broadly positive comments, though some reviewers noticed frame rate issues with the PlayStation 3 version. A tie-in titled , which is partially set between War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron was released June 24, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Gimmick! {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} {{and a lack}} of interest at release. Distributors were more interested in games for the new 16-bit systems, so Sakai found difficulty in getting the game localized outside Japan. Sunsoft of America did not approve of the game for a North American release due to its quirky character design. Ultimately, the only distributor that imported the game was Swedish distributor Bergsala, which released it in 1993 in small quantities across the Scandinavian market. Critics both praised and criticized the game for its challenging difficulty, and <b>some</b> <b>thought</b> the game was designed exclusively for children due to its character design. In retrospective reviews, Gimmick! has received more praise, even seeing a re-release in Japan in 2002 for the PlayStation.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's {{departure}} at 294/5 {{brought the}} first of the bowlers, Johnson, to the crease. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting the off spinner for four more sixes, two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. On each occasion, umpire Chester walked {{to the edge of the}} playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and <b>some</b> <b>thought</b> Chester's actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Laker refused to be deterred by the aggressive batting and continued to bowl normally by pursuing defensive off or leg theory. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 329/6, hitting Laker to Cranston.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1909 that an Apatosaurus skull was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would {{become known as the}} Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument. The skull was found a short {{distance}} from a skeleton (specimen CM3018) identified as the new species Apatosaurus louisae, named after Louise Carnegie, wife of Andrew Carnegie, who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. The skull was designated CM11162; it was very similar to the skull of Diplodocus. Another smaller skeleton of A.louisae was found nearby CM11162 and CM3018. The skull was accepted as belonging to the Apatosaurus specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientistsmost notably Osbornrejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While <b>some</b> <b>thought</b> Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton. After Holland's death in 1934, museum staff placed a cast of a Camarasaurus skull on the mount.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mayer {{was fired}} in 1937. He {{attributed}} this to the hatred of women {{on the part of}} the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, <b>some</b> <b>thought</b> that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct.|$|E

5|$|McCulloch met former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr in 1993 {{and they}} wrote and {{recorded}} an album, tentatively titled Touch Down. The album {{was to be}} released in early 1994; however, despite McCulloch and Marr being happy with the album, Rob Dickins at WEA felt it was missing some element. Dickins suggested to McCulloch that Sergeant be brought in to do some work. McCulloch was initially sceptical because he had not spoken with Sergeant since de Freitas's funeral; however, he did give the idea <b>some</b> <b>thought.</b> Before McCulloch had chance to contact Sergeant, a mutual friend persuaded the pair to meet socially. While McCulloch and Sergeant were being reacquainted, the tapes from the McCulloch and Marr sessions disappeared. McCulloch was not upset about this as he and Sergeant had started working together as Electrafixion.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 15:25, {{and without}} warning, {{a series of}} violent explosions tore through the rear part of the ship. She capsized five minutes later. <b>Some</b> <b>thought</b> {{that she had been}} torpedoed by a German U-boat or detonated a submarine-laid mine, but {{examination}} of the wreckage revealed that the explosions were internal. The divers sent to investigate the ship reported that the explosions began in either the rear 9.2-inch shellroom or the 3-pounder and small arms magazine. The Admiralty court-martial into the causes of her loss concluded that it was caused by an internal ammunition explosion, possibly due to faulty cordite. The Admiralty issued a revised list of the dead and missing that totaled 390 in January 1916, but did not list the women and children on board that day. Losses are listed from 390 to 421.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and <b>some</b> <b>thought</b> Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E
