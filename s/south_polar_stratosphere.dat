40|$|Stratospheric {{temperatures}} on Saturn imply {{a strong}} decay of the equatorial winds with altitude. If {{the decrease in}} winds reported from recent Hubble Space Telescope images is not a temporal change, then the features tracked must {{have been at least}} 130 kilometers higher than in earlier studies. Saturn's <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is warmer than predicted from simple radiative models. The C/H ratio on Saturn is seven times solar, twice Jupiter's. Saturn's ring temperatures have radial variations down to the smallest scale resolved (100 kilometers).

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of temperature}} {{trends in the}} <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> from 1979 - 1985 is detailed. A significant cooling {{has occurred in the}} stratosphere over this period. South polar October mean temperatures have declined 18 K at 24 km over the seven-year period. A large fraction of this decline occurs as a result of including 1979 temperatures in the trend. The years 1979 and 1982 differ from other years in that they include large mid-October wave events which produce significantly warmer polar temperatures. Nevertheless, a significant temperature decline has still occurred in the stratosphere even when the dynamically active years are not included. Comparing two relatively dynamically quiet years, 1980 and 1985, the largest temperature decrease in the 30 mb temperature field occurs not at the pole but in the subpolar temperature maximum centered near 60 deg S. The changes in temperature of both the maximum and the polar low regions correlate fairly well with total ozone changes observed by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrophotometer...|$|E

Two specially instrumented NASA aircraft were flown over the Arctic region. Each aircraft flew to acquire data on the meteorological, chemical and cloud physical phenomena that occur in the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> during winter. The chemical processes which occur in the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> during winter were also observed and studied. The data acquired are being analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The {{water vapor}} of the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> {{possibly}} {{plays an important}} role in various aeronomical processes; for example, OH radical formation through photodissociation of H 2 O, formation of water cluster ions, radiative energy transfer in the lower stratosphere, condensation onto particulate matter, and so on. In addition to these, it has been speculated, from the viewpoint of global transport and/or budget of water vapor, that the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> functions as an active sink. STANFORD (1973) emphasized the existence of the stratospheric Cist cloud in the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> which brought a large loss rate of stratospheric water vapor through a so-called freeze-out of cloud particles from the stratosphere into the troposphere. However, these geophysically interesting problems unfortunately remain to be solved, owing to the lack of measurements on water vapor distribution and its temporal variation in the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> The water vapor content measured at Syowa Station (69. 00 deg S, 39. 35 deg E), Antarctica using a balloon-borne hygrometer (Lyman - alpha/OH fluorescence type) is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change in}} the Southern Hemisphere (SH) <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is {{associated}} with substantial changes in the atmospheric circulation that extend to the earth's surface. The mechanisms that drive {{the changes in the}} SH troposphere are not fully understood, but most previous hypotheses have focused on the role of atmospheric dynamics rather than that of radiation. This study quantifies the radiative response of temperatures in the SH polar troposphere to the forcing from long-term temperature and ozone trends in the SH <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> A novel methodology is employed that explicitly neglects changes in tropospheric dynamics and hence isolates the component of the tropospheric temperature response that is radiatively driven by the overlying stratospheric trends. The results reveal that both the amplitude and seasonality of the observed cooling of the middle and upper SH polar troposphere {{over the past few decades}} are consistent with a reduction in downwelling longwave radiation induced by cooling in the SH <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> The results are compared with analogous calculations for trends in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Both the observations and radiative calculations imply that the comparatively weak trends in the NH <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> have not played a central role in driving NH tropospheric climate change. Overall, the results suggest that radiative processes play a key role in coupling the large trends in SH polar stratospheric temperatures to tropospheric levels. The tropospheric radiative temperature response documented here could be important for triggering the changes in internal tropospheric dynamics associated with stratosphere-troposphere coupling...|$|R

A mid-February wave 2 major warming considerably warmed the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> but did not immediately lead to a lower stratospheric vortex breakup.

25|$|The {{majority}} of this variability {{is believed to}} occur due {{to changes in the}} viewing geometry. Uranus is an oblate spheroid, which causes its visible area to become larger when viewed from the poles. This explains in part its brighter appearance at solstices. Uranus is also known to exhibit strong meridional variations in albedo (see above). For instance, the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> region of Uranus is much brighter than the equatorial bands. In addition, both poles demonstrate elevated brightness in the microwave part of the spectrum, whereas the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is known to be cooler than the equatorial one. So seasonal change seems to happen as follows: poles, which are bright both in visible and microwave spectral bands, come into the view at solstices resulting in brighter planet, whereas the dark equator is visible mainly near equinoxes resulting in darker planet. In addition, occultations at solstices probe hotter equatorial stratosphere.|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the 11 year solar cycle on the Northern Hemisphere <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> have been analyzed in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 3 {{in the absence}} of the quasi-biennial oscillation. The polar response to ENSO agrees with previous studies during solar minimum; composites of warm minus cold ENSO events show a warmer <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> and a weaker polar vortex, propagating downward as the winter evolves. During solar maximum conditions, little downward propagation of the ENSO signal is simulated, leading to colder temperatures and stronger winds in the <b>polar</b> lower <b>stratosphere.</b> The analysis of the Eliassen-Palm flux and wave index of refraction shows that this is mainly due to a reduction of upward propagating extratropical planetary wave number 1 component caused by changes in the background winds in the subtropics related to a warmer tropical upper stratosphere during solar maximum. The effect of the 11 year solar cycle variability on the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is not significant during cold ENSO events until February. During warm ENSO events, a statistically significant colder <b>polar</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> and stronger <b>polar</b> vortex are simulated throughout the winter, and no downward propagation of this signal occurs. This is mainly due to the combined effects of solar maximum and warm ENSO conditions on the wave mean flow interaction. These results show a nonlinear behavior of the extratropical stratosphere response to the combination of the two forcings and highlight the need to stratify with respect to ENSO and solar conditions and analyze the seasonal march throughout the winter...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} C 4 N 2 ice clouds {{observed}} in Titan's springtime <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> arise due to solid-state photochemistry occurring within extant ice cloud particles of HCN-HC 3 N mixtures.

40|$|Since 1980 the {{appearance}} of spring ozone depletion directly caused by chemical removal has significantly changed the pattern of vertical ozone distribution in the antarctic stratosphere, {{and has become a}} principal feature of a changing atmosphere. In recent years chemical ozone loss has also been found in the arctic stratosphere. Transient events like the presence of volcanic aerosols can additionally remove ozone in the lower <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Balloon-borne ozone observations and sun photometer measurements performed in the Antarctic and Arctic as well as satellite data are used to review interannual and seasonal changes in the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> For the arctic region tropospheric ozone and aerosol variations are briefly discussed.

30|$|A sudden stratospheric {{warming is}} a {{large-scale}} {{disruption of the}} wind and temperature fields of the wintertime <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> SSW are usually classified as major or minor, although a continuum of warmings states may occur (Coughlin and Gray 2009). A major SSW is one in which the zonal-mean eastward winds around the pole cap temporarily reverse to summer-like conditions and the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> warms so the NS temperature gradient is reversed from the normal wintertime situation. A minor warming is conventionally defined as one in which the temperature gradient reverses but the winds do not. Major SSW are primarily a northern hemisphere phenomena and occur approximately once or twice each winter. Only one major SSW has been observed in the southern hemisphere, in 2002 (e.g Krüger et al. 2005).|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} the Arctic <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is {{observed}} to be similar in many respects {{to that of the}} Antarctic <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> where an ozone hole has been identified. Most of the available chlorine (CHl and ClONO 2) was converted by reactions on polar stratospheric clouds to reactive ClO and Cl 2 O 2 thoroughout the Arctic polar vortex before midwinter. Reactive nitrogen was converted to HNO 3, and some, with spatial inhomogeneity, fell out of the stratosphere. These chemical changes ensured characteristic ozone losses of 10 to 15 percent at altitudes inside the polar vortex where polar stratospheric clouds had occurred. These local losses can translate into 5 to 8 percent losses in the vertical column abundance of ozone. As the amount of stratospheric chlorine inevitably increases by 50 percent over the next two decades, ozone losses recognizable as an ozone hole may well appear...|$|R

Some of the observed differences may be due to improper weighting of the ground-based network data, slowly changing planetary wave structure over the fixed station, of small inter-annual changes in meridional transport parameters. There is also some evidence which indicates that the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> at high latitudes may represent an important ozone storage resevoir which tends to compensate for large scale changes observed in the regions outside of the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Possible consequences of this are that the global trends derived from ground based ozone measurements may not be valid and furthermore that the current satellite techniques by themselves may be sufficient.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1991 Austral spring, volcanic aerosols from Mt. Pinatubo and Cerro Hudson were present in the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> of the Southern Hemisphere.

A layer of mature Mt. Pinatubo aerosols was identified near 21 km and a layer of fresh Cerro Hudson aerosols was identified near 12 km. This altitude separation of the Mt.

Below 15 km, the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> was subject to episodes of strong wave activity which transported the Cerro Hudson aerosols poleward and, after the middle of September, they became a persistent feature beneath the vortex.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{evolution of}} Saturn's polar atmospheric temperatures and hydrocarbon composition {{is derived from}} a decade of Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) 7 - 16 μm thermal infrared spectroscopy. We construct a near-continuous record of atmospheric variability poleward of 60 ^∘ from northern winter/southern summer (2004, L_s= 293 ^∘) through the equinox (2009, L_s= 0 ^∘) to northern spring/southern autumn (2014, L_s= 56 ^∘). The hot tropospheric polar cyclones and the hexagonal shape of the north polar belt are both persistent features throughout the decade of observations. The hexagon vertices rotated westward by ≈ 30 ^∘ longitude between March 2007 and April 2013, confirming {{that they are not}} stationary in the Voyager-defined System III longitude system as previously thought. The extended region of <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> stratospheric emission has cooled dramatically poleward of the sharp temperature gradient near 75 ^∘S, coinciding with a depletion in the abundances of acetylene and ethane, and suggestive of stratospheric upwelling with vertical wind speeds of w≈+ 0. 1 mm/s. This is mirrored by a general warming of the northern <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> and an enhancement in acetylene and ethane abundances that appears to be most intense poleward of 75 ^∘N, suggesting subsidence at w≈- 0. 15 mm/s. However, the sharp gradient in stratospheric emission expected to form near 75 ^∘N by northern summer solstice (2017, L_s= 90 ^∘) has not yet been observed, so we continue to await the development of a northern summer stratospheric vortex.

The reasons for observed seasonal and interannual variability and long-term changes are discussed. Differences between the hemispheres are identified and discussed {{in light of}} differing dynamical and chemical conditions. Since the mid- 1980 s, rapid chemical ozone loss has been recorded in the lower Antarctic stratosphere during the spring season. Using coordinated ozone soundings in some Arctic winters, similar chemical ozone loss rates have been detected related to periods of low temperatures. The currently observed cooling trend of the stratosphere, potentially caused by the increase of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, may further strengthen chemical ozone removal in the Arctic. However, the role of internal climate oscillations in observed temperature trends is still uncertain.
