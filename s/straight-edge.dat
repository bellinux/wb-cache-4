5|$|His {{character}} {{took on a}} {{more sinister}} direction on the November 27, 2009, episode of SmackDown when he revealed that he had converted Luke Gallows, who had previously been portrayed as the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the <b>straight-edge</b> lifestyle which had rid him of his mental troubles. Continuing to espouse his <b>straight-edge</b> philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted {{members of the audience}} to a <b>straight-edge</b> lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form the Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming <b>straight-edge</b> before refusing just before his head was to be shaved.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Punk joined Ring of Honor (ROH) as a face, {{but quickly}} became a heel in a feud with Raven that {{featured}} numerous variants of no disqualification matches. Their rivalry was rooted in Punk's <b>straight-edge</b> lifestyle, with him likening Raven to his alcoholic father; it lasted most of 2003 and {{was considered one of}} ROH's top feuds of the year. Their rivalry was settled at The Conclusion in November 2003, where Punk defeated Raven in a Steel Cage match. At the same time, Punk joined the wrestling promotion , later known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), in which he was paired with Julio Dinero as members of Raven's TNA alliance The Gathering.|$|E
25|$|The {{baseplate}} (sole plate) {{is generally}} circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) {{and may be}} used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router against the edge of the work, or via a <b>straight-edge</b> clamped across the work to obtain a straight cut. Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against a straight edge or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the torque of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.|$|E

50|$|The tools {{traditionally}} {{used for}} the part preparation process are very elementary: writing utensils (pencils of various graphite hardness, colored pencils, ink pens, felt tipped pens, electric and manual erasers, correction fluid and tape), office supplies (pencil sharpeners, staplers, staple removers, scissors, rulers, drafting templates, <b>straight-edges,</b> non-yellowing permanent and removable adhesive tapes, paper clips, packing tape, shipping materials, and property stamps). Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; binding machines (tape, coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software.|$|R
500|$|Küchemann {{and others}} at the RAE {{continued}} their work on the slender delta throughout this period, considering three basic shapes; the classic <b>straight-edge</b> delta, the [...] "gothic delta" [...] that was rounded outwards to appear like a gothic arch, and the [...] "ogival wing" [...] that was compound-rounded into the shape of an ogee. Each of these planforms had its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of aerodynamics. As they worked with these shapes, a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs.|$|E
2500|$|When [...] "Out of Step" [...] was rerecorded for the LP Out of Step, MacKaye {{inserted}} a spoken section explaining, [...] "This {{is not a}} set of rules..."

2500|$|Doubling {{the cube}} is the construction, using only a <b>straight-edge</b> and compass, {{of the edge}} of a cube that has twice the volume of a cube with a given edge. This is {{impossible}} because the cube root of 2, though algebraic, cannot be computed from integers by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking square roots. [...] This follows because its minimal polynomial over the rationals has degree3. This construction is possible using a straightedge with two marks on it and a compass.|$|E
5000|$|The flat-pattern {{method is}} where the entire pattern is drafted {{on a flat surface}} from measurements, using rulers, curves and <b>straight-edges.</b> A pattern maker would also use various tools such as a notcher, drill and awl to mark the pattern. Usually, flat {{patterning}} begins with the creation of a sloper or block pattern, a simple, fitted garment made to the wearer's measurements. For women, this will usually be a jewel-neck bodice and narrow skirt, and for men an upper sloper and a pants sloper. The final sloper pattern is usually made of cardboard or paperboard, without seam allowances or style details (thicker paper or cardboard allows repeated tracing and pattern development from the original sloper). Once the shape of the sloper has been refined by making a series of mock-up garments called toiles (UK) or muslins (US), the final sloper can be used in turn to create patterns for many styles of garments with varying necklines, sleeves, dart placements, and so on. The flat pattern drafting method is the most commonly used method in menswear; menswear rarely involves draping. There are many pattern making system available, but M. Muller & Sohn (...) is widely used for its accuracy and fit for different body figure.|$|R
5000|$|Skew bridges are not {{a recent}} invention, having been built on {{exceptional}} occasions since Roman times, but they were little understood and rarely used {{before the advent of}} the railway.One notable exception is an aqueduct, designed by British engineer Benjamin Outram, constructed in masonry and completed in 1798, which still carries the Ashton Canal at an angle of 45° over Store Street in Manchester. Outram's design is believed to be based on work done on the Kildare Canal in Ireland in 1787, in which William Chapman introduced the segmental oblique arch to the design of Finlay Bridge at Naas, employing an arch barrel based on a circular segment that is smaller than a semicircle and which was repeated by Thomas Storey in 1830 in the bridge carrying the Haggerleases branch of the Stockton and Darlington Railway over the River Gaunless near Cockfield, County Durham with a skew angle of 63° and a skew span of 42 ft, resulting in a clear span of 18 ft and a rise of 7 ft.The common method they all used was to clad the timber centring (also known as falsework) with planks, known as [...] "laggings", laid parallel with the abutments and carefully planed and levelled to approximate closely the required curve of the intrados of the arch.

2500|$|JBL's next {{on-screen}} rivalry {{was with}} CM Punk, the reigning World Heavyweight Champion. During the feud, JBL insulted Punk's <b>straight-edge</b> lifestyle, calling it [...] "boring". On the August 11 edition of Raw, JBL challenged Punk to a contest {{he claimed that}} Punk {{would not be able}} to win, which was revealed to be an alcohol drinking contest where he challenged Punk to drink a shot of Jack Daniel's whiskey to prove that he would do anything to remain champion.

2500|$|Stated this way, {{compass and}} {{straightedge}} constructions {{appear to be}} a parlour game, rather than a serious practical problem; but the purpose of the restriction is to ensure that constructions can be proven to be exactly correct, and is thus important to both drafting (design by both CAD software and traditional drafting with pencil, paper, <b>straight-edge</b> and compass) and the science of weights and measures, in which exact synthesis from reference bodies or materials is extremely important. One of the chief purposes of Greek mathematics was to find exact constructions for various lengths; for example, the side of a pentagon inscribed in a given circle. The Greeks could not find constructions for these three problems, among others: ...|$|E
2500|$|New Bedford {{has had a}} {{sporadic}} {{history of}} successful musicians. During the 1970s, the Tavares, a soul music group made up of five brothers from New Bedford, became a chart topping success with such songs as [...] "Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel" [...] and [...] "More Than a Woman". In 1999, the pop group LFO (Lyte Funky Ones), whose group member Harold [...] "Devin" [...] Lima is from New Bedford, had a hit single with their song [...] "Summer Girls". Have Heart, a <b>Straight-edge</b> hardcore band, were formed in New Bedford in 2002, before breaking up in 2009. Most recently, the hardcore punk band A Wilhelm Scream has gained some success, having {{been added to the}} 2005 Warped Tour lineup. New Bedford natives Hector Barros and Scott Ross were members of the hip-hop group Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, led by actor Mark Wahlberg. They achieved success with their 1991 single, Good Vibrations, which reached number one in the U.S., Sweden, and Switzerland. Josh Newton from the band Every Time I Die was born in New Bedford.|$|E
2500|$|Projective {{geometry}} is {{an elementary}} non-metrical form of geometry, {{meaning that it}} is not based on a concept of distance. In two dimensions it begins with the study of configurations of points and lines. That there is indeed some geometric interest in this sparse setting was first established by Desargues and others in their exploration of the principles of perspective art. In higher dimensional spaces there are considered hyperplanes (that always meet), and other linear subspaces, which exhibit the principle of duality. The simplest illustration of duality is in the projective plane, where the statements [...] "two distinct points determine a unique line" [...] (i.e. the line through them) and [...] "two distinct lines determine a unique point" [...] (i.e. their point of intersection) show the same structure as propositions. Projective geometry can also be seen as a geometry of constructions with a <b>straight-edge</b> alone. [...] Since projective geometry excludes compass constructions, there are no circles, no angles, no measurements, no parallels, and no concept of [...] It was realised that the theorems that do apply to projective geometry are simpler statements. For example, the different conic sections are all equivalent in (complex) projective geometry, and some theorems about circles can be considered as special cases of these general theorems.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{originally}} {{began as}} a <b>straight-edge</b> group, with all members abstaining from alcohol. The drinking culture of Korea is very powerful, and Seo struggled to stay alcohol-free in his freshman year of college and his mandatory military service, claiming to have even been nearly attacked for refusing to drink at one time. Despite violence problems in the <b>straight-edge</b> scene {{in many parts of}} the world, the Geeks are a non-violent band and have many friends who are alcoholic. Lead vocalist Seo draws an X on the back of his hands in marker to symbolize his <b>straight-edge</b> stance.|$|E
