This paper p resents the hospital sector changes in Greece over the last 20 years, emphasizing on the cost efficiency. We break down its historical developments into two periods: 1983 - 1999 and 2000 - 2008. From the historical review, i t is concluded that the system is cost inefficient, based on two components. First, a number of resources are idle, and second, part of hospital capacity is never used or misused. However, idle resources and unused <b>stand-by</b> <b>capacity</b> is not a sufficient condition to determine whether a public hospital is running below optimal cost efficiency level. Such a practice, could be an optimal (cost efficient) response by hospital managers to meet unexpected demand. This is an issue that need further research in order to investigate whether part of this inefficiency could be explained by the reserve capacity held by hospitals due to unexpected demand. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of hospital and community characteristics {{on the behavior}} of five dimensions of hospital output is examined in this article. These dimensions are the level of emergency <b>stand-by</b> <b>capacity,</b> total admissions, the diagnosis-mix of admissions and the hospital's 'style of practice' with regard to ancillary services and length of stay. A simultaneous equations model is estimated with data from a sample of 63 New England short-term general hospitals for 1970. The findings suggest that various types of short-term general hospitals have distinctive preferences for emergency capacity, volume, case mix and style of practice, and that style of practice may be more appropriately viewed as a rate of resource use per day. Specific findings of interest include the positive interdependence between protection against running out of emergency beds and length of stay, and between length of stay and ancillary service use. Hospitals that admit greater numbers of patients tend to treat more severely ill patients, and sicker patients tend to go to larger hospitals. Hospitals that provide more ancillary services tend to attract the more acutely ill patients. Relationships among other elements of the hospital's utility function represent trade-offs, i. e. substitution, in a constrained world. Among the exogenous factors, patient preferences and ability to pay have strong associations with the types of care provided by hospitals. Highly educated, high income communities, for example, tend to prefer risk averse, service intensive hospital output. Teaching hospitals are shown to prefer higher protection levels, service-intensive patterns of care, and higher admissions levels. Self-paying patients tend to be admitted for more discretionary types of diagnoses and to receive longer diagnosis-specific lengths of stay. A relatively greater supply of physician specialists in the market area is associated with increased use of ancillary services in the hospital. If replicated, these results have significant policy implications for reimbursing teaching hospitals; for defining accessibility of hospital care for the uninsured; for identifying the practice of 'skimming' by proprietary hospitals; and for specifying the role of community preferences in determining hospital performance, especially with respect to quality of care and level of emergency <b>stand-by</b> <b>capacity.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Specialty hospitals represent {{a small but growing}} segment of the health care industry. These hospitals specialize in providing care for certain conditions, such as cardiac care, or performing certain procedures, such as orthopedic surgery. Specialty hospitals are not an entirely new phenomenon, as children's and other types of specialty hospitals have existed for decades. Consequently, it is challenging to distinguish between the old and new types of specialty hospitals. One aspect that sets apart the newer genre of specialty hospitals is that many are owned, in part, by the physicians who work in them. Advocates contend that, because of their focused mission, specialty hospitals can provide high-quality specialty services more efficiently than general hospitals. Because specialty hospitals can tailor their facilities and resources to best fit the needs of certain types of patients, individuals treated in such hospitals may enjoy relatively greater convenience and comfort. Specialty hospitals may also offer physicians financial and work environment advantages. Advocates have stated that the focused mission and dedicated resources of specialty hospitals allow physicians to treat more patients than they could in general hospitals. Physicians may gain financially from this increased productivity. If they are part owners, physicians may also share in the financial gains that accrue to the hospital. Physicians in specialty hospitals may also have more control over patient scheduling and the purchasing of desired equipment. However, concerns have been raised by general hospitals and others in the health care community that specialty hospitals are siphoning off the most financially rewarding portions of general hospitals' business. Representatives of general hospitals contend that specialty hospitals concentrate on the most profitable procedures and serve patients that have fewer complicating conditions [...] leaving general hospitals with a sicker, higher-cost patient population. Part of the concern is that physician ownership in specialty hospitals creates incentives to concentrate on patients who are less sick than other patients with the same diagnosis, as a hospital is typically paid a fixed, lump-sum amount for treating someone with a given diagnosis. Hospitals can benefit financially by treating a disproportionate share of less ill patients because the payment amounts for these patients are not reduced to reflect the fact that fewer services are needed. Critics contend that this practice of drawing away a more favorable selection of patients makes it more financially difficult for general hospitals to fulfill their broad mission to serve all of a community's needs, including charity care, emergency services, and <b>stand-by</b> <b>capacity</b> to respond to community-wide disasters. In light of these concerns, Congress asked us to provide information on the prevalence of specialty hospitals, their characteristics in terms of ownership and patients treated, and the effect specialty hospitals have on the greater hospital communities in which they operate. We are preparing a comprehensive report to be issued later this year that will address these issues. This report provides available information on the (1) share of the national hospital market comprising specialty hospitals, (2) extent to which physicians have ownership interests in specialty hospitals, and (3) patients served by specialty hospitals compared with those served by general hospitals, in terms of illness severity. ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} power {{stations}} alongside the River Aire east of Castleford; Ferrybridge C, Eggborough and Drax.

40|$|Demand {{response}} is believed {{by some to}} become a major contributor towards system balancing in future electricity networks. Shifting or reducing demand at critical moments can {{reduce the need for}} generation capacity, help with the integration of renewables, support more efficient system operation and thereby potentially lead to cost and carbon reductions for the entire energy system. In this paper we review the nature of the response resource of consumers from different non-domestic sectors in the UK, based on extensive half hourly demand profiles and observed demand responses. We further explore the potential to increase the demand response capacity through changes in the regulatory and market environment. The analysis suggests that present demand response measures tend to stimulate <b>stand-by</b> generation <b>capacity</b> in preference to load shifting and we propose that extended response times may favour load based demand response, especially in sectors with significant thermal loads...|$|R
40|$|For large memory <b>capacities,</b> <b>stand-by</b> systems usually need a {{considerable}} amount of redundant hardware, {{not only because of the}} spare components, but for storing fault conditions and for carrying out the necessary reconfiguration. As alternatives, two methods of implementing fault tolerance by means of dynamic redundancy in random-access memories are proposed which allow the treatment of memory-chip faults at the interface of the memory. The memory reliability for both approaches is estimated by a simple model. These methods improve the reliability considerably compared to conventional memory fault tolerance methods, and the size of the units of reconfiguration can be tailored to the demands of the system user...|$|R
