The fungus produces the natural antibiotic strobilurinA, which was reported as a novel compound from this species in 1977; other <b>strobilurins</b> have since been found in other basidiomycete wood-rotting fungi, like Porcelain Mushroom for example. StrobilurinA {{is thought to be}} derived biosynthetically from the amino acid L-phenylalanine. In nature, the fungus secretes the chemical to prevent invasion by other fungi that challenge its nutrient source. It works by blocking electron transfer in the mitochondria, stopping respiration by binding to the ubihydroquinone oxidation center of the bc1 complex. This prevents the competing fungus from creating its own energy and inhibiting its growth at the earliest stages of the life cycle, the spore germination stage. The fungus is resistant to its own chemical because its ubihydroquinone has three amino acid residues that prevent the <b>strobilurins</b> from binding. Because of their sensitivity to light, and high vapor pressures that causes them to rapidly disappear when applied to the surface of a leaf, chemically unmodified <b>strobilurins</b> are not generally useful as fungicides for agricultural use. The strobilurin-derived compound azoxystrobin, ﬁrst made commercially available in 1996, was designed to overcome these limitations. It is the world's biggest-selling fungicide.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{assessment}} of the interactive effect of deficit irrigation and <b>strobilurin</b> application in improving tomato physiological and yield response under water shortage. A two-year field research (2011 and 2012) was carried out in southern Italy, on tomato grown under three irrigation regimes - full recovering of crop evapotranspiration (I 100), 50 % of full irrigation supply (I 50) and rainfed (I 0) - and with three fungicide treatments - control (F 0) without any fungicide; application of fungicides without <b>strobilurin</b> (F 1); application of a <b>strobilurin</b> based fungicide (Cabrio® Duo) (F 2). Plant water status, yield and quality parameters, biomass and yield water use efficiencies (B_WUE and Y_WUE), yield and biomass water response factors (Ky and Kby) were assessed. Water shortage significantly affected yield and quality response: as an average of the two years, a marketable yield decrement of 52. 7 and 80. 5 % was observed in I 50 and I 0 in respect to I 100 treatment, respectively, because of the reduction in both fruit weight and number. Fruit dry matter, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, firmness and redness showed an increase to the decline of water availability. <b>Strobilurin</b> based fungicide application increased total and marketable yield by 14. 2 % and 19. 1 %, respectively. In addition, <b>strobilurin</b> improved the plant water status under water shortage as a consequence of reduction in stomatal conductance. Deficit irrigation caused a decrease of B_WUE and Y_WUE, while the <b>strobilurin</b> application improved Y_WUE by 17 %. Kby and Ky on average were equal to 1. 11 and 1. 40, respectively, and were unaffected by fungicide treatments. These results indicated the potential benefits of using <b>strobilurin</b> based agrochemicals in tomato disease management, due to their complementary action in improving yield, WUE, and plant water status under water stress conditions...|$|R

500|$|Strobilurus tenacellus, {{commonly}} known as the pinecone cap, is a species of agaric fungus in the family Physalacriaceae. It is found in Asia and Europe, where it grows on the fallen cones of pine and spruce trees.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The major {{facilitator}} superfamily (MFS) drug transporter MgMfs 1 of {{the wheat}} pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola (Fuckel) J Schroeter {{is a potent}} multidrug transporter with high capacity to transport <b>strobilurin</b> fungicides in vitro. The data {{presented in this paper}} indicate that, in addition to the predominant cause of <b>strobilurin</b> resistance, cytochrome b G 143 A subsititution, MgMfs 1 can play a role in sensitivity of field strains of this pathogen to trifloxystrobin. RESULTS: In a major part of field strains of M. graminicola (collected in the Netherlands in 2004) containing the cytochrome b G 143 A substitution, the basal level of expression of MgMfs 1 was elevated as compared with sensitive strains lacking the G 143 A substitution. Induction of MgMfs 1 expression in wild-type isolates upon treatment with trifloxystrobin at sublethal concentrations proceeded rapidly. Furthermore, in disease control experiments on wheat seedlings, disruption mutants of MgMfs 1 displayed an increased sensitivity to trifloxystrobin.

Effects of {{triazole}} and <b>strobilurin</b> fungicide programmes, {{with and}} without late-season nitrogen fertiliser, on the baking quality of Malacca winter wheat. Journal of Cereal Science, 40 (1), 1 - 8. Field experiments were conducted over 3 years to study the effect of applying triazole and <b>strobilurin</b> fungicides on the bread-making quality of Malacca winter wheat. Averaged over all years {{the application of a}} fungicide programme increased yields, particularly when <b>strobilurin</b> fungicides were applied. Reductions in protein concentration, sulphur concentration, Hageberg falling number and loaf volumes also occurred as the amount of fungicide applied increased. However, there were no deleterious effects of fungicide application on sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sedimentation volumes, N:S ratios or dough rheology. Effects of fungicide application on bread-making quality were not product specific. Therefore, it appears that new mechanisms to explain <b>strobilurin</b> effects on bread-making quality {{do not need to be}} invoked. Where reductions in protein concentration did occur they could be compensated for by a late-season application of nitrogen either as granular ammonium nitrate at flag leaf emergence or foliar urea at anthesis.

Multiple regression analysis revealed that main effects of year, flour protein concentration and N:S ratio could explain 93 % of the variance in loaf volume caused by season, fungicide and nitrogen treatments.

No significant differences in total tuber yield based on N fertility were observed, although the high N rate decreased disease in Russet Burbank control plots in 2004.
