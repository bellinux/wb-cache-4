40|$|Avian chlamydiosis is an {{infectious}} disease of birds caused by gram-negative bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci. However, this disease can occure among other mammals including humans. Chlamydiosis often presents as an inapparent infection, especially in older birds. During stressful conditions (deficient diet, transportation, great population density in small spaces, etc.) and comorbidity, however, the birds usually begin to either present with the clinical signs of chlamydiosis, or secrete many causative agents to the environment. Depending on the serotype of the causative agent, {{and the type}} and age of the host, the disease usually causes systemic disorders, and is often fatal. The affected birds present with lethargy, fever, typical yellow-green discharge from the eyes and nose, diarrhea, anorexia and the weight lost. Bearing capacity is reduced. Autopsy findings show hepatomegaly with necrotic foci, splenomegaly and fibrinous inflammation of the pericardium, peritoneum and air sacs.

40|$|Optical {{functions}} of organic dyes, e. g., fluorescence or photochromism, tend to degrade by light irradiation, which causes a short lifetime of photonic devices. Self-healing of optical functions is attainable by metabolizing bleached molecules with nonirradiated ones. A polydimethylsiloxane elastomer {{provides a useful}} matrix for dye molecules, since its flexible structure with nano-sized intermolecular <b>spaces</b> allows <b>dye</b> diffusion from a reservoir to an operation region. Swelling the elastomer with a suitable solvent promotes both dissolution and diffusion of dye molecules. This self-healing function was demonstrated by an experiment in which a photochromic elastomer exhibited improved durability against a repeated coloring-decoloring process...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} an {{attempt was made}} to explore the potential of using flexible textile structures to replace the currently used commercial foam. Three flexible textile structures (A, B and C) were designed in three dimensional (3 D) structure using Shima Seiki flatbed machine. Each fabric consisted of 3 layers, 2 external (face and back) and one internal layer. Fabric A consisted of mercerized cotton (<b>space</b> <b>dyed)</b> and Elastane external layers, whereas ballistic nylon internal layer. Fabrics B and C were prepared using Dyneema (untwisted) and Elastane external layers and Dyneema (untwisted) internal layer, but with different structures. These textile structures were analysed for their collision protection using the technique of &# 039;drop test&# 039;. The test was based on principle of energy absorption by the textile structure due to the impact of a hard surface with them. It was assumed that the higher is the energy absorbed by the textile structure, the smaller will be the impact to the wearer. It was found that the 3 D structures can provide equivalent amount of impact protection as the commercial foam (Sample D). The flexible structures recover easily with the body movement, and provide a high level of comfort. The methods of drop-test including the results are discussed in this paper. The findings of this study suggested that an equivalent level of protection can be achieved with the use of 3 D textile structures and higher amount of comfort for the rugby players. Hence, the 3 D textile structures can be used as an alternative material to replace the commercial closed foam currently in use in the shoulder pad to achieve similar protection and improved thermal comfort...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental and theoretical studies of quenching and enhancement of fluorescence by colloidal solutions of nanoparticles and arrays of nanostructures on solid substrates — nanochips. The literature data and the results of authors’ own studies on the possibility of fluorescence signal manipulation in the presence of gold and silver nanostructures were shown. Mathematical modeling and comparative investigation of the samples with high-conductive metal nanostructures as active elements for the regulation of fluorescence signal were also performed. Nanochips samples were fabricated by thermal annealing of highly conductive gold and silver island films. Using developed novel laser-based fluorometer FluorotestNano it was shown that fluorescence intensity of Rhodamine 6 G dye can be enhanced up to 23 times near gold nanostructures by <b>spacing</b> the <b>dye</b> from the nanoparticle at the distance of 20 nm using SiO 2 coating. Using high-conductive metal nanostructures to adjust the fluorescence signal opens promising new directions in biochemical studies, such as increasing the sensitivity of fluorescence methods, development of new biosensors, fluorescence microscopy techniques and medical diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the orientational order {{parameter}} of dissolved dichroic dyes are reported for two smectic-A liquid crystals that tilt {{in the presence}} of an in-plane electric field without any decrease in the layer <b>spacing.</b> The <b>dye</b> {{order parameter}} is determined by measuring the anisotropic absorption of linearly polarized light. Different dyes are used and measurements are also performed on a smectic liquid crystal that tilts with the expected layer contraction to check how closely the measurements reflect the order parameter of the liquid crystal. The variation of the dye order parameter with electric field is in accordance with the recently proposed model of azimuthal disorder of the tilt angle direction, but the surprising finding is that the local dye orientational order parameter is significantly lower than for the smectic liquid crystal that tilts with the expected layer contraction. This suggests that another mechanism might be contributing significantly to the smectic order, one possibility of which is the tendency for different parts of these siloxane-containing molecules to segregate within each layer. Another possible explanation is that the azimuthal disorder is due to a modulated phase with a high enough density of defects to decrease the value of the local order parameter...|$|R
40|$|Since 1986, I {{have been}} {{pursuing}} my passionate interest in handwoven velvet, both practically and academically. By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain velvets have been woven {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two simple warp tensioning systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for the pile warp. 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (<b>spaced</b> <b>dyed)</b> pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 striped warps mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of velvet (cut and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (cut or uncut). All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of the pile warp, which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose pile uniformly covers the whole fabric surface. 3 This velvet can be woven on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation warp and pile warp separately tensioned with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. Solid velvet pile warps can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all the pile warps are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two pile shafts and two pile warps, one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single pile warp in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, the pile shafts 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of the two pile shafts. This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each pile shaft separately on uniformly tensioned warp beams or with live weights. Without separate tension, a recurring build-up of slack pile ends will interfere with smooth weaving and an even pile height...|$|R
40|$|The work {{detailed}} {{in this thesis}} focuses on three separate projects. The first explored the effect of introducing conjugated π-bridges equipped with different solubilizing groups, and anchoring groups on the overall performance of asymmetrical squaraines; namely by enhancing their high energy absorption, reducing dye aggregation as well as electron recombination from the mesoporous TiO 2 into the acceptors in the electrolyte. The second project looked into the effect of molecular iodine, a species that can be generated locally near the TiO 2 surface, on enhancing unwanted electron recombination from TiO 2 into the electrolyte. The synthesis of a squaraine-based dye containing a long, fluorinated alkyl chain, which have low binding affinity to iodine, positioned near the TiO 2 surface can create a pseudo blocking layer which prevents acceptors in the electrolyte, namely molecular iodine, from capturing an injected electron from TiO 2. The third project consisted of the incorporation of large, out-of-plane cyclic groups in the indole region of a donor- π-acceptor dye {{with the goal of}} studying the modification’s effect on <b>dye</b> <b>spacing,</b> aggregation, and possible excited state quenching.

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of solute concentration {{are needed to}} conduct studies of solute transport process in unsaturated soil. In this paper we present a method of obtaining accurate measurements in and <b>space</b> using <b>dye</b> infiltration and image analysis. The soil color {{was related to the}} dye concentration in the soil (C-s) using 74 small calibration samples. The overall root mean square error (RMSE) 0. 057 g dm(- 3), however, for C-s < 0. 75 g dm(- 3), the RMSE was only 0. 032 g dm(- 3). Variability of the concentration estimates at the pixel scale could be reduced by using an average filter. We used the calibration relationship during four infiltration experiments in a 0. 95 by 0. 975 m large Plexiglas Hele-Shaw cell to calculate dye concentration patterns. Using the first and second order time moments, the dispersivity lambda was calculated for nine different artificial column widths, from 0. 0014 (local-scale) to 0. 72 m (meso-scale). The horizontally averaged lambda proved to be identical for column widths from 0. 0014 to 0. 045 m. For larger scales, lambda gradually increased. We noticed that the two experiments with higher flow (1 and 2) and the two experiments with lower flow (3 and 4) showed an almost identical variation of meso-scale lambda with depth. We concluded that above a specific critical value of theta (similar to 0. 22 m(3) m(- 3)), solute mixing is enhanced, leading to a lower lambda, and that solute transport can be described as a convective-dispersive process. When theta is lower than this critical level, part of the porosity is deactivated and mixing between individual stream tubes decreases, which implies that transport then occurs as a stochastic-convective process...|$|R
40|$|The global {{configuration}} of individual, surface-adsorbed molecules {{of the giant}} muscle protein titin, labeled with rhodamine conjugates, was followed with confocal microscopy. Fluorescence-emission intensity was reduced because of self-quenching caused by the close <b>spacing</b> between rhodamine <b>dye</b> molecules that formed dimers. In the presence of chemical denaturants, fluorescence intensity increased, reversibly, up to 5 -fold in a fast reaction; the kinetics were followed at the single-molecule level. We show that dimers formed in a concentrated rhodamine solution dissociate when exposed to chemical denaturants. Furthermore, titin denaturation, followed by means of tryptophan fluorescence, is dominated by a slow reaction. Therefore, the rapid fluorescence change of the single molecules reflects the direct action of the denaturants on rhodamine dimers rather than the unfolding/refolding of the protein. Upon acidic denaturation, which we have shown not to dissociate rhodamine dimers, fluorescence intensity change was minimal, suggesting that dimers persist because the unfolded molecule has contracted into a small volume. The highly contractile nature of the acid-unfolded protein molecule derives from {{a significant increase in}} chain flexibility. We discuss the potential implications this finding could have for the passive mechanical behavior of striated muscle...|$|R
40|$|Busca-se em pesquisas e estudos avaliar a capacidade de adaptação e selamento entre a conexão implante/intermediário de diferentes sistemas de implantes odontológicos. Observou-se recentemente que implantes com {{abutments}} retidos com parafusos, diversos fenômenos como afrouxamento e fratura do parafuso, rotação e fratura do abutment com penetração bacteriana nas câmaras internas dos implantes, acontece como conseqüência da desadaptação interface implante/abutment. É descrito ao nível desta região um pequeno espaço microgap, fator relevante para remodelamento da crista óssea e longevidade da saúde dos tecidos moles periimplantares. O propósito do estudo foi investigar o extravasamento da solução do corante azul de Evan em três tipos de implantes e seus respectivos intermediários, durante um período de seis (6) dias, a cada vinte e quatro (24) horas, com intervalo em cento e vinte (120) horas, através da agitação proporcionada por uma mesa agitadora. Para tal, foram utilizados trinta (30) implantes, dez (10) de cada tipo, com seus respectivos intermediários protéticos, minipilares, sendo o Grupo Um (1) de implantes Hexágono Externo (HE), Grupo dois (2) de Hexágono Interno (HI) e Grupo três (3) de Cone Morse (CM). No interior de cada implante foi pipetado volume ou quantidade proporcional ao seu espaço interno uma solução de corante azul de Evan. Após a colocação do corante no interior dos implantes, os abutments ou intermediários foram acoplados e aparafusados com torque de vinte (20) Ncm, através do torquímetro de Gauge (Tohnichi), e estes depositados individualmente em micro tubos de cor âmbar na condição de intermediários voltados para baixo. Segui/se imediatamente a colocação de (1) ml de água deionizada. A seguir os tubos foram fechados hermeticamente e posicionados numa mesa suporte para microtubos e foram armazernados por 24 horas, sem agitação. Posteriormente foram agitados por 10 minutos com movimentos uniformes em mesa agitadora e a partir deste momento iniciou/se a coleta de uma pequena quantidade de água de cada micro tubo onde por sua vez estas amostras foram analisadas por absorbância através do método de fotometria, espectrofotometria, onde mostraram o extravasamento da solução do corante azul de Evan nos sistemas de implantes usados. Do inicio da coleta das amostras no tempo de (24 horas) até a condição no terceiro dia ou setenta e duas horas, os três sistemas não mostraram/se alterações estatisticamente significantes. A partir do tempo quarto dia ou 96 h., no sistema do grupo Cone Morse, revelou diferenças estatisticamente significantes entre o grupo HE e HI. Os resultados foram tabulados e o teste estatístico Anova há dois critérios e aplicados a eles o teste Tukey comparação entre todos, com o nível de significância de p< 0. 05. Os resultados do teste de vinte e quatro (24); quarenta e oito (48), setenta e duas (72), não havendo diferenças estatisticamente significantes, ao passo que no período de noventa e seis (96) e cento e quarenta e quatro(144) horas, mostrou a solução do corante de azul de Evan do sistema CM, o xtravasamento estatisticamente significante maior do que nos grupos HE e HI. Conclui/se, portanto, que houve extravasamento nos três sistemas na condição inicial. No tempo 96 houve um maior extravasamento do sistema CM perpetuando até o final do experimento, mostrando-se estaticamente diferente em relação aos sistemas HE e HI. Research {{and studies}} seek {{to evaluate the}} capacity of adaptation and sealing between the implant-intermediate connections of different dental implant systems. It has recently been observed that in implants with screw-retained abutments, various phenomena, such as screw 4 loosening and fracture, rotation and fracture of the abutment with bacterial penetration into the internal chambers of the implants have occurred {{as a result of}} maladaptatation at the implant-abutment interface. At the level of this region, a small space known as a microgap is described, and is a relevant factor in remodeling of the crestal bone and peri-implant soft tissue health in the long term. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the extravasation of Evans blue dye solution in three types of implants and their respective intermediates during a period of six (6) days, every twenty-four (24) hours, with an interval in one hundred and wenty (120) hours, by means of agitation provided by an agitating table. To do this, thirty (30) implants were used, ten (10) of each type, with their respective prosthetic intermediates and mini-abutments, divided into groups as follows: Group One (1) External Hexagon implants (EH), Group Two (2) Internal Hexagon (IH) and Group three (3) Morse Cone (MC). Into the interior of each implant, Evans blue dye solution was inserted with a pipette in a volume or quantity proportional to its internal <b>space.</b> After the <b>dye</b> was put into the implants, the abutments or intermediates were coupled and the screws tightened to a torque of twenty (20) Ncm, with a Gauge torque meter (Tohnichi), and they were individually deposited in amber-colored microtubes positioned so that the intermediates faced downwards. This was immediately followed by the placement of (1) ml of deionized water. Next, the tubes were hermetically closed and placed on a table with a microtube holder and stored for 24 hours, without agitation. Afterwards they were agitated for 10 minutes on an agitating table making uniform movements and from then on, a small quantity of water began to be collected from each microtube, where in turn these samples were analyzed by absorbance method of photometry, spectrophotometry, in which they showed the extravasation of the Evans blue dye solution in the implant system used. From the beginning of sample collection at the time of (24 hours) until the condition on the third day or at seventy-two hours, the three systems showed no statistically significant alterations. From the fourth day, or at the time of 96 h., in the Morse Cone Group system, statistically significant differences were revealed between Group EH and IH. The results were tabulated and the ANOVA statistical test for two criteria and the Tukey test were applied for comparison among all the groups, with a level of significance of p< 0. 05. The results of the twenty-four-hour (24); forty-eight (48), seventy-two hour tests (72), there were no statistically significant differences, whereas in the period of ninety-six (96) and one hundred and forty-four (144) hours, showed the Evans blue dye solution extravasation from the MC system to be greater with statistical significance than in Groups EH and IH. It was therefore concluded that there was extravasation in the three systems in the initial condition. At the time of 96 there was greater extravasation from the MC system, which was perpetuated up to the end of the experiment, showing it to differ statistically in comparison with the EH and IH systems...|$|R
