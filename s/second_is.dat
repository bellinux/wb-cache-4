5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions.

Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the <b>second</b> <b>is</b> true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
