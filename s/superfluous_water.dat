60|$|As he spoke, they {{advanced}} about {{a hundred}} yards up the brawling stream, until the little vale through which it flowed, making a very sudden turn to one side, showed them the Red Pool, the <b>superfluous</b> <b>water</b> of which formed the rivulet itself.|$|E
60|$|Thus assured, the {{visitors}} continued their meal with equanimity, {{regardless of the}} storm that soon began to rage with great fury, insomuch that the door required a prop to keep it up and rain began to trickle in through crevices in the roof and drop here and there upon the party. When one such drop chanced to fall on old Dobelle's nose, his younger son arose, and, fastening a piece of birch-bark to the rafters, caught the drop and trained it with its followers to flow towards an unoccupied place in one corner, which, being accidentally lower {{than the rest of}} the floor, formed a convenient receptacle for <b>superfluous</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{country in}} the {{neighborhood}} of Babylon, extending from the river on either hand was in general level and low, and subject to inundations. One of the sovereigns of the country, a queen named Nitocris, had formed the grand design of constructing an immense lake, to take off the <b>superfluous</b> <b>water</b> in case of a flood, and thus prevent an overflow. She also opened a great number of lateral and winding channels for the river, wherever the natural disposition of the surface afforded facilities for doing so, and the earth which was taken out in the course of these excavations was employed in raising the banks by artificial terraces, such as are made to confine the Mississippi at New Orleans, and are there called levees.[B] The object of Nitocris in these measures was two-fold. She wished, in the first place, to open all practicable channels for the flow of the water, and then to confine the current within the channels thus made. She also wished to make the navigation of the stream as intricate and complicated as possible, so that, while the natives of the country might easily find their way, in boats, to the capital, a foreign enemy, if he should make the attempt, might be confused and lost. These were the rivers of Babylon on the banks of which the captive Jews sat down and wept when they remembered Zion.|$|E

60|$|Turn we now to another, a more distant, and a wilder scene. Near {{the bleak}} shores of Hudson's Straits there flows a river which forms an outlet to the <b>superfluous</b> <b>waters</b> of the almost unknown {{territory}} lying between the uninhabited parts of Labrador and that tract of desert land which borders Hudson's Bay on the east, {{and is known}} to the fur-traders by the appellation of East Main. This river is called the Caniapuscaw, and discharges itself into Ungava Bay.|$|R
60|$|At {{the present}} day, it is true, both the prickly-pear cactus and the American agave (which {{the world at}} large insists upon {{confounding}} with the aloe, a member of a totally distinct family) have spread themselves in an apparently wild condition over all the rocky coasts both of Southern Europe and of Northern Africa. The alien desert weeds have fixed their roots firmly in the sunbaked clefts of Ligurian Apennines; the tall candelabrum of the western agave has reared its great spike of branching blossoms (which flower, not once in a century, as legend avers, but once in some fifteen years or so) on all the basking hillsides of the Mauritanian Atlas. But for the origin, and therefore for the evolutionary history, of either plant, we must look away from the shore of the inland sea to the arid expanse of the Mexican desert. It was there, among the sweltering rocks of the Tierras Calientes, that these ungainly cactuses first learned to clothe themselves in prickly mail, to store in their loose tissues an abundant supply of sticky moisture, and to set at defiance the persistent attacks of all external enemies. The prickly pear, in fact, is a typical instance of a desert plant, as the camel is a typical instance of a desert animal. Each lays itself out to endure the long droughts of its almost rainless habitat by drinking as much as it can when opportunity offers, hoarding up the <b>superfluous</b> <b>water</b> for future use, and economising evaporation by every means in its power.|$|E
6000|$|... [35] This {{view of the}} {{formation}} of [...] "till" [...] is that adopted, by Dr. Geikie, and upheld by almost all the Scotch, Swiss, and Scandinavian geologists. The objection however is made by many eminent English geologists, including the late Mr. Searles V. Wood, Jun., that mud ground off the rocks cannot remain beneath the ice, forming sheets of great thickness, because the glacier cannot at the same time grind down solid rock and yet pass over the surface of soft mud and loose stones. But this difficulty will disappear if we consider the numerous fluctuations in the glacier with increasing size, and the additions it must have been constantly receiving as the ice from one valley after another joined together, and at last produced an ice-sheet covering the whole country. The grinding power is the motion and pressure of the ice, and the pressure will depend on its thickness. Now the points of maximum thickness must have often changed their positions, and the result would be that the matter ground out in one place would be forced into another place where the pressure was less. If there were no lateral escape for the mud, it would necessarily support the ice over it just as a water-bed supports the person lying on it; and when there was little drainage water, and the ice extended, say, twenty miles in every direction from a given part of a valley where the ice was of less than the average thickness, the mud would necessarily accumulate at this part simply because there was no escape for it. Whenever the pressure all round any area was greater than the pressure on that area, the débris of the surrounding parts would be forced into it, and would even raise up the ice to give it room. This is a necessary result of hydrostatic pressure. During this process the <b>superfluous</b> <b>water</b> would no doubt escape through fissures or pores of the ice, and would leave the mud and stones in that excessively compressed and tenacious condition in which the [...] "till" [...] is found. The unequal thickness and pressure of the ice above referred to would be a necessary consequence of the inequalities in the valleys, now narrowing into gorges, now opening out into wide plains, and again narrowed lower down; and it is just in these openings in the valleys that the [...] "till" [...] is said to be found, and also in the lowlands where an ice-sheet must have extended for many miles in every direction. In these lowland valleys the [...] "till" [...] is both thickest and most wide-spread, {{and this is what we}} might expect. At first, when the glaciers from the mountains pushed out into these valleys, they would grind out the surface beneath them into hollows, and the drainage-water would carry away the débris. But when they spread all over the surface from sea to sea, and there was little or no drainage water compared to the enormous area covered with ice, the great bulk of the débris must have gathered under the ice wherever the pressure was least, and the ice would necessarily rise as it accumulated. Some of the mud would no doubt be forced out along lines of least resistance to the sea, but the friction of the stone-charged [...] "till" [...] would be so enormous that it would be impossible for any large part of it to be disposed of in this way.|$|E
60|$|After sewing the book, {{she would}} {{cut out a}} piece of morocco paper, or blue paper, or gilt paper, and {{sometimes}} a piece of morocco itself, just the size of the book when open, for the cover. Then, after spreading out a large newspaper upon the table, so as to keep the table clean, she would lay down the cover with the handsome side down, and then spread the paste over the other side, very carefully, with a brush which she made from the end of a quill. Then she would put the back edge of the book down upon this cover, and lay it over, first on one side, and then on the other, and pat it down well with a towel; and that would make the cover stick to the outside leaves of the book, and cover up and hide the great stitches in the back, by which the leaves had been sewed together. Then she would take the book before her, and begin at the beginning. First, she would lay down the cover and put upon it a piece of tin, made to fill papers with, to keep it down smooth. Then she would lay the next leaf down upon the tin. The leaf was to have the title-page upon it, and so there were to be no pictures pasted to it. She would, therefore, lay this down upon the tin, and then, with one of her large paint brushes, dipped in the water, she would wet it all over, patting it afterwards with a towel, to take up all the <b>superfluous</b> <b>water.</b> Then she would take up the tin, and put the title-leaf down upon the cover, and put the tin over it to keep it down smooth. The next leaf would be for pictures, and, after pasting pictures upon it, on both sides, she would lay it down upon the tin, and with her brush she would wet all those parts which had not been pasted. Then patting it with a dry towel, or soft cloth, to dry it as much as possible, she would put it under the tin. In this way she would go on regularly, through the book, pasting pictures upon all the pages, and wetting with her brush all those parts of the paper which had not been wet by the paste, and putting the tin over the leaves as fast as she finished them, to keep them all smooth. Then, when she had got through, she would put the whole away between two boards, to dry; the weight of the paper board being sufficient to keep the leaves all smooth. The next morning when she came to look at her book, she generally found it nearly dry; and then she would put some heavy weight upon the upper board, to press it harder. When it was perfectly dry, she took out the book, and pared off the edges, all around, with a sharp knife and a rule. Then she would get her paint-box, and colour all the pictures beautifully, and make borders about them, in bright colours, and print a handsome title-page with her pen, and write the name of the boy in it whom she meant to give it to.|$|E

60|$|We took a {{path that}} leads from the hotel across the fields, and, coming into a wood, crosses the Rothay by a one-arched bridge and passes the village church. The Rothay is very swift and {{turbulent}} to-day, and hurries along with foam-specks on its surface, filling its banks from brim to brim,--a stream perhaps twenty feet wide, perhaps more; for I am willing that the good little river should have all it can fairly claim. It is the St. Lawrence of several of these English lakes, through which it flows, and carries off their <b>superfluous</b> <b>waters.</b> In its haste, and with its rushing sound, it was pleasant both to see and hear; and it sweeps by {{one side of the}} old churchyard where Wordsworth lies buried,--- the side where his grave is made. The church of Grasmere is a very plain structure, with a low body, on one side of which is a small porch with a pointed arch. The tower is square and looks ancient; but the whole is overlaid with plaster of a buff or pale yellow hue. It was originally built, I suppose, of rough shingly stones, as many of the houses hereabouts are now, and, like many of them, the plaster is used to give a finish. We found the gate of the churchyard wide open; and the grass was lying on the graves, having probably been mowed yesterday. It is but a small churchyard, and with few monuments of any pretension in it, most of them being slate headstones, standing erect. From the gate at which we entered, a distinct foot-track leads to the corner nearest the riverside, and I turned into it by a sort of instinct, the more readily as I saw a tourist-looking man approaching from that point, and a woman looking among the gravestones. Both of these persons had gone by the time I came up, so that J----- and I were left to find Wordsworth's grave all by ourselves.|$|R
60|$|As it {{has been}} mentioned, the {{existence}} of the venerable convent of St. Bernard dates from a very remote period of Christianity. It stands on the very brow of the precipice which forms the last steep ascent in mounting to the Col. The building is a high, narrow, but vast, barrack-looking edifice, built of the ferruginous stone of the region, having its gable placed toward the Valais, and its front stretching {{in the direction of the}} gorge in which it stands. Immediately before its principal door, the rock rises in an ill-shapen hillock, across which runs the path to Italy. This is literally the highest point of the pass, as the building itself is the most elevated habitable abode in Europe. At this spot, the distance from rock to rock, spanning the gorge, may be a hundred yards, the wild and reddish piles rising on each side for more than a thousand feet. These are merely dwarfs, however, among their sister piles, several of which, in plain view of the convent, reach to the height of eternal snow. This point in the road attained, the path began immediately to descend, and the drippings of a snow-bank before the convent door, which had resisted the greatest heat of the past summer, ran partly into the valley of the Rhone, and partly into Piedmont; the waters, after a long and devious course through the plains of France and Italy, meeting again in the common basin of the Mediterranean. The path, on quitting the convent, runs between the base of the rocks on its right and a little limpid lake on its left, the latter occupying nearly the entire cavity of the valley of the gorge. It then disappears between natural palisades of rock, at the other extremity of the Col. This is the point where the <b>superfluous</b> <b>waters</b> of the lake find their outlet, descending swiftly, in a brawling little brook, on the sunny side of the Alps. The frontier of Italy is met on the margin of the lake, a long musket-shot from the abode of the Augustines, and near the site of a temple that the Romans had raised in honor of Jupiter, in his attribute of director of storms.|$|R

60|$|As soon as {{the others}} saw that I had managed to light the lamp, we bundled Alphonse into the farther end of the canoe with a threat which calmed him down wonderfully, that if he would insist upon making the {{darkness}} hideous with his cries we would put him out of suspense by sending him to join the Wakwafi and wait for Annette in another sphere, and began to discuss the situation {{as well as we}} could. First, however, at Good's suggestion, we bound two paddles mast-fashion in the bows so that they might give us warning against any sudden lowering of the roof of the cave or waterway. It was clear to us that we were in an underground river or, as Alphonse defined it, 'main drain', which carried off the <b>superfluous</b> <b>waters</b> of the lake. Such rivers are well known to exist {{in many parts of the}} world, but it has not often been the evil fortune of explorers to travel by them. That the river was wide we could clearly see, for the light from the bull's-eye lantern failed to reach from shore to shore, although occasionally, when the current swept us either to one side or the other, we could distinguish the rock wall of the tunnel, which, as far as we could make out, appeared to arch about twenty-five feet above our heads. As for the current itself, it ran, Good estimated, at least eight knots, and, fortunately for us, was, as is usual, fiercest in the middle of the stream. Still, our first act was to arrange that one of us, with the lantern and a pole there was in the canoe, should always be in the bows ready, if possible, to prevent us from being stove in against the side of the cave or any projecting rock. Umslopogaas, having already dined, took the first turn. This was absolutely, with one exception, all that we could do towards preserving our safety. The exception was that another of us took up a position in the stern with a paddle by means of which it was possible to steer the canoe more or less and to keep her from the sides of the cave. These matters attended to, we made a somewhat sparing meal off the cold buck's meat (for we did not know how long it might have to last us), and then feeling in rather better spirits I gave my opinion that, serious as it undoubtedly was, I did not consider our position altogether without hope, unless, indeed, the natives were right, and the river plunged straight down into the bowels of the earth. If not, it was clear that it must emerge somewhere, probably on the other side of the mountains, and in that case all we had to think of was to keep ourselves alive till we got there, wherever 'there' might be. But, of course, as Good lugubriously pointed out, on the other hand we might fall victims to a hundred unsuspected horrors -- or the river might go on winding away inside the earth till it dried up, in which case our fate would indeed be an awful one.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 16 th Mar 2018. In recent years, England and Wales have {{suffered}} droughts. This unusual situation defies the common {{belief that the}} British climate provides abundant water resources and has prompted the regulatory authorities to impose bans on <b>superfluous</b> uses of <b>water.</b> Furthermore, {{a large percentage of}} households in England consume unmetered water which is detrimental to water saving efforts. Given this context, we estimate the shadow price of water using a panel data from reports published by the Office of Water Services (Ofwat) for the period 1996 to 2010 (three regulatory periods). These shadow prices are derived from a parametric multi-output multi-input input distance function characterized by a translog technology. Following O'Donnell and Coelli (2005), we use a Bayesian econometric framework in order to impose regularity – monotonicity and curvature – conditions on a high-flexible technology. Consequently, our results can be interpreted at the firm level without requiring the need to base analysis on the averages. Our estimations offer guidance for regulation purposes and provide an assessment of how the water supply companies deal with water losses under each regulatory period. The relevance of the study is quite general as water scarcity is a problem that will become more important with population growth and the impact of climate change...|$|R
40|$|Several {{feedforward}} artificial {{neural networks}} with error back-propagation {{were trained to}} predict corn yield {{as a function of}} the timing and volume of water applications. One set of artificial neural networks (ANNs) was developed using simulated water delivery and yield data. The growing season was divided into time intervals of equal length, and each ANN input node represented the total amount of water applied within each time interval. When an optimal time interval was found and sufficient training data were provided, independent tests of the trained ANNs gave r 2 correlations greater than 0. 90 between the predicted and actual yields. These correlations tended to approach a maximum value asymptotically as the size of the training data set increased. ^ In a similar fashion, another set of ANNs was developed using six years of field data from North Platte, Nebraska. An additional input node incorporated a measurement of soil moisture taken early in the growing season. Depending on which data were selected for training and testing, r 2 correlations between the predicted and actual relative yields were as high as 0. 89. An ANN analysis of crop sensitivity to drought as a function of growth stage produced values consistent with data in the literature. ^ An ANN crop production model can be used with three different iterative algorithms to allocate water among growth stages in a manner which is optimal or nearly optimal. The first of these algorithms begins with a <b>superfluous</b> amount of <b>water</b> allocated across the growing season and, with each iteration, decreases the water allocation to that stage in which the decrement will result in the least reduction in yield. The second of these algorithms begins with no water allocated across the growing season and, with each iteration, increases the water allocation to that stage in which the increment will result in the greatest return to yield. The third of these algorithms begins with an assumed seasonal supply of water applied at a constant rate across the growing season and, with each iteration, reallocates a marginal amount of water from a less productive stage to a more productive stage. ...|$|R
