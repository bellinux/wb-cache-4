25|$|Patients of {{different}} ethnic origin carry different HLA susceptibility alleles, of which, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ {{are involved in}} the pathogenesis of SS. For example, patients from Northern and Western Europe and from North America show a high prevalence of B8, DRw52, and DR3 genes. HLA class II alleles are associated with the presence of specific subsets of autoantibodies, rather than with the disease itself. Autoantibodies refer to the loss of B-cell tolerance leading to production of antibodies directed against diverse organ-specific and organ nonspecific antigens. Association between HLA and SS is restricted to patients with anti-SSA/Ro or anti-SSB/La antibodies. <b>Seropositivity</b> for anti-Ro and anti-La is associated with greater severity and longer duration of disease, and findings of their high abundance from the salivary glands of SS patients suggests their imperative role in the pathogenesis of SS.|$|E
25|$|In most of {{the current}} studies where {{positive}} correlations have been found between T. gondii antibody titers and certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders, T. gondii <b>seropositivity</b> tests are conducted after {{the onset of the}} examined disease or behavioral trait; that is, it is often unclear whether infection with the parasite increases the chances of having a certain trait or disorder, or if having a certain trait or disorder increases the chances of becoming infected with the parasite. Groups of individuals with certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders may share certain behavioral tendencies that increase the likelihood of exposure to and infection with T. gondii; as a result, it is difficult to confirm causal relationships between T. gondii infections and associated neurological disorders or behavioral traits. Provided there is in fact a causal link between T. gondii and schizophrenia, studies have yet to determine why some individuals with latent toxoplasmosis develop schizophrenia while others do not, however, some plausible explanations include differing genetic susceptibility, parasite strain differences, and differences in the route of the acquired T. gondii infection.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the advent}} of HIV testing of donor blood in the mid/later 1980s, ex. 1985's ELISA, the {{transmission}} of HIV during transfusion has dropped dramatically. Prior testing of donor blood only included testing for antibodies to HIV. However, due to latent infection (the [...] "window period" [...] in which an individual is infectious, but has not had time to develop antibodies) many cases of HIV seropositive blood were missed. The development of a nucleic acid test for the HIV-1 RNA has dramatically lowered the rate of donor blood <b>seropositivity</b> to about 1 in 3 million units.

50|$|Infection with Toxocara {{has been}} shown to stimulate atopic disease, {{specifically}} asthma. Infection with this parasite causes asthma-like symptoms such as accumulation of eosinophils, an inflammatory response, and production of IgE, the immunoglobulins associated with allergic responses. People with asthma are shown to have a higher prevalence of Toxocara <b>seropositivity.</b> Research suggests that the IgE production stimulated by infection with Toxocara may contribute to the onsets of allergic asthma in children. The effects of how parasite load, frequency of exposure, and influence of genetics affect this relationship between Toxocara infection and allergic asthma are still unknown, yet important in understanding how to prevent asthma and other atopic diseases around the globe.|$|E

This locus in part of the HLA A1-B8-DR3-DQ2 haplotype (markers are A1, CW7, B8, BfS, C4AQ0, C4B1, DR3, DQ2) therefore one study concluded that C4AQ0 could explain the increased infectivity to HIV.

50|$|Responding to {{indications}} of contamination, {{the group that}} reported an association of XMRV with CFS stated that its evidence was not restricted to nucleic acids, but also included antibody-based detection. Their study used murine leukaemia virus antibodies and antigens, not XMRV-specific reagents. Multiple studies have failed to detect XMRV by PCR or antibody-based methods. In one study, several samples that were PCR-negative contained antibodies that interacted with XMRV. However, the authors found that these antibodies were non-specific and also interacted with other viruses. Mayo Clinic researchers also reported on non-specific anti-XMRV antibodies. In another study, only low reactivity with XMRV antigens was found, with no differences between cases and controls. The authors noted that establishing a cutoff for <b>seropositivity</b> was impossible, as no positive sera are available. A study that included samples from the original XMRV-CFS report found no XMRV in patients or controls by PCR, antibody-based methods or viral culture. The authors discovered that some PCR reagents were contaminated {{with low levels of}} mouse nucleic acid but pointed out that this could not explain the high XMRV positive rates reported initially.|$|E

It is generally seronegative in JIA occurring below 10 years of age with a milder disease process and responds better to treatment. <b>Seropositivity</b> is rare in children with systemic JIA. Due to the greater number of joints affected by polyarticular JIA, as well as the tendency to worsen over time, polyarticular JIA must be treated aggressively.|$|E
