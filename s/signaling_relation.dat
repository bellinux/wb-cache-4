40|$|In this dissertation, {{we examine}} how {{coherence}} relations (relations between propositions, such as Concession and Purpose) are signalled in discourse, and what signals {{are used to}} indicate them. We also explore the relationship between coherence <b>relations</b> and their <b>signals,</b> and examine whether every <b>relation</b> is <b>signalled.</b> Traditionally, coherence <b>relations</b> {{are considered to be}} signalled only by discourse markers or DMs (but, however, therefore, etc.), and relations, based on the presence and absence of DMs, are classified as explicit and implicit relations, respectively (Renkema, 2004). The fact that relations without DMs are omnipresent in discourse (Taboada, 2009), and relations are interpreted {{even in the absence of}} DMs (Sanders & Noordman, 2000) leads us to hypothesize that the <b>signalling</b> of <b>relations</b> is achieved not only by DMs, but also by several other textual signals. We also hypothesize that every relation in a discourse is signalled, as a signal must be necessary for correct interpretation. We conduct a corpus study, using the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2002), which contains a collection of 385 Wall Street Journal articles annotated for rhetorical (coherence) relations. We examine each relation in the corpus (20, 123 relations in total), identify relevant <b>signals</b> for those <b>relations,</b> and finally, add a new layer of annotation to them, to include signalling information. Results from our corpus study show that the majority of relations (over 90 %) in a discourse are signalled (sometimes by multiple signals), and also that the majority of <b>signalled</b> <b>relations</b> (over 80 %) are indicated by signals other than DMs, such as lexical, semantic, syntactic and graphical features. The results also show that the signalling varies quantitatively and qualitatively for individual relations. These findings reinforce the psychological claim that there exist signals for every interpretable relation. They also suggest that the category of explicit relations needs to be expanded, to include <b>relations</b> which are <b>signalled</b> by any textual feature. The annotated corpus with signalling information can be used in psycholinguistic studies to determine how readers or hearers use <b>signals</b> to identify <b>relations.</b> It can also be used to develop discourse parsing systems to automatically categorize coherence relations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to explore the {{function}} of items of procedural vocabulary as <b>signals</b> of conceptual <b>relations</b> in scientific discourse. Procedural vocabulary, a general strategic vocabulary first studied by Widdowson � 1983), consists of lexical items which {{do not belong to}} any particular schema. They are highly context-dependent items with very little lexical content, which accounts for their important role in the elaboration of rhetorical functions related to the explanation of concepts. On the basis of a database of definitions, descriptions and classifications occurring in scientific discourse, we have established a taxonomy of procedural items in terms of the contextual relations that they set up between content-bearing words. These <b>relations</b> <b>signalled</b> by procedural vocabulary can be classified into nine major groups: identity, difference, inclusion, exclusion, process, function, spatial relations, feature relations, and quantity modification. An awareness of the vocabulary <b>signalling</b> these <b>relations</b> is part of the language user's communicative strategies which allow for the negotiation and comprehension of concepts in discourse...|$|R

This Recommendation also gives in Annex A examples of how the signalling network procedures may be applied to the mesh network representation.

40|$|Researchers {{from various}} {{disciplines}} {{are concerned with}} the study of affective phenomena, especially arousal. Expressed affective modulations, which reflect both an individual’s in-ternal state and external factors, are central to the commu-nicative process. Bone et al. developed a robust, unsuper-vised (rule-based) method which provides a scale-continuous, bounded arousal rating from the vocal signal. In this study, we investigate the joint-dynamics of child and psychologist vocal arousal in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic interac-tions. Arousal synchrony is assessed with multiple methods. Results indicate that children with higher ASD severity tend to lead the arousal dynamics more, seemingly because the children aren’t as responsive to the psychologist’s affective modulations. A vocal arousal model is also proposed which incorporates so-cial and conversational constructs. The model captures conver-sational <b>signal</b> <b>relations,</b> and is able to distinguish between high and low ASD severity at accuracies well-above chance...|$|R

40|$|A {{successful}} {{class of}} image denoising methods {{is based on}} Bayesian approaches working in wavelet representations. However, analytical estimates can be obtained only for particular combinations of analytical models of signal and noise, thus precluding its straightforward extension to deal with other arbitrary noise sources. In this paper, we propose an alternative non-explicit way {{to take into account}} the relations among natural image wavelet coefficients for denoising: we use support vector regression (SVR) in the wavelet domain to enforce these relations in the estimated <b>signal.</b> Since <b>relations</b> among the coefficients are specific to the signal, the regularization property of SVR is exploited to remove the noise, which does not share this feature. The specific <b>signal</b> <b>relations</b> are encoded in an anisotropic kernel obtained from mutual information measures computed on a representative image database. Training considers minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the estimated and actual probability functions of signal and noise in order to enforce similarity. Due to its non-parametric nature, the method can eventually cope with different noise sources without the need of an explicit re-formulation, as it is strictly necessary under parametric Bayesian formalisms. Results under several noise levels and noise sources show that: (1) the proposed method outperforms conventional wavelet methods that assume coefficient independence, (2) it is similar to state-of-the-art methods that do explicitly include these relations when the noise source is Gaussian, and (3) it gives better numerical and visual performance when more complex, realistic noise sources are considered. Therefore, the proposed machine learning approach can be seen as a more flexible (model-free) alternative to the explicit description of wavelet coefficient relations for image denoising...|$|R
