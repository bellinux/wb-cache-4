50|$|Under {{the terms}} of the {{contract}} from British Rail, Woodhams could not sell complete locomotives onwards that had been sold to them for scrap, unless payment of a levy was made. Woodham's set the price for each locomotive at its exact scrap value (each type had an exact metal content breakdown from BR, so this was simply taken and multiplied by that day's <b>scrap</b> <b>rate</b> for each metal component), plus the BR levy; with the sale price completed by the addition of Value Added Tax, initially set at 10% but raised to 15% in 1979. For most of the time that locomotives were being 'rescued' from Barry, it became accepted commercial practice by the company for preservation groups to pay a deposit for a particular locomotive, which was then protected/reserved until the group could pay for the locomotive in full and arrange transport.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contexts}} {{where the}} application requires extremely tight (narrow) tolerance ranges, the requirement may push slightly past {{the limit of}} {{the ability of the}} machining and other processes (stamping, rolling, bending, etc.) to stay within the range. In such cases, selective assembly is used to compensate for a lack of total interchangeability among the parts. Thus, for a pin that must have a sliding fit in its hole (free but not sloppy), the dimension may be spec'd as 12.00 +0 −0.01 mm for the pin, and 12.00 +.01 −0 for the hole. Pins that came out oversize (say a pin at 12.003mm diameter) are not necessarily scrap, but they can only be mated with counterparts that also came out oversize (say a hole at 12.013mm). The same is then true for matching undersize parts with undersize counterparts. Inherent in this example is that for this product's application, the 12 mm dimension does not require extreme accuracy, but the desired fit between the parts does require good precision (see the article on accuracy and precision). This allows the makers to [...] "cheat a little" [...] on total interchangeability in order to get more value out of the manufacturing effort by reducing the rejection rate (<b>scrap</b> <b>rate).</b> This is a sound engineering decision as long as the application and context support it. For example, for machines {{for which there is no}} intention for any future field service of a parts-replacing nature (but rather only simple replacement of the whole unit), this makes good economic sense. It lowers the unit cost of the products, and it does not impede future service work.|$|E

The Six Sigma DMAIC methodology consists of five phases which are Define (D), Measure (M), Analyse (A), Improve (I), and Control (C) respectively. This case study focuses on implementing Six Sigma methodologies into the motherboard repair process in to identify and minimize the variation exists in the process and subsequently reducing the associated scrap cost. As known, the original assembly process of motherboard is comparatively straightforward. However, the repair process of malfunction motherboard which requires troubleshooting of problem and replacement of electronic devices can be much more complicated and often end-up scrapping the whole set of motherboard itself. Realizing this great challenge, the DMAIC tools are mounted in this study to solve the underlying problem stated.

The reasons for this can be a variation in the properties of the semi-finished product, or wear phenomena on the forming machine itself or on the bending tools.

The classic FPR model {{considers}} production planning for single product, a perfect condition during the production run and a continuous inventory issuing policy. However, in real life manufacturing environments, {{in order to maximize}} machine utilization, vendors often make plan to produce m products in turn on a single machine.

40|$|AbstractThe use of sheet molding {{compounds}} (SMC) {{in diverse}} applications requires different specific material properties {{for each type}} of finished parts. These material properties have to be assured by a reliable quality control, which does not only have to be performed for the prefabricated SMC itself but also during the production process of the semi-finished material. This is of high importance because quality fluctuations and defects can already occur during the production of the semi-finished SMC. This results in high <b>scrap</b> <b>rates</b> as well as machine failure and can additionally cause further problems in the following process steps. Hence, an inline quality control can help to establish objective quality criteria for semi-finished SMC and can enable controlled and stable production processes. Therefore, this paper deals with quality assurance in the production process of semi-finished sheet molding compounds. Air entrapping and fiber distribution are identified as two parameters that influence the quality of the semi-finished product significantly. In addition, the early detection of a pending carrier foil failure can help to establish a stable process. The focus of this paper lies on how various, individually adapted metrology systems can be used for the detection of the respective characteristics and integrated into the production process of the semi-finished SMC. In particular, optical systems, such as area scan cameras and laser stripe sensors as well as thermographic sensors are discussed and possibilities for application-related sensor data evaluation are shown. This helps to reduce the <b>scrap</b> <b>rates</b> of parts and to establish a further automated production process...|$|R
40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{feature of}} all AM techniques is their capability to produce parts of highest geometrical complexity {{which can not}} be built by any other production technique. This works because of the tool-free layer-by-layer approach of all AM processes. Parts are produced based on 3 D-CAD-model-data without any tooling needed. The number of available materials is still limited compared to other processes like milling or injection moulding but the number of materials qualified for polymer- or metal-based processes is continuously rising. Concerning technology readiness, a lot of AM techniques offer part qualities which are comparable to those resulting from conventional manufacturing methods. The AM produced parts can be used and post-processed (milled, drilled, coated) like any other standard industrial part. Especially in metal, AM produced parts often exceed the mechanical property values of those machined from standard bulk material. Another aspect becoming more and more important is connected to the outstanding material efficiency of most AM processes. <b>Scrap</b> <b>rates</b> are usually < 5 %.

40|$|Background: In 2007 alone, twenty six {{foundries}} {{were closed}} {{down when the}} castings industries directory was released. A high <b>scrap</b> <b>rate</b> {{due to a lack}} of quality management is one of the root causes of low productivity and low profits, resulting in closures. Method: This research paper focusses on the impact of defects on productivity and monetary losses due to poor utilisation of the quality management system in sand casting. Data was gathered on defects and productivity and the company’s quality control records were used for monetary losses due to scrap. The study was conducted over a period of one year at a South African foundry. The standard multiple regression analysis method was used to assess the ability of five defects (cross jointed, bad mould, shrinkage, core fault, and gas porosity) to predict monetary and productivity losses. Results: Cross jointed and bad mould defects had a correlation coefficient of 0. 727 and 0. 716 respectively which indicated a strong positive correlation. The overall variance explained by the model was 61 %, F = 16. 263, p<. 005. Thus the prevalence of these two types of defects can significantly predict monetary losses, while core fault predicted productivity. Conclusion: Foundry should concentrate on eliminating cross jointed and bad mould defects to avoid a high <b>scrap</b> <b>rate,</b> and core fault to improve productivity...|$|E

The system is demonstrated on a machining center at Waters Corporation as part of a team internship project. This thesis focuses on the gage repeatability and reproducibility study (Gage R&R study) for the implementation of the SPC system. Based on the knowledge about the machining processes and the gages available, we select the proper gages for different dimensions to conduct the Gage R&R study. Gage capabilities are analyzed and root-cause analysis for incapable gages is performed. Related reaction plans are developed and implemented in order to improve the gage capabilities. Discussion about tolerance redesign leads to the adjustment of specifications in the manufacturing area. As a result of these efforts, we find that the existing measurement system is capable for the SPC real time inspection system.

40|$|Molten metal {{processing}} is inherently energy intensive and roughly 25 % {{of the cost}} of die-cast products can be traced to some form of energy consumption [1]. The obvious major energy requirements are for melting and holding molten alloy in preparation for casting. The proper selection and maintenance of melting and holding equipment are clearly important factors in minimizing energy consumption in die-casting operations [2]. In addition to energy consumption, furnace selection also influences metal loss due to oxidation, metal quality, and maintenance requirements. Other important factors influencing energy consumption in a die-casting facility include geographic location, alloy(s) cast, starting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, casting yield, <b>scrap</b> <b>rate,</b> cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, casting yield, <b>scrap</b> <b>rate,</b> cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting machine, related equipment (robots, trim presses), and downstream processing (machining, plating, assembly, etc.).
