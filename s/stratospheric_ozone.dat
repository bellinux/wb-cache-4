40|$|The first climatological {{overview}} of total, <b>stratospheric</b> and tropospheric <b>ozone</b> {{in the southern}} hemisphere tropical and subtropics is based on ozone sounding data from 10 sites comprising the Southern Hemisphere Additional OZonesondes (SHADOZ) network. Observations were made over: Ascension Island; Nairobi, Kenya; Irene, South Africa; Reunion Island; Watukosek, Java; Fiji; Tahiti; American Samoa; San Cristobal, Galapagos; Natal, Brazil. The data reside at: [URL] SHADOZ ozone time-series and profiles give a perspective on tropical total, <b>stratospheric</b> and tropospheric <b>ozone.</b> Prominent features are highly variable tropospheric ozone and a zonal wave-one pattern in total (and tropospheric) column ozone.

In addition to leading the SHADOZ network, we have been producing near-real tropical tropospheric ozone ('TTO') data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) since 1997 with Prof. Hudson and students at the University of Maryland: [URL] Further perspective on the complexity of tropospheric ozone variability is shown using satellite observations...|$|R
25|$|Ozone {{depletion}} describes {{two related}} phenomena observed {{since the late}} 1970s: a steady decline of about four percent in {{the total amount of}} ozone in Earth's stratosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> around Earth's polar regions. The latter phenomenon {{is referred to as the}} ozone hole. There are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events in addition to these stratospheric phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Through the {{increasing}} use of nitrogen fertilizer, which was used {{at a rate of about}} 110 million tons (of N) per year in 2012, adding to the already existing amount of reactive nitrogen, nitrous oxide (N2O) has become the third most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide and methane.

25|$|The Antarctic {{ozone hole}} {{is an area}} of the Antarctic {{stratosphere}} in which the recent ozone levels have dropped to as low as 33 percent of their pre-1975 values. The ozone hole occurs during the Antarctic spring, from September to early December, as strong westerly winds start to circulate around the continent and create an atmospheric container. Within this polar vortex, over 50 percent of the lower <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> is destroyed during the Antarctic spring.|$|E

50|$|The Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer, or SBUV/2, is {{a series}} of {{operational}} remote sensors on NOAA weather satellites in Sun-synchronous orbits which have been providing global measurements of <b>stratospheric</b> total <b>ozone,</b> as well as ozone profiles, since March 1985. The SBUV/2 instruments were developed from the SBUV experiment flown on the Nimbus-7 spacecraft which improved on the design of the original BUV instrument on Nimbus-4. These are nadir viewing radiometric instruments operating at mid to near UV wavelengths. SBUV/2 data sets overlap with data from SBUV and TOMS instruments on the Nimbus-7 spacecraft. These extensive data sets (January 1979 to the present) measure the density and vertical distribution of ozone in the Earth’s atmosphere from six to 30 miles.|$|R
25|$|Ozone, while a {{minority}} constituent in Earth's atmosphere, {{is responsible for}} most of the absorption of UVB radiation. The amount of UVB radiation that penetrates through the ozone layer decreases exponentially with the slant-path thickness and density of the layer. When <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> levels decrease, higher levels of UVB reach the Earth’s surface. UV-driven phenolic formation in tree rings has dated the start of ozone depletion in northern latitudes to the late 1700s.|$|E
25|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is a complex}} dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. A primary concern for management of the global {{atmosphere is}} air pollution, the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulates, or biological materials that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the natural environment or built environment. <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized {{as a threat to}} human health {{as well as to the}} Earth's ecosystems.|$|E

When performing catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline and light gas, for example, kinetic models can be used to find the temperature and pressure at which the highest yield of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline will occur.|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} the tropospheric column ozone using a forward trajectory model {{to increase the}} horizontal resolution of the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) derived <b>stratospheric</b> column <b>ozone.</b> Subtracting the MLS <b>stratospheric</b> column from <b>Ozone</b> Monitoring Instrument total column measurements gives the trajectory enhanced tropospheric ozone residual (TTOR). Because of different tropopause definitions, we validate the basic residual technique by computing the 200 -hPa-to-surface column and comparing it to the same product from ozonesondes and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer measurements. Comparisons show good agreement in the tropics and reasonable agreement at middle latitudes, {{but there is a}} persistent low bias in the TTOR that may be due to a slight high bias in MLS stratospheric column. With the improved stratospheric column resolution, we note a strong correlation of extratropical tropospheric ozone column anomalies with probable troposphere-stratosphere exchange events or folds. The folds can be identified by their colocation with strong horizontal tropopause gradients. TTOR anomalies due to folds may be mistaken for pollution events since folds often occur in the Atlantic and Pacific pollution corridors. We also compare the 200 -hPa-to-surface column with Global Modeling Initiative chemical model estimates of the same quantity. While the tropical comparisons are good, we note that chemical model variations in 200 -hPa-to-surface column at middle latitudes are much smaller than seen in the TTOR...|$|R
40|$|Synoptic {{analyses}} of {{solar backscattered ultraviolet}} (SBUV) ozone data have been performed {{on a daily basis}} for the first year of Nimbus 7 operation, November 1978 through October 1979, at the standard pressure levels: 30, 10, 5, 2, 1, and 0. 4 mbar. By combining these data with the daily NMC meteorological {{analyses of}} temperature and geostrophic wind at the same levels, elements of the ozone-temperature relationship as well as the horizontal eddy transports are examined. In particular, the existence of an upper <b>stratospheric</b> high-latitude <b>ozone</b> minimum in winter is discussed, and the eddy fluxes are found to {{play a significant role in}} this feature, mainly associated with stratospheric warming pulses.

25|$|The {{most common}} forms {{of skin cancer}} in humans, basal and {{squamous}} cell carcinomas, have been strongly linked to UVB exposure. The mechanism by which UVB induces these cancers is well understood—absorption of UVB radiation causes the pyrimidine bases in the DNA molecule to form dimers, resulting in transcription errors when the DNA replicates. These cancers are relatively mild and rarely fatal, although the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma sometimes requires extensive reconstructive surgery. By combining epidemiological data with results of animal studies, scientists have estimated that every one percent decrease in long-term <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> would increase the incidence of these cancers by two percent.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the ozone}} layer absorbs UVB {{ultraviolet}} light from the sun, ozone layer depletion increases surface UVB levels (all else equal), {{which could lead to}} damage, including increase in skin cancer. This was the reason for the Montreal Protocol. Although decreases in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> are well-tied to CFCs and to increases in surface UVB, there is no direct observational evidence linking ozone depletion to higher incidence of skin cancer and eye damage in human beings. This is partly because UVA, which has also been implicated in some forms of skin cancer, is not absorbed by ozone, and because it is nearly impossible to control statistics for lifestyle changes over time.|$|E
25|$|When the UV Index is {{presented}} {{on a daily}} basis, it represents UV intensity around the sun's highest point in the day, called solar noon, halfway between sunrise and sunset. This typically occurs between 11:30 and 12:30, or between 12:30 and 13:30 in areas where daylight saving time is being observed. Predictions are made by a computer model that accounts {{for the effects of}} sun elevation and distance, <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> cloud conditions, air pollutants, surface albedo, and ground altitude, all of which influence the amount of UV radiation at the surface. The calculations are weighted in favor of the UV wavelengths to which human skin is most sensitive, according to the CIE-standard McKinlay-Diffey erythemal action spectrum. The resulting UV Index cannot be expressed in pure physical units, but is a good indicator of likely sunburn damage.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution, according to Paul Crutzen, Will Steffen and others, the planet has {{entered a new}} epoch, the Anthropocene. In the Anthropocene, humans have become the main agents of change to the Earth system. There have been well publicized scientific warnings about risks {{in the areas of}} climate change and <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> However, other biophysical processes are also important. For example, since the advent of the Anthropocene, the rate at which species are being extinguished has increased over 100 times, and humans are now the driving force altering global river flows as well as water vapor flows from the land surface. Continuing pressure on the Earth's biophysical systems from human activities raises concerns that further pressure could be destabilizing, and precipitate sudden or irreversible changes to the environment. It is difficult to address the issue, because the predominant paradigms of social and economic development are largely indifferent to the looming possibilities of large scale environmental disasters triggered by humans. Legal boundaries can help keep human activities in check, but are only as effective as the political will to make and enforce them.|$|E
25|$|Transgressing {{one or more}} {{planetary}} boundaries may be highly damaging or even catastrophic, due {{to the risk of}} crossing thresholds that trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. The 2009 study identified nine {{planetary boundaries}} and, drawing on current scientific understanding, the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere < 350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W/m2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-industrial levels); <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> (less than 5% reduction in total atmospheric O3 from a pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N/yr) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (< 4000nbsp&km3/yr of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (< 15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of < 10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which the group had not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} study to {{indicate}} a Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) in tropospheric ozone. Tropospheric ozone is derived using differential measurements of total column <b>ozone</b> and <b>stratospheric</b> column <b>ozone</b> measured from {{total ozone mapping spectrometer}} (TOMS) and microwave limb sounder (MLS) instruments. Two broad regions of significant MJO signal are identified in the tropics, one in the western Pacific and the other in the eastern Pacific. Over both regions, MJO variations in tropospheric ozone represent 5 - 10 Dobson Unit (DU) peak-to-peak anomalies. These variations are significant compared to mean background amounts of 20 DU or less over most of the tropical Pacific. MJO signals of this magnitude would need to be considered when investigating and interpreting particular pollution events since ozone is a precursor of the hydroxyl (OH) radical, the main oxidizing agent of pollutants in the lower atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|The polar {{stratosphere}} {{has been speculated}} to be an active sink region of various <b>stratospheric</b> materials; <b>ozone,</b> water vapor, NOX, aerosol particles and so on, but this process is not theoretically and/or observationally made clear.
