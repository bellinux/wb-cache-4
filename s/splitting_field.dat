25|$|The {{interpretation}} of the theorem changed with the formulation {{of the theory of}} Emil Artin, around 1930. From the time of Galois, the role of primitive elements had been to represent a <b>splitting</b> <b>field</b> as generated by a single element. This (arbitrary) choice of such an element was bypassed in Artin's treatment. At the same time, considerations of construction of such an element receded: the theorem becomes an existence theorem.|$|E
25|$|A {{first attempt}} at proving the theorem was made by d'Alembert in 1746, but his proof was incomplete. Among other problems, it assumed implicitly a theorem (now known as Puiseux's theorem) which would not be proved until {{more than a century}} later, and {{furthermore}} the proof assumed the fundamental theorem of algebra. Other attempts were made by Euler (1749), de Foncenex (1759), Lagrange (1772), and Laplace (1795). These last four attempts assumed implicitly Girard's assertion; to be more precise, the existence of solutions was assumed and all that remained to be proved was that their form was a+bi for some real numbers a and b. In modern terms, Euler, de Foncenex, Lagrange, and Laplace were assuming the existence of a <b>splitting</b> <b>field</b> of the polynomial p(z).|$|E

The Galois group of [...] consists of two elements: The identity transformation, which sends every complex number to itself, and complex conjugation, which sends i to −i. Since the Galois group does not change the ground field, it leaves the coefficients of the polynomial unchanged, so it must leave the set of all roots unchanged. Each root can move to another root, however, so transformation determines a permutation of the n roots among themselves. The significance of the Galois group derives from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, which proves that the fields lying between the ground field and the <b>splitting</b> <b>field</b> are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of the Galois group.|$|E

Materials and Methods : Dosimetric data from 10 patients of carcinoma nasopharynx, undergoing IMRT, were evaluated in this prospective study. The carotid vessels were contoured from sternoclavicular joints upto {{the base of}} skull. IMRT plans were generated for all patients with extended <b>field</b> and <b>split</b> <b>field</b> IMRT techniques using nine coplanar beams with 6 MV photons. A dose of 70 Gy to planning target volume (PTV) 70 Gy, 59. 4 Gy to PTV 59. 4 Gy and 54 Gy to PTV 54 Gy was delivered in 33 fractions. The dose constraints were similar for both the techniques. The integral dose to the carotid arteries was calculated as the mean dose times the volume (mean dose &# 935; volume) in units of liter-gray. Results : The mean dose to the carotid vessels in the extended field IMRT was 63. 88 &# 177; 0. 97 Gy (mean dose &# 177; SD) and it was 64. 43 &# 177; 0. 73 Gy for the <b>split</b> <b>field</b> technique.

40|$|Abstract. Intensity {{modulated}} {{radiation therapy}} (IMRT) uses radiation beams of varying intensities to deliver varying doses of radiation to {{different areas of}} the tissue. The use of IMRT has allowed the delivery of higher doses of radiation to the tumor and lower doses to the surrounding healthy tissue. It is not uncommon for head and neck tumors, for example, to have large treatment widths that are not deliverable using a single field. In such cases, the intensity matrix generated by the optimizer needs to be split into two or three matrices, each of which may be delivered using a single <b>field.</b> Existing <b>field</b> <b>splitting</b> algorithms used pre-specified arbitrary split line or region where the intensity matrix is split along a column, i. e., all rows of the matrix are split along the same column (with or without overlapping of <b>split</b> <b>fields,</b> i. e., feathering).

Red–green flicker sensitivity was ∼ 3 -fold greater for a uniform field than for a ‘split’ field with the two sides flickering out-of-phase. Just the opposite effects were observed for luminance flicker — the <b>split</b> <b>field</b> yielded a 7 -fold advantage over the uniform field at 2 or 4 Hz and a 3 -fold advantage at 12 Hz. Contrary to Kelly, {{we find that the}} <b>split</b> <b>field</b> offers only a very small advantage of 40 % for luminance flicker at 2 Hz and virtually no advantage at 4 Hz and above. Kelly’s chromatic results are surprising since one might expect that the larger color difference (or step) across the central edge would aid chromatic discrimination rather than strongly suppressing sensitivity. We show that the central chromatic edge only weakly impairs detection. Further results show that {{the two sides of the}} chromatic <b>split</b> <b>field</b> are detected essentially independently by red or green ‘blob’ detectors, which do not take advantage of the color difference across the edge.
