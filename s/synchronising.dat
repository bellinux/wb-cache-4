5|$|Heinrich events appear {{related to}} some, but not all, {{of the cold}} periods {{preceding}} the rapid warming events known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, which are best recorded in the NGRIP Greenland ice core. However, difficulties in <b>synchronising</b> marine sediment cores and Greenland ice cores to the same time scale cast aspersions on the accuracy of that statement.|$|E
5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's <b>synchronising</b> gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore {{them out on the}} ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E
5|$|The {{female worker}} ants {{do not have}} wings and {{reproductive}} females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (Harpegnathos saltator) is able to jump by <b>synchronising</b> the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs. There are several species of gliding ant including Cephalotes atratus; {{this may be a}} common trait among most arboreal ants. Ants with this ability are able to control the direction of their descent while falling.|$|E

5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, <b>synchronising</b> their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E
5|$|To keep enemy {{action to}} a minimum during the assault, a {{creeping}} barrage was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres {{in advance of the}} assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately <b>synchronising</b> the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage.|$|E

25|$|In March 1916, RFC Scout C No.5313 {{was fitted}} with a Vickers machine gun, {{synchronised}} to fire through the propeller by the awkward Vickers-Challenger <b>synchronising</b> gear, the only gear available to the RFC at that time. Six other Scouts, late Scout Cs and early Scout Ds, were also fitted with the same combination. Types using this gear (including the B.E.12, the R.E.8 and the Vickers F.B.19) all had the gun mounted {{on the port side}} of the fuselage. The attempt to use the gear for <b>synchronising</b> a centrally mounted gun on the Bristol Scout failed and tests, which continued at least until May 1916, resulted in the abandonment of the idea and no Vickers-armed Bristol Scouts were used in operations.|$|E
25|$|Four {{examples}} of the F.K.6 were ordered in April 1916, two of which were intended for the Royal Naval Air Service, but only one was built, this demonstrating poor performance when tested. As effective <b>synchronising</b> gears were now available, the type was abandoned, {{with none of the}} escort fighters being brought into production.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} both Scout and Triplane was {{determined}} {{largely by the}} Admiralty requirement to carry a quick-firing, recoilless Davis gun that used 2lb (1kg) shells. At the time, {{there was no way}} of <b>synchronising</b> such a weapon with the propeller, or of mounting it elsewhere than the fuselage, so a pusher configuration was necessary, the pilot sitting in a nacelle with the gun in its nose.|$|E

25|$|OFCOM have {{released}} their consultation {{of the future}} of the 600MHz and 700MHz UHF bands beyond 2018 on 16 November 2012. This document recommends that the 600MHz UHF band is allocated to DVB-T2 MPEG-4 Freeview HD services and Whitespace services, allowing a future migration of the existing 700MHz Freeview allocation to 700MHz mobile data services (<b>synchronising</b> the bandwidth usage with many other markets in Europe and globally).|$|E

25|$|If the shoal {{becomes more}} tightly organised, {{with the fish}} <b>synchronising</b> their {{swimming}} so they all move {{at the same speed}} and in the same direction, then the fish may be said to be schooling. Schooling fish are usually of the same species and the same age/size. Fish schools move with the individual members precisely spaced from each other. The schools undertake complicated manoeuvres, as though the schools have minds of their own.|$|E

The BES monitors the user's mailbox, relaying new {{messages to the}} phone via BlackBerry's Network Operations Center (NOC) and user's wireless provider. This feature is known as push email, because all new emails, contacts, task entries, memopad entries, and calendar entries are pushed out to the BlackBerry device immediately (as opposed to the user <b>synchronising</b> the data manually or having the device poll the server at intervals).|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the first}} major change was the advent of music {{sequencer}} technology. Prior to its introduction all synchronisation was achieved by adding SMPTE time code to analogue tape. This acted as a reference point so that individual tracks could be easily synchronised. With the advent of MIDI hardware, devices {{could be used to}} synchronise any MIDI device and eventually MIDI Time Code or MTC became an alternative method of <b>synchronising</b> studio activity. Continuing development in this area has led to computer-controlled sequencing.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} or {{transport channel}} for TV {{in countries that}} use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular <b>synchronising</b> pulses. The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial sideband, the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the lower sideband components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this {{is done by the}} RF and IF filters.|$|E

25|$|Tinson's first {{design for}} Sage was a two-seat fighter aircraft, the Sage Type 2. It {{was a small}} wood-and-fabric tractor biplane (in fact the two-seat Sage was smaller than many single-seaters of the time), with single-bay wings. The pilot and gunner sat in an enclosed, glazed cabin that filled {{the gap between the}} {{fuselage}} and upper wing. Because of the lack of effective gun <b>synchronising</b> gear to allow a fixed gun to fire through the propeller disc, a hole was cut in the upper wing above the gunners seat, so the gunner could stand with head and shoulders above the wing, giving him a good allround field of fire for his Lewis gun, including forward over the propeller. The aircraft was powered by a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine driving a four-bladed propeller.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s {{it was clear that the}} tram network could become profitable again only if it was expanded to the more lucrative suburban routes dominated by the private bus operators. Additionally most of the rolling stock dated from before or during the World War II, and were nearing the end of their lifespan, which meant that sizeable investment would be needed to keep the trams operational. In 1961 the traffic department proposed the acquisitions of new four-axle trams, but the proposal was left untreated by the technical committee until the traffic department would make a proposal for the future of the tram system. As a result, Pentti Savolainen proposed the gradual closure of the tram system by 1980, <b>synchronising</b> the closure of different lines with the retirement of the then-current tram staff. Six new four-axle trams would have been required for this plan to be realised. No actual reason was given why the tram system should be closed.|$|E
500|$|Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, often {{referred}} to as Captain Scarlet, is a 1960s British science-fiction television series produced by the Century 21 Productions company of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, John Read and Reg Hill. First broadcast on ATV Midlands from September 1967 to May 1968, it has since been transmitted in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Characters are presented as marionette puppets alongside scale model sets and special effects in a filming technique that the Andersons termed [...] "Supermarionation". This technology incorporated solenoid motors as a means of <b>synchronising</b> the puppet's lip movements with pre-recorded dialogue.|$|E
