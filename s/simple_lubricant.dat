40|$|A {{number of}} recently-developed {{experimental}} techniques, such as force balance, {{atomic force microscopy}} and ultrathin film interferometry have enabled the direct study of the properties of very thin liquid lubricating films between solid surfaces. These {{have been used to}} demonstrate the structure and rheology, and thus the lubricating ability, of monolayer additive films in rolling and sliding contacts. They have also been used to investigate the thin film properties of simple, additive-free fluids such as hydrocarbon base stocks. This paper reviews previous work on the thin film-forming properties of <b>simple</b> <b>lubricant</b> base fluids. Newwork is carried out using ultrathin film interferometry and a rolling-sliding friction test apparatus. It is found that the quasi-spherical molecules, cyclohexane and OMCTS form enhanced film thicknesses in high pressure, slow speed, rolling contacts. There is also an indication of a step-wise dependence of film thickness on rolling speed, in accord with finding using atomic force microscopy and surface forces apparatus. Friction measurements in mixed rolling-sliding show that these fluids also reduce friction in the boundary film regime...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{lubrication}} {{theory is}} unable to describe nanoscale flows due {{to the failure of}} two of its constitutive components: a) the Newtonian stress-strain rate relationship and b) the no-slip boundary condition. In this thesis, we present a methodology for deriving a modified Reynolds equation (referred to as the Molecular Dynamics-based Equation for Lubrication, or the MODEL) which overcomes these limitations by introducing a Molecular Dynamics-based constitutive relationship for the flow rate through the lubrication gap, that is valid beyond the range of validity of the Navier-Stokes constitutive models. We demonstrate the proposed methodology for the flow of a <b>simple</b> <b>lubricant,</b> n-hexadecane, between smooth Iron walls and show that the MODEL is able to predict flow rates with good accuracy even in nanochannels that are only a few atomic layers wide. The MODEL constitutive relationship for the flow rate used in this work is a slip-corrected Poiseuille model with the slip length and viscosity derived from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of pressure-driven flow in nanochannels sufficiently large that the Navier-Stokes description is valid. Although more general expressions for the flow rate can certainly be used, for the lubricant-solid system modeled here, the slip-corrected Poiseuille flow was surprisingly found to be sufficient. We validate the MODEL by comparing MD results for the pressure distribution in a barrel-drop lubrication configuration with the analytical solution for the pressure obtained by solving the MODEL. The excellent agreement obtained between the dynamic pressure in the fluid measured from these MD simulations and the MODEL results suggests {{that it is possible to}} extend pde-based hydrodynamic modelling of lubrication problems even to nanoscale films beyond the validity of the Navier-Stokes description. In other words, once the flow rate constitutive relation is obtained, lubrication problems in nanoscale films can be solved without resorting to expensive particle methods like MD. We demonstrate that slip cannot be neglected in the boundary lubrication regime by considering various lubrication problems of practical interest. Using a simple barrel-drop lubrication model for the top two rings in an internal combustion engine, we show that for lubrication gaps with a minimum thickness that is ten times the size of the slip length, the normal force and the frictional force are overestimated by a factor of 1. 5 when assuming no-slip. By modifying the Twin Land Oil Control Ring (TLOCR) -liner interface model to include slip, we find significant reduction in the hydrodynamic pressure and the friction when compared to the original model; the oil flow rate does not change appreciably. Finally, we chalk out a procedure for the inclusion of slip in the methodology for developing correlations for the pressure, friction and the flow rate in the TLOCR-liner system. by Nisha Chandramoorthy.

40|$|Unlike {{hot flushes}} and night sweats which resolve spontaneously in time, atrophic {{symptoms}} affecting the vagina and lower urinary tract are often progressive and frequently require treatment. The prevalence of vaginal dryness increases {{as a woman}} advances through the postmenopausal years, causing itching, burning and dyspareunia, and sexual activity is often compromised. But, despite the various safe and effective options, only a minority (about 25 % in the Western world and probably considerably less in other areas) will seek medical help. Some of this reluctance {{is due to the}} adverse publicity for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) over recent years that has suggested an increased risk of breast cancer, heart disease and stroke. But, regardless of whether these scares are justified, local treatment of vaginal atrophy is not associated with these possible risks of systemic HRT. Other reasons for the continued suffering in silence may be cultural and an understandable reluctance to discuss such matters, particularly with a male doctor, but the medical profession must also take much of the blame for failing to enquire of all postmenopausal women about the possibility of vaginal atrophic symptoms. Vaginal dryness can be helped by <b>simple</b> <b>lubricants</b> but the best and most logical treatment for urogenital atrophy is to use local estrogen. This is safe, effective and with few contraindications. It is hoped that these guidelines and recommendations, produced to coincide with World Menopause Day 2010, will help to highlight this major cause of distress and reduced quality of life and will encourage women and their medical advisers {{all over the world to}} seek and provide help...|$|R
40|$|An antireflection {{overcoat}} for opaque baffle coatings in the far-IR/submillimeter {{region has}} been made from a <b>simple</b> Teflon spray-on <b>lubricant.</b> The Teflon overcoat reduced the specular reflectance of four different opaque coatings by nearly a factor or 2. Analysis, based on the interference term of a reflecting-layer model, indicates that in the submillimeter region the reduced reflectance depends primarily on the refractive index of the overcoat and very little on its thickness...|$|R
40|$|From {{functioning}} as <b>simple</b> space-fillers, <b>lubricants</b> or protective coatings, to providing three-dimensional matrices for cell growth, to {{acting as the}} functional moiety in environmentally responsive ‘smart devices’, the range of applications of biopolymers in biomedicine is vast. Hydrogel-forming biopolymer systems have characteristics that are advantageous in a biological context in comparison with more conventional engineering materials {{that have been used}} to repair damaged or missing tissues, the capacity to permit molecular diffusion due to high water content being a prime example. In mechanical terms, gel-forming biopolymers more closely resemble soft tissue and so increasingly find application in soft tissue repair, an area of biomaterials science that has received limited attention until relatively recently. Aside from intrinsic physical properties, however, it is the fundamental chemistry of natural polymer systems that provides scope for some of the more ingenious applications of these materials to biomedical problems. For example, the capacity for certain biopolymers to form cross-linked gels under physiological conditions presents opportunities for minimally invasive routes to delivery of drug and or cell-loaded implants into the body. It is the purpose of this chapter to summarize some {{of the ways in which}} these materials are applied and to identify the contribution of the biopolymer in each example to the functionality of the system described...|$|R
