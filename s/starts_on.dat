5|$|The Great Salt Lake is fed {{by three}} major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed {{directly}} or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River <b>starts</b> <b>on</b> the north slope of the Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some of Bear River's waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river {{by means of the}} Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River also <b>starts</b> <b>on</b> the north slope of the Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas, rather it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River; the Provo River does originate in the Uintas, {{a few miles from the}} Weber and Bear. The Jordan flows from the north part of Utah Lake into the southeast corner of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E

5|$|This section {{establishes}} the fact that, although recipients may receive various federal awards during their lifespan, the individual federal grants are awarded for a specified time period, usually one year. Federal regulations prohibit {{the use of}} funds from a grant award outside its specified time frame unless authorized by a federal agency, and auditors should verify that the recipient expends its grant during that time only. For example, a surplus from a federal award that <b>starts</b> <b>on</b> January 1, 2006 and ends on December 31, 2006 cannot be used after December 31, because its lifespan has terminated. This surplus must {{be returned to the}} federal agency unless otherwise authorized.|$|E
5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin <b>starts</b> <b>on</b> an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Sánchez {{made the}} Giants' {{starting}} rotation out {{of spring training}} as the fifth starter. In only his second start of the season, he struck out a career high ten batters against the San Diego Padres in a game the Giants eventually won 1–0. Sánchez struck out ten batters again in a 3–1 victory against the Cincinnati Reds on April 25, becoming the first Giants left-handed pitcher since Shawn Estes to strike out at least ten batters in a game {{more than once in}} a season. From May 28 through June 12, Sánchez won a career best four straight <b>starts.</b> <b>On</b> June 12, in a 10–7 victory over the Colorado Rockies, he became the first Giants' starter to allow seven runs and win a game since Russ Ortiz did it in 2000. In his next start, on June 17 against the Detroit Tigers, Sánchez took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, but he was ultimately the losing pitcher in a 5–1 loss. Sánchez finished the first half with an 8–5 record and 115 strikeouts, which were the most ever {{in the first half of}} a season by a Giants' left-hander during the Giants' tenure in San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|In July 2006, {{after his}} release by Grays, Hooper went on two trials. Firstly to League Two club Barnet, then to Championship club Southend United, where {{he was given a}} one-year {{contract}} by manager Steve Tilson the following month. On 24 October, Hooper scored twice in a 3–1 League Cup win over Leeds United. He went on to make 18 appearances for Southend in the Championship, although only two were <b>starts.</b> <b>On</b> 15 March, Hooper joined League One club Leyton Orient on loan {{for the rest of the}} season. Tilson said that this loan would allow him to assess whether Hooper merited a new contract and would give the young striker experience. Hooper was recalled from loan on 1 May before, already relegated, Southend's last match of the season. A number of players were out injured for the match and, five days after his recall, Hooper started in the 4–1 defeat to Southampton.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the {{community}} of Hale the road enters the Huron National Forest near Loon Lake. The trunkline takes a turn to the east as it passes along the Au Sable River. The River Road National Scenic Byway <b>starts</b> <b>on</b> M-65 at Rollways Road, and the highway generally follows the river as it passes by a former logging community which is commemorated by Lumberman's Monument. At the intersection with River Road, M-65 turns north to cross the Au Sable, and the byway designation continues east along River Road to follow the river to Oscoda. The M-65 bridge over the Au Sable is just downstream of the Five Channels Dam, crossing high above the water below. The highway turns northwesterly through forest land to cross into Alcona County. North of the county line, the trunkline follows Baker and State roads near Vaughn and Hunters lakes. M-65 meets the western terminus of county road F-30 in the community of Glennie. The highway also crosses the South Branch of the Pine River.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the missed field goal, Alabama {{began its}} drive at its 25-yard line—the line of {{scrimmage}} for the field goal. In the drive's first play, Zow completed a seven-yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Hall. Alexander then ran {{to the left side}} for a two-yard gain. On third down, Alexander gained three yards and a first down. After that, Moore sacked Zow for a two-yard loss, to the 35-yard line. After the sack, Zow was hit again by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The fumble was scooped up by an Alabama player, however, and resulted in a gain of four yards. Zow then completed a pass to Alexander at the 50-yard line for a first down. Once there, Alabama was twice penalized five yards for false <b>starts</b> <b>on</b> consecutive plays. The penalties ran out the final seconds of the first quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 70.|$|E
