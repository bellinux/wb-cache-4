To this I reply {{that it is only}} a very strong man who can appreciate the charms of a landscape as he is toiling up a steep hill, along a had road. What with <b>short-windedness,</b> stones, ruts, and a pervading sense of the wisdom of rest and be thankful, most of us have little enough sense of the beautiful under these circumstances. The ordinary schoolboy is precisely in this case. He finds Parnassus uncommonly steep, and there is no chance of his having much time or inclination to look about him till he gets to the top. And nine times out of ten he does not get to the top.|$|E

[...] . In {{terms of what they}} have to say, it must be admitted that these three fragments will not alter our understanding of medieval hippology to any great extent, but they are important nonetheless in that they are essential for anyone wishing to undertake a fully collated scholarly edition of The Boke of Marchalsi...|$|E
