40|$|Growing {{populations and}} {{changing}} diets have put great pressure on food systems {{throughout the world}} and have lead to increasing agricultural intensification including the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers. Given the associated human and environmental health costs of intensification, {{the development of more}} sustainable practices is imperative. One such avenue is to make better use of natural ecosystem services, {{such as the use of}} conservation biological control to reduce reliance on pesticide. However, there are logistical and educational impediments to the more effective use of resident natural enemies through conservation biological control that need to be addressed. These include how other agricultural management practices impact biological control, and how managers can tell if it is working or when it will work. Along with pesticides, fertilizers are a defining aspect of modern agriculture, but their effect on biological control services has seldom been evaluated. The effects of plant quality on natural enemies are often overlooked developing biological control programs for insect pests in agriculture. An enhanced nutritional status of plants can fuel insect population growth because nitrogen is an important component of proteins that are known to be limiting for phytophagous insects. Additionally, nitrogen fertilizers directly and indirectly affect plant defenses. In this dissertation I used walnuts to address the effect of increased nitrogen availability to the host plant on <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> Chromaphis juglandicola and on parasitism by the specialist parasitoid Trioxys pallidus. From laboratory experiments and field sampling, nitrogen content of foliage did not change aphid population growth rate or aphid size. However, in laboratory experiments added nitrogen decreased the number of mummies produced by female parasitoids over a 24 h period, but increased the proportion and the size of female offspring. Field sampling of walnut orchards showed no relationship between the percent parasitism of <b>walnut</b> <b>aphids</b> by T. pallidus and nitrogen content of foliage. Although nitrogen fertilizer and plant quality can affect biological control in other crops, it did not appear to be a problem for biological control of <b>walnut</b> <b>aphids.</b> Biological control in action is often hard to visualize and even more difficult to quantify in the context of pest population management. Readily measured metrics are needed to accurately predict the effectiveness of biological control services: this would then allow managers to say, given this set of measurements, control of an insect pest can be expected today or at some point in the near future. Using <b>walnuts</b> and <b>walnut</b> <b>aphids</b> as a model system, I investigated whether activity measurements and diversity indices for the natural enemy assemblages present in walnut orchards would be good indicators of current and future biological control. While percent parasitism, predator:prey ratio, and natural enemy evenness were good indicators of current biological control, there were no good indicators of future biological control. An increase in natural enemy units, a measure of abundance weighted by the feeding or parasitism capacities of individual species, was correlated with a decrease in aphids over the season, but, as there was also a strong effect of within-season density dependence in the <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> populations, the correlation is more likely to be an artifact rather than a causal relationship. The composition of a local natural enemy assemblage depends on both the local environment, which acts as a filter, and the surrounding landscape, which serves as a regional pool of natural enemy species. When the surrounding landscape is the dominant factor, measures of landscape complexity can be used to predict the composition of the local natural enemy community. For more urbanized environments, however, local factors can be as important as landscape factors. Urban gardens are an ideal study system to address such questions as they are often spread along an urbanization gradient and yet differ considerably in local composition. For home and school gardens in the South Peninsula of the San Francisco Bay, urbanization had a non-linear effect on natural enemy richness with greater richness in both the most urban and most rural gardens. Moreover, urbanization was also positively related to natural enemy abundance on tomato plants, a key urban garden crop. In addition, the use of natural enemy exclosures showed that natural enemy richness was significantly related to the degree of suppression of aphids on fava bean plants, suggesting that increasing natural enemy richness could improve biological control. However, I found no clear elements of the local composition of gardens that could be modified to increase natural enemy richness. The best indicators and economic incentives do not ensure that farmers and gardeners will use biological control instead of pesticides if they are not comfortable with the idea. In this context, Cooperative Extension (CE) provides an effective means to accomplish the successful transfer of new research information on biological control to the farmers and gardeners who could put it into practice. While outreach from CE to large agricultural industries has been well established, urban gardeners represent a relatively new audience for the transfer of research knowledge. As many gardeners in urban and school gardens include children, education about insects and natural enemies could start with very young audiences. A combined scientific and outreach event put on by San Mateo Cooperative Extension demonstrated the significance of early education on this topic. Using pre and post-participation surveys I was able to show that children felt more positively about insects and were even more likely to eat insects after the event. Making research knowledge available and accessible to all ages involved in food production may help to increase the level of adoption of biological control in the future. Biological control is a valuable ecosystem service that could help reduce the negative impacts of the intensification of agriculture. However, more effective ways to visualize, quantify and predict the action of natural enemies are needed to make conservation biological control an essential part of the pest management tool kit for farmers and gardeners...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I expand {{upon our}} knowledge {{in regards to}} the utility of population genetic approaches to be used {{for the study of the}} evolution of introduced biological control agents and their target pests. If biological control methods are to provide sustainable pest management services then more long-term studies will be necessary, and these studies should also include the use of population genetic approaches. For existing biological control programs, post-release population genetic studies could be initiated using museum voucher specimens for baseline data. In Chapter 2, I explored what factors influence our ability to extract usable genomic material from dried museum specimens, and whether we could use non-destructive techniques for parasitic hymenoptera. I found that the age of the specimen was the most important determinant for the amplification of PCR products, with nuclear loci having a higher probability of amplification from older specimens than mitochondrial loci. With these sequence results I was able to differentiate voucher specimens of different strains of the biological control agent Trioxys pallidus and I was able to confirm the identification of an unknown parasitoid reared from the invasive light brown apple moth. For population genetic surveys to be conducted more frequently in biological control programs, some of the barriers to developing molecular markers that are variable enough for these types of surveys need to be overcome. One barrier is the time required to develop polymorphic microsatellite markers. Therefore, in Chapter 3, I developed a novel bioinformatics pipeline that searches through next-generation sequence (NGS) data and uses the raw sequencing reads to identify polymorphic loci. Using this approach I was able to rapidly develop microsatellite markers for two of my study species (T. pallidus and Chromaphis juglandicola). For both species more than 60 % of the target markers amplified and were found to be polymorphic, compared to previous approaches where the success rates were much lower (published studies often show rates between 1 and 20 %). I then examined evolutionary factors that may affect the sustainability of two classical biological control programs; 1) the biological control of <b>walnut</b> <b>aphids,</b> and 2) the biological control of invasive knotweeds. The <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> biological control program is a textbook successful biological control program, but has shown recent evidence of localized breakdowns, whereas the biological control program for invasive knotweeds is currently under review in the United States and Canada. In Chapter 4, I explored whether hybridization between introduced “strains” of T. pallidus is responsible for recent breakdowns in this control program. In that study I found low levels of hybridization – thus it is unlikely hybridization is playing an important role in these breakdowns – as well as evidence that two of the strains may actually be cryptic species; one being a specialist and another being a generalist. In Chapter 5, I explored whether the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution might help explain these localized breakdowns. In that chapter I found evidence for a geographic mosaic in the <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> biological control program, and commented on how components of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution can help us predict what systems we might expect localized breakdowns to occur in. In Chapter 6, I explored whether endosymbionts might play a role in shaping the host-associations of two strains of the candidate biological control agent for invasive knotweeds. I found that while strains of the psyllid Aphalara itadori showed no barriers to hybridization of their nuclear genomes, there were curious patterns of horizontal transmission of their primary endosymbiont. I also found that one haplotype of the secondary endosymbiont Sodalis sp. dramatically changed in frequency during the hybrid crosses reared on giant knotweed. When compared with previous studies of this species, the results I observe suggest that endosymbionts may play an important role in the differing fitness levels of these two strains. In conclusion, population genetic approaches provide valuable tools for the study of post-release dynamics in biological control settings. While biological control programs promise to be useful study systems for evolutionary interactions, post-release studies will allow for that promise to come to fruition. In my future research endeavors I would like to continue to monitor the effects of hybridization and the frequency of geographic mosaics of coevolution in biological control settings. In addition, I would like to conduct post-release population genetic studies of both previous successful introductions and programs that resulted in failures. I believe these post-release studies will allow us to better determine what evolutionary factors affect the sustainability of biological control services and will allow for better management practices...|$|R

6000|$|At Christmas-time in 1456, {{readers of}} Villon will {{remember}} that he was engaged on the [...] "Small Testament." [...] About the same period, circa festum nativitatis Domini, he {{took part in a}} memorable supper at the Mule Tavern, in front of the Church of St. Mathurin. Tabary, who seems to have been very much Villon's creature, had ordered the supper {{in the course of the}} afternoon. He was a man who had had troubles in his time, and languished in the Bishop of Paris's prisons on a suspicion of picking locks; confiding, convivial, not very astute--who had copied out a whole improper romance with his own right hand. This supper-party was to be his first introduction to De Cayeux and Petit-Jehan, which was probably a matter of some concern to the poor man's muddy wits; in the sequel, at least, he speaks of both with an undisguised respect, based on professional inferiority in the matter of picklocks. Dom Nicolas, a Picardy monk, was the fifth and last at table. When supper had been despatched and fairly washed down, we may suppose, with white Baigneux or red Beaune, which were favourite wines among the fellowship, Tabary was solemnly sworn over to secrecy on the night's performances; and the party left the Mule and proceeded to an unoccupied house belonging to Robert de Saint-Simon. This, over a low wall, they entered without difficulty. All but Tabary took off their upper garments; a ladder was found and applied to the high wall which separated Saint-Simon's house from the court of the College of Navarre; the four fellows in their shirt-sleeves (as we might say) clambered over in a twinkling; and Master Guy Tabary remained alone beside the overcoats. From the court the burglars made their way into the vestry of the chapel, where they found a large chest, strengthened with iron bands and closed with four locks. One of these locks they picked, and then, by levering up the corner, forced the other three. Inside was a <b>small</b> coffer, of <b>walnut</b> wood, also barred with iron, but fastened with only three locks, which were all comfortably picked by way of the keyhole. In the walnut coffer--a joyous sight by our thieves' lantern--were five hundred crowns of gold. There was some talk of opening the aumries, where, if they had only known, a booty eight or nine times greater lay ready to their hand; but one of the party (I have a humorous suspicion it was Dom Nicolas, the Picardy monk) hurried them away. It was ten o'clock when they mounted the ladder; it was about midnight before Tabary beheld them coming back. To him they gave ten crowns, and promised a share of a two-crown dinner on the morrow; whereat we may suppose his mouth watered. In course of time, he got wind of the real amount of their booty and understood how scurvily he had been used; but he seems to have borne no malice. How could he, against such superb operators as Petit-Jehan and De Cayeux; or a person like Villon, who could have made a new improper romance out of his own head, instead of merely copying an old one with mechanical right hand? ...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the most}} fast-developing {{research}} areas, biological imaging and image analysis receive more and more attentions, and have been already widely applied in many scientific fields including medical diagnosis and food safety inspection. To further investigate such a very interesting area, this research is mainly focused on advanced imaging and pattern recognition technologies in both medical and food safety applications, which include 1) noise reduction of ultra-low-dose multi-slice helical CT imaging for early lung cancer screening, and 2) automated discrimination between walnut shell and meat under hyperspectral florescence imaging. In the medical imaging and diagnosis area, because X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been applied to screen large populations for early lung cancer detection during the last decade, more and more attentions have been paid to studying low-dose, even ultra-low-dose X-ray CTs. However, reducing CT radiation exposure inevitably increases the noise level in the sinogram, thereby degrading the quality of reconstructed CT images. Thus, how to reduce the noise levels in the low-dose CT images becomes a meaningful topic. In this research, a nonparametric smoothing method with block based thin plate smoothing splines and the roughness penalty was introduced to restore the ultra-low-dose helical CT raw data, which was acquired under 120 kVp / 10 mAs protocol. The objective thorax image quality evaluation was first conducted to assess the image quality and noise level of proposed method. A web-based subjective evaluation system was also built for the total of 23 radiologists to compare proposed approach with traditional sinogram restoration method. Both objective and subjective evaluation studies showed the effectiveness of proposed thin-plate based nonparametric regression method in sinogram restoration of multi-slice helical ultra-low-dose CT. In food quality inspection area, automated discrimination between walnut shell and meat has become an imperative task in the walnut postharvest processing industry in the U. S. This research developed two hyperspectral fluorescence imaging based approaches, which were capable of differentiating <b>walnut</b> <b>small</b> shell fragments from meat. Firstly, a principal component analysis (PCA) and Gaussian mixture model (PCA-GMM) -based Bayesian classification method was introduced. PCA was used to extract features, and then the optimal number of components in PCA was selected by a cross-validation technique. The PCA-GMM-based Bayesian classifier was further applied to differentiate the walnut shell and meat according to the class-conditional probability and the prior estimated by the Gaussian mixture model. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of this PCA-GMM approach, and an overall 98. 2 % recognition rate was achieved. Secondly, Gaussian-kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) was presented for the walnut shell and meat discrimination in the hyperspectral florescence imagery. SVM was applied to seek an optimal low to high dimensional mapping such that the nonlinear separable input data in the original input data space became separable on the mapped high dimensional space, and hence fulfilled the classification between walnut shell and meat. An overall recognition rate of 98. 7 % was achieved by this method. Although the hyperspectral fluorescence imaging is capable of differentiating between walnut shell and meat, one persistent problem is how to deal with huge amount of data acquired by the hyperspectral imaging system, and hence improve the efficiency of application system. To solve this problem, an Independent Component Analysis with k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (ICA-kNN) approach was presented in this research to reduce the data redundancy while not sacrifice the classification performance too much. An overall 90. 6 % detection rate was achieved given 10 optimal wavelengths, which constituted only 13 % of the total acquired hyperspectral image data. In order to further evaluate the proposed method, the classification results of the ICA-kNN approach were also compared to the kNN classifier method alone. The experimental results showed that the ICA-kNN method with fewer wavelengths had the same performance as the kNN classifier alone using information from all 79 wavelengths. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed ICA-kNN method for the hyperspectral band selection in the walnut shell and meat classification...|$|R
