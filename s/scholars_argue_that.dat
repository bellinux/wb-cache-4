5|$|Several <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} no one High Priest who is the strongest {{candidate}} for identification with each of the Wicked Priest passages.

5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} the {{philosophical}} writings of Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes. Some <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character Diotima in the Symposium on her, while others suggest that Diotima {{was in fact a}} historical figure. According to Charles Kahn, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, Diotima is in many respects Plato's response to Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a wave of}} {{political}} reforms in the late 1990s, Antara began to produce its reporting independently {{of the government and}} was reorganized as a state-owned enterprise in 2007. However, media <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> a lengthy relationship with the government makes it difficult for the agency to become an unbiased news organization. Antara celebrated its 75th anniversary on 13December 2012.|$|E

5|$|With O'Sullivan, Hadley has {{conducted}} research on utilitarianism {{and the relationship}} between obligations to animals and obligations to needy humans. The <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> there is a conflict in Singer's philosophy between the obligation to aid needy humans and to protect animals, and that Westerners who own pets should, rather than spending large amounts of money extending the lives of their companions, euthanise severely ill animals and instead donate money to aiding those in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. Some argue that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> variation among circuits allows local courts {{to experiment with}} new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E
5|$|In 563, {{a mission}} from Ireland under St. Columba founded the monastery of Iona off {{the west coast}} of Scotland, and {{probably}} began the conversion of the region to Christianity. The kingdom reached its height under Áedán mac Gabráin (r. 574–608), but its expansion was checked at the Battle of Degsastan in 603 by Æthelfrith of Northumbria. Serious defeats in Ireland and Scotland in the time of Domnall Brecc (d.642) ended Dál Riata's golden age, and the kingdom became a client of Northumbria, then a subject to the Picts. There is disagreement over the fate of the kingdom from the late 8th century onwards. Some <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Dál Riata underwent a revival under king Áed Find (736–78), before the arrival of the Vikings.|$|E
50|$|The {{source of}} {{authority}} for the Basic Law is somewhat controversial, with most Chinese legal <b>scholars</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the Basic Law is a purely domestic legislation deriving its authority from the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and with some legal <b>scholars</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the Basic Law derives its authority directly from the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The argument is relevant in that it affects the level of authority that the PRC has in making any changes to the Basic Law. It is also essential in determining the Hong Kong courts' jurisdiction in {{issues related to the}} PRC domestic legislations.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} between Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust {{has long been}} disputed, with some <b>scholars</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> he kept silent during the Holocaust, while others have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> he saved thousands if not tens or {{hundreds of thousands of}} Jews.|$|R

5|$|The {{two heads}} at Tres Zapotes, with the La Cobata head, are stylistically {{distinct}} from the other known examples. Beatriz de la Fuente views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement. These heads are sculpted with relatively simple headdresses; they have squat, wide proportions and distinctive facial features. The two Tres Zapotes heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site. The discovery {{of one of the}} Tres Zapotes heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture, carried out by Matthew Stirling in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
5|$|Peace {{having been}} restored, a grand {{ceremonial}} procession was staged on 12 April 1159 for the triumphant entry of the Byzantine army into the city, with Manuel riding {{through the streets}} on horseback, while the Prince of Antioch and the King of Jerusalem followed on foot. Manuel dispensed justice to the citizens and presided over games and tournaments for the crowd. In May, {{at the head of}} a united Christian army, he started on the road to Edessa, but he abandoned the campaign when he secured the release by Nur ad-Din, the ruler of Syria, of 6,000 Christian prisoners captured in various battles since the second Crusade.* P. Magdalino, The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos, 67* J. H. Norwich, A short history of Byzantium Despite the glorious end of the expedition, modern <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Manuel ultimately achieved much less than he had desired in terms of imperial restoration.|$|E

25|$|The Dholavira {{signboard}} {{is one of}} {{the longest}} in the Indus script, with one symbol appearing four times, and this and its large size and public nature make it a key piece of evidence cited by <b>scholars</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the Indus script represents full literacy.|$|R
5|$|The {{number five}} {{is also found}} in the {{structure}} of the poem itself. Sir Gawain is 101stanzas long, traditionally organised into four 'Fits' of 21, 24, 34, and 22stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe that they are the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the Ten Commandments). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.|$|E
5|$|While Manilius is {{not quoted}} by any extant Roman author, many <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> he is alluded to {{by a number}} of authors, including: Ausonius, Claudian, Commodian, Dracontius, Juvenal, Lucan, Manetho, Martianus Capella, Nemesianus, Orientius, Pseudo-Empedocles, Seneca, Sidonius Apollinaris, Tertullian, Titus Calpurnius Siculus, and Venantius Fortunatus. Hübner {{cautions}} that such assumptions should be considered carefully (or downright rejected, in the cases of Manetho and Pseudo-Empedocles), as the similarities may be due to a lost ancient epic precursor that Manilius and the others were all alluding to or borrowing from. The work of Julius Firmicus Maternus, who wrote in the time of Constantine about astrology and other subjects, resembles Manilius's work in many ways; for instance, in his Matheseos libri octo (composed c.33437), Firmicus follows Manilius's method of instruction closely and analyzes the poet's astrological fundamentals. This suggests that Firmicus almost certainly used Manilius (or someone inspired by him) as a guide. But despite the similarity between Firmicus's work and Manilius's, Firmicus neither mentions Manilius by name nor lists him as among the few Romans (viz. Germanicus, Cicero, and Fronto) who wrote about astrology.|$|E
5|$|The Natchez killed {{almost all}} of the 150 Frenchmen at Fort Rosalie, and only about 20 managed to escape. Most of the dead were unarmed. Women, children, and African slaves were mostly spared; many were locked inside a house on the bluff, guarded by several warriors, from where they could see the events. According to Dumont de Montigny's account of the attack, women seen {{defending}} their husbands from the violence, or trying to avenge them, were taken captive or killed. One woman's unborn baby was reportedly torn from her before she herself was killed. A year after the event, the tally of dead was put at 138 men, 35 women and 56 children, or approximately 230 overall. Some <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the Natchez spared the African slaves due to a general sense of affinity between the Natchez and the Africans; some slaves even joined the Natchez against their masters, while others took the chance to escape to freedom. A group of Yazoo people who were accompanying Commandant du Codère remained neutral during the conflict but were inspired by the Natchez revolt. When they returned to Fort St. Pierre, they destroyed the fort, killing the Jesuit priest and 17 French soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|The first written {{mention of}} the Banjani is in 1319. Some <b>scholars</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the name could derive from balnea (sr. banja), which means [...] "bath" [...] or [...] "spa".

25|$|The Korean {{government}} says that Usando was the Liancourt Rocks. Although {{it is impossible}} for one to survive at Liancourt Rocks without outside assistance, a distinction to be noted is that Usanguk refers to a state based on Ulleng-do, whereas Usando refers to an island. Japanese <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Usando refers to either Ulleung-do or Jukdo while Korean <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it refers to Liancourt Rocks.|$|E

25|$|As {{this report}} was {{compiled}} from a Japanese geographical perspective, Japanese <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Matsushima (the closer island) refers to Liancourt Rocks and Takeshima (the farther island) refers to Ulleungdo. On {{the other hand}} Korean <b>scholars</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> a closer look reveals the grants were given to permit them to travel abroad, thus proving that fishing area was foreign territory. These grants led to a conflict with native settlers in Ulleungdo and were later revoked by Kanpaku of Japanese Tokugawa Shogunate in January 1696.|$|E
