Lilith created {{one of the few}} <b>strong</b> <b>women</b> in the 1960s. Rossen generally destroyed the main character.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1950s, Hamama had leading {{roles in}} 30 films, {{in which she}} often {{played the role of}} a weak, empathetic, poor girl. After the 1950s, Hamama was in search of her real {{identity}} and was trying to establish herself as a distinct figure. During this period, her choice of material and roles was somewhat limited. However, film producers soon capitalised on her popularity with audiences in local and Middle Eastern markets. She began to play realistic, <b>strong</b> <b>women,</b> such as in Sira' Fi Al-Wadi (صراع في الوادي, Struggle in the Valley, 1954) where she portrayed a rich man's daughter who, contrary to stereotype, was a realistic woman who helped and supported the poor. In the 1952 film Miss Fatmah (الأستاذة فاطمة), Hamama starred as a law student who believed women were as important as men in society.|$|E

500|$|Bringing Up Baby was {{the second}} of four films {{starring}} Grant and Hepburn; the others were Sylvia Scarlett (1935), Holiday (1938) and The Philadelphia Story (1940). The film's concept was described by philosopher Stanley Cavell as a [...] "definitive achievement {{in the history of}} the art of film." [...] Cavell noted that Bringing Up Baby was made in a tradition of romantic comedy with inspiration from ancient Rome and Shakespeare.

500|$|Marcie Bianco of Quartz {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "centered around women's desire" [...] and Haynes structured {{it in a way}} that [...] "elevates the power of women's gaze".

Accordingly, Minnah's back was marked and scored with the tyrant's answers to free speech." [...] Minnah eventually returns happily to the fields. Another, Judy, is complacent and enjoys taking mornings and afternoons off to see to her husband. Stowe attributes their work ethic to poor training and [...] "the negligent habits inducted by slavery"; the truly talented and hard-working black laborers had moved on from homesteads to industry, able to demand their own price for their labors.|$|E
