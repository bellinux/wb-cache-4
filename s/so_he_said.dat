500|$|Berkman {{arranged}} for Russian anarchists to protest outside the American embassy in Petrograd during the Russian Revolution, which led U.S. President Woodrow Wilson to ask California's governor to commute Mooney's death sentence. When the governor reluctantly did <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "the propaganda in [...] behalf following the plan outlined by Berkman {{has been so}} effective as to become world-wide." [...] Billings and Mooney both were pardoned in 1939.|$|E

Then we started listening to a lot of different and old loops and we used the 'Blind Alley' loop and I started singing the melody over it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1975, Biden {{broke from}} liberal orthodoxy {{when he took}} {{legislative}} action to limit desegregation busing. [...] In doing <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> busing was a [...] "bankrupt idea [...] the cardinal rule of common sense," [...] and that his opposition {{would make it easier}} for other liberals to follow suit. [...] Three years later, Wilmington's federally mandated cross-district busing plan generated much turmoil, and in trying to legislate a compromise solution, Biden found himself alienating both black and white voters for a while.|$|E
500|$|After {{the taking}} of the city, all Spanish {{authorities}} were requested to pledge allegiance to the British crown. Belgrano thought {{that the members of}} the Consulate should leave the city and join the viceroy, but the others did not agree. They obeyed the British request; Belgrano refused to do <b>so.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> that he wanted [...] "either our old master, or no master at all". To avoid being forced to pledge allegiance, he escaped from Buenos Aires and sought asylum at the chapel of Mercedes, in the Banda Oriental.|$|E
500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with CNN-IBN, Madhur Bhandarkar {{said that he}} was preparing to make a film about the fashion industry; he thought the lack of Indian films on this subject prompted him to do <b>so.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> he was fascinated with the industry, the models and their lives outside the ramp walks, saying [...] "I was amazed at the overwhelming attention given to the fashion Industry by the media and the public. I thought the idea of delving deep into the fashion world was very interesting and intriguing." [...] He was excited about depicting the people behind the ramp because most people are unfamiliar with [...] the fashion world.|$|E

Here, Zita spent many hours with the old Emperor on both formal and informal occasions, where Franz Joseph confided in her his fears for the future. Emperor Franz Joseph died of bronchitis and pneumonia {{at the age of}} 86 on 21 November 1916. [...] "I remember the dear plump figure of Prince Lobkowitz going up to my husband," [...] Zita later recounted, [...] "and, with tears in his eyes, making {{the sign of the cross}} on Charles's forehead. As he did <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'May God bless Your Majesty.' It was the first time we had heard the Imperial title used to us." ...|$|E
500|$|Joining the Maple Leafs for the 1929–30 season, 18-year-old Jackson was the {{youngest}} player in the National Hockey League (NHL). In his league debut, against the Montreal Canadiens, Jackson knocked over his idol Howie Morenz with a bodycheck. [...] Assessing the youngster's potential following the hit, Morenz offered, [...] "you'll do". Jackson appeared in 31 games for the Maple Leafs, scoring 12 goals and adding 6 assists. He missed some time due to injury, during which he earned his nickname from the team's trainer, Tim Daly. According to Jackson: [...] "Daly asked me to carry sticks for him. [...] I told him I wasn't a stick boy, I was a hockey player. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> I {{was nothing but a}} fresh busher [...] and the name stuck." ...|$|E
500|$|The boy was curious, {{he was a}} big Munnabhai fan {{and kept}} asking the name of the film.

('Munnabhai is fine, but who is this Mahatma Gandhi?') So this is the sad state of affairs today. I was shocked. And it's not just the chai-wallah. A few days ago on TV a lot of {{politicians}} were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know 2 October is Gandhiji's birthday! Many didn't know his first name. They kept saying, 'what's in a name, we respect his ideals,' but come on! How can you not know his name? ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a speech}} at the GOP Freedom Summit in April 2014, Paul insisted that the GOP has to broaden its appeal in order to grow as a party. To do <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it cannot be the party of [...] "fat cats, rich people and Wall Street" [...] and that the {{conservative}} movement has never been about rich people or privilege, [...] "we are the middle class", he said. Paul also said that conservatives must present a message of justice and concern for the unemployed and be against government surveillance to attract new people to the movement, including the young, Hispanics, and blacks. During the 2014 election, Paul launched a social media campaign titled [...] "Hillary's Losers" [...] which was meant to highlight many of the Democratic candidates that lost their bids for the U.S. Senate despite endorsements from Hillary Clinton. Clinton was also a candidate for President and eventually won the Democratic Party's nomination, going on to lose to Donald Trump in the general election.|$|E
500|$|In the Bloom's Shakespeare Through the Ages {{volume on}} Hamlet, editors Bloom and Foster express a {{conviction}} that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded {{the capacity of the}} Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy: [...] "For once, Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet: it will not stick, and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot, who preferred Coriolanus to Hamlet, or <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Who can believe Eliot, when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure?" [...] The book also notes James Joyce's interpretation, stating that he [...] "did far better in the Library Scene of Ulysses, where Stephen marvelously credits Shakespeare, in this play, with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless, thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days of the space program, astronauts and reporters would often socialize {{together}} in Cocoa Beach, and had a very different relationship than they do today. Barbree described his relationship with the astronauts as a friend and confidant, often going out to dinner with them, or socializing together when the astronauts were in town. In his book, Barbree writes that in 1961 Alan Shepard told him an [...] "off the record" [...] fact: He was going to be the first American astronaut in space. Barbree noted that if he were to report this, it would not only jeopardize the friendships, but possibly his career as well, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> nothing. Barbree also recounts a conversation with Gus Grissom about the astronaut’s concerns regarding Apollo not long before the fatal Apollo 1 fire. Barbree's association with the astronauts had some unexpected bonuses as well, Neil Armstrong carried a gold coin to the moon on Apollo 11 for Barbree, and Pete Conrad flew several flags and patches on Apollo 12, which Barbree later handed out to friends.|$|E

500|$|All four episodes were {{directed}} by Lee Salisbury, who learned {{three weeks before}} filming {{that he would be}} working on the episodes, and said he was [...] "a bit dumbstruck" [...] to discover he would be directing the fire episodes and Windsor's departure, but that he was proud to do <b>so.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> his main aim for the fire was to show the fear, panic and pandemonium that comes when a fire starts and quickly spreads. He wanted the story to be character-led rather than led by the fire, saying that the fire [...] "almost becomes a backdrop". Salisbury said it was hard to make the fire look real because [...] "you can't actually set fire to stuff". As the fire lasted for some time, characters' scenes could be divided up into small sections. Salisbury commented: [...] "Bryan Kirkwood, the writer [...] and myself also wanted it to be an episode where things kept happening and the audience would keep thinking, 'Wow, that must have been the explosion' or 'That must have been the stunt'. But more things keep happening and happening, and I think that's what people will find really shocking." [...] The production team had several production meetings for the weeks' worth of episodes, whereas there is usually just one.|$|E
500|$|The main cast was put {{together}} {{through a process of}} auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli, who beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti, recalls [...] "He's got a poker face, so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and having me try it again, which often is a sign that you're not doing it right. I thought, I'm not getting this. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'Thank you,' and I left. I didn't expect to hear back. And then they called." [...] Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had been in Goodfellas. James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco, who had played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, was originally asked {{to play the role of}} Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico, who has a criminal background, signed on to play Paulie Walnuts as long as his character was not to be a [...] "rat".|$|E
500|$|The House of Representatives convened for the 33rd Congress in December 1853. [...] At that time, the {{simmering}} {{disagreement between}} {{the free and}} slave states heated up {{with the introduction of}} the Kansas–Nebraska Act, proposed by Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, which would open the Kansas and Nebraska territories to slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. [...] Intended to quiet national agitation over slavery by shifting the decision to local settlers, Douglas's proposal instead inflamed anti-slavery sentiment in the North by allowing the possibility of slavery's expansion to territories held as free soil for three decades. [...] English, a member of the Committee on Territories, thought the bill was unnecessary and disagreed with its timing; when the committee approved the bill, English wrote a minority report to that effect. [...] He was not altogether opposed to the principle of popular sovereignty, however, believing that [...] "each organized community ought to be allowed to decide for itself". [...] Northern Democrats divided almost evenly on the bill, but English, despite his stated reservations, was among those who voted for it. [...] In doing <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that Congress was bound to respect the decision of the territories' residents and pledged to uphold their decisions. [...] President Franklin Pierce signed the bill into law on May30, 1854.|$|E
