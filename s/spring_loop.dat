The approximately 8 mi trail is significant for its association with Civilian Conservation Corps labor from CCC Camp NP-3, and represents the last link in the series of access trails built in the mid-1930s, beginning with the Under-the-Rim Trail, also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The trail descends eastward from Rainbow Point in {{the southern end of the}} park, descending along The Promontory, and turning back south, then west, then north to return to the road via Yovimpa Pass, ending at returning to Rainbow Point. The primary purpose of the trail was to provide reliable access to the backcountry of the southern portion of the park.|$|E

5000|$|The direct {{translation}} of Ain al-Hilweh is [...] "sweet water spring".

But the truth is, the Ain al-Hilweh spring was located {{at the corner of the}} valley between Miye ou Miye village and Darb es Seem. The water flowed from the spring westward 500 meters towards a man made dam. The dam was erected at the crossroad between Mieh Mieh and present day Seyroub neighborhood in Darb es Seem. The Palestinian camp is located between 1000m to 1500m to the west, away from the natural spring. Emir Fakhr-al-Din II, (Fakhr-al-Din Ibn Mann, Fakhr-al-Din al Maani), was given the title [...] "Emir" [...] or Prince in Arabic because the Maan dynasty reigned over Lebanon at that time. Lebanon was divided into several emirates (the state or jurisdiction of an emir). So, there was an emirate out of several called, “Emirate of Ain al-Hilweh” and had an Emir. The emirate stretched Northwest from the Ain al-Hilweh <b>spring,</b> <b>looped</b> around the bottom of Mieh Mieh village along present day Officers’ Military Club straight North to the Barghout Creek (between Mieh Mieh and Haret Saida) and West to the Mediterranean Sea. From the South, the emirate stretched straight West to the Mediterranean Sea. So the present day Palestinian refugee camp got its name from the Emirate Ain al-Hilweh.|$|R

50|$|The type object most {{commonly}} used to define Ringerike Style is a 2.15 m high carved stone from Vang in Oppland. Apart from a runic memorial inscription on its right edge, the main field of the Vang Stone is filled with a balanced tendril ornament springing from two shell spirals at the base: the main stems cross twice to terminate in lobed tendrils. At the crossing, further tendrils <b>spring</b> from <b>loops</b> and pear-shaped motifs appear from the tendril centres on the upper loop. Although axial in conception, a basic asymmetry arises in the deposition of the tendrils. Surmounting the tendril pattern appears a large striding animal in double-contoured rendering with spiral hips and a lip lappet. Comparing the Vang Stone animal design with the related animal from the Mammen axe-head, the latter lacks the axiality seen in the Vang Stone and its tendrils are far less disciplined: the Mammen scroll is wavy, while the Vang scroll appears taut and evenly curved, these features marking a key difference between Mammen and Ringerike ornament. The inter-relationship between the two styles is obvious, however, when comparing the Vang Stone animal with that found on the Jelling Stone.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects and interactions of first- andsecond- order preactivation bends on three dimensional force system of steel and beta titaniumcanine retraction springs. Method and materials: In a non- linear finite element analysis, three retraction <b>springs</b> including,vertical <b>loop,</b> vertical helical loop and T- loop were studied. All combinations of first-order bend(0, 20, 40 and 60 degrees), second-order bend (0, 20 and 40 degrees) and wire material (stainlesssteel, beta titanium) were applied to each design. All appliances activated incrementaly to reachelastic limit in 0. 05 mm steps. Moment/ force ratios (in occlusal and sagital plan) and load/deflection rate of appliances were measured using ABAQUS, V 6. 8 and CATIA, V 5. 13 softwares. Results: It was found that the second-order bend can somewhat reduce moment/ force ratio inocclusal plan but first order bend have no effect on moment/ force ratio in sagital plan. Theaddition of helix into the vertical loop reduces load deflection rate of spring but did little to alterthe moment/ force ratios of spring. Conclusion: First and second-order preactivation of retraction springs produce the desired effects,without significant interfering with each other. Helices added to the vertical loop may improvesome mechanical characteristics of retraction springs.

While adequate theoretical models exist for the single scattering properties of ice crystals at solar wavelengths, thermal infrared properties are difficult to obtain because exact solutions of Maxwell's equations are often needed.

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 This quantitative study compared the AIMSweb academic {{achievement in the}} area of reading and mathematics of third grade students assigned to looping classrooms and non-looping classrooms in one urban school district. Further, the study examined the parent perceptions of their students' academic and affective experiences in the looping classrooms and non-looping classrooms. Parents of the third grade looping classrooms and non-looping classroom were invited to participate in a survey of Likert-scale items to communicate their perceptions of academic and affective outcomes in these classrooms. The results for this survey indicated academic and affective experiences were not rated significantly higher by parents of the third grade looping classrooms than those parents of the third grade non-looping classrooms. The AIMSweb Reading Curriculum Based Measure (R-CBM) data and the Mathematics Concepts and Applications (M-CAP) Assessment data from the 2009 - 2010 school year were analyzed. AIMSweb achievement scores of third grade students assigned to looping classrooms were compared to the third grade students assigned to the non-looping classrooms using an independent samples t-test. Analysis of the AIMSweb reading and mathematics data indicated that all third grade students assigned to the looping classrooms did not perform significantly higher when compared to all the third grade students assigned to the non-looping classrooms.
