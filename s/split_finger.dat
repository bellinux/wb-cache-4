50|$|Brown was {{a pitcher}} {{who had the}} rare talent of relying both on {{movement}} and velocity. His main pitch was a sinking fastball that averaged 91-96 mph, with tremendous tailing, downward movement. He could spot it {{to either side of}} the plate. Batters facing him generally pounded this pitch into the ground or missed it entirely. He complemented this pitch with a sharp slider in the high 80s, and a solid <b>split</b> <b>fingered</b> fastball he used against left-handed hitters or for another look.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that three-valve instrument is a baritone and that the four-valve instrument is a euphonium. Euphoniums often have a fourth valve as an alternate <b>fingering</b> for 1&3 <b>split</b> <b>fingering</b> with improved intonation. The fourth valve can also be viewed {{in the same way}} as an F trigger on trombone, repitching the instrument to expand the lower range. A fourth valve is rarely seen on baritones, but absence of a fourth valve is not a defining characteristic.|$|R
50|$|More complex tabs have a split {{about one}} third down the leading edge so that the fingers can be placed with one finger above and two fingers below the nocking point of the arrow. This style of {{shooting}} is called <b>split</b> <b>finger</b> or Mediterranean Draw. The tab may also have a platform that {{is attached to the}} back of the tab and forms a flat cover over the top, to give the archer a hard reference point underneath the chin when the string is drawn back. Platform tabs are more common for recurve or Olympic Class target archery.|$|E

5000|$|The {{one hand}} <b>split</b> <b>finger.</b> This {{involves}} striking {{the rim of}} the drum head (or a bit further down) with a downwards (or diagonal) movement of the index finger of your ornament hand (that is the left hand for right-handed people, or the right hand for left-handed people) and from there, with no extra movement, bringing your ring finger up with a slight twist to strike the rim (or close to the rim). When this is done correctly each hit should sound like a regular [...] "ka" [...] (which is a standard rim hit with the ornament hand).|$|E

50|$|It was {{the second}} such {{painting}} Caravaggio created. The first, The Fortune Teller, had drawn attention, and this painting extended his reputation, small though {{it was at this}} stage. The subjects of The Fortune Teller and Cardsharps offered something new, realistic scenes of street life, especially with this beautifully rendered attention to little details such as the <b>split</b> <b>fingers</b> on the older man's gloves, or the teenage cheat's anxious glance at his master. The psychological insight is equally striking, the three figures bound together by the common drama, yet each with his own unique part within the larger play - for if the innocent is being duped, the other boy is no older, another innocent being corrupted even as he cheats his gull.|$|R
50|$|The bowstring {{and arrow}} are held with three fingers, {{or with a}} {{mechanical}} arrow release. Most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique. Instinctive shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either the <b>split</b> <b>finger</b> or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in {{the first or second}} joint, or else on the pads of the fingers. When using a mechanical release aid, the release is hooked onto the D-loop.|$|E

50|$|Before a {{sell-out}} {{crowd of}} 28,438 {{at home to}} local Premier League club West Bromwich Albion in the fourth round, Rowett rested top scorer Donaldson and Demarai Gray, {{who had just been}} named December's Football League Young Player of the Month, in favour of Novak and debutant loan signing Lloyd Dyer, and started Randolph for his first cup appearance for Birmingham. The visitors took a two-goal lead; on each occasion, Paul Robinson was unable to prevent the powerful Victor Anichebe converting Saido Berahino's pass. In first-half stoppage time, Dyer's low centre was steered past Boaz Myhill via the post by Grounds for his first goal for the club. After an hour, a collision between Dyer and Myhill left the latter with a <b>split</b> <b>finger,</b> and he was replaced by Albion's other former Birmingham goalkeeper, Ben Foster. Randolph saved well from Joleon Lescott's header and was fortunate when Chris Brunt hit a post, Myhill saved Novak's volleyed shot, and Foster saved twice from substitute Gray, but despite having the better of the second half, Birmingham failed to score.|$|E
50|$|CSM improvised {{the left}} hand playing {{technique}} with innovative movements of <b>split</b> <b>fingers.</b> He was renowned for his unmatched sense of pitch, tonal purity and meaningful silent pauses while following the main artiste. Clarity even during very high speed renditions {{was one of the}} hallmarks of his thani aavarthanes (solos). CSM also developed many unique patterns and lessons and established a new playing style. Some of his notable students include Mavilekkara Shankarakutty Nair, Karaikudi Krishnamurthy (Singapore & London), Kumbakonam Premkumar (AIR Delhi), and B. Druvaraj (Bangalore). His most famous student was the Khanjira wizard G. Harishankar (AIR Madras).The Mridanga trinity influenced one another and drew inspiration by listening to one another. It is a fact that Palani Subramania Pillia, who rarely played the Khanjira in live concerts (although he was extremely good at it), played on a Khanjira only with two Mridangists. One of course was Palghat Mani Iyer and the other was C S Murugabhoopathy.|$|R

5000|$|He {{was drafted}} in the 14th round by the Minnesota Twins in 1989. He made his major league debut for the Twins in 1992, with the team in a pennant race. He went 3-2 with a 3.30 ERA in 46 innings, which earned him the team's Rookie of the Year Award. Trombley played with many {{well-known}} players in 1993, including Kirby Puckett, Rick Aguilera and Dave Winfield. Early in his career, Trombley contributed to Indians designated hitter Eddie Murray's 3000th hit on June 30, 1995. He was sent to AAA for a short time, which drove him to start using a <b>split</b> <b>finger</b> fastball. In 1996, Trombley was recalled from AAA Salt Lake City to the Twins in 1996, and {{would be one of}} the most prominent relief pitchers in the league. He finished in the top six in appearances from 1998 through 2000. In 1999, when he was a free agent, Trombley posted 24 saves, which led to him signing a three-year deal with the Baltimore Orioles for $7.75 million. His departure left the Twins looking for a closer. The team had hoped to keep Trombley; Twins general manager Terry Ryan said, [...] "That certainly puts a hole in the back end of our bullpen, so we're going to have to start making alternative plans.". Trombley pitched 634 innings for the Twins and ended his Twins career with 30 wins, 34 losses, and 34 saves.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Split</b> <b>Finger</b> Protein 1 (Sfp 1) is an yeast nutrient- and stress-sensitive {{transcription}} factor that controls for {{the expression of}} growth related genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, rRNA processing and translation. Sfp 1 was early recognized as an unusual {{transcription factor}} that occupies the promoter of a reduced set of its target genes and its mechanism of action have been remained elusive. Sfp 1 ChIP-seq experiments performed in this thesis revealed that Sfp 1 may play a direct role in the regulation of RNAPII recruitment during PIC formation and this control does not necessarily require Sfp 1 promoter occupancy. We have found that SFP 1 positively affects the expression of growth related genes whereas it has a negative effect on stress-sensitive genes expression. Finally, we have described that Sfp 1 occupies some cell cycle-dependent gene in a cell cycle dependent manner, suggesting a key role of this transcription factor in the intricate process that maintains cell size homeostasis...|$|E

5000|$|Bowling with <b>split</b> fingers: the <b>fingers</b> {{are placed}} {{either side of}} the seam of the ball, and the ball is bowled full-length; when done {{correctly}} the delivery will appear to be a full toss until it suddenly drops.

Sri Lankan Dilhara Fernando holds the ball between the index and middle finger, and just fits it in the webbing between the two. [...] This leads to the delivery of a slow loopy ball.|$|R
40|$|Pattern-forming processes, such as electrodeposition, {{dielectric}} breakdown or viscous fingering are often driven by instabilities. Accordingly, the resulting growth patterns are usually highly branched, fractal structures. However, {{in some of}} the unstable growth processes the envelope of the structure grows in a highly regular manner, with the perturbations smoothed out over the course of time. In this paper, we show that the regularity of the envelope growth can be connected to small-scale instabilities leading to the tip <b>splitting</b> of the <b>fingers</b> at the advancing front of the structure. Whenever the growth velocity becomes too large, the <b>finger</b> <b>splits</b> into two branches. In this way it can absorb an increased flux and thus damp the instability. Hence, somewhat counterintuitively, the instability at a small scale results in a stability at a larger scale. The quantitative analysis of these effects is provided by means of the Loewner equation, which one can use to reduce the problem of the interface motion to that of the evolution of the conformal mapping onto the complex plane. This allows an effective analysis of the multifingered growth in a variety of different geometries. We show how the geometry impacts the shape of the envelope of the growing pattern and compare the results with those observed in natural systems. Comment: to be published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

Landrith took over as starting catcher for most of the week with the newly activated Walker Cooper his backup until Smith returned to action on April 30. In the later months of the season, Landrith started replacing Hal whenever they were up against a right-handed pitcher. His most active month was July, where he hit [...]279 with 2 home runs and 11 RBI in 21 games for the Cards.
