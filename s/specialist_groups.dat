They were trained to operate a U-boat's ballast-tank valves, to reverse any scuttling attempts by the crew, and to search quickly for cryptographic equipment and documents.|$|E
500|$|While the {{majority}} of burials conducted by the LNC (around 80%) were pauper funerals on behalf of London parishes, the LNC also reached agreement {{with a number of}} societies, guilds, religious bodies and similar organisations. The LNC provided dedicated sections of the cemetery for these groups, on the basis that those who had lived or worked together in life could remain together after death. Although the LNC was never able to gain the domination of London's funeral industry for which its founders had hoped, it was very successful at targeting <b>specialist</b> <b>groups</b> of artisans and trades, {{to the extent that it}} became nicknamed [...] "the Westminster Abbey of the middle classes". A large number of these dedicated plots were established, ranging from Chelsea Pensioners and the Ancient Order of Foresters to the Corps of Commissionaires and the LSWR. The Nonconformist cemetery also includes a Parsee burial ground established in 1862, which [...] remains the only Zoroastrian burial ground in Europe. Dedicated sections in the Anglican cemetery were also reserved for burials from those parishes which had made burial arrangements with the LNC.|$|E

2500|$|In the event, Labour {{lost the}} 1959 election, but it voted at its 1960 Conference for {{unilateral}} nuclear disarmament, which represented CND's greatest influence and {{coincided with the}} highest level of public support for its programme. [...] The resolution was passed against the wishes of the party's leaders, who refused to be bound by it and proceeded to organise to have it overturned at the next conference. Hugh Gaitskell, the Labour Party leader, promised to [...] "fight, fight, and fight again" [...] against the decision, which was duly overturned at the 1961 Conference. Labour's failure to win the election and its rejection of unilateralism upset CND's plans, and from about 1961 its prospects of success began to fade. It was said that from that time onward it lacked any clear idea of how nuclear disarmament was to be implemented and that its demonstrations had become ends in themselves. The sociologist Frank Parkin said that, for many supporters, the question of implementation was of secondary importance anyway because, for them, involvement in the campaign was [...] "an expressive activity in which the defence of principles was felt to have higher priority than 'getting things done'." [...] He suggested CND's survival in the face of its failure was {{explained by the fact that}} it provided [...] "a rallying point and symbol for radicals", which was more important for them than [...] "its manifest function of attempting to change the government's nuclear weapons policy." [...] Despite setbacks, it retained the support of a significant minority of the population and became a mass movement, with a network of autonomous branches and <b>specialist</b> <b>groups</b> and an increased participation in demonstrations until about 1963.|$|E
