40|$|We {{study the}} {{physical}} and dynamical properties of the ionized gas in the prototypical HII galaxy Henize 2 - 10 using MUSE integral field spectroscopy. The large scale dynamics is dominated by extended outflowing bubbles, probably the results of massive gas ejection from the central star forming regions. We derive a mass outflow rate dMout/dt~ 0. 30 Msun/yr, corresponding to mass loading factor eta~ 0. 4, in range with similar measurements in local LIRGs. Such a massive outflow has a total kinetic energy that is sustainable by the stellar winds and Supernova Remnants expected in the galaxy. We use classical emission line diagnostic to study the dust extinction, electron density and ionization conditions all across the galaxy, confirming the extreme nature of the highly <b>star</b> forming <b>knots</b> {{in the core of}} the galaxy, which show high density and high ionization parameter. We measure the gas phase metallicity in the galaxy taking into account the strong variation of the ionization parameter, finding that the external parts of the galaxy have abundances as low as 12 + log(O/H) ~ 8. 3, while the central <b>star</b> forming <b>knots</b> are highly enriched with super solar metallicity. We find no sign of AGN ionization in the galaxy, despite the recent claim of the presence of a super massive active Black Hole in the core of He~ 2 - 10.

40|$|Using VLT/FLAMES optical {{integral}} field unit observations, {{we present}} the first spa-tially resolved spectroscopic {{study of the}} well known blue compact galaxy Haro 11, {{thought to be a}} local analogue to high redshift Lyman Break Galaxies. Haro 11 dis-plays complex emission line profiles, consisting of narrow (FWHM. 200 km s− 1) and broad (FWHM ∼ 200 – 300 km s− 1) components. We identify three distinct emission knots kinematically connected to one another. A chemodynamical analysis is pre-sented, revealing that spatially resolved ionic and elemental abundances do not agree with those derived from integrated spectra across the galaxy. We conclude that this is almost certainly due to the surface-brightness-weighting of electron temperature in integrated spectra, leading to higher derived abundances. We find that the eastern knot has a low gas density, but a higher temperature (by ∼ 4, 000 K) and consequently an oxygen abundance ∼ 0. 4 dex lower than the neighbouring regions. A region of en-hanced N/O is found specifically in Knot C, confirming previous studies that found anomalously high N/O ratios in this system. Maps of the Wolf-Rayet feature at 4686 Å reveal large WR populations (∼ 900 – 1500 <b>stars)</b> in <b>Knots</b> A and B.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the physical properties of the nebular material in four star-forming knots of the blue compact dwarf galaxy Haro 15. Using long-slit and echelle spectroscopy obtained at Las Campanas Observatory, we study the physical conditions (electron density and temperatures), ionic and total chemical abundances of several atoms, reddening and ionization structure, for the global flux and for the different kinematical components. The latter was derived by comparing the oxygen and sulphur ionic ratios to their corresponding observed emission line ratios (the η and η' plots) in {{different regions of the}} galaxy. Applying the direct method or empirical relationships for abundance determination, we perform a comparative analysis between these regions. The similarities found in the ionization structure of the different kinematical components implies that the effective temperatures of the ionizing radiation fields are very similar in spite of some small differences in the ionization state of the different elements. Therefore the different gaseous kinematical components identified in each <b>star</b> forming <b>knot</b> are probably ionized by the same star cluster. However, the difference in the ionizing structure of the two knots with knot A showing a lower effective temperature than knot B, suggests a different evolutionary stage for them consistent with the presence of an older and more evolved stellar population in the first.

Yet, almost 20 {{years after the}} discovery of bipolar outflows from young stars, the origins of this violent phenomenon are not well understood.

40|$|The {{onset of}} spiral {{structure}} in galaxies appears to occur between redshifts 1. 4 and 1. 8 when disks {{have developed a}} cool stellar component, rotation dominates over turbulent motions in the gas, and massive clumps become less frequent. During the transition from clumpy to spiral disks, two unusual types of spirals {{are found in the}} Hubble Ultra Deep Field that are massive, clumpy and irregular like their predecessor clumpy disks, yet spiral-like or sheared like their descendants. One type is ``woolly'' with massive clumpy arms all over the disk and is brighter than other disk galaxies at the same redshift, while another type has irregular multiple arms with high pitch angles, <b>star</b> formation <b>knots</b> and no inner symmetry like today's multiple-arm galaxies. The common types of spirals seen locally are also present in a redshift range around z~ 1, namely grand design with two symmetric arms, multiple arm with symmetry in the inner parts and several long, thin arms in the outer parts, and flocculent, with short, irregular and patchy arms that are mostly from star formation. Normal multiple arm galaxies are found only closer than z~ 0. 6 in the UDF. Grand design galaxies extend furthest to z~ 1. 8, presumably because interactions can drive a two-arm spiral in a disk that would otherwise have a more irregular structure.

Our Hα + [NII] imaging reveals the TDG to have an elongated structure, ∼ 1. 9 kpc in length with the two principal <b>star</b> forming <b>knots</b> at either end. Our observations also show the TDG candidate has a recessional V_Hα ∼ 3032 km s^- 1, within 100 km s^- 1 of the parent pair's mean velocity and an oxygen abundance of 12 +log(O/H) = 8. 10 ± 0. 41. The TDG's oxygen abundance is in good agreement with that of a star forming region in NGC 2719 A, one of the parent galaxies, which has an estimated oxygen abundance of 12 +log(O/H) = 8. 05 ± 0. 41. The TDG's V_Hα and oxygen abundance confirm previous results validating the candidate as a TDG. The absence of detectable emission from the TDG in Spitzer 3. 6 μm and 4. 5 μm images together with the lack of absorption lines and weak continuum in the spectrum is consistent with absence of an old population (≳ 0. 5 Gyr). The location of the TDG within the interaction debris and the absence of indicators of an old stellar population in the TDG are consistent with a scenario in which the TDG is formed from HI stripped from the parent galaxies and within the extended dark matter halo of one of the parents as proposed by (Bournaud et al. 2003; Duc et al. 2004).

The spectroscopic observations were complemented with available photometry of the galaxy in the narrow Halpha filter. We measured the rotation curve of the ring, from which we infer a ratio M/L_B = 3. 9 inside the star forming ring. We measured the auroral [OIII] line in the two brightest knots, allowing us to measure oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen, argon and neon chemical abundances following the direct method. Different empirical calibrators were used to estimate the oxygen abundance in the two faintest knots. The metallicities obtained are very similar for all the knots, but lower than previously {{reported in the literature}} from integrated spectra. The N/O abundance, as derived from the N 2 O 2 parameter, is remarkably constant over the ring, indicating that local polution processes are not conspicuous. Using synthetic stellar populations (SSPs) calculated with the code STARLIGHT, we studied the age distribution of the stellar populations in each knot, finding that in all of them there is a combination of a very young population with less than 10 Myr, responsible for the ionisation of the gas, with other populations older than 100 Myr, probably responsible for the chemical evolution of the knots. The small differences in metallicity and the age distributions among the different knots are indicative of a common chemical evolution, probably related to the process of interaction with the companion galaxy IIZw 70.

We present the methodology for the second pathway, using Spitzer/IRAC, 2 MASS, and UKIRT imaging and photometry. Although IRE selection of YSOs is welltrodden territory, MYStIX presents unique challenges.

Previous CO(4 - 3) emission line obserations yielded a non-detection, for which we derived an upper limit of the CO line luminosity of L'_CO = 0. 3 x 10 ^ 10 K km/s/pc^ 2, which is not inconsistent with the L'_CO - L_FIR relation for starburst galaxies. The best fit model to the optical and near-infrared photometry give a stellar population with an age of 1. 4 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1. 6 x 10 ^ 10 Msun. The optical morphology is compact and in the source plane the galaxy has an extent of ~ 6 kpc x 3 kpc with individual <b>star</b> forming <b>knots</b> of < 500 pc in size. J 163556 is not resolved in the SMA data and we place a strict upper limit {{on the size of the}} starburst region of 8 kpc x 3 kpc, which implies a lower limit on the star formation rate surface density of 12 Msun/yr/kpc^ 2. The redshift of J 163556 extends the redshift distribution of faint, lensed SMGs, and we find no evidence that these have a different redshift distribution than bright SMGs.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of the closest collisional ring galaxy to the Milky Way. Such rare systems occur due to "bulls-eye" encounters between two reasonably matched galaxies. The recessional velocity of about 840 km/s is low enough that it was detected in the AAO/UKST Survey for Galactic Hα emission. The distance is only 10. 0 Mpc and the main galaxy shows a full ring of <b>star</b> forming <b>knots,</b> 6. 1 kpc in diameter surrounding a quiescent disk. The smaller assumed "bullet" galaxy also shows vigorous star formation. The spectacular nature of the object had been overlooked because of its location in the Galactic plane and proximity to a bright star and even though it is the 60 ^ th brightest galaxy in the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) HI survey. The overall system has a physical size of ∼ 15 kpc, a total mass of M_∗ = 6. 6 × 10 ^ 9 M_ (stars + HI), a metallicity of [O/H]∼- 0. 4, and a star formation rate of 0. 2 - 0. 5 M_ yr^- 1, making it a Magellanic-type system. Collisional ring galaxies therefore extend to much lower galaxy masses than commonly assumed. We derive a space density for such systems of 7 × 10 ^- 5 Mpc^- 3, an order of magnitude higher than previously estimated. This suggests Kathryn's Wheel is the nearest such system. We present discovery images, CTIO 4 -m telescope narrow-band follow-up images and spectroscopy for selected emission components. Given its proximity and modest extinction along the line of sight, this spectacular system provides an ideal target for future high spatial resolution studies of such systems and for direct detection of its stellar populations.
