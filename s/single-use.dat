5|$|Reach {{features}} updated {{versions of}} old weapons, plus new weapons fulfilling various combat roles. In Halo 3, players can carry <b>single-use</b> equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of <b>single-use</b> equipment is replaced in Reach by reusable and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character {{until they are}} replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects them from {{a limited amount of}} damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief period of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium {{is used in}} cadmium {{telluride}} (CdTe) solar panels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests of tellurium demonstrated {{some of the greatest}} efficiencies for solar cell electric power generators. Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased tellurium demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to <b>single-use</b> film badges.|$|E
5|$|To {{provide the}} desired performance, several {{features}} {{were used in}} the RB.199. To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB.199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is pressurised by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a <b>single-use</b> battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Monterey Bay Aquarium {{plays an}} active role in federal and state politics, from {{sponsoring}} governmental legislation about the ocean to persuading voter action from its visitors and online followers. The aquarium was a leading sponsor for the statewide shark fin ban in 2011. After the ban’s success the aquarium shifted its efforts to focus on ocean plastic pollution. It produced advertisements, webpages, and podcasts in 2016 in support of California Proposition 67 for a statewide ban on <b>single-use</b> plastic grocery bags. The aquarium hosted a plastic pollution symposium through the Aquarium Conservation Partnership in December 2016, and, in July 2017, the aquarium {{and other members of the}} partnership began eliminating their own plastic products.|$|E
5|$|While {{ascending}} the mountain, {{the player}} activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting and planting minerals in marked plots. While {{there are over}} 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further down the mountain upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from minerals, and the Crystal ability generates minerals from multiple plots. Thornvine's <b>single-use,</b> protective thorny vine can hurt enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an anchor for a spiky flail, and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding holes with water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs whether to use minerals offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic of the Roman times iron {{industry}} were huge centers of metallurgy. One such concentration of ironworks, in Świętokrzyskie Mountains, which already produced iron on an industrial {{scale in the}} 1st century AD, in the 2nd and 3rd centuries became Barbaricum's largest. It may {{have been responsible for}} the majority of the iron supplied for barbarian weapon production during the Marcomannic Wars. The iron product was obtained in rather small, <b>single-use</b> smelting furnaces. One furnace's iron output was from a few to 20kg, which required 10 to 200kg of ore and the same amount of charcoal. The satisfaction of so much need for charcoal caused significant deforestation of the areas surrounding the iron centers. Not only turf, but also hematite ores were utilized, which involved building mines and shafts to provide access. The furnaces in Świętokrzyskie Mountains were grouped into large complexes, located in forested areas, away from human settlements. There could have had been as many as 700,000 smelting furnaces built in that area; one big concentration of the Przeworsk culture's spent furnaces (2nd-3rd centuries) was located in Nowa Słupia, Kielce County. The second largest iron production center functioned at that time in Masovia, west of Warsaw, with the total number of furnaces there, in which only turf ores were used, estimated at up to 200,000. They were operated as very large complexes, with several thousand furnaces at a time located near populated areas, where intermediate products were processed further. Those two great concentrations of metallurgical industry produced iron largely for long distance trade; to fulfill local requirements and on smaller scale iron was obtained at a number of other locations.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaac is a {{top-down}} dungeon crawler game, presented using two-dimensional sprites, {{in which}} the player controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters differ in speed, amount of health, amount of damage they deal, and other attributes. The game's mechanics and presentation {{is similar to the}} dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels {{in the manner of a}} roguelike game. On each floor of the basement dungeon, the player must fight monsters in a room before continuing onto the next room. This is most commonly done by the character's tears as bullets in the style of a twin-stick shooter, but the player can also use a limited supply of bombs to damage enemies and clear out parts of the room. Other methods of defeating enemies become possible as the character gains power-ups, items that are automatically worn by the player-character when picked up that can alter the character's core attributes, such as increasing health or the strength of each tear, or cause additional side effects, such as for allowing charged tear shots to be fired after holding down a controller button for a short while, or a means to fire tears behind the character. Power-ups include passive items that improve the character's attributes automatically, active power-ups that can be used once before they are recharged by completing additional rooms in the dungeon, and <b>single-use</b> power-ups such as pills or Tarot cards that confer a one-time benefit when used, such as regaining full health, or increasing or decreasing all attributes of the character. The effect of power-ups stack, so that the player may come into highly-beneficial power-up combinations.|$|E
25|$|Single use kits – Apheresis is done using <b>single-use</b> kits, {{so there}} is no risk of {{infection}} from blood-contaminated tubing or centrifuge.|$|E
25|$|Cash fares (<b>single-use</b> Compass tickets) {{purchased}} at ticket machines in stations on Sea Island include an AddFare of $5.00 {{on top of}} the normal fare. This charge is also added to trips initiated on Sea Island that travel east beyond Sea Island using Compass Card Stored Value or DayPasses. It is not applied to trips using monthly passes, nor to trips using DayPasses or <b>single-use</b> Compass tickets which were purchased outside the Airport Zone. The AddFare came into effect on January 18, 2010. The revenue collected from the AddFare goes back to TransLink.|$|E
25|$|UC Davis {{became the}} first {{university}} to implement requiring payment of a fee for all <b>single-use</b> bags distributed on campus; it is working {{to become the first}} university campus to ban plastic bags entirely.|$|E
25|$|Single journey tokens: These <b>single-use</b> RFID tokens can {{be bought}} from ticket vending {{machines}} in each station. They are valid only {{on the day of}} purchase and replaced the existing magnetic cards in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Insulin {{is usually}} taken as {{subcutaneous}} injections by <b>single-use</b> syringes with needles, via an insulin pump, or by repeated-use insulin pens with disposable needles. Inhaled insulin {{is also available}} in the U.S. market now.|$|E
25|$|Reusable {{products}} {{need to be}} {{more durable}} than <b>single-use</b> products, and hence require more material per item. This is particularly significant if only a small proportion of the reusable products are in fact reused.|$|E
25|$|In 2017 Greenpeace {{published}} a report criticizing Coca-Cola's use of <b>single-use</b> plastic bottles. The report is especially {{critical of the}} companies failing to reach the goals it set to source 25% of its bottles from recycled or renewable sources, and the non-existence of targets to reduce its use of <b>single-use</b> bottles since then. Greenpeace also claims that Coca-Cola has actively lobbied against recycling and deposit return schemes in several European countries, {{while at the same}} time maintaining a green marketing facade with vague promises and false-solutions such as sizable donations to schemes that put the emphasis of anti-littering on the consumer, instead of the producer of the litter itself.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} {{conventional}} reuse is the doorstep delivery of milk in refillable bottles; other {{examples include the}} retreading of tires {{and the use of}} returnable/reusable plastic boxes, shipping containers, instead of <b>single-use</b> corrugated fiberboard boxes.|$|E
25|$|A {{respirator}} is {{a device}} {{designed to protect}} the wearer from inhaling particulate matter, including airborne microorganisms, fumes, vapours, i.e. gases. Respirators range from relatively inexpensive <b>single-use,</b> disposable face masks to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges and are used by the military, private industry and the public.|$|E
25|$|Some of the university's notable {{research}} achievements {{include the}} world's first IVF pregnancy, the first seatbelt legislation, {{the discovery of}} the anti-influenza drug Relenza (Zanamivir), the discovery that nerve stem cells could be derived from embryonic stem cells {{and the development of a}} <b>single-use</b> oral anti-malaria drug.|$|E
25|$|Graveyard: A player's discard pile. When a card on the {{battlefield}} is destroyed, a card is discarded from hand, or after a <b>single-use</b> card is used, it is put in its owner's graveyard. These cards are face up, and can be examined by any player at any time.|$|E
25|$|Automated patch clamp {{systems have}} {{recently}} been developed, in order to collect large amounts of data inexpensively in a shorter period of time. Such systems typically include a <b>single-use</b> microfluidic device, either an injection molded or a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cast chip, to capture a cell or cells, and an integrated electrode.|$|E
25|$|A {{respirator}} is a {{piece of}} protective respiratory equipment designed to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful particulate matter (as in dusts, including airborne microorganisms), fumes, vapors, or gases. They range from relatively inexpensive <b>single-use,</b> disposable masks to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges, and are used by the military, private industry and the public.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Gatwick {{became the}} first single runway airport to handle more than 40million {{passengers}} annually. By 2016, EasyJet accounted for over 40% of Gatwick's total passengers. When ranked by global passenger traffic, Gatwick is 35th busiest internationally and the eighth busiest airport in Europe. Gatwick is the world's leading low-cost airport and until March 2017 had the world's busiest <b>single-use</b> runway, with a maximum of 55 aircraft movements per hour.|$|E
25|$|Shopping {{bags are}} {{medium-sized}} bags, typically around 10-20 litres (2.5 to 5 gallons) in volume, {{that are often}} used by grocery shoppers to carry home their purchases. They can be <b>single-use</b> (disposable), used for other purposes or designed as reusable shopping bags. The grocery bag with handles was invented in 1918 by Walter Deubener of St. Paul Minnesota. U.S. patent #1,305,198 was issued to Deubener on May 27, 1919.|$|E
25|$|Citric acid is {{commonly}} used as a buffer to increase the solubility of brown heroin. <b>Single-use</b> citric acid sachets {{have been used as}} an inducement to get heroin users to exchange their dirty needles for clean needles in an attempt to decrease the spread of HIV and hepatitis. Other acidifiers used for brown heroin are ascorbic acid, acetic acid, and lactic acid; in their absence, a drug user will often substitute lemon juice or vinegar.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} method of {{tattooing}} {{in modern times}} is the electric tattoo machine, which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle {{or a group of}} needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles {{in and out of the}} skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second. The needles are <b>single-use</b> needles that come packaged individually.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} {{application}} areas for <b>single-use</b> medically approved PVC compounds are flexible containers and tubing: containers used for blood and blood components, for urine collection or for ostomy products and tubing used for blood taking and blood giving sets, catheters, heart-lung bypass sets, hemodialysis sets etc. In Europe {{the consumption of}} PVC for medical devices is approximately 85,000 tons each year. Almost one third of plastic-based medical devices are made from PVC.|$|E
25|$|Intermittent urinary {{catheterization}} is used {{to relieve}} the bladder in people with urinary retention. Self-catheterization is an option in BPH when the bladder is difficult or impossible to completely empty. Urinary tract infection {{is the most common}} complication of intermittent catheterization. Several techniques and types of catheter are available, including sterile (<b>single-use)</b> and clean (multiple use) catheters, but none is superior to others in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infection based on current information.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical filter {{respirators}} retain {{particulate matter}} such as dust created during woodworking or metal processing, when contaminated air is {{passed through the}} filter material. Wool is still used today as a filter, along with plastic, glass, cellulose, and combinations {{of two or more}} of these materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. <b>Single-use,</b> disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.|$|E
25|$|The K-1 is the world’s first fully {{reusable}} aerospace vehicle, {{designed to}} deliver payloads to orbit {{and provide a}} low-cost alternative to <b>single-use</b> launch vehicles. The company intends the K-1 rocketships to become the reliable, low-cost providers of launch services for commercial and government payloads destined for Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), {{as well as for}} cargo resupply and recovery flights to and from the International Space Station (ISS).|$|E
25|$|PayPal {{acquired}} the VeriSign payment solution in 2005 {{to expand its}} e-commerce business and provide added security support. In 2007, PayPal announced a partnership with MasterCard {{that led to the}} development and launch of the PayPal Secure Card service, a software that allows customers to make payments on websites that do not accept PayPal directly by generating a unique, <b>single-use</b> MasterCard number for each checkout. By the end of 2007, the company generated $1.8 billion in revenue.|$|E
25|$|Acupuncture is {{generally}} safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and <b>single-use</b> needles. When properly delivered, {{it has a}} low rate of mostly minor adverse effects. Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect of the practitioner. A review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade. The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections. Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, {{it is recommended that}} acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{requires}} breaking the skin barrier, tattooing carries health risks including infection and allergic reactions. Tattooing can be uncomfortable to excruciating {{depending on the}} area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with <b>single-use</b> items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have blood-borne pathogen training such as that provided through the Red Cross and OSHA. As of 2009 (in the United States) {{there have been no}} reported cases of HIV contracted from tattoos.|$|E
25|$|In {{its efforts}} to become a cleaner, greener city, Brownsville {{became one of the}} first cities in the U.S. and Texas to require stores to charge a fee for <b>single-use</b> plastic {{shopping}} bags. In its first five years, approximately $3.8 million was collected. Funds have been used for city beautification and maintenance projects. This has led other cities in the area to also consider such a fee. Forbes has identified Brownsville as one of 12 metropolitan areas in the U.S. with the cleanest air; Laredo was the only other Texas metropolitan area to be among the 12.|$|E
25|$|Of course glass {{containers}} {{can also}} be reused, and in developing countries this is common, however {{the environmental impact of}} washing the container as against remelting them is uncertain. Factors to consider here are the chemicals and fresh water used in the washing, and the fact that a <b>single-use</b> container can be made much lighter, using less than half the glass (and therefore energy content) of a multiuse container. Also, a significant factor in the developed world's consideration of reuse are producer concerns over the risk and consequential product liability of using a component (the reused container) of unknown and unqualified safety.|$|E
25|$|Since tattoo {{instruments}} come {{in contact}} with blood and bodily fluids, diseases may be transmitted if the instruments are used on more than one person without being sterilised. However, infection from tattooing in clean and modern tattoo studios employing <b>single-use</b> needles is rare. With amateur tattoos, such as those applied in prisons, however, there is an elevated risk of infection. To address this problem, a programme was introduced in Canada as of the summer of 2005 that provides legal tattooing in prisons, both to reduce health risks and to provide inmates with a marketable skill. Inmates were to be trained to staff and operate the tattoo parlours once six of them opened successfully.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses {{are often}} {{categorized}} by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because {{they do not}} have to stand up to the wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. <b>Single-use</b> lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.|$|E
25|$|A rocket-propelled grenade (often {{abbreviated}} RPG) is a shoulder-fired, {{anti-tank weapon}} system which fires rockets {{equipped with an}} explosive warhead. These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor and stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are reloadable while others are <b>single-use.</b> RPGs, {{with the exception of}} self-contained versions, are loaded from the muzzle. RPGs are very effective against armored vehicles such as armoured personnel carriers (APCs). The German Panzerfaust were the originals RPG's while a Soviet-development, the RPG-7, is the most widely distributed and used RPG in the world. The basic design of this RPG was developed by the Soviets shortly after World War II {{in the form of the}} RPG-2, which is similar in function to the Bazooka and the Panzerfaust.|$|E
