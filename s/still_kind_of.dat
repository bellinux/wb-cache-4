500|$|... "Jump the Shark" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz; it was {{directed}} by Cliff Bole. The episode proved difficult to make. After the cancellation of The Lone Gunmen television series, which aired in 2001, Fox reportedly [...] "hated [...] characters". Executive producer and co-writer Frank Spotnitz had to fight to get the episode made; the studio informed Spotnitz {{that they did not}} want to bring the characters back in any capacity in the ninth season. Actor Bruce Harwood later explained that [...] "I think if the studio objected to anything, it was wasting time on our characters long enough to kill us off." [...] Co-writer Gilligan later recalled [...] "The Lone Gunmen was <b>still</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> an open wound for me." [...] Thus, the episode was crafted as a way to wrap up the series. Due to the nature of the episode—which effectively works as a tie-in—various long-term characters from both The X-Files and The Lone Gunmen make cameo appearances.|$|E
500|$|... "Outrageous" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Mim Udovitch of Blender called the song an [...] "R. Kelly club number, [...] has a hot, odd compulsion and lyrics that are practically big-pimpin', Spears-style". William Shaw of Blender selected {{it as the}} ninth best Spears song, highlighting [...] "the nonsense chants" [...] at 1:10. While reviewing , Ann Powers commented, [...] "'Outrageous' is R. Kelly's dirty little take on the ideal Janet Jackson song". Spence D. of IGN said of the song that [...] "it's a somewhat derivative Egyptian lover groove number. Yet for all [...] repetitiveness, it's <b>still</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> funky and pervasive". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it [...] " [...] composition that cruises along on autopilot for two minutes and then suddenly switches gears with a delectable Michael Jackson-inspired bridge". Annabel Leathes of BBC Online stated that [...] "R. Kelly transform Britney into a grubby Beyoncé". Caryn Ganz of Spin called [...] "Outrageous" [...] a [...] "go-nowhere homage to living fabulously". Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic called it [...] "a forgettable but nonetheless catchy single". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that along with [...] "(I Got That) Boom Boom", [...] " [...] {{are little more than}} wobbly, rhythm-based contraptions intended to advance Spears' sex-princess-on-the-loose image". Jamie Gill of Yahoo! Music Radio commented that, [...] "with its cheap, tinny production– it would take a rather senile and unworldly old lady in Tonbridge Wells [...] to find this even diverting, let alone shocking".|$|E
500|$|Of the {{remaining}} songs, Rachel and Finn's performance of [...] "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" [...] attracted praise for Monteith's vocals, which Stack and Yahr commented [...] "sounded better than ever". [...] "Le Jazz Hot!" [...] received a split response. Burns wrote that Kurt [...] "pulled it off flawlessly", and Fallon called the performance [...] "far more moving and rousing" [...] {{than any of}} the songs in [...] "Grilled Cheesus". Stack and Benigno both graded it [...] "B+"; the latter deemed it [...] "very good" [...] but [...] "not transcendent". Reiter felt that the costumes and choreography overpowered the emotion of the piece, and Futterman found the number [...] "too self-indulgent and reminiscent of previous performances like 'Rose's Turn'." [...] Berk rated it two stars out of five, and commented, [...] "I get the idea, and the execution is commendable, but it <b>still</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sucked." [...] Rachel and Finn's deliberately offensive version of [...] "With You I'm Born Again" [...] received a [...] "C" [...] and [...] "C+" [...] from Benigno and Stack respectively. Both conceded that it was acceptable vocally, but as Stack acknowledged, [...] "the point of this song was to hate it, and I gotta say, Glee: you played me like a fiddle." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named their rendition one of Glee worst performances. Regardless of being a send-up, Respers France found the number [...] "oddly endearing".|$|E

500|$|... "TS-19" [...] {{garnered}} favorable {{reviews from}} most television critics. In his 8.5 out of 10 rating review, Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode was an exceptional showing for the series, adding that it told [...] "a compelling, intense story within its hour" [...] albeit averting from the comics. As Michelle Kung of The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "The first season of The Walking Dead doesn’t exactly end on an optimistic note, but our heroes are left driving into the unknown after escaping certain death at the CDC." [...] Kurt Christenson of New York Daily News analyzed that [...] "almost and everyone's <b>still</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> in the dark", and Kelly stated that [...] "TS-19" [...] came to an [...] "abrupt, explosive end". Salon journalist Simon Abrams concluded that the frenetic pace of The Walking Dead was relatable, while Paste television commentator Josh Jackson was keen of the character development in the episode {{as well as the}} varying political themes covered; [...] "After six episodes, the characters are worth caring about. Despite occasional stilted monologues, quick tempers and unfortunate stereotypes, the few living souls in The Walking Dead are a bigger draw than the undead. The show has spent more time on topics like marriage, parenthood, unfaithfulness, loss, domestic violence, gender roles, small-scale politics, loyalty, kindness than it has with kill shots. By filling the world with zombies, Frank Darabont is able to explore the human condition under extreme circumstances." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson was entertained by [...] "TS-19", and asserted that the conclusion [...] "resonated over images of Rick & Co. U-turning into the great unknown, we got the sense that {{as long as they were}} alive, at least there was a chance of a tomorrow." [...] Writing for the same publication, Jeff Jensen was intrigued at how producers approached the themes of the comics, and later noted that it was proof that they were using the comics as a route for thematic inspiration in lieu of a literal interpretation. For Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre, [...] "Tonight's finale [...] did yield much insight, though, into the nature of the plague itself, in relative terms anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, in 2005, fans used a poll on Marvel's website to {{vote for}} the character's return. This led to a third version of Death's Head, Death's Head 3.0, created by {{original}} Death's Head writer Simon Furman. Simon Furman said in 2011 that the character was still popular because “he’ll never change or compromise or grow or repent or agonise like most comic book characters. He’s this unchanging, uncompromising rock that other characters bounce off. But you <b>still</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> love him. Weird.” ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the period}} of filming, Murray {{was in the midst}} of marital {{problems}} and several crew reported his attitude as erratic. Murray had wanted to make the film less of a comedy as to make it more contemplative, against Ramis' own direction to keep it as a comedy. Rather than to handle Murray's constant phone calls, Ramis had Murray work with Rubin in New York City directly to adjust the script to satisfy Murray's requests. Actor Stephen Tobolowsky described the script changes: [...] "When I got the part, it was <b>still</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a mediocre Bill Murray movie," [...] he said. [...] "You know, Bill Murray, with no consequences, in comic situations ... It wasn’t until we got into the shooting that everything turned on its head. And it became not only a good movie, not only a great movie, but a classic." ...|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "I'll Do It" [...] was {{described}} as Montag getting [...] "racy" [...] due to the song's sexually explicit lyrics stating to [...] "come eat my panties off of me." [...] Montag addressed the issue by stating [...] "I love it. I'm a very sexual person and I'm married, so it's okay. I think every woman ... has an alter ego. We all have that really sexual, fun side. I just thought the lyrics were so fun and so sexy. They empower women. That song, when my friends hear it, they feel sexier. They have more fun, because the song is like, 'I'll do whatever you want, but I'm <b>still</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> in charge here.'

2500|$|Upon its release, Doctor's Advocate {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. It received an average score of 73 out of 100 based on 20 reviews. Allmusic writer David Jeffries wrote {{that while the}} album [...] "is nothing new" [...] from The Documentary, [...] "the fact remains that every track here {{is as good as}} or better than those on his debut." [...] Entertainment Weekly disagreed, saying [...] "it doesn't live up to the nihilistic brilliance" [...] of his previous album. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone stated that the album [...] "isn't the classic that message boards are calling it, but it is a middling yet pleasurable record." [...] Hoard also wrote that [...] "lyrically, it's a mixed bag. The Game is <b>still</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> corny, but his skills have improved... He's more nimble and more assured than before, and he switches up his flow more often".|$|E
2500|$|Given the Democratic {{resistance}} {{coupled with}} Holsinger's lack {{of response to}} the committee's questions after more than ten months, in June 2008, thirteen months after his nomination, Kentucky Senator Jim Bunning, a Holsinger supporter, suggested the nomination was dead which the White House and fellow Kentucky Senator and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denied. The political scientist Norman Ornstein said, [...] "It's extremely unusual for somebody not to answer questions. It's a big fat 'dis' of the committee and of the Senate.

2500|$|In {{terms of}} genre elements, Damon Lindelof has stated that, [...] "We sort of suckered people into this show [...] not {{presenting}} it {{as a science}} fiction show {{right out of the}} gate … Lost has really been about the long con, because {{by the time we get}} to season 6, it's going to be...crazy!"s Past and Future]", IGN. [...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox. [...] Paradox creates issues." [...] Actor Terry O'Quinn has divulged that [...] "it is revealed who Locke actually is.
