50|$|A {{child safety}} seat (infant safety seat, child {{restraint}} system, child seat, baby seat, restraining car seat, car seat, etc.) is a seat {{designed specifically to}} protect children from injury or death during collisions. Most commonly these seats are purchased and installed by consumers, but car manufacturers may integrate them directly into their vehicle's design and generally are required to provide anchors and to ensure seat belt compatibility. Many jurisdictions require children defined by age, weight, and/or height to use a government-approved child safety seat when riding in a vehicle. Child safety seats provide passive restraints and must be properly used to be effective. However, research indicates many child safety restraints are often not used properly. To tackle this negative trend, health officials and child safety experts produce child safety videos to teach proper car <b>seat</b> <b>installation</b> to parents and caregivers.|$|E

Even though restraint laws are in place and public awareness campaigns and educational interventions have increased, many children are still improperly restrained or not restrained at all. When correctly used, child restraints significantly reduce risk of injury or death. Methods: The {{purpose of the study}} was to elicit caregiver baseline knowledge of car <b>seat</b> <b>installation</b> and regulation before receiving car seat education from certified technicians at Inspection Station events. Inspection Station is a program whereby staff assists parents in correctly positioning car seats in participants&rsquo; vehicles. Over an 8 -week period, Safe Kids Cobb County Car Seat Technicians distributed a 16 -item survey, with 10 knowledge-based questions and six demographic questions to Inspection Station participants. Descriptive statistics and t-tests were conducted to assess relationships between participant age, ethnicity, and gender with overall knowledge scores. Regression analysis was run to determine the association between participant education level and total child restraint knowledge. Results: One hundred sixty-nine surveys were completed. Participant knowledge of vehicular child restraint ranged from 0 % to 90 % on all items. Only 29. 6 % of caregivers understood the proper tightness of the harness system. Less than half of the caregivers (43. 8 %) were aware of the Georgia law requiring children aged 6 years and younger to be in some type of child restraint. Only 43. 2 % of caregivers surveyed knew that children need to ride in a rear-facing child restraint until 1 year of age and 20 pounds. No significant correlations between participant knowledge and age were found. Statistically significant associations were found between total knowledge scores and education level, ethnicity, and gender. Discussion: The results from this study describe baseline knowledge among a sample of participants at Inspection Station activities held in Cobb County, Georgia. These results can help inform tailoring of future programming so that the impact of enhanced health education/prevention messages for intended populations can be maximized and health child injury risk related to improper restraints can be minimized.

50|$|Retro-styled (color-coded with chromed buckles) 2-point and 3-point seat (safety) belts are {{manufactured}} according to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). However, most classic car bodies (manufactured before the late 1960s) {{did not include}} safety belts as standard equipment, and do not include readily available reinforced mounting points, on the vehicle body, therefore it can be problematic to install such equipment properly: specific studies and calculations should be performed before any attempts. Proper installation is critical, which means locating attachment points on the body/frame, assuring the strength by proper reinforcement, and following the <b>seat</b> belt <b>installation</b> instructions properly {{to reduce the risk}} of malfunction or failure. Some classic car owners are reluctant to retrofit seat belts for the loss of originality this modification implies.

50|$|In 1995, Dodge {{introduced}} {{a system of}} <b>seats</b> to simplify <b>installation,</b> removal, and re-positioning, marketed as Easy-Out Roller Seats. When installed, the seats are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks have locator depressions for rollers, to simplify installation. Ergonomic levers at the seat backs release the floor latches single-handedly, without tools, and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seat backs were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks are permanently attached {{to the floor and}} seat stanchions are aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.|$|R
40|$|This thesis' {{work has}} been {{conducted}} at and made possible by Autoliv Sverige AB in Vårgårda. The aim of this thesis is to study how the occupant experience of the belt changes when it is moved from a traditional installation point in the car's B-pillar, to the seat. This shall be studied {{in terms of how}} the perceived comfort is influenced by a belt in seat in an upright and a reclined seat back position of 20 and 45 degrees, for different sizes of occupants. Also how the ability to reach a belt in seat is affected by the size and mobility of the occupant. Based on this new knowledge, an optimal outlet position for a belt in seat shall be proposed, from a comfort perspective. The work has used a cross-sectional research approach to achieve its purpose. Through the cross-sectional approach, several different qualitative and quantitative methods have been used. Initially, a literature study where subjects relevant to the forthcoming study was studied. Meanwhile, a competitive analysis of existing belt in <b>seat</b> <b>installations</b> in new cars available on the market was planned and carried out. In the main element of this work, a two-part comfort and mobility study with a belt in seat was performed. The study combined the methods interview, survey and observation. Through the interview, qualitative questions were asked as a complement to the quantitative responses given by the test subjects on scales in the survey. Observations were used to observe the subjects' behavior and difficulties regarding the belt in seat. A major limitation {{of the results of the}} study is the deficient distribution of sitting heights and genders in the group of test subjects, which founded a certain bias in the results. This has been the reason why it has not been possible to draw any certain conclusions from the results, however, some trends have been seen. The comfort study revealed several different assessments of the belt that contributed to discomfort, including the perception of the belt being too close to the neck or too far out on the shoulder. Additionally, the discomfort significantly impaired when the seat was reclined to the relaxed state. The mobility study showed that more subjects felt limited by their own bodies in the movement than by the belt. In addition did the reversed belt geometry create large discomfort issues at the neck. An important conclusion of this thesis is that the seat's design is as important to the customer experience of discomfort of the belt as the positioning of the outlet. It has also become clear that the accessibility of a belt in seat is strongly limited, as it was tested in this study...|$|R
50|$|Dating back {{as early}} as 1885, seat belts were first {{patented}} by Edward J. Claghorn. In 1955, Ford began offering the lap belt in their automobiles. Saab then began to manufacture their entire range of automobiles with seat belts; most importantly the Saab GT750, launched in 1958. From this model, the practice of <b>seat</b> belt <b>installation</b> then became a competitive advantage to the industry but still did not seem essential to the consumers. Forward, this popular technique became standard in most U.S. automobiles. By 1965, front lap seat belts were produced in several models, by 1968 front shoulder and rear lap belts were introduced, and in 1974 three point front lap belts were adopted in most automobiles. The first United States Federal law pertaining {{to the use of}} seat belts became effective January 1, 1968 {{with the help of the}} U.S. Department of Transportation which was created two years prior. The law has since been modified but currently requires all vehicles to be produced with three-point seat belts in all seating areas. The use and legality of seat belts varies from state to state, with the first state to pass the law requiring all passengers to wear a seat belt being New York on December 1, 1984. Currently, there are no countries whose automobiles do not offer seat belts and it is a standardized practice world wide.|$|R
