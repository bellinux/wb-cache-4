50|$|The {{impeller}} in a DGF pump {{is designed}} with dual sides. One side {{is designed to}} drive the liquid like a normal centrifugal pump {{and the other side}} is designed to draw vapor into the pump and mix it with the liquid. In addition to the new impeller, a special seal was invented to extend the life of the pump. With these innovations the pump creates a sub-atmospheric pressure region within the pump's <b>seal</b> <b>chamber.</b> As the impeller draws in the vapor it is mixed with the liquid being pumped and compressed into micro-fine bubbles. Because of the close tolerance between the backvanes of the impeller and the backplate of the pump the vapor is sheared into fine bubbles and then they are compressed in the sub-atmospheric pressure region of the pump. These fine bubbles become dissolved into the liquid within the volute of the pump.|$|E

5000|$|A chest {{drainage}} system is typically {{used to collect}} chest drainage (air, blood, effusions). Most commonly, {{drainage system}}s use three chambers {{which are based on}} the three-bottle system. The first chamber allows fluid that is drained from the chest to be collected. The second chamber functions as a [...] "water seal", which acts as a one way valve allowing gas to escape, but not reenter the chest. Air bubbling through the water <b>seal</b> <b>chamber</b> is usual when the patient coughs or exhales but may indicate, if continual, a pleural or system leak that should be evaluated critically. It can also indicate a leak of air from the lung. The third chamber is the suction control chamber. The height of the water in this chamber regulates the negative pressure applied to the system. A gentle bubbling through the water column minimizes evaporation of the fluid and indicates that the suction is being regulated to the height of the water column. In this way, increased wall suction does not increase the negative pressure of the system. Newer drainage systems eliminate the water seal using a mechanical check-valve, and some also use a mechanical regulator to regulate the suction pressure. Systems which employ both these are dubbed [...] "dry" [...] systems, whereas systems that retain the water seal but use a mechanical regulator are called [...] "wet-dry" [...] systems. Systems which use a water seal and water column regulator are called [...] "wet" [...] systems. Dry systems are advantageous as tip-overs of wet systems can spill and mix with blood, mandating the replacement of the system. Even newer systems are smaller and more ambulatory so the patient can be sent home for drainage if indicated.|$|E

Realizable k-epsilon model was used for turbulence modeling. Radiation heat losses were taken into account. The temperature distribution at seal region is predicted with respect to heat addition.

40|$|LectureHeat soak {{is defined}} as heat {{transfer}} from the metal of a <b>seal</b> <b>chamber</b> to the fluid within the <b>seal</b> <b>chamber.</b> Many variables affect heat soak including materials, surface configurations, and film coefficients. Heat soak can be from the <b>seal</b> <b>chamber</b> to the fluid within, or from the fluid to the <b>seal</b> <b>chamber.</b> Typically, the term heat soak is used to describe heat transfer from a hot pump to a cooler liquid within the <b>seal</b> <b>chamber.</b> During {{the development of the}} API 682 seal standard (2004), the API 682 Task Force adopted an equation for estimating heat soak but recommended that the coefficients in the equation should be based on tests. However, there are still little data available and most users simply estimate heat soak using the API 682 default values. For a number of service conditions, the API 682 default equation produces unnecessarily high estimates for heat soak but default estimates are not always high. As a result, auxiliary systems can be incorrectly sized by using the API 682 default equation for heat soak. Improvements are needed in the API 682 heat soak equation. The first step toward improving the API 682 heat soak equation was to use simple one-dimensional find theory to derive a heat transfer equation. Surprisingly, this one-dimensional fin equation could be recast into a form that approximated the API equation but included additional parameters. The theoretical fin equation was checked and further improved using two-dimensional finite element analysis and again by using computational fluid dynamics. The predicted heat transfer compares favorably to measurements in the test lab. Based on these studies, the authors have prepared and offer a table of adjustment factors to be applied to the default API 682 heat soak equation...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 17 Since the {{introduction}} of noncontacting, gas lubricated, dual pressurized mechanical seals for process pumps over five years ago, and they have primarily been applied to ANSI pumps and other applications where the barrier pressure was below 300 psig. This pressure limit was not due to a limitation in material strength or face pattern technology as noncontacting seals have been applied in compressors at pressures well above this. The challenge came in fitting a dual pressurized cartridge seal into the limited size seal cavity available in most process pumps. The radial and axial dimensions of a pump <b>seal</b> <b>chamber</b> limit {{the size and shape}} of the seal faces as well as the supporting hardware needed to make a convenient cartridge seal design. A pressure responsive primary sealing ring geometry has been developed to allow a dual pressurized sealing arrangement to routinely handle pressures up to 600 psig.

Double end face mechanical seals lubricated by oil were selected to stop the isobutane from leaking out of the closed loop system and into the atmosphere. Two of the largest providers of mechanical seals in the world provided reference lists showing that this application was pushing the tip speed limits for existing liquid end face mechanical seals. A vendor was selected and the seals were purchased. The first run of the seals on the test stand seemed successful, until the disassembly of the unit revealed the faces were severely overheated and heat checked. The face design was changed and the second test was successful. A major concern was to maintain a low seal leakage rate, so this was measured and was within the specified range. However, the third test resulted in a catastrophic failure of the rotating faces and collateral damage to the entire seal cartridge. Detailed investigation of the failure revealed several interesting problem areas. All of these were addressed in a new design which was implemented, built, and shipped in only one week!
