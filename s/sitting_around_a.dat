In the first, a hunter (uncredited actor) straps a 16-gauge shotgun around his shoulder, and tracks {{footsteps}} through the snow, eventually finding the Swamplord (the band's mascot, here as depicted {{on the covers}} of The Black Waltz and For the Revolution). In the second narrative, the band members, dressed warmly in heavy clothing, are <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> campfire, preparing a kettle of an unknown drink. As each person takes a sip, they begin convulsing. To simulate the drink's effects, the camera used shaking and rapid zooming.

Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of her are shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock.

On {{each of the five}} days preceding the video's premiere, One Direction posted a teaser trailer of the video online.

The video opens with One Direction spending time on a Malibu, California beach intercut with scenes of them driving an orange campervan.

500|$|Orci said getting Nimoy in {{the film}} was important. [...] "Having him <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> camp fire sharing his {{memories}} was never gonna cut it" [...] though, and time travel {{was going to be}} included {{in the film}} from the beginning. Kurtzman added, saying the time travel creates jeopardy, unlike other prequels where viewers [...] "know how they all died". The writers acknowledged time travel had been overused in the other series, but it served a good purpose in creating a new set of adventures for the original characters before they could completely do away with it in other films. Abrams selected the Romulans as the villains because they had been featured less than the Klingons in the series, and thought it was [...] "fun" [...] to have them meet Kirk before they do in the series. Orci and Kurtzman noted it would feel backward to demonize the Klingons again after they had become heroes in later Star Trek series, and the Romulan presence continues Spock's story from his last chronological appearance in [...] "", an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation set in 2368. The episode of the original continuity in which Kirk becomes the first human to ever see a Romulan, [...] "Balance of Terror", served as one of the influences for the film. Orci said it was difficult giving a good explanation for the time travel without being gimmicky, like having Nero specifically seeking to assassinate Kirk.|$|E

These people need to match Leona’s vibe and {{need to be able to}} have fun." [...] It was also noted that models applying to be in the video should have an Abercrombie & Fitch style about them, and that [...] "small tattoos" [...] were acceptable. For the most part of the video, Lewis is featured on a beach in a variety of different settings, such as sitting in an old cabriolet car, in which she is surrounded by her friends. Sitting in the car, Lewis wears a polka dot bikini top. Other scenes include Lewis standing in the shallow part of the ocean by herself, as well as <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> fire on the beach.

500|$|Work {{continued}} on the screenplay from 2003 onwards, {{taking place in}} the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. The writers spent six months discussing a plot, and each of them offered sketchy ideas. Jean suggested the family rescue manatees, which became the 2005 episode [...] "The Bonfire of the Manatees", and there was also a notion similar to that of The Truman Show where the characters discovered their lives were a TV show. Groening rejected this, as he felt that the Simpsons should [...] "never become aware of themselves as celebrities", but the idea was later used in the video game The Simpsons Game. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. The decision for Flanders to have an important role also came early on, as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father. Hank Scorpio, a character from the 1996 episode [...] "You Only Move Twice", was originally meant to return as the main antagonist, but the staff dropped the idea and created Russ Cargill instead. Having eventually decided on the basic outline of the plot for the film, the writers then separated it into seven sections. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin, and Meyer wrote 25 pages each, and the group met one month later to merge the seven sections into one [...] "very rough draft". The film's script was written {{in the same way as}} the television series: the writers <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> table, pitching ideas, and trying to make each other laugh. The script went through over 100 revisions, and at one point the film was a musical. However, the songs were continually being shortened and the idea was dropped. Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, saying that he wanted to [...] "give you something that you haven't seen before".|$|E
