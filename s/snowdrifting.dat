40|$|Blowing and {{drifting}} snow {{has been a}} problem for the highway maintenance engineer virtually since the inception of the automobile. In the early days, highway engineers were limited in their capability to design and construct drift free roadway cross sections, and the driving public tolerated the delays associated with snow storms. Modern technology, however, has long since provided the design expertise, financial resources, and construction capability for creating relatively snowdrift free highways, and the driver today has come to expect a highway facility that is free of snowdrifts, and if drifts develop they expect highway maintenance crews to open the highway within a short time. Highway administrators have responded to this charge for better control of <b>snowdrifting.</b> Modern highway designs in general provide an aerodynamic cross section that inhibits the deposition of snow on the roadway insofar as it is economically feasible to do so...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: During the ‘Little Ice Age ’ (LIA), the {{periglacial}} {{landscape in}} northeast Greenland responded rela-tively {{quickly to the}} climatic deterioration with increased nivation activity. Resulting nivation landforms and associated sediment basins are used as palaeoclimatic archives, documenting the significant geomorphological effect of nivation during the LIA period in the Zackenberg area. A nival basin studied in detail showed the onset and dominance of niveo-fluvial sedimentation in the period ad 1250 – 1420, followed by increasing niveo-aeolian sedimentation between ad 1420 – 1500 / 1580. Finally, very rapid niveo-aeolian sedimentation prevailed during the period ad 1500 / 1580 – 1690. In the same period, some large nival fans accumulated in the Zackenberg lowland {{as a result of}} increased niveo-fluvial activity, and niveo-fluvial sediments were also deposited in pre-existing fluvial valleys, demonstrating the large areal extension of the nivation activity. The chronology is based on nine AMS 14 C determinations. The intense geomorphological terrestrial activity in northeast Greenland during the LIA is deduced to be primarily due to increased winter wind speeds enabling larger snowpatches to accumulate as a result of increased <b>snowdrifting...</b>|$|E

The site is characterised by a relatively mild, wet and windy climate, so <b>snowdrift</b> is a common phenomenon. The modelled timing and frequency of <b>snowdrift</b> events compares well with observations. This is further illustrated by an additional simulation for Kohnen base, where the timing of <b>snowdrift</b> is realistic, although the modelled horizontal transport is overestimated. <b>Snowdrift</b> sublimation is mainly dependent on wind speed, but also on relative humidity and temperature. During high wind speeds, SUds saturates and cools the air, limiting its own strength. We estimate that SUds removes around 16 %&plusmn; 8 % of the accumulated snow from the surface. The total sublimation more than triples when <b>snowdrift</b> is considered, although <b>snowdrift</b> sublimation limits sublimation at the surface.

40|$|Australian alpine {{ecosystems}} {{are expected to}} diminish in extent as global warming intensifies. Alpine vegetation patterns {{are influenced by the}} duration of snow cover including the presence of <b>snowdrifts</b> in summer, but there is little quantitative information on landscape-scale relationships between vegetation patterns and the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer <b>snowdrifts</b> in the Australian alps. We mapped annual changes in summer <b>snowdrifts</b> in the Kosciuszko alpine region, Australia, from Landsat TM images and modelled the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer <b>snowdrifts</b> from long-term records (1954 – 2003) of winter snow depth. We then compared vegetation composition and structure among four classes that differed in the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer <b>snowdrifts.</b> We found a curvilinear relationship between annual winter snow depth and the area occupied by persistent <b>snowdrifts</b> in the following summer (r 2 = 0. 9756). Only 21 ha (0. 42 % of study area) was predicted to have supported summer <b>snowdrifts</b> in 80 % of the past 50 years, while 440 ha supported persistent summer snow in 10 % of years. Mean cover and species richness of vascular plants declined significantly, and species composition varied significantly, as the frequency of summer snow persistence increased. Cushion plants and rushes were most abundant where summer <b>snowdrifts</b> occurred most frequently, and shrubs, grasses and sedges were most abundant in areas that did not support <b>snowdrifts</b> in summer. The results demonstrate strong regional relationships between vegetation composition and structure and the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer <b>snowdrifts.</b> Reductions in winter snow depth due to global warming are expected to lead to substantial reductions in the extent of persistent summer <b>snowdrifts.</b> As a consequence, shrubs, grasses and sedges are predicted to expand at the expense of cushion plants and rushes, reducing landscape vegetation diversity. Fortunately, few vascular plant species (e. g. Ranunculus niphophilus) appear to be totally restricted to areas where summer snow occurs most frequently. The results from this study highlight potential indicator species that could be monitored to assess the effects of global warming on Australian alpine environments. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The daily climatological record {{including}} snowcover water equivalent (SWE) {{was estimated}} for the Big Level Summit Plateau (BL), Gros Morne National Park, western Newfoundland, for the 1962 - 1999 study period. This was accomplished using widely known statistical techniques, i. e. {{multiple linear regression}} and mean ratios, linking the Big Level Autostation (1993 - 1999) record with the nearby low lying coastal stations records through the climate elements mentioned above. Physically based relationships were added for the snow model, {{which was based on}} the reconstructed climatological elements (temperature, wind speed and precipitation). [...] The BL daily temperature record (estimated for 1946 - 1999) and hourly wind speed record were estimated with multiple linear regression. Precipitation was estimated using mean ratios. The estimated BL winter precipitation record was separated into snowfall and rainfall and measured snowfall at BL was corrected for wind induced undercatch. Snowcover SWE was estimated with the estimated daily precipitation record and the temperature index method, using increasing degree-day factors as the snow season progressed. <b>Snowdrifting</b> off the plateau and sublimation of blowing snow were also estimated using simple expressions that were a function of wind speed. [...] Snowcover on BL is consistently present for long periods from year to year, although its thickness varies considerably compared with the coastal plain (BL maximum seasonal SWE varied from 110 mm to 1650 mm). The single largest factor influencing the snowcover SWE, other than the large amounts of snowfall, was found to be blowing snow sublimation, which ablates approximately 53 % of the snowfall accumulation on average. Another large factor influencing snowcover SWE is <b>snowdrifting</b> off the plateau, accounting for approximately 10 % of the average accumulated snowfall, leaving approximately 32 % to be ablated by melt. The months from February to June all showed negative significant trends with respect to mean BL SWE during the study period. There were no significant linear trends in the temperature record for the period of estimation, but there was a significant linear positive trend (95 % level) for the number of thawing degree-days using daily maximum temperature for the snow accumulation season (November-April) of 1. 3 - 1. 8 degree-days per year. [...] An anthropogenically induced warmer climate would lead to much thinner snowcovers existing during shorter periods, with snow seasons having reduced snowfall and increased rainfall values. The thinnest seasonal snowcovers of the recent past such as in the 1981 snow season could become above average if the IPCC climate change projections become reality...|$|E

This {{is an important}} issue for instance in the Massif Central (France) where limited snowfalls on vast areas can locally lead to huge snow accumulations. This problem is not new and prevention measures were designed and tested as early {{as the end of the}} 19 th century. However, the development of efficient snow clearing vehicles in the second half of the 20 th century led to some decrease of research efforts (mostly a trial and error approach) on traditional prevention measures such as afforestration and hedges. Nevertheless, the renewed interest in ecological engineering, dating from the early 90 s has yielded to new research efforts on that topic, even though such measures are not effective on short term. Currently, bioengineering tallies meet the requirements of sustainable development and of long term management, accordingly. In this context, this paper aims at giving a new vision of hedges and afforestration, taken as protection measures against <b>snowdrifting,</b> through the eyes of a fluid mechanics researcher, a forest engineer and a territories manager. The principles of action, setting and species choice are presented through case studies with emphasis on difficulties related to land property and long and short-term maintenance...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Computer {{modelling}} techniques, employing computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) and a finite area element model (FAE), were used to predict <b>snowdrift</b> deposition patterns around a new building at the South Pole Station, Antarctica. Through interpretation of the wind flow field predicted through CFD, <b>snowdrift</b> prone areas around an existing building, that is raised above the snow surface, were identified. The wind flow field, generated by CFD, was subsequently used as input to an FAE computer <b>snowdrift</b> prediction model. The characteristics of the drift deposition patterns predicted by the computer simulation techniques were in satisfactory agreement with <b>snowdrift</b> patterns measured around the existing reference building at the South Pole. It was concluded that the FAE model predicted realistic <b>snowdrift</b> accumulation patterns when CFD-predicted local wind velocity fields were combined with local meteorological data. ...|$|R
