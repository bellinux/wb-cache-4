5|$|Games between FBS and FCS teams {{typically}} {{result in}} lopsided victories for the FBS team, and the Appalachian State–Michigan game {{was not expected}} to be an exception. The predicted outcome was a lopsided victory for Michigan. Las Vegas sportsbooks did not give a betting line. The game was also the first to be broadcast on the then-new Big Ten Network. It began with a strong first half for Appalachian State, who held a 28–17 lead {{at the end of the}} half. Michigan regained the lead at 32–31 in the fourth quarter, but Appalachian State took the lead for a second time on a <b>short</b> <b>field</b> goal with 26seconds left. The Mountaineers blocked a game-winning field goal attempt from Michigan at the end of regulation to secure a 34–32 win.|$|E
5|$|Sapir also {{encouraged}} Whorf {{to continue his}} work on the historical and descriptive linguistics of Uto-Aztecan. Whorf published several articles on that topic in this period, some of them with G. L. Trager, who had become his close friend. Whorf took a special interest in the Hopi language and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village living in Manhattan, New York. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a <b>short</b> <b>field</b> trip to the village of Mishongnovi, on the Second Mesa of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} involved was a Boeing737-8HG(SFP) {{was one of}} the few 737's with <b>Short</b> <b>Field</b> Performance {{package to}} use for landing in an airports with short runways, with the aircraft registration VT–AXV and manufacturer's serial number 36333, line number 2481. The aircraft first flew on 20 December 2007 with the Boeing test registration N1787B and was delivered a month later. The crew consisted of Captain Zlatko Glušica, First Officer Harbinder Singh Ahluwalia and four flight attendants. Glušica {a former employee of Jat Airways of Serbia}, aged 55, a British and Serbian national with over 10,000 hours of flying and over 7,500 hours of command experience, and Ahluwalia (a former employee of Jet Airways who joined Air India Express in 2009). Both pilots were based in Mangalore and they were both killed in the crash.|$|E

5|$|On McGovern's December 15 mission over Linz, {{his second}} as pilot, {{a piece of}} {{shrapnel}} from flak came through the windshield and missed fatally wounding him by only a few inches. The following day {{on a mission to}} Brüx, he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover. The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane. On a December 20 mission against the Škoda Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, McGovern's plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on Vis, a small island in the Adriatic Sea off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by Josip Broz Tito's Partisans. The <b>short</b> <b>field,</b> normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft that many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished. But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
5|$|The Browns' first {{opponents in}} the 1986 playoffs were the New York Jets. The Jets were ahead {{for most of the}} game and held a 20–10 lead as time wound down in the final quarter. But Cleveland took over and began a march down the field, ending with a Kevin Mack touchdown. The defense forced the Jets to punt after the ensuing kickoff, leaving the offense with less than a minute to get within field goal range and even the score at 20–20. A pass {{interference}} penalty and a completion to Slaughter put the ball at the Jets' five-yard line, and kicker Mark Moseley booted through the tying score with 11 seconds left. In an initial 15-minute overtime period, Moseley missed a <b>short</b> <b>field</b> goal and neither team scored, sending the game into double overtime. This time, Moseley made a field goal and won the game for the Browns 23–20. It was the team's first playoff victory in 17 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} game {{was largely a}} defensive battle with little scoring from either team. New York scored the game's first {{points in the first}} quarter on a 21-yard field goal by Harvey Johnson, but the Browns went into the lead in the second quarter when Marion Motley ran for a touchdown after a 70-yard drive. The Yankees retook the lead in the third quarter, marching 80 yards down the field for a Sanders touchdown. Cleveland reached the New York 18-yard line {{at the end of the}} third, but the drive stalled and Lou Groza missed a <b>short</b> <b>field</b> goal, his third failed attempt of the game. Groza had suffered a sprained left ankle, and Chet Adams substituted for him. Adams, however, missed another field goal in the fourth quarter. The Browns took the lead again in the fourth quarter when Graham passed to Lavelli for a 16-yard touchdown. Groza came back in and kicked the extra point, giving Cleveland a 14–9 advantage with 4:31 to play in the game. Sanders returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards, and the Yankees started the drive at the Browns' 45-yard line. The Yankees appeared poised for a comeback, but Graham intercepted a pass on a third down and Cleveland was almost able to run out the clock. Time expired after a Tommy Colella punt and one short Yankees completion.|$|E

5|$|Penn State got {{the ball}} to start the game, and drove down the field with {{relative}} ease (facing only one third down) prior to stalling at their 26-yard line and turning the ball over on downs. After an Indiana three and out, Penn State ran another drive {{at the end of}} which they turned over on downs. Each team ran one more drive before Indiana attained first downs on three consecutive plays, ultimately culminating their possession with a five-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Nate Sudfeld to Isaiah Roundtree, making the score 7–0 at the end of the first quarter. Penn State responded on their second drive of the second quarter via a 46-yard pass from Hackenberg to Robinson to tie the game. Later, Mitch Ewald kicked a <b>short</b> <b>field</b> goal to re-take the lead. Penn State had a chance to tie the game again when kicker Sam Ficken attempted a 42-yard field goal, but Indiana blocked the kick, and with their ensuing momentum drove down the field at the end of the half, ultimately ending with Ewald hitting a field goal as time expired. After halftime, Indiana ran a quick drive on which they punted before Penn State ran a 13-play, 80-yard drive that concluded with Robinson catching his second touchdown of the game, a 26-yard pass from Hackenberg. Indiana responded with a quick score; they converted a two-point conversion to take a 21–14 lead. Late in the third quarter, Hackenberg threw a fade pattern to Robinson in the corner of the end zone, which Robinson corralled, but he landed on his back out of bounds, and came up either with the wind knocked out, or some sort of back injury. Penn State settled for a field goal, and at the end of three, Indiana led 21–17. The fourth quarter entrenched the Hoosiers' lead, as they totaled 23 points to only 7 for Penn State, winning the game 44–24, their final score coming on a safety.|$|E

25|$|No scoring {{by either}} {{team in the}} third quarter, but Arizona took care of that by scoring two touchdowns with the <b>short</b> <b>fields</b> in the final period. UCLA running back Chane Moline (#42) had 72 yards rushing and Arizona's wide {{receiver}} Mike Thomas (#10) caught for 112 yards. Aaron Perez kicked two punts for more than 50 yards for the Bruins and they were downed inside the two-yard line.|$|R
25|$|The Short 330 was {{developed}} by Short Brothers of Belfast from their earlier Short Skyvan STOL utility transport.

30|$|The {{gas and oil}} {{recoveries}} {{and total}} water production increase with increasing completion length when hperf/h[*]≤[*] 0.4. When hperf/h[*]>[*] 0.4, an increase in hperf/h ratio results in small decrease in oil recovery and no change in both gas recovery and total water production. The higher the completion length is, the <b>shorter</b> <b>field</b> production life becomes and the faster the water breakthrough occurs. Therefore, for Sand 20 gas-condensate reservoir, the completion length should be roughly 0.4 to maximize the gas and oil recoveries.|$|R
50|$|Even though Utah {{faced an}} early 7 - 0 deficit, this game was never close.

25|$|Following {{the half}} time performance, Florida {{connected}} on a 51-yard field goal from Sturgis {{to cut the}} Razorbacks' lead to 10-6. Tramain Thomas made an outstanding play on UF's Chris Rainey later in the third quarter. He attempted to tackle Rainey in the open field, but fell to the turf. While falling, Thomas kicked the ball cleanly out of Rainey's arm, and it fell right to Thomas. The Hogs took over at Florida's 28-yard line, but missed a <b>short</b> <b>field</b> goal and were forced walk away empty from the encounter.|$|E
5000|$|Zones. Because of <b>short</b> <b>fields</b> {{and walls}} {{surrounding}} the goal, a common tactic is {{to attempt to}} score at kickoff by shooting at the goal and charging at the goal with all five non-goalkeeper players who overwhelm the other team's defense and score at close range. As this depletes the tactics and drama of the game, many leagues have adopted an ice hockey-like zone rule, requiring that the ball not cross more than a certain forward distance toward the goal without being touched by a player.|$|R

25|$|The Herald {{attracted}} much early interest {{around the}} world because of its astonishing <b>short</b> <b>field</b> performance and excellent flight characteristics, but Handley Page failed to close many of the deals, as the F-27 and the HS.748 had become rival offerings, both of which proved significantly more popular. A key design feature of the Herald was the high-mounted wing, but with a noticeable dihedral. In addition, the Herald's vertical fin was covered with miniature airfoils, adding further to the Herald's excellent stability. Pilots reported that the Herald flew like a dream; very stable in the air, yet highly manoeuvrable even at slow speed. Ground handling {{was said to be}} the Herald's only vice due to an overlarge tailfin.|$|E
