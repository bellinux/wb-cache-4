Williams did so and founded Providence Plantation which later became the state of Rhode Island.|$|E
50|$|In 1753, {{three years}} into Father Le Loutre's War, John Creighton led {{the group of}} Foreign Protestants {{stationed}} in Halifax to resettle Mirliguèche, naming the new British colony Lunenburg. The town was named in honour of the King of Great Britain and Ireland, George August of Hanover, who was also the duke of Braunschweig-Lüneburg. Like Halifax, the British established Lunenburg unilaterally, that is, without negotiating with the Mi'kmaq, whose sovereign territory it had always been. In the <b>spring,</b> <b>Governor</b> Hopson received warnings from Fort Edward {{that as many as}} 300 natives nearby were prepared to oppose the settlement of Lunenburg and intended to attack upon the arrival of settlers. On June 7, 1753, supervised by Lawrence, escorted by several ships of the British Navy and accompanied by 160 Regular soldiers, 1,453 Foreign Protestants from Halifax landed at Rous' Brook.|$|E
50|$|Stanley Clark, Benjamin Chamberlain, and William Gallagher owned lands {{adjacent}} to the Oil Spring Reservation. On behalf of the three, Clark surveyed Reservation lands and claimed it, granting one-quarter of the reservation to Horatio Seymour, later governor of New York, and in the 1850s, conveying another quarter to Philonius Pattison. In response to these actions, the Seneca began a case which {{ended up in the}} New York Court of Appeals, Seneca Nation of Indians v. Philonus Pattison. A state court case protested Seymour, Gallagher, Chamberlain, and Clark's claims to the northeast quarter of Oil <b>Spring.</b> <b>Governor</b> Blacksnake, who had attended the negotiations of the Treaty of Big Tree, testified that he and Joseph Ellicott had surveyed the Oil Spring lands and the omission of the lands from the treaty was a mistake. He was able to produce a map copied by the Holland Land Company in which the Oil Spring Reservation was marked similarly to other Seneca lands. The case was laid to rest in 1861 when the court found for the Senecas. Pattison, Chamberlain, Clark, Gallagher, and Seymour were forced to leave the reservation. While later incursions by the New York State Board of Canal Commissioners and tourist activities eroded additional land from the Reservation, Governor Blacksnake's actions helped preserve at least some of Oil Spring as Seneca lands.|$|E

5000|$|He began {{purchasing}} land in Cass County (now Bartow), Georgia in 1838 {{and built}} a sizable plantation of over 2,500 acres which was called [...] "Etowah Valley". He served as postmaster for Etowah Valley from 1841-1845. In 1843, he purchased 2,440 additional acres in Cass County (Bartow) about 9.5 miles northeast of his plantation and, built the most exclusive resort {{in the state of}} Georgia, Rowland <b>Springs.</b> <b>Governor</b> and Mrs. Joseph E. Brown were frequent guests there and four state governors vacationed there in one season. Renowned physician, scientist, conservationist, and educator, Joseph LeConte honeymooned at Rowland Springs in 1846.

5000|$|The D-400 series engine or the Iron Horse {{engine was}} a {{light-duty}} two-stroke engine used for powering lawnmowers {{produced in the}} 1960s to the early 1980s. D-400 engines were single-cylinder engines designed and manufactured by the Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC; Johnson and Evinrude) for Lawn-Boy and Masport. The D-400 engines displaced 109 cc, generated 2.61 kW of power, and operated {{in the range of}} 2400-3300 RPM. The engines have a distinctive rectangular cowling that has created a nickname of Brick-top mowers. Another distinctive feature is the two-finger vertical recoil starter. The kidney-shaped muffler and exhaust unit is mounted beneath the mowers' deck and gives the engine a small, low profile design when compared to the newer and more powerful lawnmower engines. The ignition system employs a magneto, points, and a condenser (capacitor) set-up with an unusual spark-advance system which utilised a weight on the crankshaft to adjust the spark-advance amount depending on engine speed. The <b>sprung</b> <b>governor</b> was also unusual with a throw-yoke which operated under the flywheel and was linked to the throttle. The carburettor was a float design and fed into a pair of reed valves.|$|R

Antiwar Republicans wrote {{in the name of}} New York {{governor}} Nelson Rockefeller, the leader of the GOP's liberal wing, who received 11% of the vote. He later defeated Nixon in the Massachusetts primary on April 30 but otherwise fared poorly in the state primaries and conventions. That <b>spring,</b> California <b>governor</b> Ronald Reagan emerged as the leading voice of Republican conservatism, attaining second place in two primaries and winning the contest in his home state.|$|R
50|$|In July 2014, Gay {{and another}} Republican lawmaker, Steven Watt of Rock <b>Springs,</b> claimed that <b>Governor</b> Matt Meadabused {{the powers of}} his office and used funds prior to legal {{authorization}} to discredit his gubernatorial primary opponent Cindy Hill, the state superintendent of public instruction who was elected in 2010, suspended in 2013, and remained out of office until May 2014.|$|R

25|$|By early <b>spring,</b> California <b>Governor</b> Ronald Reagan, {{the leader}} of the Republican Party's {{conservative}} wing, had become Nixon's chief rival. In the Nebraska primary on May 14, Nixon won with 70% of the vote to 21% for Reagan and 5% for Rockefeller. While this was a wide margin for Nixon, Reagan remained Nixon's leading challenger. Nixon won the next primary of importance, Oregon, on May 15 with 65% of the vote, and won all the following primaries except for California (June 4), where only Reagan appeared on the ballot. Reagan's victory in California gave him a plurality of the nationwide primary vote, but his poor showing in most other state primaries left him far behind Nixon in the actual delegate count.|$|R

50|$|During the Iberian Union, King Phillip II of Spain {{ordered an}} armada to Terceira {{to impose the}} {{governorship}} of Ambrósia de Aguiar Coutinho on his unruly subjects in the Azores and facilitate shipping to the Indies. Under the command of Pedro de Valdez, the fleet arrived in Santa Maria with seven large carracks and 1000 troops, took on provisions and sailed for São Miguel in the <b>spring</b> (where <b>Governor</b> Ambrósio de Aguiar Coutinho and his cousin supplied the group). After an initial assault on Angra, Valdez rushed to assault the island, disembarking troops at the Casa da Salga, in the valley of Porto Judeu (a mile from Vila de São Sebastião), incensed that King Phillip was sending a larger contingent to capture Terceira. The Battle of Salga became an important event {{in the village of}} São Sebastião (then a parish of Praia) broke out along the coast in 1582.|$|R
50|$|The same act {{authorized}} {{the appointment of}} a superintendent of the salt <b>springs</b> by the <b>Governor,</b> with the consent of the Council of Appointment which was a powerful Arbitrary Board.

Furthermore, models with vertical or horizontal crankshaft are available. The B-series complies with the strict requirements of EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Tier IV final in the US.|$|R
2500|$|After Pataki {{refused to}} give McCaughey {{permission}} to conduct a study into child abuse, she did one anyway and publicly announced its results. McCaughey was publicly critical of the governor's proposed cuts to Medicaid and gave a pro-choice speech without his advance permission. In March 1996, The New York Times reported that McCaughey was locked out of the governor's inner circle because she had violated the [...] "unwritten rules" [...] of the conventional lieutenant governor's role. Rather than following protocol as lieutenant governor by taking a seat with everyone else during Pataki's State of the State address to the legislature in 1996, McCaughey stood for the entire 56 min speech's length, further attracting attention to herself at her governor's expense. In the <b>spring</b> of 1997, <b>Governor</b> Pataki announced that McCaughey would not be his running mate {{when he ran for}} re-election in 1998. He later selected New York State Supreme Court Justice Mary Donohue to replace her.|$|R

In what became known as Lord Dunmore's War, over 1,490 men were assembled, some at Fort Pitt at present-day Pittsburgh, and others at Fort Union, on the site of present-day Lewisburg. These recruits included Lewis’s brother Charles, and others which history books refer to {{as one of the most}} remarkable assemblages of frontier leaders in American history. Thirteen were men of political and military distinction. Lewis's army marched down the New and Kanawha Rivers to the Ohio River, where they intended to cross over and invade the Ohio Country, which was the home of the Shawnees. The Native Americans, led by Cornstalk, attempted to cut them off at the mouth of the Kanawha, where they fought an inconclusive battle that came to be known as the Battle of Point Pleasant.|$|R
5000|$|In 1959, Rayburn {{acted as}} a {{lieutenant}} for Earl Long and helped to get the <b>governor</b> <b>sprung</b> from a mental institution {{where he had been}} confined by his wife, Blanche R. Long. Ironically, it was Jesse Bankston, later the longtime Democratic Party state chairman, who had signed the original commitment papers because he thought that he was acting in his friend Long's best interest. Rayburn, however, remained loyal to Long even as family members, concerned about the governor's drinking and public relationships with Bourbon Street strippers, had Bankston, then the state director of hospitals, commit Long to Southeast Louisiana Hospital in Mandeville. With Rayburn's help, Long famously worked from his hospital bed to fire Bankston and then get released. Upon Rayburn's death, Bankston said that the veteran lawmaker had excelled in speechmaking but was also strong on Democratic issues involving education and labor. The two had long since reconciled their differences over Long's hospitalization. Former Senate secretary Mike Baer, himself a native of Rayburn's Bogalusa, declared the former lawmaker the [...] "last of the Red Hot Poppas," [...] a term that Earl Long had applied to himself in the 1950s to refer to politicians traveling from one community to another with sound trucks for stump speaking, rather than reliance on slick television advertising. Baer noted that Rayburn could stop a bill by making a familiar argument that the proposed law would [...] "hurt the poor people[...] [...] [...] Even the author of a bill withdrew it or voted against his own bill after Sixty spoke against it." ...|$|R
