Geographical variation for shelf-dependent resources is explained by dividing <b>FAO</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Areas</b> into three categories: Arcto-boreal regions in the northern hemisphere, with five-year mean fishery production peaking at 2. 1 – 2. 7 tons per km 2; from the Antarc-tic convergence to south-boreal latitudes, with production peaking at 0. 5 – 2. 2 tons per km 2, and tropical/subtropical shelves, peaking at 0. 4 – 0. 9 tons per km 2 (except for the Central East Atlantic). For zoogeographically similar areas, overall production levels for shelf-dependent resources have generally reached similar peak values and declined re-cently in areas with long histories of fishing.

40|$|Possible {{effects of}} the spatial scale of {{analysis}} {{on the relationship between}} fishery landings and the water temperature in the Mediterranean Sea have been investigated using the FAO capture database (1970 - 2010). The analysis was performed by dividing species in three thermal affinity categories: cold, temperate and hot species. Results showed significant changes in fishery landings composition during the last four decades, in terms of the relative contribution of cold, temperate and hot species to landings; moreover, the presence of a strong influence of water warming in determining the landings temporal pattern has been confirmed. This relationship, however, resulted to be not homogenous across the tested spatial scales (entire Mediterranean basin, three main sub-basins, eight <b>FAO</b> <b>areas).</b> The best models (based on the Akaike Information Criterion), were the ones fitted at the finer spatial definition (i. e. the eight <b>FAO</b> <b>areas)</b> for all the three thermal affinity categories.

Cold species showed a negative relationship with the increasing water temperature in all the <b>FAO</b> <b>areas,</b> being partially replaced by temperate ones, {{with the exception of the}} Adriatic and Black Sea (the coldest areas in the Mediterranean basin), where a moderate increase in the water temperature is still favoring the cold affinity group.

Research on the population structure of E. tetradactylum in these coastal waters is substantial {{in order to ensure}} sustainable use and appropriate resource management. In this study, genetic variation, diversity and population structure of E. tetradactylum among four <b>FAO</b> fishing <b>areas,</b> along South Asian countries, were evaluated using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Totally 30 sequences of COI gene were collected from four <b>FAO</b> fishing <b>areas.</b> Among these 30 individuals, 18 distinct haplotypes were defined. High levels of haplotype diversity (hd = 0. 952 ± 0. 096) and nucleotide diversity (π = 0. 01536 ± 0. 00312) were observed in the population within the Bay of Bengal. No haplotype and nucleotide diversity were observed in South China Sea population. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 0. 81 % of the genetic variation occurred within the populations, while 7. 09 % variation occurred among populations. Significant genealogical branches were recognized in North Australian populations (one clade), South China Sea populations (one clade), Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal populations (one clade) on the neighbor-joining tree.

In viscera, the main localisations of the larvae were under the gastric serosa, where several parasites alive and dead were found, and intestinal serosa.

40|$|We {{have applied}} {{specific}} eco-exergy to data on fisheries landing and on aquaculture from FAO.

Therefore, this value is independent of the total catches and reflects the quality in terms of information content of what we are extracting from the whole oceans or producing by aquaculture.

In addition, we have detected possible change points in the gradient at unknown times using likelihood ratio test, with the null hypothesis of linear relationship.

40|$|Cephalopod {{fisheries}} {{are among}} the few still with some local potential for expansion; in fact, as groundfish landings have declined globally, cephalopod landings have increased. We propose the hypothesis that, although increased cephalopod landings may partly reflect increased market demand, overfishing groundfish stocks has positively affected cephalopod populations. Data from 15 key <b>FAO</b> <b>areas</b> reveal that, {{with the exception of}} the north- east Atlantic, cephalopod landings have increased significantly over the last 25 years while groundfish have risen more slowly, remained stable, or declined. In terms of volume, cephalopods have not replaced groundfish. This is hypothesized as owing to the shorter life cycle of cephalopods, and rapid turnover and lower standing stocks than for longer-lived finfish species. Under high fishing pressure, groundfish are probably poor competitors, having less opportunity for spawning and replacement. In West Africa, the Gulf of Thailand and Adriatic there is strong circumstantial evidence that fishing pressure has changed ecological conditions and cephalopod stocks have increased as predatory fish have declined. We recommend that this hypothesis be tested thoroughly in other areas where suitable data exist. Most coastal and shelf cephalopod fisheries are likely to be fully exploited or overexploited, and current annual fluctuations in cephalopod landings are probably largely environmentally-driven...|$|R

40|$|The {{degree of}} {{competition}} between fisheries and marine mammals in the Pacific Ocean was estimated for 7 statistical areas {{defined by the}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Catch statistics compiled from FAO sources show {{that the amount of}} fish caught in the Pacific Ocean rose from 2 million tons in the late- 1940 s to over 50 million tons in the early- 1990 s. Recent stagnation and declines occurring in some areas of the Pacific suggest that Pacific fisheries cannot continue to expand as they had previously. Based on estimates of population size, total biomass and daily consumption rates, it was estimated that the 84 species of marine mammals inhabiting the Pacific Ocean con-sume about three times as much food as humans harvest. A large fraction (> 60 %) of the food caught by marine mammals consisted of deep sea squids and very small deep sea fishes not harvestable by humans, thus limiting the extent of direct competition between fisheries and marine mammals. Moreover, the most important consumers of commercially exploited fish are other predatory fish, not marine mammals. Although direct competition between fisheries and marine mammals for prey appears rather limited, there may be considerable indirect competition for primary production. The primary production required to sustain marine mammals in each of the 7 <b>FAO</b> <b>areas</b> varies within a narrow range, suggesting that the diversity and abundance of marine mam-mals may have slowly evolved to fully exploit their niche and maximize their use of avail-able primary production. This contrasts with the rapid expansion of fisheries and their relatively recent dependence on primary production, which may have led to what we call 'food web competition'...|$|R
