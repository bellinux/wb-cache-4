40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a method, based on the image processing of field survey data, to analyze vehicles movements into roundabouts. This research study consisted of three stages: a field survey to collect vehicular flow images captured by video cameras, the processing of these images using a proprietary software (VeTRA—Vehicle Tracking for Roundabout Analysis), and finally, the analysis of the collected data. The main feature of the software is that it allows the automatic computation of the main variables necessary to rank and evaluate a generic roundabout: the entry/exit (E/E) matrix with classification of vehicles (e. g., heavy, light, and motorbikes), vehicle trajectories, and vehicular <b>speed</b> <b>diagrams</b> along the paths inside the roundabout. The processing system is robust enough to withstand classic problems affecting image processing such as variable wind conditions, cloud cover, shadows, and obstructions. Calibration and error evaluation have been deduced from data collected by a high precision Real Time Kinematic GPS video recording system mounted on a probe vehicle. Data of E/E matrices generated by VeTRA are compared with those manually counted on the corresponding video images. A case study of an existing roundabout is featured in the paper. The results indicate that the software has a high capability of generating the E/E matrix. The analysis of vehicular trajectories with both the plot of curvature diagrams and the corresponding <b>speed</b> <b>diagrams</b> enable the evaluation of driver behavior relative to the geometric shape of the roundabout.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to use numerical optimisation to investigate the on-limit behaviour of an open wheel downforce type race car using the best compromise of modelling accuracy and computational effort. The current state of lap simulation methods are identified, and the GG <b>speed</b> <b>diagram</b> is described. The use of constrained optimisation, which is a form of optimal control, is used to develop the methods described in this thesis. A seven degree of freedom vehicle model validated by other researchers is used for method validation purposes, and is extended, where possible, to make the modelling of vehicle components more physically significant, without adversely affecting the computational time. This research suggests a quasi steady state approach that produces a GG <b>speed</b> <b>diagram</b> and circuit simulation tool that is capable of optimising vehicle parameters and subsystems in addition to the prevailing control vector of steer and throttle response. The use of numerical optimisation to optimise the rear differential hydraulic pressure and the roll stiffness distribution to maximise vehicle performance is demonstrated. The optimisation of the rear differential hydraulic pressure showed a very small improvement in vehicle performance in combined high speed braking and cornering, but highlighted the ability of the differential to affect the cornering behaviour of the vehicle. The optimisation of the roll stiffness distribution research showed that a significant improvement in the lateral acceleration capability of the vehicle could be achieved at all vehicle speeds between 20 and 80 m/s, especially in combined braking and cornering. In addition, a parameter sensitivity study around a realistic Formula One vehicle setup was conducted, looking at the sensitivity of vehicle mass, yaw inertia, tyres, centre of gravity location and engine torque to vehicle performance.

The authors investigate when and where each driver acts, and how his action is influenced by the perception of the layout, as it is guaranteed by markings (standard and reinforced by retroreflective post-delineators). Different driving scenarios are examined, concluding that improved road markings: usually permit a better perception of the road, especially of the curve stretches, and a general reduction of average speed; sometimes have a not positive effect, specifically where there is a variation {{of the size of the}} roadway; have a negative role on the long straights; decrease the scattering of driver behaviours.

30|$|To further {{verify the}} {{existence}} of the linear wave modes, the coherent wave components are studied using the dispersion relation diagram and the phase <b>speed</b> <b>diagram</b> for comparison with the MHD linear-mode waves. The dispersion relation diagram presents the distribution of frequencies and the wavevector angles from the mean magnetic field for the local spectral peaks {{as a function of the}} wavenumbers (Fig.  7).

Field-aligned Alfvén waves with the relation ω = k V_ A are taken for the reference dispersion relation. The Alfvén speed is estimated around V_ A = 1390.6 km/s. The Doppler shift (which is at most a few hundreds of km/s, see Fig.  2) is not significant as the flow speed is sufficiently below the Alfvén speed. The coherent waves show both higher and lower frequencies than that of the Alfvén waves (on the reference dispersion relation in the top panel), and the wavevector angles are broadly distributed including quasi-parallel, oblique, quasi-perpendicular, and quasi-anti-parallel directions with respect to the mean magnetic field (bottom panel).|$|E

50|$|<b>Speed</b> flow <b>diagrams</b> {{are used}} to {{determine}} the speed at which the optimum flow occurs. There are currently two shapes of the speed-flow curve. The speed-flow curve also consists of two branches, the freeflow and congested branches. The diagram is not a function, allowing the flow variable to exist at two different speeds. The flow variable existing at two different speeds occurs when the speed is higher and the density is lower or when the speed is lower and the density is higher, which allows for the same flow rate. In the first speed-flow diagram, the freeflow branch is a horizontal line, which shows that the roadway is at freeflow speed until the optimum flow is reached. Once the optimum flow is reached, the diagram switches to the congested branch, which is a parabolic shape. The second <b>speed</b> flow <b>diagram</b> is a parabola. The parabola suggests that the only time there is freeflow speed is when the density approaches zero; it also suggests that as the flow increases the speed decreases.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we had to}} face the topic of {{intrinsic}} road safety experimentally by investigating two interurban roads. These roads are characterised by different types of traffic. The results of the investigation are given in the form of prediction relations with their relevant <b>speed</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The present investigation, to be carried out in the field, intends to verify, on some sections considered as significant, the relationship and mutual incidence between the variables flow, road geometry and speed. In the processing of the results, use will also be made of specific instruments for evaluating the geometrical consistency of the road alignment in accordance with operating speed. Our experimental investigation aimed at studying operating speeds on two different categories of roads as regards both importance and circulation. First of all we selected the road samples which belong to the A 18 Messina-Catania motorway and to the SS 626 Licata-Ravanusa state highway. The study contemplated the use of a laser beam speedometer and some digital camcorders. In each section we considered two cross-sections at the same time, one on a tangent and one on a curve. At the same time, we also measured traffic flows which were subsequently disaggregated according to all the calculation parameters necessary to establish the level of service. In order to have a clearer interpretation of the experimental evidence and to propose some prediction relations we analysed the rapport between V 85 and some geometrical parameters like CCRs, CCR, is and i. Both prediction relations and their determination coefficients show that it is the simultaneous and synergic action of planimetric and altimetric elements that determines a high degree of correlation to V 85. In both road samples we found that operating speed values are almost always higher than the design speed of the geometrical elements considered. On the other hand, a general increase in operating speed involves very small speed variations in the transition from one element to the other. This leads us to think that the layouts are appreciably consistent, as {{can be seen from the}} diagrams prepared on the basis of the prediction reports V 85 -CCRs-is. As for the motorway sections studied, this datum conflicts with what the curvature planimetric-design <b>speed</b> <b>diagrams,</b> prepared on the basis of the present Italian geometric design standard, affirm. We think that these prediction relations could become behavioural models, on the basis of more thorough studies, referring to a specific category of road geometry characterised by a specific mobility function.

These include requirements for safety (action deadlines are met) as well optimality (maximization and smoothness of quality levels). The Controller consists of a Quality Manager and a Scheduler. For each action, the Controller uses a quality management policy for choosing a schedule and quality levels meeting the QoS requirements.

There are many studies realized on driver speed, in the last two decades; the resulting values and relationships are different from each other. Every Country has an its own relationship that characterizes the behavior of drivers in road environment: {{it is not possible to}} define a single formula for different situations and different drivers. In the paper, in particular, it describes an experimental relationship obtained of the distributions of running speeds of vehicles recorded, in significant periods of time, in different conditions of geometric path and different provinces. The surveys were conducted on various two-lane roads and have allowed to identify a good relationship for the dependence of the operating speed of the layout geometrical elements not only with the free flow speed (FFS, 85 th-percentile) and the CCR (curvature change rate), but also with the road longitudinal gradient. It has used the measurements over 40 sections of rural roads with two-lane single carriageway, width greater than 7 meters, long straights and curvature radii greater than 100 meters.

40|$|The most {{important}} variable in roundabout geometric design is speed and its prior selection represents a fundamental step for road designers and traffic engineers. The design speed refers {{to that of}} an ideal vehicle on the shortest radius along the fastest allowable path in free-flowing conditions. It should be defined {{with respect to the}} geometry of the legs converging into the roundabout {{in order to ensure that}} the operating speed, which is conventionally set at the 85 th percentile of on-site recorded values in the above mentioned flow conditions, is as close as possible to the selected design speed or, in other words, that design consistency is achieved. This is a key factor in maintaining roundabouts as a safe intersection typology. When consistency is achieved, most of the vehicles (minimum 85 %) pass through the roundabout satisfying equilibrium and visibility conditions established by the designer. In this scenario, operating speeds of isolated vehicles are also similar in the circulatory roadway and relative speeds are lower compared to other intersection types. Design and operating speeds were evaluated in an experimental investigation carried out at some urban roundabouts in the Municipality of Cuneo (Italy). Operating speed data were gathered by means of a speed measuring system consisting of laser equipment, while geometric characteristics were derived by an on-site topographical survey. <b>Speed</b> <b>diagrams</b> for turn and through movements were derived in order to study the effects of the geometric characteristics of approach and exit legs.
