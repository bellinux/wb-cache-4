40|$|Certificate status {{validation}} {{is a hard}} {{problem in}} general but it is particularly complex in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) because we require solutions to manage both the lack of fixed infrastructure inside the MANET and the possible absence of connectivity to trusted authorities when the certification validation has to be performed. In this sense, certificate acquisition is usually assumed as an initialization phase. However, certificate validation is a critical operation since the node needs to check the validity of certificates in real-time, that is, when a particular certificate {{is going to be}} used. In such MANET environments, it may happen that the node is placed {{in a part of the}} network that is disconnected from the source of status data at the moment the <b>status</b> <b>checking</b> is required. Proposals in the literature suggest the use of caching mechanisms so that the node itself or a neighbour node has some <b>status</b> <b>checking</b> material (typically on-line status responses or lists of revoked certificates). However, to the best of our knowledge the only criterion to evaluate the cached (obsolete) material is the time. In this paper, we analyse how to deploy a certificate <b>status</b> <b>checking</b> PKI service for hybrid MANET and we propose a new criterion based on risk to evaluate cached status data that is much more appropriate and absolute than time because it takes into account the revocation process.

50|$|AFS {{uses the}} Weak Consistency model. Read and write {{operations}} {{on an open}} file are directed only to the locally cached copy. When a modified file is closed, the changed portions are copied back to the file server. Cache consistency is maintained by callback mechanism. When a file is cached, the server makes a note of this and promises to inform the client if the file is updated by someone else. Callbacks are discarded and must be re-established after any client, server, or network failure, including a time-out. Re-establishing a callback involves a <b>status</b> <b>check</b> and does not require re-reading the file itself.|$|E
5000|$|A launch <b>status</b> <b>check,</b> {{also known}} as a [...] "go/no go poll" [...] and several other terms occurs at the {{beginning}} of an American spaceflight mission in which flight controllers monitoring various systems are queried for operation and readiness status before a launch can proceed. For space shuttle missions, in the firing room at the Launch Control Center, the NASA Test Director (NTD) performed this check via a voice communications link with other NASA personnel. The NTD was the leader of the shuttle test team responsible for directing and integrating all flight crew, orbiter, external tank/solid rocket booster and ground support testing in the shuttle launch countdown. The NTD was also responsible for the safety of all personnel inside the pad after external tank loading, including the flight crew. He reported to the Launch Director. The Launch director declares if a mission is go for launch.|$|E

Designed <b>status</b> <b>checking</b> system consists of sensor modules, a wireless communication module, cloud server, android application and a machine learning algorithm. The developed system applied to washing machine analyses and judges the four-kinds of appliance’s status such as staying, washing, rinsing and spin-drying. The measurements of sensor and transmission of sensing data are operated on an Arduino board and the data are transmitted to cloud server in real time. The collected data are parsed by an Android application and injected into the machine learning algorithm for learning the status of the appliances. The machine learning algorithm compares the stored learning data with collected real-time data from the appliances. Our results are expected to contribute as a base technology to design an automatic control system based on machine learning technology for household appliances in real-time...|$|R

5000|$|During an {{immigration}} <b>status</b> <b>check</b> of a passenger {{on a bus}} in Texas, a United States Border Patrol Agent squeezed the soft luggage of Steven D Bond.

After Bond admitted {{that it was his}} bag and then consented to a search of the bag, the Border Patrol Agent found a [...] "brick" [...] of methamphetamine. Bond was arrested and indicted on Federal drug charges. Bond moved to suppress the [...] "brick" [...] of methamphetamine on the basis that the agent had conducted an illegal search of the bag when squeezing it. He claimed that this was a violation of the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. The district court denied the motion, and found Bond guilty. The Court of Appeals held that the agent's manipulation of the bag was not a search under the Fourth Amendment.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} upheld Section 2, but did so {{by reading}} it in a more restrictive manner.

Additionally, any arrestee's immigration status would have to have been determined before they could be released. Status checks would have been made through Immigration and Customs Enforcement and their databases. Listing several examples, Justice Kennedy wrote that Section 2(B) [...] "likely would survive preemption" [...] if it is interpreted only to require state officers to conduct a <b>status</b> <b>check</b> [...] "during the course of an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has been released." [...] Underlining the cautious approach that the majority took to Section 2(B) were Justice Kennedy's final words on the section: [...] "This opinion does not foreclose other preemption and constitutional challenges to the law as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect." ...|$|E

30|$|Brain tumor is treatable if it {{has been}} {{identified}} in the earliest stages of the disease. In this paper, we proposed and developed a novel approach for brain tumor segmentation and detection. Our main contribution consisted of modeling improved watershed algorithm with three steps of de-noising filtering and designing scale-invariant feature transform algorithm where the optimized features were selected. Traditional over segmentation problem could be minimized by our improved algorithm as the MR images are highly affected by noise and artifacts. We preprocessed the images using artifacts removal, median filter and trilateral filter for improving the segmentation quality. Due to this improved combination, our proposed method is far better than any single or other combination algorithms. To check the accuracy of our algorithm, we compared the result with the truth images and acquired 98.5 % accuracy. Here, we also introduced <b>status</b> <b>checking</b> of the tumor. We calculated {{the area of the}} tumor and then set a decision rule to decide whether it is in a critical or initial stage. This <b>status</b> <b>checking</b> made our system more robust.

40|$|Diabetes Mellitus {{is one of}} {{the major}} public health challenges, {{affecting}} more than 347 million adults worldwide. The impact of diabetes necessitates assessing the quality of care received by people with diabetes, especially in countries with a significant diabetes burden such as Kuwait. This paper aimed at piloting an approach for measuring Type II diabetes care performance through the use of a diabetes quality indicator set (DQIS) in primary health care. The DQIS for Kuwait was adapted from that developed by the National Diabetes Quality Improvement Alliance and the International Diabetes Federation. Five key care domains/measures were employed: (1) Blood glucose level measurement, (2) Cholesterol level measurement, (3) Blood pressure measurement, (4) Kidney function testing and (5) Smoking <b>status</b> <b>check.</b> The sample included the four major primary health care centers with the highest case load in Kuwait City, 4, 241 patients in 2012 and 3, 211 in 2010.

Furthermore, findings revealed that many of the primary health care centers have achieved noteworthy improvement in diabetes care between 2010 and 2012, with the exception of smoking <b>status</b> <b>check.</b> The DQIS can help policymakers identify performance gaps and investigate key system roadblocks related to diabetes care in Kuwait...|$|E
