40|$|We {{investigate}} the capital structure of 350 Dutch insurers {{during the period}} 1995 - 2005. Our main findings are: (1) a small company size, a mutual organisation, high profitability, large equity investments, and being a fire insurer, all contribute to higher solvency margins; (2) minimum <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements</b> from the supervisor are less easy to explain by firm characteristics and do not correlate positively with risk; (3) neither do insurers follow <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements</b> closely; (4) most insurers have surplus capital which, together with a large company size and high profitability, {{reduces the risk of}} insolvency.

We test {{the performance of}} these mechanisms {{in terms of the}} protection offered to pension benefits in relation to the costs. For this, we calculate the expected log-return for the beneficiaries and the shortfall probability, i. e. the likelihood of the pension payment falling below the promised level. We show {{that it is possible to}} compare different pension security mechanisms using appropriate finance tools. Compared to a system based on <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements</b> alone, support by a pension guarantee fund or by the sponsor offers better downside protection for pension funds pursuing an aggressive investment policy.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether insurers base their solvency margins on risk factors even when operating under a supervisory regime where minimum <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements</b> {{do not fully}} take such risk factors into account. To do this, we use a dataset of about 350 Dutch insurers from all major lines of business during the pre-Solvency II period 1995 - 2005. We find that the levels of insurers' actual solvency margins are related to their risk characteristics and not to regulatory <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements.</b> Consequently, {{the vast majority of}} insurers hold much more capital than required, i. e. non-risk based capital requirements generally are not binding. Requirements are found to affect solvency adjustment behaviour, though. More specifically, below-target capital ratios are raised most rapidly by those insurers whose targets are relatively close to the regulatory minimum. One implication from our results is that, because insurers already follow a risk-based approach, the transition to the new European regulatory framework, Solvency II, is likely to be smooth.

40|$|The {{main reasons}} for giving {{insurance}} companies the option to apply internal models for calculating the <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement</b> within the <b>Solvency</b> II framework is to enhance better risk management and to allow a more accurate risk oriented capital requirement than the standard <b>Solvency</b> Capital <b>Requirement</b> (SCR) would provide. The possibility to use internal models within Pillar I basically means freedom to calculate the <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement</b> using some other formulae and even principles than those given by the standard formula. In our view within Pillar I, contrary to Pillar II, {{there is a clear}} need both for insurance supervisors and for those developing internal models in practise to have a common guideline among EU member states on how to validate and approve internal models. The tentative advice from The Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS) to the European Commission roughly follows the same approach. However, we believe that a broader scope of models and a more detailed approach to the validation will be needed for the final standard. This standard should give principles for the design of internal models and highlight areas that will be of greatest importance in the process of using internal models for calculating the SCR. This paper gives a brief background review of the Solvency II project, deals with different aspects on internal models within Pillar I, and finally illustrates a rather detailed guideline that could be included in the standard for approving internal models.

40|$|We develop {{portfolio}} optimization {{problems for}} a nonlife insurance company seeking {{to find the}} minimum capital required that simultaneously satisfies solvency and portfolio performance constraints. Motivated by standard insurance regulations, we consider <b>solvency</b> capital <b>requirements</b> based on three criteria: ruin probability, conditional Value-at-Risk, and expected policyholder deficit ratio. We propose a novel semiparametric formulation for each problem and explore the advantages of implementing this methodology over other potential approaches. When liabilities follow a Lognormal distribution, we provide sufficient conditions for convexity for each problem. Using different expected return on capital target levels, we construct efficient frontiers when portfolio assets are modeled with a special class of multivariate GARCH models. We find that the correlation between asset returns {{plays an important role}} in the behavior of the optimal capital required and the portfolio structure. The stability and out-of-sample performance of our optimal solutions are empirically tested with respect to both the <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement</b> and portfolio performance, through a double rolling window estimation exercise...|$|R

40|$|Many {{statutory}} <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements,</b> e. g. {{the system}} prescribed by the EU, {{do not take}} into account the distribution of the investments. In practice, however, an adequate solvency margin of an insurance company depends strongly on the investment portfo-lio. This paper describes how the sufficient level of the solvency margin can be esti-mated. In this, only the margin depending on the company’s investments is dealt with and the margin for the insurance risk is not included. First, the paper describes the use of an asset liability simulation model for the calcula-tion for the solvency margin. Then some formulas are developed for approximating the simulation results. These formulas depend on the means, standard deviations and cor-relation coefficients of the investment yields, as well as on the chosen risk level. In addition, the interest rate applied to the reserves is taken into account. Finally, the paper describes the new formula for the statutory <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements</b> of the Finnish employment pension institutions...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{equilibrium}} model to investigate the adverse effects of liquidity risk on price discovery and to examine the interaction of (externally or internally imposed) <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements</b> for financial institutions with the accounting measurement for financial assets in markets under stress. The model develops liquidity demand and supply curves generating two types of general equilibria: liquid and illiquid. We then investigate the adverse feedback effects in the illiquid equilibrium in response to banks selling risky assets to satisfy <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements.</b> Our model captures negative externalities of other banks responding to a liquidity shock with precautionary hoarding and predicts that the potential of bank runs reduces the motivation to hoard. Model results further suggest that applying mark-to-market accounting in the illiquid equilibrium can lead to loss spirals transforming a bank’s illiquidity problem to one of insolvency. We discuss several policy implications {{for the role of}} fair value accounting in linking liquidity and solvency problems of banks during times of market stress...|$|E

40|$|Contrary to the {{prediction}} of standard portfolio diversification theory, many investors place a large fraction of their stock investment in a small number of stocks. We show that underdiversification may be a result of the <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement.</b> The key assumption is that investors must remain solvent after certain committed consumption at which the marginal utility is finite. We show that investors underdiversify when wealth is low and that even wealthy investors may underdiversify. In addition, variance and higher moments do not affect stock selection and a less diversified stock portfolio has a higher expected return, a higher volatility, a higher skewness, and maybe a lower Sharpe ratio. Underdiversification in equilibrium implies that idiosyncratic risks are priced. All of these theoretical predictions are consistent with empirical findings...|$|R
