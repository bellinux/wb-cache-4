Between the time the order was accepted and when production started, Ford overhauled the design to solve several problems. The car-type radiator was enlarged to [...] capacity to cure overheating problems. The additional weight also helped hold the front down. In early Fordsons, the worm drive was located at the top under the driver's seat. During heavy operation the heat became unbearable to the operator. The worm drive was relocated {{to solve this problem}} and also allowed larger rear wheels which improved traction. Several changes were also made to simplify manufacture. The Fordson used the Model T <b>coil</b> <b>magneto</b> system; and water and oil pumps were eliminated in favor of the simpler thermosiphon cooling and splash lubrication.|$|R
