In 1910, he bought Le Limon, a piece of property in the Seine-et-Marne département, away from the distractions of Paris. He worked tirelessly on a stage adaptation of Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov along with his friend from school, Jean Croué, finishing it {{by the end of}} 1910. He was now ready to work in the theatre as a practitioner not only as critic. The play was staged in April 1911 under the direction of Jacques Rouché at the Théâtre des Arts, receiving favorable reviews. Charles Dullin, who played the role of Smerdiakov, was particularly singled out for a fine performance. A second staging of the adaptation the following October, with Louis Jouvet in the role of Father Zossima, confirmed the earlier critical claim.|$|E

6000|$|... "I put a {{chair by}} the window," [...] the sailor <b>said,</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> bed, [...] "and left the light, for you might run foul of {{something}} or other in the dark, though I have left a pretty clear gangway for you." ...|$|E

50|$|Having {{set up the}} John B. and Nelly Llanos Kilroy Foundation, Kilroy <b>said</b> {{proceeds}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> memoir {{would go}} to benefit youth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come!" [...] he <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> corner. [...] "Don't {{go on in}} that way, Mr. Gridley. You {{are only}} a little low. We are all of us a little low sometimes. I am. Hold up, hold up! You'll lose your temper with the whole round of 'em, again and again; and I shall take you on a score of {{warrants}} yet, if I have luck." ...|$|E
60|$|He went on {{with his}} story, but Jacinta {{scarcely}} listened to it, for she was wondering why Austin had not come, and waiting expectantly for the time when she could, in self-abasement, endeavour to wipe what she had <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> memory. Still, he did not come, and it was {{half an hour later}} when a barefooted boatman was shown into the patio. He had an envelope in his hand, and turned to Brown.|$|E
6000|$|Corp told Tommy some of {{the things}} Gavinia said about Thomas Sandys as a boy: how he sat rapt in church, and, instead of going bird-nesting, lay on the ground {{listening}} to the beautiful little warblers overhead, and gave all his pennies to poorer children, and could repeat the Shorter Catechism, beginning at either end, and was very respectful to the aged and infirm, and of a yielding disposition, and <b>said,</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> earliest years, [...] "I don't want to be great; I just want to be good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{an immense}} {{improvement}} on shooting the unimpressionable Fuzzy in the open," [...] <b>said</b> Dick, <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{place in the}} corner.|$|R

60|$|The {{most intense}} emotion now prevailed. Several members {{clustered}} in remonstrance round the Captain, and several round Mr. Tiddypot; but, both were obdurate. Mr. Chib then presented himself amid tremendous cheering, and said, that not to shrink from {{the discharge of}} his painful duty, he must now move that both honourable gentlemen be taken into custody by the beadle, and conveyed to the nearest police-office, there to be held to bail. The union of parties still continuing, the motion was seconded by Mr. Wigsby - on all usual occasions Mr. Chib's opponent - and rapturously carried with only one dissentient voice. This was Dogginson's, who <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> place 'Let 'em fight it out with fistes;' but whose coarse remark was received as it merited.|$|E
60|$|Peter's {{voice was}} {{immediately}} recognized. The confident, quiet, natural {{manner in which}} he spoke served to mislead those in the canoes; and when he joined them, and entered the passage among the rice {{that led to the}} landing, preceding the others, the last followed him as regularly as the colt follows its dam. Le Bourdon heard the conversation, and understood the movement, though he could not see the canoes. Peter continued talking aloud, as he went up the passage, receiving answers to all he <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> new companions, his voice serving to let the fugitives know precisely where they were. All this was understood and improved by the last, who lost no time in turning the adventure to account.|$|E
60|$|When {{the hall}} was clear of guests, a council was held between the Knight, the Priest, and the two Esquires. Its result was, that Arthur's person, as the most {{important}} point, should be secured, by his uncle carrying him at once to the Prince's protection at Bordeaux; but it was only with difficulty that Eustace was prevailed on to fly, as he <b>said,</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> accusers. The good Father had to say, with a smile, that after all there was as much need for patience and submission under the helm as under the cowl, before Eustace at length consented. Cyril meanwhile was to lay the case before the Chancellor, William of Wykeham, and Eustace gave him letters to the Duke of Lancaster and to Sir Richard Ferrars, in the hopes of their recommending his suit.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{she would}} care for me," [...] <b>said</b> Foker, <b>from</b> <b>his</b> sofa--"that is, I think she would. Last night only, {{as we were}} dancing, she said----" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No use {{asking me}} what he meant, Lena; I don't know, and I did not ask him. The gentleman, as I have told you before, seems devoted to mystification. I said nothing, and he laid down his head again on the bundle of rugs he uses for a pillow. He affects a state of great weakness, but I suspect that he's {{perfectly}} capable of leaping to his feet if he likes. Having been ejected, he <b>said,</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> proper social sphere because he had refused to conform to certain usual conventions, he was a rebel now, and was coming and {{going up and down}} the earth. As I really did not want to listen to all this nonsense, I told him that I had heard that sort of story about somebody else before. His grin is really ghastly. He confessed that I was very far from the sort of man he expected to meet. Then he said: ...|$|E
60|$|From the {{day that}} Miss Gushing heard of it--which was not however for some {{considerable}} time after this--she became an Independent Methodist. She could no longer, she said at first, have any faith in any religion; and {{for an hour or}} so she was almost tempted to swear that she could no longer have any faith in any man. She had nearly completed a worked cover for a credence-table when the news reached her, as to which, in the young enthusiasm of her heart, she had not been able to remain silent; it had already been promised to Mr Oriel; that promise she swore should not be kept. He was an apostate, she <b>said,</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> principles; an utter pervert; a false, designing man, with whom she would never have trusted herself alone on dark mornings had she known that he had such grovelling, worldly inclinations. So Miss Gushing became an Independent Methodist; the credence-table covering was cut up into slippers for the preacher's feet; and the young thing herself, more happy in this direction than she had been in the other, became the arbiter of that preacher's domestic happiness.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she was a}} deader and had {{attained}} {{distinction in}} the only way possible in that street. Shovel did not shake Tommy's hand warmly, the forms of congratulation varying {{in different parts of}} London, but he looked his admiration so plainly that Tommy's head waggled proudly. Evidently, whatever his mother had done redounded to his glory as well as to hers, and somehow he had become a boy of mark. He <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> elevation that he hoped Shovel would believe his tales about Thrums now, and Shovel, who had often cuffed Tommy for sticking to him so closely, cringed in the most snobbish manner, craving permission to be seen in his company for the next three days. Tommy, the upstart, did not see his way to grant this favor for nothing, and Shovel offered a knife, but did not have it with him; it was his sister Ameliar's knife, and he would take it from her, help his davy. Tommy would wait there till Shovel fetched it. Shovel, baffled, wanted to know what Tommy was putting on hairs for. Tommy smiled, and asked whose mother was a deader. Then Shovel collapsed, and his wind passed into Tommy.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Twas sunset as I spoke: {{one star}} [...] 855 Had scarce burst forth, when from afar The ministers of misrule sent, Seized upon Lionel, and bore His chained limbs to a dreary tower, In {{the midst of}} a city vast and wide. [...] 860 For he, they <b>said,</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mind had bent Against their gods keen blasphemy, For which, though his soul must roasted be In hell's red lakes immortally, Yet even on earth must he abide [...] 865 The vengeance of their slaves: a trial, I think, men call it. What avail Are prayers and tears, which chase denial From the fierce savage, nursed in hate? What the knit soul that {{pleading}} and pale [...] 870 Makes wan the quivering cheek, which late It painted with its own delight? We were divided. As I could, I stilled the tingling of my blood, And followed him in their despite, [...] 875 As a widow follows, pale and wild, The murderers and corse of her only child; And when we came to the prison door And I prayed to share his dungeon floor With prayers which rarely have been spurned, [...] 880 And when men drove me forth and I Stared with blank frenzy on the sky, A farewell look of love he turned, Half calming me; then gazed awhile, As if thro' that black and massy pile, [...] 885 And thro' the crowd around him there, And thro' the dense and murky air, And the thronged streets, he did espy What poets know and prophesy; And said, with voice that made them shiver [...] 890 And clung like music in my brain, And which the mute walls spoke again Prolonging it with deepened strain: 'Fear not the tyrants shall rule for ever, Or the priests of the bloody faith; [...] 895 They stand on the brink of that mighty river, Whose waves they have tainted with death: It is fed from the depths of a thousand dells, Around them it foams, and rages, and swells, And their swords and their sceptres I floating see, [...] 900 Like wrecks in the surge of eternity.' ...|$|E
60|$|Being asked, Whether the Rajah is {{not bound}} to furnish the {{cultivators}} of land with seed for their crops, {{according to the}} custom of the country? he said, The king of Tanjore, as proprietor of the land, always makes advances of money for seed for the cultivation of the land.--Being then asked, If money beyond his power of furnishing should be extorted from him, might it not prevent, in the first instance, the means of cultivating the country? he said, It certainly does; he knows it for a fact; and he knows, that, {{when he left the}} country, there were several districts which were uncultivated from that cause.--Being asked, Whether {{it is not necessary to}} be at a considerable expense in order to keep up the mounds and watercourses? he said, A very considerable one annually.--Being asked, What would be the consequence, if money should fail for that? he said, In the first instance, the country would be partially supplied with water, some districts would be overflowed, and others would be parched.--Being asked, Whether there is not a considerable dam called the Anicut, on the keeping up of which the prosperity of the country greatly depends, and which requires a great expense? he said, Yes, there is: the whole of the Tanjore country is admirably well supplied with water, nor can he conceive any method could be fallen upon more happily adapted to the cultivation and prosperity of the country; but, as the Anicut is the source of that prosperity, any injury done to that must essentially affect all the other works in the country: it is a most stupendous piece of masonry, but, from the very great floods, frequently requiring repairs, which if neglected, not only the expense of repairing must be greatly increased, but a general injury done to the whole country.--Being asked, Whether that dam has been kept in as good preservation since the prevalence of the English government as before? he <b>said,</b> <b>From</b> <b>his</b> own knowledge he cannot tell, but from everything he has read or heard of the former prosperity and opulence of the kings of Tanjore, he should suppose not.--Being asked, Whether he does not know of several attempts that have been made to prevent the repair, and even to damage the work? he said, The Rajah himself frequently complained of that to him, and he has likewise heard it from others at Tanjore.--Being asked, Who it was that attempted those acts of violence? he said, He was told it was the inhabitants of the Nabob's country adjoining to the Anicut.--Being asked, Whether they were not set on or instigated by the Nabob? he answered, The Rajah said so.--And being asked, What steps the President and Council took to punish the authors and prevent those violences? he said, To the best of his recollection, the Governor told him he would make inquiries into it, but he does not know that any inquiries were made; that Sir Thomas Rumbold, the Governor, informed him that he had laid his representations with respect to the Anicut before the Nabob, who denied that his people had given any interruption to the repairs of that work.|$|E
