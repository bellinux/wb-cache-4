5|$|Next Nuaym went to Abu Sufyan, the Confederate leader, warning {{him that}} the Qurayza had {{defected}} to Muhammad. He stated that the tribe intended to ask the Confederacy for hostages, ostensibly in return for cooperation, but really to hand over to Muhammad. Thus the Confederacy should not give a single man as hostage. Nuaym repeated the <b>same</b> <b>message</b> to other tribes in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|The Kaivalya Upanishad manuscripts vary, {{depending}} on which Veda it is attached to. The one attached to Krishna Yajurveda has 26 verses, while the edition attached to the Atharvaveda has 24 verses with an epilogue. Both convey the <b>same</b> <b>message,</b> but the former is structured as a single chapter, and the latter into two chapters (19 verses in first, 5 verses in second). The text is structured as verses, set to a poetic Vedic meter (exactly same number of syllables per verse of the song).|$|E

25|$|One common {{faux pas}} on Internet forums is to post the <b>same</b> <b>message</b> twice. Users {{sometimes}} post {{versions of a}} message that are only slightly different, especially in forums where {{they are not allowed}} to edit their earlier posts. Multiple posting instead of editing prior posts can artificially inflate a user's post count. Multiple posting can be unintentional; a user's browser might display an error message even though the post has been transmitted or a user of a slow forum might become impatient and repeatedly hit the submit button. An offline editor may post the <b>same</b> <b>message</b> twice. Multiple posting can also be used as a method of trolling or spreading forum spam. A user may also send the same post to several forums, which is termed crossposting. The term derives from Usenet, where crossposting was an accepted practice but causes problems in web forums, which lack the ability to link such posts so replies in one forum are not visible to people reading the post in other forums.|$|E

The most famous runestones and those that people tend to think of are those that tell of foreign voyages, but they comprise only c. 10% of all runestones, and they were raised in usually memory of those not having returned from Viking expeditions and not as tributes to those having returned. These runestones contain roughly the <b>same</b> <b>message</b> as the majority of the runestones, which is that people wanted to commemorate one or several dead kinsmen.|$|E
25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater {{for me than}} on The Abyss, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the <b>same</b> <b>message</b> intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E
25|$|Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started {{thinking}} about breaking Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him {{that he did not}} think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish's last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He told them he might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band. The <b>same</b> <b>message</b> was also written on the band's message board.|$|E

25|$|The 24 {{stars on}} the reverse convey the <b>same</b> <b>message</b> that the 2★4 on the obverse of some {{specimens}} does—that Missouri was the 24th state to enter the Union. The name SEDALIA, the first state capital and site of the centennial exposition, appears in exergue. Aitken's stylized monogram, RA, is near the rifle butt. The Missouri piece, and the Columbian half dollar of 1892–1893, are the only U.S. commemorative half dollars to bear none of the patriotic mottoes usually found on U.S. coinage, that is LIBERTY, IN GOD WE TRUST and E PLURIBUS UNUM. The design was liked {{at the time of}} issue; several specimens were shown and admired at the 1921 American Numismatic Association convention at Boston in August, soon after the coin's release.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} {{earliest}} view of Jesus in Islamic thought {{is that of}} a prophet; a human being chosen by God to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to the one, true God, is foundational for all Muslims. From this basis reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim identity, Jesus {{is no more than a}} messenger repeating the <b>same</b> <b>message</b> of the ages. Jesus is not traditionally perceived as divine, yet Muslim ideology is careful not to view Jesus as less than this, for in doing so would be sacrilegious and similar to rejecting a recognized Islamic prophet. The miracles of Jesus and the Qur'anic titles attributed to Jesus demonstrate the power of God rather than the divinity of Jesus—the same power behind the message of all prophets.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Mills {{decided to}} speak about his inner experiences, but only if asked to do so. He made this {{agreement}} after he received the <b>same</b> <b>message</b> from two different sources: “You must learn to speak the Word again.” Then, people began seeking him out - sometimes arriving unexpectedly on his doorstep - asking about their deepest questions and concerns. Mills found himself speaking spontaneously to these seekers. When their number became too large to speak with individually, Mills began giving lectures. He defined his spontaneous speaking, which he called Unfoldment, as “an impromptu performance under the impelling of divine ideas. It is a projection from another dimension or plane of consciousness, causing those prepared to hear to awaken to the higher or greater possibilities of living {{beyond the limits of}} three dimensions and translating {{what seems to be the}} ordinary into another level of consideration.” He also often spoke in poetry, offering some 3,000 extemporaneous poems during his lifetime.|$|E

No religion teaches violence and savagery. This confirms that theologically religion is very much interested in the realization of human well-being in life. Thus, peace must be a meeting point for all religions to implement in social life. This paper explored the Sufi’s view of the nature of God, religion, and the perennial wisdom based on the principle of spirituality and love (mahabbah) ...|$|R

Bond is directed to track down Pushkin in Tangier and kill him to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West.

500|$|Just {{outside the}} {{entrance}} to the wood was a small hermitage known as The Temple of Death. It had a thatched roof and internal enclosures formed by fake stonework panels, each covered in verses reminding the reader of [...] "the vanity, the shortness and insufficiency of human pleasures". To the right-hand side of the temple entrance, hidden out of sight, was a clock that chimed every minute, which in the words of William Bowyer, was [...] "admonishing us that Time is fleeting, and even the least portion of it to be employed in reflections on Eternity"; it was faced on the opposite side by a large white raven with a label in its mouth conveying the <b>same</b> <b>message.</b> Chained to a sloping desk in the centre of the temple was a copy of Edward Young's poem Night-Thoughts and Robert Blair's The Grave, bound in black leather.|$|E
5000|$|Contrast {{this with}} the same protocol, but in a system lacking virtual {{synchrony}} (for example, using UDP multicast, which provides no guarantees at all). Even if the same sequence of events occurs and the <b>same</b> <b>messages</b> are sent, the protocol becomes very hard to reason about, because processes may join or leave the group, or fail, while the protocol is running. If some processes miss a locking request, or a lock-release message, bugs can easily arise.
