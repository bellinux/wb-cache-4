Her very recent experience probably led Mrs. Veal to talk of death, and the books written on the subject, and she pronounced, ex cathedrâ, as a dead person was best entitled to do, that [...] "Drelincourt's book on Death was the best {{book on the subject}} ever written." [...] She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock, two Dutch books which had been translated, and several others; but Drelincourt, she said, had the clearest notions of death and the future state of any who had handled that subject. She then asked for the work [we marvel the edition and impress had not been mentioned,] and lectured on it with great eloquence and affection. Dr. Kenrick's Ascetick was also mentioned with approbation by this critical spectre, [the Doctor's work was no doubt a tenant of the shelf in some favourite publisher's shop]; and Mr. Norris's Poem on Friendship, a work, which I doubt, though honoured with a ghost's approbation, we may now seek for as vainly as Correlli tormented his memory to recover the sonata which the devil played to him in a dream. Presently after, from former habits we may suppose, the guest desires a cup of tea; but, bethinking herself of her new character, escapes from her own proposal by recollecting that Mr. Bargrave was in the habit of breaking his wife's china. It would have been indeed strangely out of character if the spirit had lunched, or breakfasted upon tea and toast. Such a consummation would have sounded as ridiculous as if the statue of the commander in Don Juan had not only accepted of the invitation of the libertine to supper, but had also committed a beef-steak to his flinty jaws and stomach of adamant. A little more conversation ensued of a less serious nature, and tending to show that even the passage from life to death leaves the female anxiety about person and dress somewhat alive. The ghost asked Mrs. Bargrave whether she did not think her very much altered, and Mrs. Bargrave of course complimented her on her good looks. Mrs. Bargrave also admired the gown which Mrs. Veal wore, and as a mark of her perfectly restored confidence, the spirit let her into the important secret, that it was a <b>scoured</b> <b>silk,</b> and lately made up. She informed her also of another secret, namely, that one Mr. Bretton had allowed her ten pounds a year; and, lastly, she requested that Mrs. Bargrave would write to her brother, and tell him how to distribute her mourning rings, and mentioned there was a purse of gold in her cabinet. She expressed some wish to see Mrs. Bargrave's daughter; but when that good lady went to the next door to seek her, she found on her return the guest leaving the house. She had got without the door, in the street, {{in the face of the}} beast market, on a Saturday, which is market day, and stood ready to part. She said she must be going, as she had to call upon her cousin Watson, (this appears to be a gratis dictum on the part of the ghost,) and, maintaining the character of mortality to the last, she quietly turned the corner, and walked out of sight.|$|E
50|$|The {{demand for}} the {{material}} continued to dwindle during the Muromachi Period due to the Onin War (1467 - 1477), exacerbated by a string of internal conflict in Kyoto and drought over the following years, {{where the majority of}} Kyoto was demolished. The people of Kyoto fled to nearby towns for safety. Finally, in the 1480s the war ended and the Kyoto residents returned home, established residence, and contributed to the name 'Nishijin', which means West position. This name was established due to Kyoto residents’ settlement being located on the exact piece of land the Army of Yamana Sozen had occupied during the war. Another group established residence in the northern portion of Kyoto in NRDD. This northern group is known for producing 'Nerinuki', a shimmering fabric made from raw silk and <b>scoured</b> <b>silk.</b>|$|E
60|$|When we {{have thus}} turned the tale, the seam without, {{it may be}} thought too ridiculous to have {{attracted}} notice. But whoever will read it as told by De Foe himself, will agree that, could the thing have happened in reality, so {{it would have been}} told. The sobering the whole supernatural visit into the language of middle or low life, gives it an air of probability even in its absurdity. The ghost of an exciseman's housekeeper, and a seamstress, were not to converse like Brutus with his Evil Genius. And the circumstances of <b>scoured</b> <b>silks,</b> broken tea-china, and such like, while they are the natural topics of such persons' conversation, would, one might have thought, be the last which an inventor would have introduced into a pretended narrative betwixt the dead and living. In short, the whole is so distinctly circumstantial, that, {{were it not for the}} impossibility, or extreme improbability at least, of such an occurrence, the evidence could not but support the story.|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{biotechnology}} has {{the potential}} to fulfil many key criteria of greener textile production. This review outlines the current research and future directions of the emerging applications of enzymatic technology in the sustainable production and processing of textiles. The state-of-the-art industrial enzymes in textile processing include amylases for desizing of cotton and cellulases for denim-washing and biopolishing. Aside from these established processes, emerging enzymatic processes such as cotton scouring and bleaching, bast fiber retting/degumming, wool <b>scouring</b> and shrink-proofing, <b>silk</b> degumming, bio-dye production and enzyme-assisted dyeing and finishing are at various stages of development. To illustrate the state-of-the-art, representative examples of enzymes in the processing of various types of textile substrates are discussed and evaluated in this article. The major limitations of the large scale implications of textile biotechnology are lack of sufficient research efforts to make it an economically viable option and issues related to technological glitches. The limitations of existing approaches will be highlighted and the requirements of continuous improvement to overcome current obstacles will be demonstrated by critical assessment...|$|R
