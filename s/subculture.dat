Dominant technique of data collection were semistructured interviews with adolescents, who identify themselves with <b>subcultures</b> and also with adolescents, who distance from <b>subcultures.</b> Respondents of both researches were 14 to 17 years old. Based on statements made by informants, three basic attitudes, which teenagers take in realation to <b>subcultures</b> (full identification, ambivalent identification and non-identification) and which involve diverse conceptions of <b>subcultures,</b> were described. These resides in emphasizing internal or external signs of membership in <b>subcultures</b> and perception of obligatoriness [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Communities {{have formed}} around the creation, play and {{discussion}} of LARP. These communities have developed a <b>subculture</b> that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP <b>subculture</b> focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre with the rapid uptake of the World of Darkness setting in the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Otaku often {{participate}} in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their <b>subculture.</b> Anime and manga otaku {{are the subject}} of numerous self-critical works, such as Otaku no Video, which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes fun at the otaku <b>subculture</b> and includes Gainax's own staff as the interviewees. Other works depict otaku <b>subculture</b> less critically, such as Genshiken and Comic Party. A well-known novel-cum-manga-cum-anime is Welcome to the N.H.K., which focuses on the subcultures popular with otaku and highlights other social outcasts such as the hikikomori and NEETs. Works that focus on an otaku character include WataMote, the story of an unattractive and unsociable otome game otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status. Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, Otaku Unite!, focuses on the American side of the otaku culture.|$|E

In {{an attempt to}} overcome the idea of <b>subcultures</b> as forms of deviance or resistance, they describe <b>subcultures</b> as collectivities which, on a cultural level, are sufficiently homogeneous internally and heterogeneous {{with respect to the}} outside world to be capable of developing, as Paul Hodkinson points out, consistent distinctiveness, identity, commitment and autonomy. Defined by Sarah Thornton as taste cultures, <b>subcultures</b> are endowed with elastic, porous borders, and are inserted into relationships of interaction and mingling, rather than independence and conflict, with the cultural industry and mass media, as Steve Redhead and David Muggleton emphasize. The very idea of a unique, internally homogeneous, dominant culture is explicitly criticized. Thus forms of individual involvement in <b>subcultures</b> are fluid and gradual, differentiated according to each actor’s investment, outside clear dichotomies. The ideas of different levels of subcultural capital (Sarah Thornton) possessed by each individual, of the supermarket of style (Ted Polhemus) and of style surfing (Martina Böse) replace that of the <b>subculture’s</b> insiders and outsiders - with the perspective of <b>subcultures</b> supplying resources for the construction of new identities going beyond strong, lasting identifications.|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} {{criticism of}} the integrative `shared values' view of culture has prompted many researchers to argue that one way of advancing culture research is by examining the ways different <b>subcultures</b> interact in organizational settings. However, existing studies in this area generally explore the nature of <b>subcultures</b> and the differences between them. The findings from a study of two large healthcare organizations suggest that greater insights can be generated into organizational <b>subcultures</b> by studying doctors, nurses and non-clinical managers through multiple analytical lenses. Such analyses help to uncover the wide variation in subcultural values, norms and assumptions, revealing those that are shared, those that differ {{and those that are}} characterized by ambiguity both within and across <b>subcultures.</b> It is argued that this approach reveals interesting insights into the dynamics of <b>subcultures</b> {{and the ways in which}} different <b>subcultures</b> interpret and respond to management initiated changes designed to transform organizational practices...|$|R
5|$|Morikawa Kaichirō {{identifies}} the <b>subculture</b> as distinctly Japanese, {{a product of}} the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a caste system, but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society {{identifies the}} value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku <b>subculture.</b>|$|E
5|$|Otaku <b>subculture</b> is {{a central}} theme of various anime and manga works, documentaries and {{academic}} research. The <b>subculture</b> began in the 1980s as changing social mentalities and the nurturing of otaku traits by Japanese schools combined with the resignation of such individuals to become social outcasts. The subculture's birth coincided with the anime boom, {{after the release of}} works such as Mobile Suit Gundam before it branched into Comic Market. The definition of otaku subsequently became more complex, and numerous classifications of otaku emerged. In 2005, the Nomura Research Institute divided otaku into twelve groups and estimated the size and market impact of each of these groups. Other institutions have split it further or focus on a single otaku interest. These publications classify distinct groups including anime, manga, camera, automobile, idol and electronics otaku. The economic impact of otaku has been estimated to be as high as ¥2 trillion ($18 billion).|$|E

This means that different geographical, ethnic or age groups of employees could have different assumptions, values and beliefs about the protection of information, resulting in unique information security <b>subcultures.</b> This research sets out to understand how dominant information security cultures and <b>subcultures</b> develop and how they can be influenced positively over time through targeted interventions. In support of this, a summary of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence information security culture is presented. An empirical case study was conducted using a survey approach with a validated information security culture questionnaire to illustrate how to identify dominant information security cultures and <b>subcultures.</b> The survey was conducted at four intervals in the same organisation over a number of years to identify potential information security <b>subcultures</b> and to monitor the change, if targeted interventions for each are implemented. Using t-tests and ANOVA tests, a number of information security <b>subcultures</b> were identified, mostly evident across the organisation’s office locations (which are separated geographically), as well as between employees that worked in the IT division compared to those who did not. The data indicate that the dominant information security culture and <b>subcultures</b> improved over time to a more positive information security culture after the implementation of targeted interventions. This illustrates how the identification and targeting of information security <b>subcultures</b> with customised interventions can influence the information security culture positively. By using information security interventions, organisations can target their high risk <b>subcultures</b> and monitor the change over time through continuous assessment, thereby minimising the risk to information protection from a human perspective.

By means of intensive investigation conducted through observation, questionnaire and interviews, qualitative data about the existence of three delinquent <b>subcultures</b> at Setjhaba-sohle secondary school was gathered. From the data collected it was evident that there are delinquent <b>subcultures</b> whose beliefs, norms, values and activities are working against the school culture. Their existence is a result of a reaction to the frustrating situation caused by the home, the school, the society and peer group during the process of socialisation. The findings revealed that there are background factors which force youths into delinquent <b>subcultures.</b> This suggests that if the socialising stimuli to which a developing child is exposed could be corrected, then the disorganisation caused by these <b>subcultures</b> could be kept to its minimum level. The interviews, observation, and questionnaire conducted at Setjaba-sohle secondary school revealed the existence of three delinquent <b>subcultures,</b> namely, Makoloane, Matariana, and Mapantsola. Under pressure from their peer groups, together with background factors, these groups had formulated their own values, norms and actions which are different from the school culture. The conclusion reached is that the type of delinquent <b>subcultures</b> at school is determined by the type of community that the school serves. The existence of these <b>subcultures</b> result as a reaction to malfunctioning and disintegration of the community. If the community can re-integrate, unite and help one another, the circular causality of contributing factors to delinquency can be kept to a minimum...|$|R
