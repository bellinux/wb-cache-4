40|$|A linear quantum {{dynamical}} theory for squeezing {{the output of}} the trapped Bose-Einstein condensate is presented with the Bogoliubov approximation. We observe that the non-classical properties, such as <b>sub-Poisson</b> <b>distribution</b> and quadrature squeezing effect, mutually oscillate between the quantum states of the applied optical field and the resulting atom laser beam with time. In particular, it is shown that an initially squeezed optical field will lead to squeezing in the outcoupled atomic beam at later times. Comment: 6 pages, Latex file, Phys. Rev.

40|$|We {{characterize}} the practical photon-counting receiver in optical scattering communication with finite sampling rate and electrical noise. In the receiver side, the detected signal {{can be characterized}} as a series of pulses generated by photon-multiplier (PMT) detector and held by the pulse-holding circuits, which are then sampled by the analog-to-digit convertor (ADC) with finite sampling rate and counted by a rising-edge pulse detector. However, the finite small pulse width incurs the dead time effect that may lead to <b>sub-Poisson</b> <b>distribution</b> on the recorded pulses. We analyze first-order and second-order moments on the number of recorded pulses with finite sampling rate at the receiver side under two cases where the sampling period is shorter than or equal to the pulse width as well as longer than the pulse width. Moreover, we adopt the maximum likelihood (ML) detection. In order to simplify the analysis, we adopt binomial distribution approximation on the number of recorded pulses in each slot. A tractable holding time and decision threshold selection rule is provided aiming to maximize the minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance between the two distributions. The performance of proposed <b>sub-Poisson</b> <b>distribution</b> and the binomial approximation are verified by the experimental results. The equivalent arrival rate and holding time predicted by the of sub-Poisson model and the associated proposed binomial distribution on finite sampling rate and the electrical noise are validated by the simulation results. The proposed the holding time and decision threshold selection rule performs close to the optimal one...|$|E
40|$|The model {{describing}} three coupled quantum oscillators with {{decay of}} Rayleigh mode into the Stokes and vibration (phonon) modes is examined. Due to the Manley-Rowe relations {{the problem of}} exact eigenvalues and eigenstates is reduced to the calculation of new orthogonal polynomials defined both by the difference and differential equations. The quantum statistical properties are examined in the case when initially: the Stokes mode is in the vacuum state; the Rayleigh mode is in the number state; and the vibration mode is {{in the number of}} or squeezed states. The collapses and revivals are obtained for different initial conditions as well as the change in time the <b>sub-Poisson</b> <b>distribution</b> by the super-Poisson distribution and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|Biophotons (BPHs) {{are weak}} photons within or emitted from living organisms. BPH {{emission}} originates from a de-localized coherent electromagnetic field within living organisms and is {{regulated by the}} field. Based on experimental results concerning Poisson and <b>sub-Poisson</b> <b>distributions</b> of photocount statistics, the coherent properties of BPHs and their functions in cell communication are described in this paper. We discuss functions of BPH roles in some important processes, including DNA replication, transcription, protein synthesis, and cell signalling, and in the processes of oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the interplay between}} {{stochastic}} gene expression and system design using simple stochastic models of auto-activation and auto-inhibition. Using the Poisson Representation, a technique whose particular usefulness {{in the context of}} non-linear gene regulation models we elucidate, we find exact results for these feedback models in the steady state. Further, we exploit this representation to analyze the parameter spaces of each model, determine which dimensionless combinations of rates are the shape determinants for each distribution, and thus demarcate where in the parameter-space qualitatively different behaviors arise. These behaviors include power-law tailed distributions, bimodal <b>distributions</b> and <b>sub-Poisson</b> <b>distributions.</b> We also show how these distribution shapes change when the strength of the feedback is tuned. Using our results, we reexamine how well the auto-inhibition and auto-activation models serve their conventionally assumed roles as paradigms for noise suppression and noise exploitation, respectively...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{physically}} motivated semi-analytic model {{to understand the}} clustering of high redshift Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs). We show that the model parameters constrained by the observed luminosity functions, {{can be used to}} predict large scale bias and angular correlation function of LAEs. These predictions are shown to reproduce the observations remarkably well. We find that average masses of dark matter halos hosting LAEs brighter than threshold narrow band magnitude 25 are 10 ^ 11 M_. These are smaller than that of typical Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) brighter than similar threshold continuum magnitude by a factor 10. This results in a smaller clustering strength of LAEs compared to LBGs. However, using the observed relationship between UV continuum and Lyman-alpha luminosity of LAEs, we show that both LAEs and LBGs belong to the same parent galaxy population with narrow band techniques having greater efficiency in picking up galaxies with low UV luminosity. We also show that the lack of evidence for the presence of the one halo term in the observed LAE angular correlation functions can be attributed to <b>sub-Poisson</b> <b>distribution</b> of LAEs in dark matter halos {{as a result of their}} low halo occupations.
