Built {{specifically for the}} 1938 Rhön competitions the H.IIIa {{was found to have}} unsatisfactory turning performance, so the H.IIIc, to be flown by Werner Blech, was modified with a canard <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> above and in front of the cockpit to assist with pitch control at low speeds.|$|E
25|$|An {{advance on}} the basic design was the iron ploughshare, a {{replaceable}} horizontal cutting <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the tip of}} the share. The earliest ploughs with a detachable and replaceable share date from around 1000 BC in the Ancient Near East, and the earliest iron ploughshares from ca. 500 BC in China. Early mouldboards were basically wedges that sat inside the cut formed by the coulter, turning over the soil to the side. The ploughshare spread the cut horizontally below the surface, so when the mouldboard lifted it, a wider area of soil was turned over. Mouldboards are known in Britain from the late 6th century on.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} basic {{tutorial}} for implementing <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> technology in lab-built scientific instruments. We discuss {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of using <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> chips. We also describe methods for the development and prototyping of <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> circuitry in home-built electronics. The method of soldering <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> components in a common toaster oven is described. We provide advice from our own experience in developing this technology, and argue that <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> technology is often preferable to using leaded components when building large circuits, and is essential if the desired component characteristics are only available in <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> packages.

For added support, <b>surface</b> <b>mounts</b> can also include triangular brackets, also referred to as gusset plates, to reinforce the connection between the flange and tubing. <b>Surface</b> <b>mounts</b> with this extra support are called gusset <b>mounts.</b> <b>Surface</b> and gusset <b>mounts</b> are used to secure a bike rack into an existing piece of concrete.|$|R
25|$|Identical to the H.IIIa, {{but with}} a canard <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> above {{and in front of}} the cockpit. One H.IIIc was built, to be flown by Werner Blech at the 1938 Rhön contest. The {{intention}} of the canard surface was to improve CLmax, but actual results were inconclusive. Blech flew the H.IIIc well and was leading Scheidhauer in the competition. On the same day as Scheidhauer's disastrous flight, Blech entered the same cloud as Scheidhauer after telling other pilots not to enter it after him. Blech's H.IIIc was next seen fluttering slowly to the ground without a canopy and trailing Blech's parachute bag. Blech's ice-covered body was discovered later on a rocky outcrop of the Wasserkuppe.|$|E
25|$|Film {{capacitors}} for use {{in electronic}} equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for point-to-point wiring and some traditional through-hole printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences. Although the transient heat of reflow soldering induces high stress in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in <b>Surface</b> <b>Mounted</b> Device“ (SMD) packages.|$|E
500|$|After {{extensive}} {{wind tunnel}} testing, the stabilator was mounted {{at the top}} of the fin for optimum stability and control about the pitch axis. Because the vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective, it could act as a wing on rudder application (a phenomenon known as [...] "Dutch roll"). To offset this effect, the wings were angled downward to give 10° anhedral. The rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small yaw damper <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> at the bottom of the fin.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> {{package is}} favored where {{a low profile}} package is {{required}} or the space available to mount the package is limited. As electronic devices become more complex and available space is reduced, the desirability of a <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> package increases. Concurrently, as the device complexity increases, the heat generated by operation increases. If the heat is not removed, {{the temperature of the}} device rises shortening the operational life. It is therefore highly desirable to develop <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> packages having high thermal conductivity.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>mounting</b> {{lends itself}} well {{to a high}} degree of automation, {{reducing}} labor costs and greatly increasing production rates. [...] Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. <b>Surface</b> <b>mount</b> components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper; prices of semiconductor <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> devices (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages. Some wire-ended components, such as 1N4148 small-signal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.|$|R

2500|$|In 1879 Moy {{demonstrated}} his [...] "military kite" [...] to {{a meeting}} of the Royal Aeronautical Society. This was a small model aircraft propelled by a pair of rubber-driven propellers which rotated in opposite directions. This had two lifting surfaces like the Aerial Steamer, but was more like a modern aircraft in that there was a principal lifting <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> in front of a second lifting surface of half the span and a quarter of the area. [...] The bow-shaped surfaces were made of cambric, had dihedral and an adjustable angle of incidence and were fixed to on a central pine box-girder, mounted on wheels. Unlike Alphonse Pénaud's Planophore of 1871, which had to be hand-launched, the Military Kite could take off under its own power.|$|E
2500|$|The Blériot XII was a {{high wing}} tractor {{configuration}} monoplane with a deep uncovered fuselage, with the wings mounted on the upper longerons and the pilot and passenger seated between upper and lower longerons below {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. Lateral control was effected by a pair of ailerons mounted independently of the wings on the lower longerons behind the pilot. The prototype was initially powered by an [...] E.N.V. Type D water-cooled engine mounted on the lower longerons, driving a two-bladed propeller mounted at the same level as the wing [...] via a chain with a reduction ratio of about 2:1. [...] When first flown the empennage consisted of an elevator at the extreme rear of the fuselage, with a separate fixed horizontal <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> above and in front of it, and three small rectangular rudders above the elevator. [...] After initial flight trials during May 1909 the rudders were removed. Various configurations were experimented with, the final arrangement being an elongated triangular fin with a rectangular unbalanced rudder hinged to the trailing edge.|$|E
