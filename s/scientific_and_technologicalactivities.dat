40|$|This paper takes Tianjin {{for example}} and {{analyzes}} the development tend of <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological progress in Tianjin. From five aspects as ‘environment of <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological progress’, ‘input of <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological activities’, ‘output of <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological activities’, ‘high-tech industrialization’, ‘science and technology {{for economic and}} social development’, the paper analysis the correlation between GDP <b>and</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological progress. Research finding shows that these five indicators are all positive correlated with the GDP, and especially ‘environment of <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological progress’, ‘input of <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological activities’, and ‘science and technology for economic and social development’, which are significantly positive correlation of GDP. The {{extent to which these}} five indicators impact the GDP from strong to weak is ‘input of <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological activities’, ‘science and technology for economic and social development’, ‘environment of <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological progress’, ‘high-tech industrialization’, <b>and</b> ‘output of <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological activities’. The ‘input of <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technological activities’ index (2011) in Tianjin scores only 70 which ranks fourth among the five indexes, however its impact on GDP is most significant. So it would be best for Tianjin to increase the human and financial input in ‘scientific and technological activities’ to promote the growth of GDP in future.  </p...|$|R
