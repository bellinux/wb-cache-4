5|$|In addition, land {{availability}} {{has a large}} {{effect on}} the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and <b>suitable</b> for solar panels. Roofs {{have been found to}} be a <b>suitable</b> place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are <b>suitable</b> for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.|$|E
5|$|Outside of breed-specific shows, the Saddlebred is also {{promoted}} as <b>suitable</b> for competitive trail riding, endurance riding, dressage, combined driving, eventing, and show jumping. Some Saddlebreds are also <b>suitable</b> for fox hunting, cutting and roping. Because {{they are so}} closely affiliated with their traditional show ring competition, they are sometimes mistaken for warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses when participating in other equine events. They are also <b>suitable</b> family horses used for trail and pleasure riding and ranch work.|$|E
5|$|The 1970 and 1971 seasons {{provided}} no <b>suitable</b> seeding candidates. Despite this, flights were conducted into Hurricane Ginger. Ginger {{was not a}} <b>suitable</b> storm for seeding, due to its diffuse, indistinct nature. The seeding had no effect. Ginger was the last seeding done by Project Stormfury.|$|E
5|$|A {{party from}} the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) arrived the same month, but {{decided it was}} not <b>suitable</b> for a base and instead located the mission {{downstream}} at Bor.|$|E
5|$|A {{thin layer}} of horn is glued onto {{what will be the}} belly of the bow, the side facing the archer. Water buffalo horn is very <b>suitable,</b> as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok, oryx, ibex, and that of Hungarian grey cattle. Goat and sheep horn can also be used. Most forms of cow horn are not <b>suitable,</b> as they soon {{delaminate}} with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.|$|E
5|$|AluminumS63 (9.0l) , {{and steel}} HP65 (8.2l) are smaller and {{lighter than the}} Al80, but have a lower capacity, and are <b>suitable</b> for smaller divers or shorter dives.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} implies, the mistle thrush is {{important}} in propagating the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of <b>suitable</b> trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush, which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted, possibly in a <b>suitable</b> location for germination.|$|E
5|$|Ben oil, {{extracted}} from {{the seeds of the}} Moringa oleifera. High in behenic acid. Extremely stable edible oil. Also <b>suitable</b> for biofuel.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{efforts have}} yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit <b>suitable</b> for {{either of the two}} forms of apple allergy.|$|E
5|$|Brown rats use social {{learning}} {{in a wide}} range of situations, but perhaps especially so in acquiring food preferences. Learning about <b>suitable</b> foods can be divided into four life stages.|$|E
5|$|By <b>suitable</b> {{choice of}} length, the stub {{can be used}} in place of a capacitor, an {{inductor}} or a resonant circuit.|$|E
5|$|C# is {{intended}} to be <b>suitable</b> for writing applications for both hosted and embedded systems, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems, down to the very small having dedicated functions.|$|E
5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore size. In oligonucleotide chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG <b>suitable</b> for further processing, {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an anchoring point for linkers <b>suitable</b> for oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E
5|$|Centre Point, {{just beyond}} {{the eastern end of}} Oxford Street next to Tottenham Court Road station, was {{designed}} by property developer Harry Hyams and opened in 1966. It failed to find a <b>suitable</b> tenant and sat empty for many years, eventually being occupied by squatters who used it as a centre of protest against the lack of <b>suitable</b> accommodation in Central London. In 2015, the building began to be converted into residential flats, with development expected to finish in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Currently, curium is {{not used}} as a nuclear fuel owing to its low {{availability}} and high price. 245Cm and 247Cm have a very small critical mass and therefore {{could be used in}} portable nuclear weapons, but none have been reported thus far. Curium-243 is not <b>suitable</b> for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat. Curium-247 would be highly <b>suitable,</b> having a half-life 647 times that of plutonium-239.|$|E
5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are <b>suitable</b> for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more <b>suitable</b> for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
5|$|Failed {{to ensure}} {{availability}} of <b>suitable</b> tyres for the race.|$|E
5|$|Ferryman Field is a {{split-level}} field located to the North of the site, <b>suitable</b> for 'back to basics' camping {{due to its}} wooded {{nature and}} distance from facilities.|$|E
5|$|Given an {{adequate}} supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons after three larval stages. Within the cocoon, the larva moults {{for a final}} time and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. This can take just four days, but may take much longer under adverse conditions, and there follows a variable-length stage during which the pre-emergent adult awaits a <b>suitable</b> opportunity to emerge. Trigger factors for emergence include vibrations (including sound), heat (in warm-blooded hosts), and increased levels of carbon dioxide, all of which stimuli may indicate {{the presence of a}} <b>suitable</b> host. Large numbers of pre-emergent fleas may be present in otherwise flea-free environments, and the introduction of a <b>suitable</b> host may trigger a mass emergence.|$|E
5|$|Grapefruit seed oil, {{extracted}} from the seeds of grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi). Grapefruit seed oil was extracted experimentally in 1930 and was shown to be <b>suitable</b> for making soap.|$|E
5|$|Honesty oil, {{from the}} seeds of Lunaria annua, which contain 30–40% oil. The oil is {{particularly}} rich in long chain fatty acids, including erucic and nervonic acid, making it <b>suitable</b> for certain industrial purposes.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Australian and New Zealand Governments, at {{the request}} of Pacific Island nations, sent defence representatives into the South-West Pacific region to assess {{surveillance}} and maritime patrol requirements. The governments of a number of the Pacific nations expressed their concern about the need for a <b>suitable</b> naval patrol force to meet their new surveillance requirements. The Australian government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP), to provide <b>suitable</b> patrol vessels, training and infrastructure to island nations in the region. The Pacific Patrol Boat Systems Program Office was created within the Minor War Vessels Branch of the RAN procurement organisation.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, {{infusion}} of silicon carbide nano-particles in molten magnesium was {{mentioned as a}} way to produce a new strong and plastic alloy <b>suitable</b> for use in aeronautics, aerospace, automobile and micro-electronics.|$|E
5|$|In {{ecosystems}} such as mangrove swamps, trees {{play a role}} {{in developing}} the habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and creating <b>suitable</b> conditions for further mangrove colonisation. Thus mangrove swamps tend to extend seawards in <b>suitable</b> locations. Mangrove swamps also provide an effective buffer against the more damaging effects of cyclones and tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|In general, data {{normalisation}} {{can help}} diminish {{the amount of}} experimental work and can increase {{the reliability of the}} output, and is <b>suitable</b> for both graphical and numerical analysis.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a sustainable development of ethanol production, in September 2009 the government issued by decree a countrywide agroecological land use zoning to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas. According to the new criteria, 92.5% of the Brazilian territory is not <b>suitable</b> for sugarcane plantation. The government considers that the <b>suitable</b> areas are {{more than enough to}} meet the future demand for ethanol and sugar in the domestic and international markets foreseen for the next decades.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup {{production}} is centred in northeastern North America; however, given the correct weather conditions, {{it can be}} made wherever <b>suitable</b> species of maple trees grow.|$|E

5|$|Random {{matrices}} are matrices whose {{entries are}} random numbers, subject to <b>suitable</b> probability distributions, such as matrix normal distribution. Beyond probability theory, they are applied in domains ranging from number theory to physics.|$|E
5|$|Rathamma {{lives in}} a village with her sons Raja and Kundu, and her {{daughter}} Ammadu. Raja is a teacher and a theatre enthusiast. Along with Kundu {{and a group of}} fellow actors, Raja performs plays in a local theatre during his free time. Raja's maternal uncle Govindayya, a pleader, wants him to marry his daughter Chitti, who is in a relationship with a bodybuilder named Bheemudu. Raja rejects the proposal and Govindayya offers to find a <b>suitable</b> bridegroom for Ammadu if Raja marries Chitti. Raja rejects the proposal and with Kundu he sets out to find a <b>suitable</b> bridegroom for Ammadu.|$|E
5|$|Rice bran oil is {{a highly}} stable cooking and salad oil, <b>suitable</b> for {{high-temperature}} cooking. It also has potential as a biofuel.|$|E
5|$|Stunned, the {{remaining}} Chili Peppers, {{who had no}} <b>suitable</b> replacement for Frusciante, hired Arik Marshall to play {{the remaining}} dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed {{an ad in the}} L.A. Weekly for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be a waste of time. After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a <b>suitable</b> guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. He had always been the band's first choice, but had been too busy following the 1991 breakup of Jane's Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.|$|E
