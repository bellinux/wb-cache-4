50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{property of}} strip photography {{is that it}} is a 2-dimensional slice across space-time. In some cases this is a slice perpendicular to the frame, in 1 spatial dimension (the slit) and 1 temporal dimension (the exposure time), if the slit is stationary (as in a photo finish), showing one strip over time (e.g., the finish line), where the <b>scanning</b> <b>direction</b> (e.g., horizontal) represents time, not space. In other cases this is a slice diagonal (in space-time) to the frame, with 1 spatial dimension (the slit) and 1 spatial-temporal dimension (the exposure time and moving slit) if the slit moves, as in a panoramic camera, which shows a single frame, but different strips are at different times, in which case the <b>scanning</b> <b>direction</b> represents both space and time. Thus, even though the image is viewed as a 2-dimensional spatial image, it does not depict a single instant.|$|E

50|$|Two Low Energy Detectors (LEDs) {{were located}} in {{positions}} 180° apart on {{opposite side of the}} hexagon. They had thin ~3 mm thick NaI detectors, also 5 in in diameter, covering the energy range from ~10—200 keV. Their FOV was defined to fan-shaped beams of 1.7° x 20° FWHM by passive, parallel slat-plate collimators. The slats of the two LEDs were inclined to ±30° to the nominal HEAO <b>scanning</b> <b>direction,</b> crossing each other at 60°.Thus, working together, they covered a wide field of view, but could localize celestial sources with a precision determined by their 1.7° narrow fields.|$|E
50|$|In strip photography, {{distance}} is interchanged (or mixed) with time, so width in the <b>scanning</b> <b>direction</b> (say, horizontal) {{is proportional to}} time, and thus inversely proportional to speed. Slower-moving objects occupy more time, and thus appear wider, while faster-moving objects are narrower, as they occupy the slit for a shorter period of time. In extreme cases a very rapidly moving object can be captured for only a single strip or even none at all (if discrete capture, as in a digital camera), while a stationary object (notably background) will appear as a horizontal line (a stripe). These differences are particularly notable in cases of movement at differing constant speeds, such as parallax from a train window or differing speeds of traffic (esp. if in differing directions diagonal to the camera) or people walking. Further, {{in the case of}} motion towards or away from the camera, size changes, creating additional distortion.|$|E

Two of the WP-3D aircraft were {{owned and operated}} by NOAA and were named N42 and N43. The P-3 N42 was equipped with a fore and aft fixed flat-plate antenna which served as a dual-beam Doppler weather radar. The P-3, N43 was equipped with one single-parabolic antenna which was able to operate as a dual-Doppler radar by alternating <b>scanning</b> <b>direction</b> (once again between fore and aft). These NOAA aircraft were able to attain 1.5 km horizontal resolution. The third P-3, NRL, was equipped with an ELDORA (Electra Doppler radar) and was the first ELDORA used in the imaging of tropical cyclones. In addition to the radars, each aircraft was equipped with a large quantity of dropsondes to be deployed every 5-10 minutes (about 30-65 km on flight path). During Hurricane Katrina, 302 dropsondes were deployed, during Ophelia 462, and Rita 503. A detailed description of dropsonde specifications can be found in Hock and Franklin 1999. The aircraft transmitted all of the information collected by these instruments to the RAINEX operations center (ROC) at RSMAS during flight in order for the ground team to forecast the development of the tropical cyclone while flight crews were in the air and afterward.|$|E

Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has shown significant promise for coarse root detection and measurement, however root orientation relative to <b>scanning</b> transect <b>direction,</b> the difficulty identifying dead root mass, and the effects of root shadowing are all key factors affecting biomass estimation that require additional research. Specifically, many aspects of GPR applicability for coarse root measurement have not been tested with a full range of antenna frequencies. We tested the effects of multiple <b>scanning</b> <b>directions,</b> root crossover, and root versus soil moisture content in a sand-hill mixed oak community using a 1500 MHz antenna, which provides higher resolution than the oft used 900 MHz antenna. Combining four <b>scanning</b> <b>directions</b> produced a significant relationship between GPR signal reflectance and coarse root biomass (R 2 = 0. 75) (p < 0. 01) and reduced variability encountered when fewer <b>scanning</b> <b>directions</b> were used. Additionally, significantly fewer roots were correctly identified when their moisture content was allowed to equalize with the surrounding soil (p < 0. 01), providing evidence to support assertions that GPR cannot reliably identify dead root mass. The 1500 MHz antenna was able to identify roots in close proximity of each other as well as roots shadowed beneath shallower roots, providing higher precision than a 900 MHz antenna.
