40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the efficacy of different mineral separation procedures to validate the EN 1788 (2001) European Union standard protocol for better identification of irradiated fish and shellfish. The silicate minerals were isolated with physical density separation method from two types of non-irradiated freeze-dried fish and shellfish that included Pacific saury (Cololabis saira), mackerel (Scomber japonicus), <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Penaeidae</b> metapenaeus), and mussel (Mytilus coruscus). Radiation-specific thermoluminescence (TL) peaks (glow curve 1) were observed between 150 – 250 °C. The peaks are typical for the irradiated food; despite the samples being not irradiated. Apparently it showed that the isolated minerals were contaminated with organic materials such as bone, etc. Acid-hydrolysis digestion was employed to remove the possible contaminants. The minerals obtained through alternative pre-treatment showed no TL curves in radiation specific temperature range. Moreover, acid hydrolysis extraction resulted in producing higher mineral yields and lower background luminescence. Results were also confirmed by calculating TL ratios (glow curve 1 /glow curve 2) to confirm the irradiation history of samples. Furthermore, different time and temperature treatments on TL intensity of irradiated standard quartz (SiO 2) minerals showed that the acid-hydrolysis can be adjusted to 50 °C and 3 h for better luminescence determinations. ...|$|E

The material was collected in March-April 1991, aboard the R/V "El Puma" (ICML, UNAM). A total of 29 stations were occupied and samples of invertebrates and fishes were obtained with three types of gear: an 80 -foot shrimp trawl, a Mediterranean bottom trawl and a modified Agassiz dredge. Fifty-two species of macro-crustaceans were collected; these included 6 species of stomatopods, and 46 species or subspecies of decapod crustaceans (10 Penaeoidea, 3 Caridea, 2 Palinura, 2 Anomura, and 29 Brachyura). As many as 16 species had never been reported previously in the literature for the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Figures available for stomatopods are close to those reported in literature for areas located off the coast of Sinaloa and Nayarit (SE of Gulf of California), in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico, and in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica. When compared to what is known of subtidal decapods, however, number of species is comparatively lower in the Gulf of Tehuantepec than in the SE Gulf of California where as many as 107 species, including only a few cryptic species, have been collected. As far as distribution is concerned, the following results were obtained: 1) all species, except one, have previously been recognized as members of the crustacean fauna of the tropical east Pacific; 2) all stomatopods present a distribution ranging from the Gulf of California, Mexico, to Peru, except for Lysiosquilla panamica; 3) most species of decapod are also know from the Gulf of California (or even from further north) to Peru (or even further south), but two species have never been found south of the Gulf of Panama; one does not seem to range south of Nicaragua; two are known south to Gorgona Island, Colombia; seven have never been reported further south than Ecuador; and two have their currently known southernmost limit in the Gulf of Tehuantepec...|$|E

40|$|The suprabenthos or hyperbenthos is the macrofaunal {{assemblage}} of small-sized organisms that interact {{for some time}} in the benthic boundary layer. Information about the taxonomic composition and role of suprabenthic species, especially in littoral zones, is scarce and scattered. This work attempts to contribute alleviate this problem. We analyze the temporal and spatial variations of suprabenthic assemblages in the swash-zone from four beaches of the littoral coast of Venezuela. For each beach, two sites were chosen, and special attention was given to water and sediment characteristics. 12 environmental variables were measured: Dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation percentage, pH, salinity, surface temperature, total, organic and inorganic suspended solids, total organic carbon, organic matter in sediment, grain size of sediment, and amount of dragged material of sample. All faunal samples were taken on a monthly basis during 2011; these were extracted using a manual suprabenthic sledge towed parallel to the shoreline. Samples were sorted and identified to their lowest possible taxonomic level. A total of 24 141 specimens (mean abundance: 26. 16 ± 55. 35 ind. /m²) belonging to 21 taxonomic groups were identified. Analysis suggests that seasonality does not explain observed changes either in fauna or environmental variables. It was found that suprabenthic assemblages, total suprabenthos density, richness and environmental variables changed in a dissimilar fashion between months and beaches. The most frequent groups were amphipods and decapods; and at the species/categories level post-larval <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Penaeidae),</b> Grapsidae crab megalopae and Arenaeus cribarius megalopae were common. Dissimilarity between months in each beach was primarily explained by the abundance of amphipods, ctenophores, decapods and mysids. For particular months and selected beaches very high abundances of ctenophores were found. This group dominated the sample even though it is not usually a representative group in suprabenthos. Samples showed low correlations between suprabenthos and environmental variables. A somewhat stronger correlation could be established between water characteristics and dragged material abundance. The studied suprabenthos assemblage was found to have high taxa richness and very dynamic behaviour at spatial and temporal scale. Further analysis suggested that there is no evident pattern of distribution and that causality can not be directly attributed to temporal variation only. Possibly there is an influence of a synergy of environmentals or biological factors, rather than a single variable. The species Americamysis bahia and Americamysis taironana are reported {{for the first time in}} Venezuela.

40|$|Molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH), a peptide {{member of}} the {{crustacean}} hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) family, is commonly considered as a negative regulator during the molt cycle in crustaceans. Phylogenetic analysis of CHH family peptides in <b>penaeidae</b> <b>shrimps</b> suggested {{that there is no}} significant differentiation between MIH and vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone (VIH, another peptide member of CHH family), by far the most potent negative regulator of crustacean vitellogenesis known. Thus, MIH may also play a role in regulating vitellogenesis. In this study, two previously reported putative MIHs (LivMIH 1 and LivMIH 2) in the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and further confirmed by western blot. Regulation of vitellogenin (VTG) mRNA expression by recombinant LivMIH 1 and LivMIH 2 challenge was performed by both in vitro hepatopancreatic primary cells culture and in vivo injection approaches. In in vitro primary culture of shrimp hepatopancreatic cells, only LivMIH 2 but not LivMIH 1 administration could improve the mRNA expression of VTG. In in vivo injection experiments, similarly, only LivMIH 2 but not LivMIH 1 could stimulate hepatopancreatic VTG gene expression and induce ovary maturation. Our study may provide evidence for one isoform of MIH (MIH 2 in L. vannamei) may serve as one of the mediators of the physiological progress of molting and vitellogenesis.

The nations engaged in shrimp fishing are numerous; Japan, U. S. A., Mexico, Thailand, India, lead in terms of volume of catch. Japan, for instance one of the large shrimp consuming nations in the world, has been dispatching shrimp fishing boats to many countries whether on her own capital or in joint ventures. Japan annually imports some 100, 000 tons of frozen shrimp of which penaeids rank first in quantity. Meanwhile, the demand for shrimp is expected to rise in the years to come. The shrimp fishing industry and its operation are conducted and managed naturally, as indicated above, under international agreement. However, confusions arise particularly regarding the common names of shrimp caught or the products. It is evident that many commercial species of penaeids are given common names which differ from one country to another.
