5|$|In November 2011, {{the club}} {{announced}} that the away supporters' section would be moved from the South <b>Stand</b> <b>to</b> the North Stand Upper {{from the beginning of}} the 2012–13 season. As a result, minor modifications to the ground will be necessary.|$|E
5|$|A serious {{incident}} involving hooliganism before, {{during and after}} a match against Millwall in 1985 caused the club's then chairman, Conservative MP David Evans, to introduce a scheme effective {{from the start of}} 1986–87 banning all visiting supporters from the ground, and requiring home fans to carry identity cards when attending matches. Conversion to an all-seater ground also began in 1986. Away fans returned for 1990–91, and grass a year later. The David Preece Stand was erected in 1991, and the conversion of the Kenilworth <b>Stand</b> <b>to</b> an all-seater was completed in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Competition {{to secure}} a call is very keen, since one <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> gain more than one <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> lose, but {{for that very reason}} the bidding is {{frequently}} pushed beyond the level of safety.|$|R

5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, NFF {{launched}} {{plans for}} a redevelopment of Ullevaal, including artificial turf, a retractable roof and redevelopment of the West <b>Stand</b> <b>to</b> increase total capacity to 30,500 spectators. The combination of the three would allow Ullevaal to become a multi-purpose venue and allow more matches to be played, grant the teams more practice time on their home pitch, make room for sponsor events, allow more concerts and potentially allow non-football sports, such as sprint skiing, to be held.|$|E
50|$|The current size of {{the stadium}} was reached in 1999, when {{the north and south}} stands were {{expanded}} or renovated, respectively. The <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> the north of the pitch offer a standing area for 6,000 spectators, and the <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> the east offer 7,000 seats. Both stands are covered. Space for handicapped spectators were built in front of the east <b>stands,</b> right next <b>to</b> the pitch.|$|R

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the stadium is the head office of many sports federations, a bandy field, and commercial property including a conference center, hotel and shopping mall. The stadium is located adjacent to Ullevål Stadion Station of the Oslo Metro and the Ring 3 motorway. Plans call to replace the West <b>Stand</b> <b>to</b> increase capacity to 30,000 and perhaps add a retractable roof and artificial turf.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 1913 Goodison Park {{became the}} first English {{football}} ground to be visited by a reigning monarch when King George V and Queen Mary attended. The attending royals had opened Gladstone Dock on the same day. A tablet was unveiled in the Main <b>Stand</b> <b>to</b> mark the occasion. During the First World War Goodison frequently hosted Territorial Army training drill sessions.|$|E
5|$|One year later, Hyun-jun {{returns to}} Korea to seek revenge. During this time, North and South Korea {{are set to}} reunify. However, the members of IRIS are intent on {{stopping}} the reunification. They attacked a local mall for hostages to blackmail {{both sides of the}} Korean government to threaten SK's president into announcing their political <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> not unite with NK. Hyun-jun became the negotiator for the president Cho Myung-ho (Lee Jung-gil) and for the hostages' release. Eventually, Sa-woo was killed. With all things hindering the reunification process gone, the peace talks resumed.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{for a new}} two-tier <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> {{the north}} and east were {{presented}} next. The plans had called for 24,500 sitting places in the new and south stands, and 5,500 standing places in the west stand. However, in 1989, the plans were modified, as the FIFA made new rules, requiring that only seating places could be used for international qualification matches from 1992. It was thereby decided that Ullevaal would become an all-seater.|$|E
5|$|The Exposition Universelle (1867) (Paris Exhibition) {{devoted a}} <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> the metric system and by 1875, {{two thirds of}} the European {{population}} and close to half the world's population had adopted the metric system.

5|$|The Hawthorns is {{certificated}} {{under the}} highest UEFA pitch surfaces {{which means it}} is ready to host almost any competition if required. Its West Stand could be developed over the Halford's Lane road {{at the back of}} the <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> allow an upper tier, approximately adding around 5,000 to the capacity of The Hawthorns. Other developments can include the filling in of The Millennium and East-Rainbow corners if and when required.|$|E

Silcott's barrister, Barbara Mills (1940–2011), a future Director of Public Prosecutions, decided that he should not take the <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> avoid exposing him to questions about his previous convictions.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{consists}} of four stands: the Main Stand, which also houses the club offices and players facilities; the Merkland Road Family Stand; the South Stand, which is opposite the main stand and holds the largest amount of spectators; and the Richard Donald <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> the east, which was completed in 1993, contains hospitality suites, and is named after former chairman Dick Donald. A quarter of the South Stand is used to accommodate travelling supporters. In 1978, Pittodrie became the first all covered, all-seater stadium in Britain.|$|E

Secretariat won by 31 lengths {{with a time of}} 2:24 for the mile and a half, both course records in their own right. Through his combined victories at the Belmont Stakes, Preakness Stakes, and Kentucky Derby, Secretariat became the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, and the first horse since Citation in 1948, ending a 25-year period without a Triple Crown winner. Secretariat's times in all three Triple Crown races were stakes records and still <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> this day.|$|E

All of the stands have two tiers except the Trinity Road Stand, which has three.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E
