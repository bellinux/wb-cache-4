50|$|The <b>scarce</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Euphydryas maturna) is {{a species}} of {{butterfly}} in the family Nymphalidae. It is found in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, and Sweden.|$|E
40|$|The <b>scarce</b> <b>fritillary</b> Euphydryas (Hypodryas) maturna (L.) is {{included}} in the Habitats Directive's Annexes II and IV(a). Therefore, it is crucially important to be able to define the habitat and breeding places of E. maturna in a correct and unbiased way. Data on a previously unknown pre-diapause main host plant, the small cow-wheat (Melampyrum sylvaticum L.), of Euphydryas maturna in Finland is presented...|$|E
40|$|The Euro-Siberian <b>Scarce</b> <b>Fritillary</b> Euphydryas maturna is {{considered}} a vulnerable species in the European Union and is listed in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive. The butterfly shows a complex pattern of larval plant use throughout its range. In central Europe females oviposit on some trees and bushes, especially Fraxinus spp., on which hatched larvae spend their pre-diapause phase of development feeding gregariously in conspicuous webs. However, some herbal plants are also reported {{in the north and}} east. During a study performed in the Natura 2000 area “Dolina Biebrzy” (Biebrza Valley) in NE Poland we recorded populations showing a unique mixture of ecological characteristics. Both Fraxinus excelsior and Veronica longifolia were used as larval food plants before hibernation, and some local populations seemed to be completely dependent on the latter plant. Moreover, in the spring, at one site, we observed larvae feeding on Salix rosmarinifolia - the first host record for this plant species. The importance of our findings for conservation, {{as well as for the}} monitoring of the butterfly, is discussed...|$|E
50|$|This site is {{designated}} {{due to its}} biological qualities, {{especially its}} wet heath and marshy grassland. It also has an important population of the nationally <b>scarce</b> marsh <b>fritillary</b> butterfly (Eurodryas aurinia).|$|R
50|$|The site {{contains}} many invertebrates including the uncommon scarlet tiger moth (Callimorpha dominula) and the nationally <b>scarce</b> pearl-bordered <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria euphrosyne). Pasture areas within the site supports the scarce hornet robberfly (Asilus crabroniformis).|$|R
50|$|Twenty {{species of}} {{butterfly}} {{have been recorded}} in the valley including the nationally <b>scarce</b> marsh <b>fritillary</b> (Eurodryas aurinia) and nationally vulnerable high brown fritillary (Argynnis adippe). Both roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) graze areas of wood pasture. The presence of otters (Lutra lutra) on the Barle has been regularly recorded. A colony of dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius) inhabits {{at least one of}} the hazel coppices.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The last {{surviving}} {{population of}} the <b>scarce</b> <b>fritillary</b> Euphydryas maturna (L., 1758) (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) in the Czech Republic was studied using mark-recapture methods in 2002 {{in order to assess}} adult population structure and mobility, and by annual censuses of larval nests since 2001. The population is restricted to clearings within an isolated lowland deciduous forest situated in a densely populated landscape. Modelling demography using constrained linear models revealed that adult survival was constant in time and lower in males than in females; catchability was equal in sexes and varied in time, while recruitment was constant in sexes and time. Total population size was extremely small, numbering less then 200 individuals. Mobility was well described by a negative exponential function. Less than 5 per cent of individuals are predicted to cross distances of 500 metres, and long distance movements were highly unlikely. We conclude that the butterfly persists as a dynamic metapopulation that tracks early successional woodland clearings. Under recent high-forest management, its long-term survival is highly unlikely and the only chance for preserving it in the long term is the re-establishment of traditional coppicing with standards, which should provide a more continuous supply of the butterfly’s biotope...|$|E
5|$|Several rare {{butterflies}} are {{indigenous to}} the area, including the nationally <b>scarce</b> pearl-bordered <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria euphrosyne), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), and white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album). The {{large blue butterfly}} (Maculinea arion) became extinct in the hills in the late 1970s, since when a research project has been undertaken into its ecology and reintroduction. The white-clawed crayfish is also nationally rare and is a declining species with small populations in {{a tributary of the}} Mells River and the River Chew.|$|R
50|$|Three {{areas of}} grassland, scrub and {{woodland}} situated around the village are {{designated as a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest. Together the three areas cover 12.4 hectares (30.7 acres) and were notified in 2002. The sites are home to the dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius), red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) and the nationally <b>scarce</b> small pearl-bordered <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria selene) and Kent black arches (Meganola albula). Other species include the adder (Vipera berus) and the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara), and nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos).|$|R
50|$|This site {{comprises}} {{a mosaic}} of broadleaved woodland, scrub, bracken, mires and unimproved grassland which provides the habitat for several species of butterfly which are now scarce in Britain. The site is also important for its lichens. The ground flora includes a number of species normally found only in ancient woodland such as woodruff (Galium odoratum) and wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa). Wood horsetail (Equisetum sylvaticum), which is rare in Somerset, is abundant and widespread on this site also being found {{in the areas of}} bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). The epiphytic lichen flora is also typical of ancient woodland and includes species such as Lobaria pulmonaria. The nationally scarce Opegrapha corticola and the nationally rare Chaenotheca stemonea also occur. The woodland rides and glades provide ideal habitat for the nationally scarce wood white (Leptidea sinapsis) butterfly, this site having by far the strongest colony known in Somerset. The grassland provides habitat for the nationally <b>scarce</b> marsh <b>fritillary</b> (Eurodryas aurinia) butterfly. The breeding birds include nightingale (Luscinia megarhyches), redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) and wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix). Adder (Vipera berus), grass snake (Natrix helvetica), slowworm (Anguis fragilis) and common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) have all been recorded from the site.|$|R
50|$|The Barle Valley {{contains}} extensive {{tracts of}} ancient upland sessile oak ancient woodland which exhibit variations in structure and species composition {{as a result}} of difference in past management, geology and topography. The diversity of the site is increased substantially by areas of valley mire, heathland and acid grassland. Eighty five woodland vascular plant species have been recorded including thirty one ancient woodland indicators from a single compartment. The meadows {{are one of the few}} sites for great burnet on Exmoor. Springs emerging from the base of sandstone slopes generate nutrient poor acid mires dominated by Sphagnum and Polytrichum moss carpets. The lichen flora is exceptional both for its luxuriance and in the number of rare species. One hundred and sixty five taxa of epiphytic lichens are present containing a remarkablylarge proportion of ancient woodland indicators giving the Barle a very high index of ecological continuity. The site contains an outstanding assemblage of woodland breeding birds including particularly high densities of wood warbler, redstart and pied flycatcher. The River Barle provides an important habitat for kingfisher, dipper and grey wagtail, while scrub and heath have breeding stonechat and whinchat. Twenty species of butterfly have been recorded in the valley including the nationally <b>scarce</b> marsh <b>fritillary</b> and nationally vulnerable high brown fritillary. Both roe deer and red deer graze areas of wood pasture. The presence of otters on the Barle has been regularly recorded. A colony of dormice inhabits at least one of the hazel coppices.|$|R
