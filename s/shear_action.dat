40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} an experimental study of a cold-formed steel hollow flange channel beam known as LiteSteel Beam (LSB) subject to combined bending and <b>shear</b> <b>actions.</b> The LSB sections are produced by a patented manufacturing process involving simultaneous cold-forming and electric resistance welding. Due to the geometry of the LSB, {{as well as its}} unique residual stress characteristics and initial geometric imperfections resultant of manufacturing processes, much of the existing research for common cold-formed steel sections is not directly applicable to LSB. Experimental and numerical studies have been carried out to evaluate the behaviour and design of LSBs subject to pure bending <b>actions</b> and predominant <b>shear</b> <b>actions.</b> To date, however, no investigation has been conducted into the strength of LSB sections under combined bending and <b>shear</b> <b>actions.</b> Combined bending and shear is especially prevalent at the supports of continuous span and cantilever beams, where the interaction of high shear force and bending moment can reduce the capacity of a section to well below that for the same section subject only to pure shear or moment. Hence experimental studies were conducted to assess the combined bending and shear behaviour and strengths of LSBs. Eighteen tests were conducted and the results were compared with current AS/NZS 4600 and AS 4100 design rules. AS/NZS 4600 design rules were shown to grossly underestimate the combined bending and shear capacities of LSBs and hence two lower bound design equations were proposed based on experimental results. Use of these equations will significantly improve the confidence and cost-effectiveness of designing LSBs for combined bending and <b>shear</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R

50|$|Assuming a flow is bounded on {{one side}} only, and that a {{rectilinear}} flow passing over a stationary flat plate which lies parallel to the flow, the flow just upstream of the plate has a uniform velocity. As the flow comes {{into contact with the}} plate, the layer of fluid actually 'adheres' to a solid surface. There is then a considerable <b>shearing</b> <b>action</b> between the layer of fluid on the plate surface and the second layer of fluid. The second layer is therefore forced to decelerate (though it is not quite brought to rest), creating a <b>shearing</b> <b>action</b> with the third layer of fluid, and so on. As the fluid passes further along the plate, the zone in which <b>shearing</b> <b>action</b> occurs tends to spread further outwards. This zone is known as the 'boundary layer'. The flow outside the boundary layer is free of shear and viscous-related forces so it is assumed to act like an ideal fluid. The intermolecular cohesive forces in a fluid are not great enough to hold fluid together. Hence a fluid will flow under the action of the slightest stress and flow will continue as long as the stress is present. The flow inside the layer can be either viscous or turbulent, depending on Reynolds number.|$|R

To avoid wax precipitation, {{it is necessary to}} assure that the flow temperature is above cloud point, as already discussed. If the oil production rate is sufficiently high to guarantee the minimum heat loss from the reservoir to the surface, the oil temperature will be above this onset point and it is expected that the paraffin deposits will not appear.

40|$|Abstract—Continuous high {{pressure}} water jets currently have many industrial applications, for example, mining coal, cutting materials, and cleaning fouling layers.

This approach follows the fact that it is more efficient to perform <b>shearing</b> <b>action</b> on the fouling layer in the cleaning process beyond an axial impacting action functioned by a traditional cylindrical contracting nozzle. The results reported in this paper show that the velocity magnitude of the jet issuing from the helix nozzle produces a relatively concentrated distribution, considering the guidance and disturbance by the spiral line, and the dynamic pressure shows similar characteristics.

40|$|Measurements of the {{unconfined}} {{yield strength}} (fc) of powders {{can be made}} with a variety of commercially available shear testing devices. For all of these devices, it has been observed that the reproducibility o f fc measurements is greatly reduced at low levels of major principal stress. Furthermore at low consolidation the conventional sample procedures may not be adequate since they may alter the powder consolidation condition with respect to the desired for practical application. The state of the art shear tester recently developed by Anton Paar Company is a unique instrument for the study of dry granular flows, especially in the fluidized or near fluidized state it is able to keep the powder in unconfined and not consolidated condition. Four different powders were used in this research, namely, Alumina, Glass Beads, Calcium Lactate and Sand. A specifically developed sequence of operations, including the introduction of air, allows the application of the desired stress history on the powder sample and to carry out experiments that may mimic the preshear and shear sequences operated in conventional testers. In particular, stirring the bed without air allows consolidating the material as in the preshear step, in which the <b>shearing</b> <b>action</b> is carried out till the attainment of a constant shear stress, which is assumed to correspond to the critical state. Stopping the <b>shearing</b> <b>actions</b> and using an upward gas flow means reducing the load on the shear plane by sustaining part of the bed weight by means of the gas flow. Therefore, starting a <b>shearing</b> <b>action</b> in this condition corresponds to the shear step in a rotationalshear tester.
