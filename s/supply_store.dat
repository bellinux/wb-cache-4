5|$|Berry was {{appointed}} Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, serving from 1997 to 2001.

5|$|On June 14, 1981, Har Mar Mall {{was damaged}} {{by a large}} tornado during the {{afternoon}} hours. While the mall wasn't heavily damaged and only affected the mall's cosmetic appearance, several nearby local businesses and residences were left in ruins following the impact. Shortly after the tornado, a large renovation occurred to update the mall's appearance and fix any damage left by it. In 1988, another expansion took place, allowing Har Mar to acquire several larger retailers in the newly constructed space; the opening of Highland Superstore and TJ Maxx appeared later this year, along {{with the addition of}} a new food court with seating for over 400 people. Three years later, the Highland Superstore was converted to BizMart, a regional office <b>supply</b> <b>store.</b> BizMart was later acquired by OfficeMax in 1992 before ultimately closing in 1995; HomePlace opened in the space vacated by OfficeMax, and is currently leased by HomeGoods, the successor of HomePlace. In the 2000s, Har Mar underwent a cosmetic makeover that cost previous owner Emmes Realty Services nearly $12 million; Emmes sparked interest in opening a Von Maur at the center, but the proposal eventually dissolved.|$|E

25|$|The {{historic}} 19th Century {{building that}} originally housed Gallery 30 {{is located at}} 30 York Street, also known as US Route 30 and the historic Lincoln Highway, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The brick building bears an official plaque that verifies it as a Civil War building that was standing during the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. In fact, the building was erected in the early 1800s by Gettysburg merchant John Hoke, the proprietor of a store offering dry goods and groceries. In 1858, J.C. Guinn took over Hoke’s Store and continued to operate it “on an enlarged scale.” In 1866, the store changed hands again when it was purchased by J.A. Grimes who called his business a “family grocery and variety store.” Nicholas Codori acquired the building in 1867 and started a butcher shop with his son Simon J. Codori. In 1906, the Codori family abandoned the butchering business in order to open a garage in another York Street building and form the Citizens Oil Company. By the early 1920s, Gettysburg merchant Harry Viener had acquired 30 York Street and was operating a store specializing in ready-made clothing. In 1953, Harry Viener’s Store was sold to brothers Martin and Charles Redding and was reopened as Redding’s <b>Supply</b> <b>Store.</b> Redding’s <b>Supply</b> <b>Store</b> remained in operation until 1979.|$|E
