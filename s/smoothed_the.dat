Writing to his superiors, Lahm <b>smoothed</b> <b>the</b> way for Wilbur to give an in-person presentation to the U.S. Board of Ordnance and Fortification in Washington, D.C. {{when he returned to}} the U.S. This time, the Board was favorably impressed, in contrast to its previous indifference. With further input from the Wrights, the U.S. Army Signal Corps issued Specification #486 in December 1907, inviting bids for construction of a flying machine under military contract. The Wrights submitted their bid in January.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} sawmilling. In 1856, the mills produced 12 million board feet (28,000 m³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 board feet (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 board feet (2,270,000 m³) in 1899. During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and <b>smoothed</b> <b>the</b> lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles and wooden buckets.|$|E

Aiming to create a trap for Norreys' army, the Spanish had <b>smoothed</b> <b>the</b> ground on their right in order to funnel English units and draw Norrey's troops into an engagement area where a crossfire effect could be created. Verdugo himself drove two stakes into the ground to mark the point that his cavalry was to charge upon the English vanguard.|$|E

30|$|A {{new method}} to <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> target hybrid state with Gaussian mixture {{measurement}} likelihood-integrated track splitting (GMM-ITS) {{in the presence}} of clutter for a high pulse repetition frequency (HPRF) radar is proposed. This method <b>smooths</b> <b>the</b> target state at fixed lag N and considers all feasible multi-scan target existence sequences in the temporal window of scans in order to <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> target hybrid state. <b>The</b> <b>smoothing</b> window can be of any length N. The proposed method to <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> target hybrid state at fixed lag is also applied to the enhanced multiple model (EMM) tracking algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the performance of fixed lag smoothing GMM-ITS significantly improves false track discrimination and root mean square errors (RMSEs).|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} of coal {{by the community}} in the early 19th century {{paved the way for}} the Youngstown area's inclusion on the network of the famed Erie Canal. The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company was organized in 1835, and the canal was completed in 1840. Local industrialist David Tod, who was later Ohio governor during the Civil War, persuaded Lake Erie steamboat owners that coal mined in the Mahoning Valley could fuel their vessels if canal transportation were available between Youngstown and Cleveland. The arrival of the railroad in 1856 <b>smoothed</b> <b>the</b> path for further economic growth.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions in}} exploration {{of problems in}} numerical hydrodynamics. For example, with Robert D. Richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves. When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of artificial viscosity <b>smoothed</b> <b>the</b> shock transition without sacrificing basic physics. Other contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution to blast waves, and the co-discovery of the ZND detonation model of explosives. During the 1930s, Von Neumann became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, modems made e-mail a viable {{alternative}} to Telex systems in a business environment. But individual e-mail accounts were not widely available until local Internet service providers were in place, although demand grew rapidly, as e-mail was seen as the Internet's killer app. It allowed anyone to email anyone, whereas previously, different system had been walled off from each other, such that America Online subscribers could email only other America Online subscribers, Compuserve subscribers could email only other Compuserve subscribers, etc. The broad user base created by the demand for e-mail <b>smoothed</b> <b>the</b> way for the rapid acceptance of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s.

25|$|Having {{the beam}} {{connected}} to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant {{that it was possible}} to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel. The most simple solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and <b>smoothed</b> <b>the</b> action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E

25|$|Saladin's son al-Zahir al-Ghazi ruled Aleppo between 1193 and 1215. During {{this time}} the citadel went through major reconstruction, {{fortification}} and addition of new structures that create the complex of the Citadel {{in its current form}} today. Sultan Ghazi strengthened the walls, <b>smoothed</b> <b>the</b> surface of the outcrop and covered sections of the slope at the entrance area with stone cladding. The depth of the moat was increased, connected with water canals and spanned by a tall bridge-cum-viaduct, which today still serves as the entrance into the Citadel. During {{the first decade of the}} thirteenth century the citadel evolved into a palatial city that included functions ranging from residential (palaces and baths), religious (mosque and shrines), military installations (arsenal, training ground, defence towers and the entrance block) and supporting elements (water cisterns and granaries). The most prominent renovation is the entrance block rebuilt in 1213. Sultan Ghazi also had the two mosques on the Citadel restored, and expanded the city walls to include the southern and eastern suburbs, making the citadel the centre of the fortifications, rather than alongside the wall.|$|E
25|$|There is no very {{definite}} {{statement as}} to the material which was in most common use {{for the purposes of}} writing {{at the start of the}} early writing systems. In all ages it has been customary to engrave on stone or metal, or other durable material, with the view of securing the permanency of the record; and accordingly, in the very commencement of the national history of Israel, it is read of the two tables of the law written in stone, and of a subsequent writing of the law on stone. In the latter case there is this peculiarity, that plaster (sic, lime or gypsum) was used along with stone, a combination of materials which is illustrated by comparison of the practice of the Egyptian engravers, who, having first carefully <b>smoothed</b> <b>the</b> stone, filled up the faulty places with gypsum or cement, in order to obtain a perfectly uniform surface on which to execute their engravings. Metals, such as stamped coins, are mentioned as a material of writing; they include lead, brass, and gold. To the engraving of gems there is reference also, such as with seals or signets.|$|E
25|$|Like other maniraptorans, Anchiornis had a propatagium, a flap of skin {{connecting}} the wrist {{to the shoulder}} and rounding out {{the front edge of}} the wing. In Anchiornis, this part of the wing was covered in covert feathers which <b>smoothed</b> <b>the</b> wing and covered the gaps between the larger primary and secondary feathers. However, unlike modern birds, the covert feathers of Anchiornis were not arranged in tracts or rows. The arrangement of the covert feathers was also more primitive in Anchiornis than in birds and more advanced paravians. In modern birds, the coverts usually cover only the upper portion of the wing, with most of the wing surface made up of uncovered flight feathers. In some Anchiornis fossils, on the other hand, several layers of covert feathers seem to extend down to cover most of the wing's surface, so that the wing is essentially made of multiple layers of feathers, rather than a layer of broad feathers with only their bases hidden by layers of coverts. This multi-layered wing arrangement might have helped strengthen the wing, considering that the primary and secondary feathers themselves were narrow and weak.|$|E
