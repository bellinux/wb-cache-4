5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> into four groups. The <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E
5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this <b>side</b> <b>chain)</b> and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E
5000|$|Normally, joint cartilages have {{proteoglycan}} complexes, {{which are}} proteins with <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> made of glycosaminoglycans such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate attached to strands of hyaluronic acid. The glycosaminoglycan <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> are polyanionic, which causes adjacent <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> to push each other away {{and create a}} [...] "bottle brush", where hyaluronic acid is the stem and the <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> are the bristles. When pressure is exerted on the joint, fluids move between the chondrocytes and synovial fluid, exchanging nutrients.|$|R
50|$|Figure 1. This figure {{depicts the}} {{homodimer}} that is TS. As {{you can see}} the orange and teal backbones never connect or intertwine, but there are <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> interactions between the dimers. On the orange protein, you can visibly detect two long <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> that enter the teal protein (this is located within the yellow circle). The other beige parts are <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> that interact within the active site. Just below the yellow circle, you are able to see the same pattern of <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> and configuration.|$|R
40|$|A {{new series}} of donor {{acceptor}} co-polymers based on benzodithiophene and quinoxaline with various <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> {{have been developed for}} polymer solar cells. The effect of the degree of branching and dimensionality of the <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> were systematically investigated on the thermal stability, optical absorption, energy levels, molecular packing, and photovoltaic performance of the resulting co-polymers. The results indicated that the linear and 2 D conjugated <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> improved the thermal stabilities and optical absorptions. The introduction of alkylthienyl <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> could efficiently lower the energy levels compared with the alkoxylsubstituted analogues, and the branched alkoxyl <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> could deepen the HOMO levels relative to the linear alkoxyl chains. The branched alkoxyl groups induced better lamellar-like ordering, but poorer face-to-face packing behavior. The 2 D conjugated <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> had a negative influence on the crystalline properties of the co-polymers. The performance of the devices indicated that the branched alkoxyl <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> improved the Vo but decreased the J. and fill factor (FE). However, the 2 D conjugated <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> would increase the Vo J, and FE simultaneously. For the first time, our work provides insight into molecular design strategies through side-chain engineering to achieve efficient polymer solar cells by considering both the degree of branching and dimensionality...|$|R
5|$|In {{alternative}} fashion, the (S) and (R) designators {{are used}} to indicate the absolute stereochemistry. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, with cysteine being (R) and glycine non-chiral. Cysteine has its <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> in the same geometric position as the other amino acids, but the R/S terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of sulfur compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> a higher priority, whereas the atoms in most other side chains give them lower priority.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids are organic {{compounds}} containing amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, {{along with a}} <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements {{are found in the}} side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acid residues form the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles and other tissues. Beyond their role as residues in proteins, amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E
50|$|Oxidative {{stress can}} be caused by {{radicals}} such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). These unstable radicals can attack the amino acid residues, leading to oxidation of <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> (e.g. aromatic <b>side</b> <b>chains,</b> methionine <b>side</b> <b>chains)</b> and/or cleavage of the polypeptide bonds. This can affect the non-covalent interactions that hold the protein together correctly, which can cause protein destabilization, and may cause the protein to unfold.|$|R
5000|$|Different polymer {{surfaces}} {{have different}} <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> on their monomers that can become charged {{due to the}} adsorption or dissociation of adsorbates. For example, polystyrene sulfonate has monomers containing negatively charged <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> which can adsorb positively charged adsorbates. Polystyrene sulfonate will adsorb more positively charged adsorbate than negatively charged. Conversely, for a polymer that contains positively charged <b>side</b> <b>chains,</b> such as poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), negatively charged adsorbates will be strongly attracted.|$|R
40|$|The {{solution}} {{behavior of}} a series of poly(2 -oxazoline) s with different <b>side</b> <b>chains,</b> namely methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, phenyl and benzyl, are reported in ethanol-water solvent mixtures based on turbidimetry investigations. The LCST transitions of poly(2 -oxazoline) s with propyl <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> and the UCST transitions of the poly(2 -oxazoline) s with more hydrophobic <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> are discussed in relation to the ethanol-water solvent composition and structure. The poly(2 -alkyl- 2 -oxazoline) s with <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> longer than propyl only dissolved during the first heating run, which is discussed and correlated to the melting transition of the polymers...|$|R
5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|The lipid {{component}} of MFGM {{is rich in}} phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. Phospholipids make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total phospholipids. Phospholipids and sphingolipids play central roles in cerebral neurogenesis and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis {{during the first year}} of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are sphingolipids containing sialic acid and an oligosaccharide <b>side</b> <b>chain.</b> Each of these lipid classes is known to play functional roles within the body, including the support of gut, immune, and central nervous system development.|$|E
5|$|This unusual triad occurs only in one {{superfamily}} of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise {{the middle}} serine. The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one with the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> hydroxyl {{and the other}} with the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual cis orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and cis-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiple}} <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> of {{amino acids}} can also undergo chemical reactions. The types of these reactions {{are determined by}} the groups on these <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> and are, therefore, different between the various types of amino acid.|$|R
40|$|Potentials of mean force (PMF) between ionizable {{amino acid}} <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> (Arg, Lys, His, Glu) in the headgroup {{area of a}} palmitoyl oleoyl {{phosphatidylcholine}} lipid bilayer were obtained from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and the adaptive biasing force method. Simulations in bulk water were also performed for comparison. <b>Side</b> <b>chains</b> were constrained in collinear, stacking and orthogonal (T-shaped) orientations. The most structured and attractive PMFs were observed for hydrogen-bonded <b>side</b> <b>chains.</b> Contact minima occurred {{at a distance of}} 2. 6 – 3. 1 Å between selected atoms or centers of mass with the most attractive interaction (− 9. 6 kcal/mol) observed between Arg+ and Glu−. Hydrogen bonds {{play a significant role in}} stabilizing these interactions. Interactions between like-charged <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> can also be very attractive, if the charges are screened by surrounding molecules or groups (e. g. the PMF value at the contact minimum for Arg+…Arg+ is − 7. 6 kcal/mol). Like-charged <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> can have contact minima as close as 3. 6 Å. The PMFs depend strongly on the relative orientation of the <b>side</b> <b>chains.</b> In agreement with experimental studies and other simulations, we found the stacking arrangement of like-charged <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> to be the most favorable orientation. Interaction energies and Lennard-Jones energies between <b>side</b> <b>chains,</b> headgroups and water molecules were analyzed in order to rationalize the observed PMFs and their dependence on orientation. In general, the results cannot be explained by simple dielectric arguments.

25|$|Early {{evidence}} that cation–π interactions {{played a role}} in protein structure was the observation that in crystallographic data, aromatic <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> appear in close contact with nitrogen-containing <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> (which can exist as protonated, cationic species) with disproportionate frequency.|$|R
5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system, protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles with acidic and protease-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles. However, work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP-dependent protein degradation in reticulocytes, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism. This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time. Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the histone protein by a bond between a lysine <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> of the histone and the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin, a protein that had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation, known as ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as ubiquitin. The proteolytic activities of this system was isolated as a multi-protein complex originally called the multi-catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski. Later, the ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that was responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E
5|$|The {{layers of}} the adrenal gland differ by function, with each layer having {{distinct}} enzymes that produce different hormones from a common precursor. The first enzymatic step {{in the production of}} all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol <b>side</b> <b>chain,</b> a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase. After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it. Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones. Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. For example, {{the most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{comparison of}} random copolymers, derived from poly(dihexylsilylene) (PDHS) by incorporation of monomeric units with shorter unbranched alkyl <b>side</b> <b>chains,</b> {{has been carried}} out based on calorimetry, variable temperature UV spectroscopy, and 29 Si MAS (magic angle spinning) solid state NMR investigations. Also, hexylmethylsilylene units and branched monomers have been copolymerized. Up to 10 % comonomer with shorter linear <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> (i. e., pentyl to propyl) could be incorporated into PDHS without impeding the all-trans order of the crystalline phase. In this case, the UV absorption maximum of the crystalline low-temperature phase was affected only slightly according to the length and fraction of the comonomer <b>side</b> <b>chains.</b> A less ordered crystal structure (λmax = 345 - 355 nm) was observed when the content of comonomers with shorter <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> was about 20 %.

It is worth noting that polymer solar cells (PSCs) fabricated from EWC 3, with branched <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> on the carbazole units, gave a much higher V-oc than the devices made from EWC 1, which bears the same electron-deficient segment as EWC 3 but straight <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> on carbazole units.

40|$|The {{influence}} of side-chain attraction on the conformational properties of two-dimensional polymer brushes with rigid <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations.
