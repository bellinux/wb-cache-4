25|$|A common {{feature of}} Unix-like systems, Linux {{includes}} traditional specific-purpose programming languages targeted at scripting, text processing and <b>system</b> <b>configuration</b> and management in general. Linux distributions support shell scripts, awk, sed and make. Many programs {{also have an}} embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves. For example, regular expressions are supported in programs like grep and locate, the traditional Unix MTA Sendmail contains its own Turing complete scripting system, and the advanced text editor GNU Emacs is built around a general purpose Lisp interpreter.|$|E
40|$|Software {{evolution}} {{is critical to}} extending the utility and life of distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems. Determining the optimal set of software and hardware components to evolve that (1) incorporate cutting-edge technology and (2) satisfy DRE system resource constraints, such as memory, power, and CPU usage is an NP-Hard problem. This article provides four contributions to evolving legacy DRE <b>system</b> <b>configurations.</b> First, we present the Software Evolution Analysis with Resources (SEAR) technique for converting legacy DRE <b>system</b> <b>configurations,</b> external resource availabilities, and candidate replacement components into multiple-choice multi-dimension knapsack problems (MMKP). Second, we present a formal methodology for assessing the validity of evolved <b>system</b> <b>configurations.</b> Third, we apply heuristic approximation algorithms to determine low-cost, high value evolution paths in polynomial time. Finally, we analyze results of experiments that apply these techniques to determine which technique is most effective for given system parameters. Our results show that constraint solvers can only evolve small <b>system</b> <b>configurations,</b> whereas approximation techniques are needed to evolve larger <b>system</b> <b>configurations...</b>|$|R

25|$|Some systems {{integrate}} a wet MRF {{to separate}} by density and flotation and to recover & wash the recyclable {{elements of the}} waste {{in a form that}} can be sent for recycling. MBT can alternatively process the waste to produce a high calorific fuel termed refuse derived fuel (RDF). RDF can be used in cement kilns or thermal combustion power plants and is generally made up from plastics and biodegradable organic waste. Systems which are configured to produce RDF include the Herhof and Ecodeco Processes. It is a common misconception that all MBT processes produce RDF. This is not the case and depends strictly on <b>system</b> <b>configuration</b> and suitable local markets for MBT outputs.|$|E
