In speech, the trend is not only in repeating the same phrase but also {{talking about the same}} subject continually. Cluttered speech and <b>self-talk</b> are commonly seen. <b>Self-talk</b> includes talking with oneself using different tones and pitches.|$|E

2500|$|Panic {{disorder}} {{is a serious}} health problem {{that in many cases}} can be successfully treated, although there is no known cure. Identification of treatments that engender as full a response as possible, and can minimize relapse, is imperative. Cognitive behavioural therapy and positive <b>self-talk</b> specific for panic are the treatment of choice for panic disorder. Several studies show that 85 to 90 percent of panic disorder patients treated with CBT recover completely from their panic attacks within 12 weeks. [...] When cognitive behavioral therapy is not an option, pharmacotherapy can be used. SSRIs are considered a first-line pharmacotherapeutic option.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{different}} protocols for delivering cognitive behavioral therapy, with important similarities among them. Use {{of the term}} CBT may refer to different interventions, including [...] "self-instructions (e.g. distraction, imagery, motivational <b>self-talk),</b> relaxation and/or biofeedback, development of adaptive coping strategies (e.g. minimizing negative or self-defeating thoughts), changing maladaptive beliefs about pain, and goal setting". Treatment is sometimes manualized, with brief, direct, and time-limited treatments for individual psychological disorders that are specific technique-driven. CBT is used in both individual and group settings, and the techniques are often adapted for self-help applications. Some clinicians and researchers are cognitively oriented (e.g. cognitive restructuring), while others are more behaviorally oriented (e.g. in vivo exposure therapy). Interventions such as imaginal exposure therapy combine both approaches.|$|E
60|$|But not {{the less}} {{is the general}} feeling very strong against the hunting parson; and not the less will it remain so in spite of {{anything}} that I may say. Under these circumstances our friend the hunting parson usually rides {{as though he were}} more or less under a cloud. The cloud is not to be seen in a melancholy brow or a shamed demeanour; for the hunting parson will have lived down those feelings, and is generally too forcible a man to allow himself to be subjected to such annoyances; nor is the cloud to be found in any gentle tardiness of his motions, or an attempt at suppressed riding; for the hunting parson generally rides hard. Unless he loved hunting much he would not be there. But the cloud is to be perceived and heard {{in the manner in which}} he speaks of himself and his own doings. He is never natural in his <b>self-talk</b> as is any other man. He either flies at his own cloth at once, marring some false apology for his presence, telling you that he is there just to see the hounds, and hinting to you his own knowledge that he has no business to ride after them; or else he drops his profession altogether, and speaks to you in a tone which makes you feel that you would not dare to speak to him about his parish. You can talk to the banker about his banking, the brewer about his brewing, the farmer about his barley, or the landlord about his land; but to a hunting parson of this latter class, you may not say a word about his church.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{there is}} also a {{positive}} side to positive <b>self-talk</b> and in this study they found that, [...] "people with higher levels of self-reinforcing <b>self-talk</b> reported more positive self-esteem and more frequent automatic positive self-statements". They also found that men had a more frequent self-reinforcing <b>self-talk</b> than females. This particular finding is important because there are not many general findings comparing men and women in adult <b>self-talk</b> in today’s research. <b>Self-talk</b> and imaginary companionship contain many similarities therefore it is possible that they can be related. Through positive <b>self-talk</b> children can increase their self-esteem, which leads to the possibility that a positive relationship with an imaginary companion could predict a similar outcome.|$|E
50|$|Research {{supporting}} the model shows that persuasion is powerfully {{affected by the}} amount of <b>self-talk</b> that occurs in response to a message. The degree to which the <b>self-talk</b> supports the message and the confidence that recipients express in the validity of that <b>self-talk</b> further support the cognitive response model.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, other {{research}} {{has concluded that}} women seek more social support than men, which could be another possibility for creating these imaginary companions. The second study found that children without siblings reported more <b>self-talk</b> than children with siblings and the third {{study found that the}} students who reported having an imaginary friend also reported more self talk than the other students who did not have imaginary friends. <b>Self-talk</b> is often associated with negative effects such as increased anxiety and depression when the <b>self-talk</b> is specifically negative. The researchers found that [...] "Individuals with higher levels of social-assessment and critical <b>self-talk</b> reported lower self-esteem and more frequent automatic negative self-statements".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Self-talk</b> {{refers to}} the {{thoughts}} and words athletes and performers say to themselves, usually in their minds. <b>Self-talk</b> phrases (or cues) are used to direct attention towards a particular thing {{in order to improve}} focus or are used alongside other techniques to facilitate their effectiveness. [...] For example, a softball player may think [...] "release point" [...] when at bat to direct her attention {{to the point where the}} pitcher releases the ball, while a golfer may say [...] "smooth stroke" [...] before putting to stay relaxed. Research suggests either positive or negative <b>self-talk</b> may improve performance, suggesting the effectiveness of <b>self-talk</b> phrases depends on how the phrase is interpreted by the individual. However, the use of positive <b>self-talk</b> is considered to be more efficacious and is consistent with the associative network theory of Gordon Bower and the self-efficacy tenet within the broader Social Cognitive Theory of Albert Bandura. The use of words in sport has been widely utilized. The ability to bombard the unconscious mind with one single positive phrase, is one of the most effective and easy to use psychological skills available to any athlete.|$|E

50|$|Both <b>self-talk,</b> the {{propensity}} {{to engage in}} verbal or mental self-directed conversation and thought, and social support {{can be used as}} instruments of self-improvement, often by empowering, action-promoting messages. Psychologists have designed series of experiments that are intended to shed light into how <b>self-talk</b> can result in self-improvement. In general, research has shown that people prefer to use second person pronouns over first person pronouns when engaging in <b>self-talk</b> to achieve goals, regulate one’s own behavior, thoughts, or emotions, and facilitate performance. If <b>self-talk</b> has the expected effect, then writing about personal problems using language from their friends’ perspective should result in greater amount of motivational and emotional benefits comparing to using language from their own perspective. When you need to finish a difficult task and you are not willing to do something to finish this task, trying to write a few sentence or goals imaging what your friends have told you gives you more motivational resources comparing to you write to yourself. Research done by Ireland and others have revealed that, as expected, when people are writing using many physical and mental words or even typing a standard prompt with these kinds of words, adopting a friend’s perspective while freely writing about a personal challenge can help increase people’s intention to improve self-control by promoting the positivity of emotions such as pride and satisfaction, which can motivate people to reach their goal.|$|E

50|$|Their {{first study}} {{indicated}} that only children who create imaginary companions actually engage in high levels of positive <b>self-talk</b> had more positive social development. They also found a gender difference within their study that {{women were more likely}} than men to have an imaginary companion. Their findings were consistent with other research supporting that it is more common for females to have imaginary companions. One possible explanation the researchers suggested that women may be more likely to have imaginary companions is because they are more likely to rely on feedback from other than themselves supporting the conclusions that men were found to have more self reinforcing <b>self-talk.</b>|$|E

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{research}} to date has demonstrated that optimists are less likely to have certain diseases or develop certain diseases over time. By comparison, research has not yet been able to demonstrate the ability to change an individual's level of optimism through psychological interventions, and thereby alter the course of disease or likelihood for development of disease. Though in that same vein, an article by Mayo Clinic argues steps to change <b>self-talk</b> from negative to positive may shift individuals from a negative to a more positive/optimistic outlook. Strategies claimed to be of value include surrounding oneself with positive people, identifying areas of change, practicing positive <b>self-talk,</b> being open to humor, and following a healthy lifestyle.|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>self-talk</b> {{goes beyond}} the scope of self-improvement for {{performing}} certain activities, <b>self-talk</b> as a linguistic form of self-help also plays a very important role in regulating people’s emotions under social stress. First of all, people using non-first-person language tend to exhibit higher level of visual self-distancing during the process of introspection, indicating that using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name may result in enhanced self-distancing. More importantly, this specific form of self-help also has been found can enhance people’s ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior under social stress, which would lead them to appraise social-anxiety-provoking events in more challenging and less threatening terms. Additionally, these self-help behaviors also demonstrate noticeable self-regulatory effects through the process of social interactions, regardless of their dispositional vulnerability to social anxiety.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, {{communication}} is social interaction {{where at least}} two interacting agents share {{a common set of}} signs and a common set of semiotic rules.

50|$|Although dialogical {{analysis}} {{tends to}} focus on discourse, it is distinct from discourse analysis and conversation analysis because its focus goes beyond {{the question of how}} people speak and what they achieve by speaking.

5000|$|Intrapersonal {{communication}} can be facilitated {{through both}} first person and second person pronouns. However, {{through years of}} research, scholars have already realized that people tend to use first-person and second-person <b>self-talk</b> in different situations.

In punctuation, an exclamative is ended with an exclamation mark.|$|E
