5|$|Hattie McDaniel {{became the}} first African-American to win an Academy Award—beating out her co-star Olivia de Havilland who was also {{nominated}} in the same category—but was racially segregated from her co-stars at the awards ceremony at the Coconut Grove; she and her escort were made to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> separate table {{at the back of}} the room. Meanwhile, screenwriter Sidney Howard {{became the first}} posthumous Oscar winner and Selznick personally received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his career achievements.|$|E
25|$|In the morning, Dan waits, {{with flowers}} ready for Imogen {{in his hotel}} bar. But before she arrives, Nicola finds him, having {{correctly}} guessed where to find him. They <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> table, and although a reconciliation of sorts is achieved, it becomes clear {{there is no chance}} of a future together. Unfortunately, at this moment, Imogen enters and sees Dan sitting at a table, flowers resting there, talking to another woman. Imogen leaves distraught. Ambrose tells Dan she just left, but it is too late for Dan to catch up with her, and Dan knows no way of contacting her.|$|E
25|$|A {{new star}} will <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{specific}} {{point on the}} main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, with the main-sequence spectral type depending upon {{the mass of the}} star. Small, relatively cold, low-mass red dwarfs fuse hydrogen slowly and will remain on the main sequence for hundreds of billions of years or longer, whereas massive, hot O-type stars will leave the main sequence after just a few million years. A mid-sized yellow dwarf star, like the Sun, will remain on the main sequence for about 10 billion years. The Sun is thought {{to be in the middle}} of its main sequence lifespan.|$|E

25|$|In series 10, {{the format}} to Bootcamp was changed: the judges find out their {{categories}} before Bootcamp starts, and each judge will {{make decisions on}} who is performing in the Six-Chair Challenge by eliminating the contestants, this is up to each individual judge. From Series 11 onwards, the judges do not know their categories before the Bootcamp, {{so they have to}} make the decisions together. After the Bootcamp round, the mentor challenges their contestants through the Six-Chair Challenge. Judges make decisions on who to put through to judges' houses straight after each act has performed, with those getting a yes taking a chair in the final six chairs on stage. It is up to the mentor to decide, which act they want to take to judges' houses, but once all six spots are full, if the mentor wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they have to replace one of those who were previously given a yes. This format was very poorly rated by many members of the British public. Bootcamp still took place, but only highlights were shown in the first episode of the Six-chair challenge. In series 12, all of Bootcamp aired on-screen. A more brutal twist to the Six-Chair Challenge was introduced in series 14, where the mentor is to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> smaller table {{at the side of the}} arena while making the decisions, while the other judges remain at a larger table on the other side.|$|E
25|$|Great grey shrikes breed {{during the}} summer, {{typically}} once per year. In exceptionally good conditions, they raise two broods a year, {{and if the}} first clutch is destroyed before hatching they are usually able to produce a second one. Their monogamous pair bond is strong during the breeding season and loosens over winter; birds often choose a different mate than the year before. To seek out potential mates, males will venture outside their breeding territories. If a female thus encountered finds a male to her liking, she will visit {{to see whether they}} get along well and inspect the nesting sites he can offer. The courtship period is generally longer than in the southern grey shrike (L. meridionalis), usually starting about March and lasting to April/May. At first, the female rebuffs the male, only allowing him to feed her. Males give increasingly vocal displays and show off the white markings of the wings in flight and of the tail by fanning it and turning away from the female. He also occasionally turns to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> right angle to her. Eventually, the female will join in the male's displays, and the songs will become duets. To feed females and to show off their hunting prowess, males will make their food caches in conspicuous places during this time. When presenting nesting sites, males give the variety of calls described above and jerk their head and fanned tail.|$|E
25|$|On March 8, 1847, Narioki {{arrived in}} Satsuma, making Nariakira’s position, {{something}} equivalent to deputy to his father, obsolete. After essentially having {{the reins of}} power wrenched from his hands by his own father, Nariakira left Satsuma for Edo. The authority formerly vested him was clearly and quickly being shifted to his half brother, Hisamitsu Hisamitsu was rapidly elevated {{through the ranks of}} his father’s court soon after Nariakira’s departure from Satsuma for Edo. He was placed in charge of the newly created office of military service of Satsuma in October 1847. In 1848, Narioki appointed Hisamitsu steward of Chosa District, with the responsibility of acting on behalf of the daimyō in all military matters in the area. At about the same time, Hisamitsu was given the highly respected post of han councilor, a rank which, according to the instructions accompanying the appointment, placed him {{at the top of the}} social scale. At ceremonial occasions, Hisamitsu was ordered by his father to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> place higher than that of the deputy in charge of the daimyō of Satsuma’s castle. Narioki even went so far as to place Hisamitsu in charge of all of Satsuma whenever the daimyō chose to leave Satsuma for any reason, business or pleasure. It was apparent that Hisamitsu was being groomed to become the next daimyō, completely disregarding the fact that, by primogeniture, Nariakira was supposed to be the heir-apparent.|$|E

500|$|This {{episode was}} written by series creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, in their second episode for this season, and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, also his second episode this season, {{during the course of}} the second production season. This episode was based on a remark David once made during a conversation. Cherones deliberately made Elaine <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> smaller table while directing the dinner scene. [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was the first episode in which Kramer wants to gamble, it is later established that he has a gambling addiction. The idea of Elaine asking Isaac what is going to happen with his old apartment was added during rehearsals. The first table reading of the episode was held on October 24, 1990, and a run through was held two days later. [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was filmed in front of a live audience on October 30, 1990, while Seinfeld's stand-up routine was filmed one day earlier, along with the performances used in [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] and [...] "The Busboy"; Seinfeld would change wardrobe between takes.|$|E

2500|$|During the Secret Empire storyline, the Ultron/Hank Pym {{had set up}} a base in a {{unidentified}} forest. Upon being alerted by {{the approach}} of Sam Wilson's task force by a robot version of Edwin Jarvis, the Ultron/Hank Pym decides to give his [...] "family" [...] a warm welcome. When Tony Stark A.I.'s team and Captain America's team confront each other, they are captured by the Ultron/Hank Pym who forces both teams to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> dinner table. The Ultron/Hank Pym argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man despite past experience confirming that this should be a bad idea, but the Tony Stark A.I. counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Hank Pym's attack on Wasp. Outraged, the Ultron/Hank Pym nearly attacks the other heroes, but Scott Lang is able to talk him down by arguing that Hank Pym remains his own inspiration. The Ultron/Hank Pym allows the Tony Stark A.I.'s team to leave with the fragment, arguing that he will leave Captain America's plans with Hydra alone as it appears to be the best chance for world peace.|$|E
2500|$|Melchior Wańkowicz, {{a popular}} Polish journalist, met Beck {{in the autumn}} of 1939 during his {{internment}} in Romania. This is how he described the meeting: [...] "Beck was locked in a golden cage of a luxurious hotel in Brașov, where he and his entourage occupied one floor. He was closely guarded: whenever he went out, hordes of Allied, German and Romanian agents followed him (...) I met him at 5 in the afternoon, and our conversation continued until almost two in the morning, with a dinner break. Beck emphasized achievements of the last month of his post: a military treaty with England, Hungarian refusal to let German troops pass through their territory, droit de residence and droit de passage, granted by Romanian government. Beck believes in a solid coalition, and that we would <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> negotiating table as partners, while Czechs would remain outside. He does not care about the fact that Lloyd George stated that Poland did not deserve help as a reactionary country. He is not bothered by the fact that Lord Halifax wants to recreate the Curzon Line. Instead, he points out that when British king gave a speech on the radio, only English, French and Polish anthems were played (...) Since I cannot tolerate this kind of wishful thinking, I ask him whether he had ever seriously considered German attack. He keeps saying that he had met Hitler several times, that Hitler backs out of discussions, that he can easily be talked into different things, that he was influenced by von Ribbentrop." ...|$|E
