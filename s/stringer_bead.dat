40|$|Purpose: of this paper: Study of {{abrasive}} wear resistance of robotized GMA surfaced cermetal deposits. The one-, two- and three layers <b>stringer</b> <b>bead</b> and weave bead deposits were surfaced by a metal-cored wire. Design/methodology/approach: The study {{were based on}} the analysis of deposits dilution, structure, measurements of hardness and microhardness, determination of WC carbide morphology and {{abrasive wear}} resistance type metal-ceramic according to ASTM G 65. Findings: It was found that robotized GMA surfacing process with EnDOtec DO* 11 wire of diameter 1, 6 [mm], with oscillation of the welding torch, can be applied for producing high quality of deposits {{in a wide range of}} surfacing parameters especially heat input. The abrasive wear resistance of <b>stringer</b> <b>bead</b> deposits is significantly higher compared with weave bead deposits. The weave bead deposits are free of transverse cracks, contrary to stringer beads. This phenomenon can be explained by different thermal stresses in the deposits. Research limitations/implications: It was found that further investigations and detailed studies are required to identify the mechanism of deposit shaping, especially the control of dilution, shape of fusion zone and penetration depth, depending on parameters of surfacing and the trajectory and parameters of oscillation of the surfacing GMA torch.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of a comparative study of the nitriding process of titanium alloy substrate using two lasers with different characteristics of laser beams. One of the applied lasers was a high power diode laser emitting at a dominant wavelength of 808 nm, with a rectangular laser beam spot, and multimode energy distribution across the spot. The second laser was a solid state Yb:YAG disk laser emitting at a wavelength of 1. 03 μm, with a circular beam spot, characterized by near Gaussian energy distribution across the spot. In a case of both lasers single <b>stringer</b> <b>beads</b> with a similar width and at similar energy input were produced. As a result of melting of the substrate with a laser beam in a pure gaseous nitrogen atmosphere composite surface layers with in situ precipitated titanium nitrides embedded in the metallic matrix of titanium alloy were produced, in both cases. However, the surface topography and structure is different for the surface layers produce by different lasers at the same processing parameters and width of laser beams...|$|R
40|$|A {{high power}} direct diode laser, {{emitting}} {{in the range}} of near infrared radiation at wavelength 808 – 940 nm, was applied to produce a titanium matrix composite on a surface layer of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V by laser surface gas nitriding. The nitrided surface layers were produced as single <b>stringer</b> <b>beads</b> at different heat inputs, different scanning speeds, and different powers of laser beam. The influence of laser nitriding parameters on the quality, shape, and morphology of the surface layers was investigated. It was found that the nitrided surface layers consist of titanium nitride precipitations mainly in the form of dendrites embedded in the titanium alloy matrix. The titanium nitrides are produced {{as a result of the}} reaction between molten Ti and gaseous nitrogen. Solidification and subsequent growth of the TiN dendrites takes place to a large extent at the interface of the molten Ti and the nitrogen gas atmosphere. The direction of TiN dendrites growth is perpendicular to the surface of molten Ti. The roughness of the surface layers depends strongly on the heat input of laser nitriding and can be precisely controlled. In spite of high microhardness up to 2400 HV 0. 2, the surface layers are crack free...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{the effects}} of helium (from tritium decay) on the {{weldability}} of Types 304 and ITER Grade 316 LN stainless steel demonstrated the inherent complexities in designing and conducting an experimental program using tritium-charged-and-aged materials to simulate the effects of irradiation-induced helium on weld behavior. Differences in microstructure, surface condition and alloy chemistry are known to play key roles in tritium absorption and distribution and thus have direct effects on the subsequent 3 He production and distribution. The helium embrittlement cracking produced in 0. 5 in. (12. 7 mm) thick 304 and 316 LN plates that were tritium-charged in the same container and subsequently welded with gas metal arc, low heat input weld overlays and gas tungsten arc <b>stringer</b> <b>beads,</b> varied markedly. For example, the porosity in the weld beads was much higher in the 304 plate than in the 316 LN plate. Additionally, crack measurements from weld cross-sections revealed more extensive intergranular cracking in the heat-affected zones of welds on the 304 plate when compared to the 316 LN plate. However, {{the differences between the two}} types of stainless steel may not be a result of differences in the resistance to helium embrittlement cracking, but may be due to initial tritium concentration differences developed in the as-charged plates. Further work is necessary to identify the reasons for the apparent plate to plate variation in tritium/helium content and to demonstrate the similarities (or differences) between Types 304 and ITER grade 316 LN stainless steel...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the measurement of}} longitudinal residual stresses within a specially designed 200 × 180 × 25 mm single groove weld specimen. The purpose of these measurements was to quantify the residual stress field arising from a single <b>stringer</b> weld <b>bead</b> laid down within the constraint of a groove in order to validate finite element simulations of the welding process. Measurements were made over the cross section at the mid-bead length, utilising the relatively new Contour method and neutron diffraction. Non destructive neutron diffraction measurements were made using ENGIN-X, the engineering spectrometer at the ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK). The Contour method measurement was applied destructively at the Open University (UK), producing a detailed full-field residual stress map. Results from these measurements indicate a peak tensile longitudinal residual stress of ~ 300 MPa within the parent material adjacent to the weld bead. Good agreement is found between both techniques...|$|R
60|$|After this, {{for a long}} time, I {{never saw}} her, and I {{wondered}} that the common chances of the day should not have helped us to meet. It could only be evident that she was immensely on her guard against them; {{and in addition to}} this the house was so big that for each other we were lost in it. I used to look out for her hopefully as I crossed the sala in my comings and goings, but I was not rewarded with a glimpse of the tail of her dress. It was as if she never peeped out of her aunt's apartment. I used to wonder what she did there week after week and year after year. I had never encountered such a violent parti pris of seclusion; it was more than keeping quiet--it was like hunted creatures feigning death. The two ladies appeared to have no visitors whatever and no sort of contact with the world. I judged at least that people could not have come to the house and that Miss Tita could not have gone out without my having some observation of it. I did what I disliked myself for doing (reflecting that it was only once in a way): I questioned my servant about their habits and let him divine that I should be interested in any information he could pick up. But he picked up amazingly little for a knowing Venetian: it must be added that where there is a perpetual fast there are very few crumbs on the floor. His cleverness in other ways was sufficient, if it was not quite all that I had attributed to him on the occasion of my first interview with Miss Tita. He had helped my gondolier to bring me round a boatload of furniture; and when these articles had been carried {{to the top of the}} palace and distributed according to our associated wisdom he organized my household with such promptitude as was consistent with the fact that it was composed exclusively of himself. He made me in short as comfortable as I could be with my indifferent prospects. I should have been glad if he had fallen in love with Miss Bordereau's maid or, failing this, had taken her in aversion; either event might have brought about some kind of catastrophe, and a catastrophe might have led to some parley. It was my idea that she would have been sociable, and I myself on various occasions saw her flit to and fro on domestic errands, so that I was sure she was accessible. But I tasted of no gossip from that fountain, and I afterward learned that Pasquale's affections were fixed upon an object that made him heedless of other women. This was a young lady with a powdered face, a yellow cotton gown, and much leisure, who used often to come to see him. She practiced, at her convenience, the art of a <b>stringer</b> of <b>beads</b> (these ornaments are made in Venice, in profusion; she had her pocket full of them, and I used to find them on the floor of my apartment), and kept an eye on the maiden in the house. It was not for me of course to make the domestics tattle, and I never said a word to Miss Bordereau's cook.|$|R
25|$|Charles Freer {{introduced}} Whistler to {{his friend}} and fellow businessman, Richard Albert Canfield, in 1899 who became a personal friend and patron of Whistler's. Canfield owned a number of fashionable gambling houses in New York, Rhode Island, Saratoga Springs and Newport, and was also a man of culture with refined tastes in art. Canfield owned early American and Chippendale furniture, tapestries, Chinese porcelain and Barye bronzes. Canfield soon possessed the second largest and most important Whistler collection in the world prior to his death in 1914. A few months before his death, Canfield sold his collection of etchings, lithographs, drawings and paintings by Whistler to the American art dealer Roland F. Knoedler for $300,000. Three of Canfield's Whistler paintings hang in the Frick Museum in New York City. Canfield came to own numerous paintings by Whistler including La Mère Gérard (2) (YMSM 27), Symphony in Grey and Green: The Ocean (YMSM 72), Arrangement in Black: Portrait of F. R. Leyland (YMSM 97), Arrangement in Brown and Black: Portrait of Miss Rosa Corder (YMSM 203), Nocturne in Blue and Silver: The Lagoon,Venice (YMSM 212), Arrangement in Black and Gold: Comte Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac (YMSM 398), Rose et or: La Napolitaine (YMSM 505) and Grey and Gold: The Golden Bay, Ireland (YMSM 537). He also owned works in chalk, pastel and watercolour, including The Cemetery (M.738), Long Venice (M.748), Little Calle in San Barnaba; gold and brown (M.764), Little Canal, San Barnaba; flesh colour and grey (M.777), The Little Back Canal (M.779), Courtyard on Canal; grey and red (M.790), Nocturne - The Riva (M.799), Return of the fishing boats (M.1036), Blue and Silver - Afternoon, the Channel (M.1045), Grey and Pink (M.1209), r.: The Blue Girl; v.: Woman holding a fan (M.1223), Blue and Violet - Iris (M.1278), The Conversation (M.1289), Violet and Silver: The Afternoon Dream (M.1298), The Pink Cap (M.1308), Green and Blue: The Dancer (M.1376), The Captive (M.1524), The <b>Bead</b> <b>Stringers</b> (M.1530), Opal and Gold - Pourville Evening (M.1591), r.: Grey and Gold - Belle Isle; v.: Study for 'Grey and Gold - Belle Isle' (M.1595), Gray and Silver: The Golf Links, Dublin (M.1620), The Dancer (No.1) (M.1624), The Dancer (No.2) (M.1625), At Sea (M.1642), Shop, Algiers (M.1650), The Café - Algiers (M.1651), Street, Algiers (M.1652), Street, Corsica (M.1653), Street - Ajaccio (M.1654), r.: The Forge; v.: Smiths, Ajaccio (M.1679), r.: Blue and Silver: Morning - Ajaccio; v.: Building and trees (M.1694) and r.: The Gossips. Ajaccio; v.: group of people (M.1695). In May 1901 Canfield commissioned a portrait from Whistler. He started to pose for Portrait of Richard A. Canfield (YMSM 547) in March 1902. According to Alexander Gardiner, Canfield returned to Europe to sit for Whistler at the New Year in 1903, and sat every day until 16 May 1903. However, Whistler was ill and frail at this time and the work was his last completed portrait. The deceptive air of respectability that the portrait gave Canfield caused Whistler to call it 'His Reverence'. The two men were in correspondence from 1901 until Whistler's death.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} varying welding {{conditions}} on multipass weld metal {{has been investigated}} in all-weld test plates produced by flux cored arc (FCA) welding. The principal welding conditions varied for the test samples in the current research program were heat input (between approximately 1 and 2. 5 kJ/mm), welding technique (<b>stringer</b> or weave <b>beads),</b> shielding gas, welding position (flat or vertical) and consumable type. Mechanical testing of weld metal included tensile testing and Charpy-vee-notch impact tests over a range of temperatures from - 60 °C to 40 °C. The tensile testing results showed that yield and tensile strength generally decreased with increasing heat input and that the changes were {{of the order of}} 100 MPa. Impact properties showed more varied behaviour depending on consumable type. The effect of varying welding conditions on some less commonly studied microstructural factors has also been investigated, such as proportions of reheated and double-reheated regions and mean free path (MFP) in various distinctive microstructural zones. Using the simplifying assumption that the structural gradient the heat affected zone (HAZ) of reheated weld metal can be characterized in terms of three regions: the grain coarsened, GC; grain refined, GR and intercritical, IC heat affected regions; a second overlapping weld bead creates double-reheated weld metal structures which can be defined in terms of 9 sub-zones: GC-GC, GC-GR, GC-IC, GRGC, GR-GR, GR-IC, IC-GC, IC-GR, IC-IC. Linear and areal measurement techniques have been used on cross-sections of seventeen test plates to determine the volume fractions of solidified weld metal (SW), GC, GR and IC sub-zones of the reheated weld metal and the double-reheated zone. The hardness variation in the sub-zones and the influence of welding conditions has also been investigated in the present research. The mean free path was determined for SW, GC, GR and IC regions and the overall average mean free path of ferrite in each weld was also calculated to provide a characteristic length of the totality of the structural microconstituents in the weld metal. Strong relationships were found between mean free path and heat input and also with the strength of the weld metal. In contrast, toughness correlated poorly with overall mean free path. Impact toughness {{is one of the most}} important mechanical properties of welds. Assessment and understanding of the impact properties of welds is central to the avoidance of catastrophic failure of welded steel structures. Neural networks analysis has been used for the purpose of assessing which factors are beneficial to the low temperature impact properties of steel welds in order to obtain practical guidance as to how impact properties might be improved in FCA welds. Four major data fields were involved in the training of the neural networks: chemical composition, microstructure, non-metallic inclusions and welding condition. The backpropagation algorithm was used for the analysis. Sensitivity analysis of the neural network model revealed that the characteristics of the non-metallic inclusion distribution exerted only a small direct influence on toughness. In contrast, chemical composition and microstructure were indicated to be very important. In particular the toughness is predicted to increase with increasing % acicular ferrite and % reaustenitised region and these factors in turn are sensitive to the selected FCAW process and the welding conditions...|$|R
