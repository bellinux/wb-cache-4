5|$|He also {{experienced}} <b>stomach</b> <b>disease,</b> having a low production of gastric acids. This was worsened by harsh military conditions, including long periods with little food. The first {{references to the}} disease {{that would lead to}} his death, a case of edema, are from a year before, in a letter directed to Álvarez Thomas. He declared having problems in the chest, a lung, and his right leg. A later letter to Sarratea confirmed his situation, and specified that it started on 23 April 1819. The gravity of his condition led the doctor Francisco de Paula Rivero to diagnose an advanced dropsy. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires, where he died. He was embalmed by Joseph Redhead and Juan Sullivan. Sullivan performed the autopsy; it revealed high levels of fluid in multiple edemas and a tumor in the right epigastrium. The liver and spleen had grown beyond normal levels, there were hamartomas in the kidneys, and problems with the lungs and heart.|$|E

Intrigued by the find, Colonel Pavel Popov, {{the commander of the}} regiment, ordered that the springs be cleaned and that the water be bottled and transported to the military base. Popov, who suffered from <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> tried the water first. Seeing positive results, he ordered the construction of rock walls around the spring and he had a bath house built nearby, along with a small cottage house for himself. In 1837, when the Kherson regiment was replaced by the Georgian grenadiers regiment, its medical doctor Amirov examined the water components and their effects, sending the first results of analysis to Saint Petersburg and Moscow. By 1841, the healing effects of Borjomi water were so famous that the viceroy of the Russian Tsar in the Caucasus Yevgeni Golovin brought his sick daughter to the springs for treatment. In light of the quick results of the treatment, he called the first spring Yekaterinsky (...) after his daughter Yekaterina and the second Yevgeniyevsky (Евгеньевский) after himself.|$|E
