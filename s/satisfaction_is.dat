Instead, {{the function}} of <b>satisfaction</b> <b>is</b> to restore a sinner to a state of harmony with God by repairing or restoring in the sinner what sin has damaged. This is Aquinas' major difference with Anselm. Rather than seeing the debt as one of honor, he sees the debt as a moral injustice to be righted.|$|E

The overall number of reported friends in later life may be mediated by increased lucidity, better speech and vision, and marital status.|$|E

It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O psychology. Job satisfaction has theoretical and practical utility for the field. It has been linked to important job outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension. A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.|$|E

Being unemployed can have detrimental effects on a spouse's subjective well-being, compared to being employed or not working (and not looking for work).

When both partners are underemployed, the life-satisfaction of men is more greatly diminished than women. However, just being in a relationship reduces the impact unemployment has on the subjective well-being of an individual. On a broad scale, high rates of unemployment negatively affect the subjective well-being of the employed.|$|E

25|$|A fourth {{controversy}} {{stems from}} {{the manner in which}} the Chief Rabbinate of Israel has been handling marriage and conversion decisions in recent years. Conversions and marriages within Israel are legally controlled by the Orthodox Israeli Chief Rabbinate; therefore, a person not proven to be a Jew to the Rabbinate's <b>satisfaction</b> <b>is</b> not legally permitted to marry a Jew in Israel today. Although the Rabbinate has always refused to accept non-Orthodox conversions, until recent years it was more willing to accept the Jewish parentage of applicants based on personal testimony, and the validity of conversions based on the testimony of Orthodox Rabbis. However, in recent years the rabbinate, whose rabbis historically had a more Modern Orthodox orientation, has increasingly been filled by the more stringent Haredi camp. It has increasingly been inclined to presume that applicants are not Jewish until proven otherwise, and require more stringent standards of proof than in the past. It has implemented a policy of refusing to accept the testimony of non-Orthodox Jews in matters of Jewish status, on grounds that such testimony is not reliable. It also has been increasingly skeptical of the reliability of Orthodox rabbis ordained by institutions not subject to its accreditation, particularly in matters of conversion. Accordingly, non-Orthodox Jews born to Jewish parents, and some Jews converted by Orthodox rabbis, have been increasingly unable to prove their Jewishness to the Rabbinate's satisfaction, because they are unable to find an Orthodox rabbi who is both acceptable to the Rabbinate, and familiar with and willing to vouch for the Jewishness of their maternal lineage or the validity of their conversion.|$|E

Although women's <b>satisfaction</b> <b>is</b> usually lower than before the injury, it improves as time passes. Women report higher rates of sexual satisfaction than men post-SCI {{for as many as}} 10–45 years. More than a quarter of men have substantial problems with adjustment to their post-injury sexual functioning. Sexual satisfaction depends on a host of factors, some more important than the physical function of the genitals: intimacy, quality of relationships, satisfaction of partners, willingness to be sexually experimental, and good communication. Genital function is not as important to men's sexual satisfaction as are their partners' satisfaction and intimacy in their relationships. For women, quality of relationships, closeness with partners, sexual desire, and positive body image, as well as the physical function of the genitals, contribute sexual satisfaction. For both sexes, long-term relationships are associated with higher sexual satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|In Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs (1971), the High Court {{affirmed that}} {{with respect to}} the President's {{satisfaction}} that a person is acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore, mala fides or bad faith was [...] "not... a justiciable issue {{in the context of the}} Act and the power conferred by the Act on a body such as the President who has to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to direct the issue of an order of detention if the President is satisfied with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore etc". Essentially, this means that the President's <b>satisfaction</b> <b>is</b> subjective, and not objective. The effect of this decision is that [...] "the Constitution left it to the executive, and not the judiciary, to decide what national security required". Subsequently, in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal took a different stand, holding that the objective test should apply to the review of the exercise of discretion under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. (Section 10 empowers the Minister to direct that a detention order be suspended [...] "as the Minister sees fit", as well as to revoke such a direction.) The Court said that [...] "the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law" [...] because [...] "all power has legal limits", and therefore the exercise of discretionary power warrants examination by the court.|$|E
