Electrical faults, radiation instrumentation faults, and human errors are the three leading causes of failures. A representative “all modes” failure rate is 1 E- 04 /hr.

It provides cells ’ data and realizes cells management for BMS. In this paper, the design and realization of the management module for single cell is presented. It can collect real-time voltage and temperature data of cells, and carry on the necessary processing for such data, and then upload these data to the main control module in the battery management system. The design can also equalize the cells, and made their voltage remain in a standard. For the proposed design scheme, the microcontroller PIC 24 F 16 KA 101 is used as the core part, and the multi-cell addressable battery <b>stack</b> <b>monitor</b> LTC 6802 is utilized as the collection part.

40|$|The <b>stack</b> <b>monitor</b> uses {{long-range}} alpha detection (LRAD) {{technology for}} the measurement of radon levels in the stack emissions. The basic principle behind LRAD is the collection of ions created in air through the energy loss mechanisms of decay alphas. This is accomplished by establishing an electric field in the region where alpha decays will occur, and directing the ions via the field onto a biased plate. Accumulation of charge on the plate results in a current in the biasing circuit which can be read with a sensitive electrometer. In electrostatic LRAD designs, the linearity of the measured current with gross alpha activity is well-established. In order to determine radon- 222 levels {{in the presence of}} other radon isotopes, it is necessary to perform some type of isotopic analysis on the stack samples. In the present case, other radon isotopes of possible concern are radon- 219, which occurs in the decay chain of uranium- 235, and radon- 220, found in the decay chain of thorium- 232. Radon- 219, with a half-life of four seconds, presents no difficulty for the situation in which emanations from the vitrification process undergo as little as one minute of delay before release into the stack. For example, an initial concentration of 200, 000 pCi/l of radon- 219 decays to 5 pCi/l in one minute. Radon- 220, however, has a half-life of about 55 seconds. If initially present in a substantial ratio to radon- 222, a radon gross-alpha measurement on stack emissions would have a significant error if used as a measure for radon- 222, even with many minutes of processing delay before the sample was taken...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVolume {{reduction}} of radioactive solid wastes {{is carried out}} with an aim to minimize disposal space requirement. Cellulosic combustible solid wastes like cotton, paper etc. are treated by incineration and the plastic wastes are volume reduced by baling. Compaction of plastic wastes by baling gives low volume reduction factors (3 – 5) and also the resultant waste bale may spring back to original volume after disposal. With a view to achieve higher volume reduction factors, studies were conducted at CWMF on the melt-densification of plastic wastes at 180 - 190 C. The melted plastics were characterized by TGA/DTA & IR Spectroscopy and {{found that there was}} no structural loss of the polymer compounds. The melted mass was observed to have the expected theoretical density. A melt densification unit (MDU) was set up at CWMF with a facility for melting 20 kg of the plastic waste in each batch in a 200 L MS drum. The system has a furnace with vacuum chamber where plastic waste in drum is melted and an off gas treatment system consisting of a scrubber followed by HEPA filter. A continuous <b>stack</b> <b>monitor</b> is installed to estimate any release of radioactivity in the off-gases. This paper describes the operational experience of melting of different plastic wastes namely polythene sheets & bottles, HDPE pipes and cans, PVC shoe covers and neoprene gloves. About 47 M 3 of β-γ and 18 M 3 of α contaminated plastic wastes were melted using the above MDU. The volume reduction factors varied from 2. 5 to 30 depending on the initial bulk density of the material. The radioactivity in the off-gases was found to be always below detectable limits. The leach indices of waste matrices were 2 to 3 orders better than the stipulated limits...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports on}} a series of tests to assess the proposed air sampling locations for the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) Group 5 - 6 exhaust stacks with respect to the applicable criteria regarding the placement of an air sampling probe. The LB-C 2, LV-S 1, and LB S 2 exhaust stacks were tested together as a group (Test Group 5 - 6) because the common factor in their design is that the last significant flow disturbance upstream of the air sampling probe is a reduction in duct diameter. Federal regulations() require that a sampling probe be located in the exhaust stack according to the criteria of the American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) N 13. 1 - 1999, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stack and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities. These criteria address the capability of the sampling probe to extract a sample that represents the effluent stream. The testing on scale models of the stacks conducted for this project was part of the River Protection Project—Waste Treatment Plant Support Program under Contract No. DE-AC 05 - 76 RL 01830 according to the statement of work issued by Bechtel National Inc. (BNI, 24590 -QL-SRA-W 000 - 00101, N 13. 1 - 1999 <b>Stack</b> <b>Monitor</b> Scale Model Testing and Qualification, Revision 1, 9 / 12 / 2007) and Work Authorization 09 of Memorandum of Agreement 24590 -QL-HC 9 -WA 49 - 00001.

The series of tests consists of various measurements taken over a grid of points in the duct cross-section at the designed sampling probe locations and at five duct diameters up and downstream from the design location to accommodate potential construction variability. The tests were done only at the design sampling probe location on the scale model of LB-S 2 because that ductwork was already constructed.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), in conjunction with Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was then used to build a series of models able to predict NO x emissions from the furnaces. The models produced were proven to be robust, with a relatively high accuracy, and are able to predict NO x levels over the range of operating conditions which were sampled. It was found that due to structural/operational variations a separate model is usually required for each furnace.
