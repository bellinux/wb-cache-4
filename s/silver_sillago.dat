50|$|The {{northern}} whiting {{was first}} described by Peter Forsskål in 1775 {{under the name}} Atherina sihama, mistaking the fish as a species of hardyhead. The species was subsequently placed in the genus Platycephalus, before its true identity as a new genus was realized and Sillago was created in 1816. This was the first description and naming of any smelt-whiting, even though the author initially placed the species in the wrong genus. This makes S. sihama the type species of its genus, Sillago, {{as well as the}} type species of the family Sillaginidae, which was not to be named until 1846. However, Forsskål's name {{was not the only one}} applied to the species, with three other names given to the fish after the first correct naming. Two of these, S. acuta and S. erythraea were made by Georges Cuvier, and the other, Sciaena malabarica by Bloch and Schneider. These later names are junior synonyms and are discarded under the ICZN rules.Due to its wide distribution, the species has been applied a number of common names, with northern whiting, silver whiting, sand smelt and <b>silver</b> <b>sillago</b> the most common English names.|$|E
