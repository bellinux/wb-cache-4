25|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>sintering</b> is an {{additive}} {{rapid manufacturing}} technique {{that uses a}} high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass representing a desired 3-dimensional object. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part {{on the surface of}} a powder bed. <b>Selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>sintering</b> was invented and patented by Dr. Carl Deckard at the University of Texas at Austin in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Many, perhaps most, {{threaded}} parts {{have potential}} to be generated via additive manufacturing (3D printing), {{of which there are}} many variants, including fused deposition modeling, <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>sintering,</b> direct metal laser sintering, selective laser melting, electron beam melting, layered object manufacturing, and stereolithography. For most additive technologies, it has not been long since they emerged from the laboratory end of their historical development, but further commercialization is picking up speed. To date, most additive methods tend to produce a rough surface finish and tend to be restricted in the material properties that they can produce, and thus their earliest commercial victories have been in parts for which those restrictions were acceptable. However, the capabilities are continually growing.|$|E

The entire visco-elasto-plastic response is determined based on experimental data obtained through tensile, compression, shear and relaxation testing. In addition, ultrasonic non-destructive testing is proposed {{as an alternative to}} conventional testing for the derivation of the elastic properties of this material. An isotropic elastic behavior was observed, while a clear orthotropic and non-linear response was found for both the plastic curves and the relaxation behavior. Strength data suggests <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> PA- 12 will fail in tension rather than in shear. The ultrasonic tests correspond well to conventional tensile data (at high rates), and represent a cost-effective alternative to extensive conventional tensile testing.

25|$|AM {{processes}} for metal sintering or melting (such as <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>sintering,</b> direct metal laser sintering, and selective laser melting) usually went {{by their own}} individual names in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive (casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining); although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies (such as by robot welding and CNC), {{the idea of a}} tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal (rather than adding it), such as CNC milling, CNC EDM, and many others. But the automated techniques that added metal, which would later be called additive manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including microcasting and sprayed materials. Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common, enabling new object geometries.|$|E

2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>sintering,</b> with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to <b>Selective</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>Sintering,</b> but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of several rapid prototyping and manufacturing (RP and M) technologies {{is having a}} dramatic impact on investment casting.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} study into {{the effects of}} using recycled Polyamide 12 (PA 12) powder on the manufacture of a <b>Selective</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>Sintered</b> (SLS) part. It was found that through using recycled PA 12 material, a poor and unacceptable surface finish was achieved. The aim {{of this paper is}} therefore to develop a strategy to ideally eliminate the coarse surface texture found on the product (Orange Peel effect) by controlling the most important SLS process parameters. The reason for employing the strategy is to ensure consistent surface quality of the resultant parts and more efficient use of the SLS recycled material. A suitable laser scanning strategy and energy density value along with an appropriate recycled material was chosen as the main process parameters. In this experiment 3 replications were experimentally tested. PA 12 recycled materials with a Melt Flow Rate (MFR) of 18 - 19 MFR and 15 - 16 MFR were used in the experiments. An in-house surface texture scoring system was introduced to evaluate the surface quality produced on the parts. This paper extends the understanding of the SLS process and in particular the relationship between the SLS parameters and part quality. The experimental results suggest that through employing an effective laser scanning strategy and energy density value, the resulting part surface quality was improved. The proposed method provides a threshold MFR value for the PA 12 powder and shows that materials with MFR values lower than 18 MFR created parts of poor and unacceptable surface quality...|$|R

40|$|Centrifuges have {{multiple}} uses {{in medicine and}} in laboratories. Most notably, {{they are used to}} separate materials, e. g. blood plasma and serums, and produce genetically engineered substances. Centrifuge rotors hold sample containers. Centrifugal forces equaling 25, 000 times the force of gravity act on operating rotors and samples at speeds of 20, 000 r/min. Unlike present conventional solutions (rotors made of special aluminum alloys), the load-bearing structures of the lightweight rotors presented here are made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP). Given the fibers extremely high load-bearing capacity, lightweight rotors manufactured with this novel technology set new standards for weight, stability and service life compared to current concepts. In addition, the time typically need ed to heat aluminum rotors is reduced by at least 50 %. This complicated design principle necessitates suitable forming tools that reproduce the complex geometries (e. g. undercuts). Therefore, generative (laminate) methods of geometry generation are used for mold making. With their practically unlimited freedom of design, the technologies can, for instance, already produce close-contour cooling channels during mold making. Furthermore, as mentioned, <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> geometrically complex inserts will reduce the weight of future rotor bodies. Once this novel concept has been implemented, a lighter weight CFRP rotor will be at least 10 % more stable than a lightweight wound rotor. At the same time, its permissible speed is expected to be at least 10 % higher than that of availabl e lightweight rotors in the same class. To this end, comprehensive physical models and new calculation algorithms for the FEM analysis have been developed, which ensure that lightweight rotors can be manufacture reproducibly...|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} high surface {{roughness}} of additive manufactured (AM) products, typically a post-treatment is required. Subtractive post-treatments are often performed {{by hand and}} are therefore expensive and time consuming, whereas conventional additive post-treatments, such as pneumatic spray coating, require large quantities of coating material. Ultrasonic spray coating, in contrast, is an additive post-treatment technology capable of applying coatings in an efficient way, resulting in less material usage. In this paper, we investigate {{the application of the}} ultrasonic spray coating process and the final properties of the coated AM part by applying a thin coating to reduce surface roughness of the AM substrate and to impart hydrophobic functionality. The hydrophobic coating is applied onto flat <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> (SLS) surfaces prepared from polyamide 12 (PA 12) having a surface roughness of Ra = 20 µm. The hydrophobic coating consists of 5 wt % polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in acetone. The coated substrates are analyzed for roughness using a profilometer, a contact angle using a goniometer, and a coating uniformity and thickness using light and scanning electron microscopes. The layer formation applying the ultrasonic spray coating is studied and compared with layer formation using pneumatic spray coating. It is found that a roughness reduction down to 5 µm was achieved via an ultrasonic spray coating with 30 layers of PVDF solution. It is shown in cross-section electron microscopy pictures that, {{due to the nature of}} the ultrasonically generated droplets, the rough and porous surface of the SLS surface is filled with the PVDF material after which the roughness is reduced by adding a thin layer on top. In comparison to a standard industry-applied pneumatic spray coating process, the results obtained from ultrasonic spray coating show less material usage, a reduced roughness, and a better filling of the pores, obviously resulting in optimized adhesion...|$|R
