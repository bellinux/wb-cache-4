The areas treated with resist keep their {{original}} colour; when the resist is removed {{the contrast between}} the dyed and undyed areas forms the pattern. This process is repeated as many times as the number of colours desired.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 1996, a -long boom {{portion of}} a {{construction}} crane crashed at the construction site, <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> stone {{on the east side}} of the building, but not injuring anyone. Due to the fragile sandstone exterior, the damage on the rotunda was not repaired. In January 1997, construction crews finished the demolition portion of the project and finished the structural reinforcement part before they began the interior construction phase.|$|E
5|$|The earldom of Suffolk, says {{historian}} Michael Hicks, was 'not particularly well-endowed,' {{probably only}} just <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> £666 qualifying income for that rank. His mother, though, held substantial estates {{in her own}} right, from her father, Sir Thomas Chaucer. Furthermore, because this was Alice's third marriage, she held large dowers from both previous husbands, the second {{of whom had been}} Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury.|$|E

5|$|At 00:30 {{hours on}} 28 March the convoy {{crossed over the}} shoals {{at the mouth of}} the Loire estuary, with Campbeltown <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> bottom twice. Each time she was able to pull free, and the group {{proceeded}} on up toward the harbour in darkness. They had got to within about eight minutes passage from the dock gates when at 01:22 the entire convoy was illuminated by the combined searchlights of both banks of the estuary. A naval signal light demanded their identification.|$|E
5|$|The dugouts {{were created}} by Algonquian peoples who were {{seasonal}} visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowing burning out {{the center of the}} log and <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell. Historians believe that the Algonquian would sink their canoes {{to the bottom of the}} lake for safekeeping until they would return the following fishing and hunting season. Thirty of these ancient canoes have been found in Lake Phelps, with perhaps more yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact with}} the fire {{extinguisher}} wrenched Pryce's helmet upward sharply. Death was almost certainly instantaneous. Pryce's Shadow DN8, now with its driver dead at the wheel, continued at speed down the main straight towards the first corner, called Crowthorne. The car left the track to the right, <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> metal barriers, hitting an entrance for emergency vehicles, and veering back onto the track. It then hit Jacques Laffite's Ligier, sending both Pryce and Laffite head-on into the barriers. Jansen van Vuuren's injuries were so extensive that, initially, his body was identified only after the race director had summoned all of the race marshals {{and he was not}} among them.|$|E

5|$|Both NEC tracks have {{high-level}} platforms, {{which were}} added in 2001 {{for use by}} Acela Express trains (which cannot use low platforms). The southbound NEC track is served by a low platform behind the station, {{which leads to a}} short high-level platform south of State Street. The northbound NEC track is served by a high-level platform behind the station building; the low platform south of State Street is generally only used for deboarding passengers from busy trains. Because of the sharp curve, the high-level platforms are set slightly back from the tracks to avoid <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> ends of train cars, and thus bridge plates are needed to span the gap between platform and car.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} and not sharing personal items. While treatment {{is not necessary}} some may wish to have the lesions removed for cosmetic reasons or to prevent spread. Removal may occur with freezing, opening up the lesion and <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> inside, or laser therapy. <b>Scraping</b> <b>the</b> lesion can however result in scarring. The medication cimetidine by mouth or podophyllotoxin cream applied to the skin may also be used.|$|E

25|$|A Turkish {{passenger}} reported, as {{a possible}} cause, that illegal Afghan immigrants, who had boarded the ship concealed in a lorry, had lit a fire at the ship's garage to keep themselves warm.

25|$|Like other cats, snow leopards use scent {{marks to}} {{indicate}} their territories and common travel routes. These are most commonly produced by <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> ground with the hind feet before depositing urine or scat, but they also spray urine onto sheltered patches of rock.|$|E

25|$|Unless a {{desiccant}} is used {{which can}} destroy the peroxides, they will concentrate during distillation, {{due to their}} higher boiling point. When sufficient peroxides have formed, they can form a crystalline, shock-sensitive solid precipitate. Minor mechanical disturbances, such as <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> inside of a vessel or the dislodging of a deposit, can set off a violent explosion.|$|E
25|$|Recent large calving events {{where the}} glacier {{produces}} icebergs {{have also been}} found to trigger earthquakes due to the icebergs <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the fjord. A recent large calving of approximately 7km² took place on February 15, 2015.

25|$|In July 2004 {{the third}} search {{was carried out}} in the {{northern}} part of the Pig's Meadow, where Alexander Avdonin originally found the nine sets of remains. Ground-penetrating radar was used with hand tools and well as <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> top 8cm of the soil with a machine in order to bring the soil level down to that of the 1918 era. In July 2007, the remains of two young people were found in the southern part of the Pig's Meadow, approximately 70 meters from the first grave site.|$|E

25|$|Scratch bands, {{also known}} as fungi bands and {{formerly}} string bands, are a distinctive form of folk ensemble; they have survived the decline of other Virgin Islander folk traditions, through adapting to newly imported instrumentation and songs, and becoming {{a part of a}} more general revival of interest in folk culture on the islands. The name scratch band may derive from the sound produced by <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> squash, an instrument similar to the Puerto Rican guiro, but larger, or from the word squash itself, used to refer to the bands first by American visitors and then by locals.|$|E
25|$|Yaks mate in the summer, {{typically}} between July and September, {{depending on}} the local environment. For {{the remainder of the}} year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as the rut approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns. Like bison, but unlike cattle, males wallow in dry soil during the rut, often while scent-marking with urine or dung. Females enter oestrus up to four times a year, and females are receptive only for a few hours in each cycle.|$|E
25|$|Kevin Harvick {{started on}} pole and {{dominated}} {{most of the}} first half of the race. Cautions flew for debris on lap 59, Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. brushing the wall on lap 76, and debris again on lap 125. Brad Keselowski took the lead from Harvick on lap 149. After a caution for J.J. Yeley <b>scraping</b> <b>the</b> wall on lap 171, Harvick regained the lead. After a round of green flag pit stops, Harvick cut a tire on lap 253 and brought out the caution. Keselowski took over the race lead. Jeff Gordon took the lead from Keselowski on lap 306 and continued on for the win, the 92nd of his career. Following this race, A. J. Allmendinger, Kurt Busch, Greg Biffle, and Aric Almirola were eliminated from the Chase.|$|E
