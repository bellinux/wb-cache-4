40|$|In a {{manufacturing}} company, certain departments {{can be characterized}} as production departments and others as <b>service</b> <b>departments.</b> Examples of <b>service</b> <b>departments</b> are purchasing, computing services, repair and maintenance, security, food services, and so forth.

It is known that one can view the cost allocation problem as an absorbing Markov process, with the production depart-ments as the absorbing states and the <b>service</b> <b>departments</b> as the transient states. Using Markov analysis, we will show that this yields additional insight into the underlying con-cept of reciprocal <b>service</b> <b>department</b> cost allocation by proving that the “full service” department costs can be used to determine the price that should be paid to an external supplier of the same service currently supplied by the <b>service</b> <b>department.</b> 1...|$|R
