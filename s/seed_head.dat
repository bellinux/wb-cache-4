25|$|The seeds {{themselves}} {{do not contain}} significant amounts of opiates. But a poppy tea consumed in some areas and {{often referred to as}} doda has been controversial for containing ground opium poppy plant, especially the <b>seed</b> <b>head,</b> and contains significant levels of opiates. Popular in some South Asian communities, doda is created by grinding dried poppy husks or poppy seeds into a fine powder and then ingesting the mix with hot water or tea. In Canada, doda is made from poppy plants brought in from Afghanistan and Arizona under the guise of legal purposes such as floral arrangements, but is sold illegally from some meat markets.|$|E
2500|$|Emmer wheat, {{also known}} as farro {{especially}} in Italy, or hulled wheat, {{is a type of}} awned wheat. [...] Emmer is a tetraploid (2n=4x=28 chromosomes). [...] The domesticated species are Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccum and Triticum turgidum conv. durum. The wild species is called Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides. [...] The principal difference between the wild and the domestic species is that the ripened <b>seed</b> <b>head</b> of the wild species shatters and spreads the seed onto the ground, while in the domesticated emmer, the <b>seed</b> <b>head</b> remains intact, thus making it easier for humans to harvest the grain.|$|E
2500|$|The name Pelargonium {{is derived}} from the Greek , pelargós (stork), because the <b>seed</b> <b>head</b> looks like a stork's beak. Dillenius {{originally}} suggested the name 'stork', because Geranium was named after a crane — [...] "a πελαργός, ciconia, sicuti vocamus Gerania, γερανός, grus" [...] (as pelargos, stork, as we call the Gerania, geranos, crane). Despite the Latin, this {{should not be confused with}} the modern-day Ciconia genus, of birds in the stork family.|$|E

She became a creative being, {{in harmony with the}} live things around her. The great life-dispensing sun poured its rays down upon her, as if to ripen her; and the earth seemed warm, motherly, immense with its all-embracing arms. She no longer plucked the bluebells to press to her face, but leaned to them. Every blade of gramma grass, with its shining bronze-tufted <b>seed</b> <b>head,</b> had significance for her. The scents of the desert began to have meaning for her. She sensed within her the working of a great leveling process through which supreme happiness would come.|$|E

50|$|The {{flower stalk}} is notable for its curious behaviour: {{pendulous}} before flowering, it becomes erect for flowering, lifting the flower {{to the attention}} of pollinators, then becomes pendulous again until the <b>seed</b> <b>head</b> ripens, at which time it becomes erect again, exposing the <b>seed</b> <b>head</b> to the best possible wind exposure. The 'flower' is a yellow head of florets, reminiscent of a dandelion. The seed heads ripen to a cluster of fluffy, tan achenes, each having a crown of fine extensions called a pappus. Seed dispersal is by wind.|$|E
