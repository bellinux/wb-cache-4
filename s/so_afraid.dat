5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E

25|$|Late in August, New York {{prosecutor}} Joseph Stone {{convened a}} grand jury to investigate the allegations of the fixing of quiz shows. At {{the time of the}} empaneling, neither being a party to a fixed game show nor fixing a game show in the first place were crimes in their own right. Some witnesses in the grand jury acknowledged their role in a fixed show, while others denied it, directly contradicting one another. Many of the coached contestants, who had become celebrities due to their quiz show success, were <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> of the social repercussions of admitting the fraud that they were unwilling to confess to having been coached, {{even to the point of}} perjuring themselves to avoid backlash. Show producers, who had legally rigged the games to increase ratings but did not want to implicate themselves, the show sponsors, or the networks they worked for in doing so, categorically denied the allegations. After the nine-month grand jury, no indictments were handed down, and the judge sealed the grand jury report in Summer 1959.|$|E

500|$|Ross Kananga {{suggested}} the stunt of Bond [...] jumping on crocodiles, and was enlisted by the producers to perform it. The scene took five {{takes to be}} completed, including {{one in which the}} last crocodile snapped at Kananga's heel, tearing his trousers. The production also had trouble with snakes. The script supervisor was <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> that she refused to be on set with them; an actor fainted while filming a scene where he is killed by a snake; Jane Seymour became terrified as a reptile got closer, and Geoffrey Holder only agreed to fall into the snake-filled casket because Princess Alexandra was visiting the set.|$|E

500|$|Some reviews {{were less}} favorable.

[...] Linda Beath of The Globe and Mail said Duvall's {{performance}} was [...] "fabulous," [...] but that the film was [...] "very slight" [...] compared to Beresford's Australian pictures. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film, criticizing its mood and tempo and describing Buckley as its only true asset: [...] "Tender Mercies fails because of an apparent dimness of perception that frequently overcomes dramatists: they don't always know when they've got ahold of {{the wrong end of}} the story they want to tell." ...|$|E

500|$|On 8 January 1945 Nikolai Krylov {{formally}} allowed Shanina {{to participate}} in front-line combat, albeit with great reluctance: previously Shanina was denied that permission by {{the commander of the}} 184th Rifle Division and the military council of the 5th Army as well. Five days later, the Soviets launched the East Prussian Offensive, which prompted heavy fighting in East Prussia. By 15 January, travelling with divisional logistics, Shanina reached the East Prussian town of Eydtkuhnen (now Chernyshevskoye), where she used white military camouflage. Several days later, she experienced friendly fire from a Katyusha rocket launcher and wrote in her diary, [...] "Now I understand why the Germans are <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> of Katyushas.

500|$|The fifth track, [...] "The Other Side", has churning, chunky guitars, a double-bass {{drum and}} Lee's [...] "ethereal, widescreen" [...] vocals with {{elements}} of R. Lyrically, the song's theme is death. [...] "Erase This", formerly titled [...] "Vanilla", was noted by Mary Ouellette of Loudwire as an [...] "uptempo rocker" [...] similar to [...] "What You Want" [...] which would sound better played live {{rather than through}} earphones. [...] "Lost in Paradise" [...] is a symphonic rock ballad which begins with piano, strings and Lee's unlayered vocals before adding the band for the song's climax; its lyrics reflect Lee's past struggles, apologizing to her fans for the band's five-year absence. The song's musical structure was compared to [...] "Jóga", by the Icelandic recording artist Björk. [...] "Sick" [...] has a loose, lazy melody and a chanted chorus; {{one of the first}} songs written for the album, it [...] "set a heavy direction {{for the rest of the}} record." [...] "End of the Dream" [...] begins [...] "full bore with chunky guitar, then falls into a brooding grove with piano underpinning Lee's unmistakable vocals." [...] In the chorus, Lee sings [...] "Follow your heart 'til it bleeds," [...] evincing the track's [...] "seize the day" [...] message. Lee said about the song, [...] "It's about understanding that this life isn't forever, and how you have to live it, embrace even the pain, before it's all over. As much as it hurts, it just means you're alive. So don't be <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> to get hurt that you miss out on living." [...] "Oceans" [...] begins with a big, low synth and a vocal before the band joins in. According to Lee, [...] "It's big and lush. We've been having a lot of fun playing that one especially." [...] "Never Go Back" [...] (originally called [...] "Orange") examines [...] "loss from the perspective of someone losing someone in a tragedy". Lee said that the song, with the lyrics [...] "It's all gone, the only world I've ever known", was inspired by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. [...] "Swimming Home" [...] is an electro-pop song with grinding guitars and a [...] "weeping" [...] piano.|$|E
