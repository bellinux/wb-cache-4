50|$|In 1937, Willys {{redesigned}} the 4-cylinder model. It {{gained a}} semistreamlined {{body with a}} <b>slanted</b> <b>windshield,</b> headlamps integrally embedded into the fenders, and a one-piece, rounded hood transversely hinged at the rear.|$|E
50|$|Square-bodied Land Cruiser utility 4x4. Two or four {{doors with}} steel doors and top, <b>slanted</b> <b>windshield.</b> The front-clip styling remains {{much like that}} of the 40 Series. The grille can be mesh or can consist of three {{horizontal}} bars.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1970s {{he moved}} to Mooney Aircraft where he worked lead an {{aerodynamic}} cleanup of the M20F Executive and called it the Mooney 201. Starting with the already stretched frame of the M20F, LoPresti improved the aerodynamics via a more <b>slanted</b> <b>windshield,</b> sleeker cowling, and some other minor cleanup items. It was the first aircraft to achieve 200mph (201mph top speed) on [...] He also led design of the 201's larger cousins, the 231, 252 and 301.|$|E
50|$|Following a 1938 incident, the XC-12 was {{modified}} at Glendale, California: The forward <b>slanting</b> eight-piece <b>windshield</b> {{was modified}} to a four piece that slanted rearward, and the passenger windows were squared off {{to look more}} like a Douglas DC-3.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is a six passenger, all-metal, single-engine, low-wing monoplane with hydraulically retractable conventional landing gear. The center fuselage is {{welded steel}} tubing. The cockpit used a spilt forward <b>slanting</b> <b>windshield</b> popular on large aircraft of the period, with rearward sliding canopy panels over the pilots. There {{is a large}} passenger doorway just behind the right wing. The aircraft was constructed around an eight inch steel tube jig that was removed after assembly. The first engine used was sourced from a Boeing P-12E from Selfridge Field using a NACA cowling. Four small passenger windows were expanded for better visibility. The engine was upgraded in 1936 to a [...] Pratt & Whitney SRB-1535 with additional fuel capacity of [...] total.|$|R
5000|$|The 1960 models {{featured}} numerous {{exterior and}} interior design changes. The greenhouse was made [...] "lighter" [...] with a narrower C-pillar and roof profile, as well as <b>slanting</b> both the <b>windshield</b> and rear window at a greater angle providing for an [...] "airy cabin." [...] The front end was simplified, while the tailfins became smaller thus highlighting the new tall taillamps. The overall length was trimmed by 1.6 in because of a new spit-bumper design. Riding on 15-inch wheels the Rambler appeared to be larger than it actually was. The interior was also revised and the instrument panel now incorporated all instrumentation within a large oval {{in front of the}} driver.|$|R
50|$|The concept show vehicle {{featured}} rear suicide {{doors and}} a 400 hp turbocharged 3.0-liter two stroke engine. Both {{the concept and}} production model used the Chrysler Corporation's new cab-forward design, which was launched on the larger LH sedans in 1992. Cab-forward design was characterized by the long, dramatically <b>slanted</b> <b>windshield,</b> and short overhangs. The wheels were pushed further to {{the corners of the}} vehicle, which created a much larger passenger cabin than most other similarly sized vehicles of that time.|$|E
40|$|Vortex {{generation}} {{behind the}} A-pillar region due to airflow separation leads to aero-acoustics generation. The magnitude {{and intensity of}} the vortex and hence aero-acoustics activities are further enhanced when vehicle are exposed to crosswind especially when travelling on a highway. The objective of this project {{is to develop a}} computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and computational aero-acoustics (CAA) model to best simulate aerodynamic flow and aero-acoustics propagation behind the A-pillar region of simplified vehicle with varying windshield radii under various yaw conditions. The CFD model will then be used to investigate and better understand the aerodynamic and aero-acoustics distribution behaviour surrounding area of the vehicle A-pillar region. The simplified vehicle model used was of 40 % scale. Models investigated consist of three models of different circular windshield/A-pillar radii and two models of with sharp A-pillar edges with different <b>windshield</b> <b>slant</b> angle. Models used in this project were subjected to 0 &# 0176;, 5 &# 0176;, 10 &# 0176; and 15 &# 0176; yaw angles. The models were modelled under laboratory conditions, exposed to boundary inlet velocities of 60, 100 and 140 km/h...|$|R
5000|$|The Fisher-bodied Series 62 {{replaced}} the Cadillac Series 61 {{at the lowest}} rung in the model line up in 1940. The Series 62 featured a low sleek [...] "torpedo" [...] style C-body with chrome window reveals, more <b>slant</b> in the <b>windshield,</b> and a curved rear window. The new C-body that the 1940 Cadillac Series 62 shared with the Buick Roadmaster and Super, the Oldsmobile Series 90 and the Pontiac Torpedo featured shoulder and hip room that was over 5" [...] wider, the elimination of running boards and exterior styling that was streamlined and 2-3" [...] lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly {{been influenced by the}} Cadillac Sixty Special. The styling feature distinguishing all V-8 Cadillacs was once again the grille. Although grilles had the same pointed shape as in 1939, the grille bars were heavier and fewer in number. Two sets of louver bars appeared {{on each side of the}} hood. Running boards were a no cost option. The Series 62 was available as a club coupe or a sedan, with 2-door and 4-door convertibles introduced mid-year. Sales totaled 5903 in its inaugural year accounting for about 45% of Cadillac's sales.|$|R
