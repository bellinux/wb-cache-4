Marquis also had lessons from John Stands in Timber, the Cheyenne tribal historian and grandson of Lame White Man, a Cheyenne chief killed in the battle with Custer. Together with co-author Margot Liberty, Stands in Timber published Cheyenne Memories <b>shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died in 1967.|$|E

5|$|World events {{thereafter}} moved {{against the}} Conservatives. Controversial wars in Afghanistan and South Africa undermined his public support. He angered British farmers {{by refusing to}} reinstitute the Corn Laws in response to poor harvests and cheap imported grain. With Gladstone conducting a massive speaking campaign, his Liberals bested Disraeli's Conservatives at the 1880 general election. In his final months, Disraeli led the Conservatives in Opposition. He had throughout his career written novels, beginning in 1826, and he published his last completed novel, Endymion, <b>shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> {{died at the age}} of 76.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, Sarria became {{determined}} to join the military, despite being, at just under five feet tall, too short to meet the Army's height requirement. He seduced a major who {{was attached to the}} San Francisco recruiting station on the condition that the major approve Sarria's enlistment. Jose Sarria was approved and entered the Army Reserve, continuing his studies as he waited to be called up to active duty. <b>Shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was scheduled for induction in the regular Army, his beloved second father, Charles Millen, died of a heart attack. Sarria's induction was delayed a month, then he was sworn in and ordered to Sacramento, California, for basic training with the Signal Corps.|$|E
5|$|Although early {{computers}} such as EDSAC made successful use {{of mercury}} delay line memory, the technology had several drawbacks; it was heavy, it was expensive, {{and it did}} not allow data to be accessed randomly. In addition, because data was stored as a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a mercury column, the device's temperature had to be very carefully controlled, as the velocity of sound through a medium varies with its temperature. Williams had seen an experiment at Bell Labs demonstrating the effectiveness of cathode ray tubes (CRT) {{as an alternative to the}} delay line for removing ground echoes from radar signals. While working at the TRE, <b>shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> joined the University of Manchester in December 1946, he and Tom Kilburn had developed a form of electronic memory known as the Williams or Williams–Kilburn tube based on a standard CRT, the first random-access digital storage device. The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) was designed to show that the system was a practical storage device, by testing that data held within it could be read and written at the speed necessary for use in a computer.|$|E

5|$|Bonsaint and Scully visit Melissa's home, {{but find}} it unoccupied. Bonsaint tells Scully that Melissa was once {{married to a}} local fisherman, but was widowed when he was inexplicably found dead aboard his fishing boat, the hook on his winch driven through his skull. Later, it is {{revealed}} that he found Chinga in a lobster trap {{and gave it to}} Polly as a present <b>shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died. Bonsaint also explains that there had been an incident between Polly and Jane Froelich, the proprietor of a local daycare center, when Jane slapped Polly over her behavior. Meanwhile, Riggs meets Melissa and Polly at an ice cream shop. Melissa describes how she has seen images of violent deaths, such as Dave's, before they occur. Riggs gives Melissa the key to a remote cabin and suggests that she leave town. When Polly asks one of the workers for more cherries, the worker insists that she needs to pay for them. Just then, the worker is nearly killed when her hair gets caught in the mixer until Riggs saves her.|$|E
5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, <b>shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> went to bed. Kelly and Kate {{had gone to bed}} earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E
5|$|Harold Larwood {{maintained}} {{great respect}} for Jardine, treasuring a gift his captain gave him after the Bodyline tour and believing {{him to be a}} great man. Jardine showed affection for Larwood in return even after both of their retirements; he expressed his concern for the way Larwood was treated, hosted a lunch for the former fast bowler <b>shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> emigrated to Australia and met him there in 1954. On the other hand, Donald Bradman would never speak to journalists about Bodyline or Jardine, and refused to give a tribute when Jardine died in 1958. Jack Fingleton admitted that he had liked Jardine and stated that he and Larwood had each done their job on the Bodyline tour, and expressed regret at the way both left cricket in acrimonious circumstances. Fingleton also described Jardine as an aloof individual who preferred to take his time in judging a person before befriending them, a quality that caused problems in Australia. Bill O'Reilly stated that he disliked Jardine at the time of Bodyline, but on meeting him later found him agreeable and even charming.|$|E

5|$|On 7 June 1944, Elliot married Donald James Graham Gowing at the Wimbledon Registry Office. He was a vocalist who {{had also}} {{attended}} Christ's Hospital before winning a choral scholarship to Kings College, Cambridge, in 1939. He had joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1941, and was serving at Combined Operations Headquarters. They married <b>shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was shipped overseas. He was taught Japanese in the United States and went on serve in the Pacific as a translator. The marriage bar was suspended for the duration and Gowing was allowed {{to remain in the}} Civil Service. They had two children, both sons: Nicholas Keith (Nik), a journalist who was born in 1951 and named after Hancock, and James, born in 1954. Her husband, frustrated by his lack of professional success compared to hers, became an alcoholic, and died from a massive stroke in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} decade the house was {{likely to have been}} let, as Maria Davenport {{preferred}} to live elsewhere. Her eldest son, William Davenport Davenport married firstly to Camilla Maria Gatt, then secondly to Diana Handley, whom he lived with at Bramall for four years before the estate was passed to him. Maria moved to London where she lived with her youngest son, Charles, and died in 1866. During William's tenure Bramall was regularly visited by members of the public, and the Chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship. However, following his death in 1869, the property was let to Wakefield Christy of Christys & Co Hatting, therefore ending direct involvement from the Davenport family. This occurred because William's son, John, was too young to inherit the estate. John's whereabouts during Christy's seven-year tenure is unknown, though he was shown as a visitor at Bramall in 1871, and in 1874 became the first chairman of the Bramhall School Board. In 1876, <b>shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> returned to the house, he was listed as living on Ack Lane in Bramhall.|$|E
5|$|Some foreign volunteers had no {{military}} experience and {{found themselves in}} a similar situation to the Rhodesian teenagers. These foreigners were generally motivated to enlist by anti-communist political views, hunger for adventure, turbulent personal lives in their home countries or some combination of these factors. The Canadian Mathew Charles Lamb joined 3 Commando, RLI in 1973, having just spent six years in a psychiatric hospital. In June 1966, aged 18, he had killed two strangers in a shooting spree in his home-town, but avoided the death penalty on a court ruling {{that at the time of}} the incident he had been insane. Keeping his past life a secret, he became a popular and well-regarded soldier in 3 Commando, and eventually rose to the rank of Lance-Corporal, taking command of a Fireforce stick on Operation Thrasher <b>shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{formed the}} {{backdrop}} for several scenes in William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Another Henry Percy inherited the family estates in 1585 and assumed the title of 9thEarl of Northumberland. After the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605, the earl was imprisoned for his connection with Thomas Percy, one of the plotters. <b>Shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was sentenced (he was fined £30,000 and held in the Tower of London), the earl leased Warkworth Castle to Sir Ralph Gray, who owned Chillingham Castle in Northumberland. Gray neglected the earl's building and allowed it to fall further into disrepair. The lead from the buildings in the bailey was sold in 1607 to alleviate the earl's financial problems. When JamesI visited in 1617 en route to Scotland, his entourage was angered by the sorry state of the castle. With the unification of England and Scotland under a single ruler, the earls of Northumberland had no need for two great castles near the Anglo-Scottish border; they maintained Alnwick {{at the expense of}} Warkworth. In {{the first quarter of the}} 17thcentury, the keep was used to hold manor courts and for the laying out of oats.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{designed}} by Sir Charles Barry, <b>shortly</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> designed the Palace of Westminster. It was constructed between 1837 and 1839 out of sandstone, with a slate roof. It is in English neogothic style. The building has seven narrow bays, with buttresses and a lancet in each bay. The west end has a giant moulded archway, with an arched doorway at the ground floor with a window above. On the east end there is a rose window. The corners are square, with pinnacles. The inside of the chapel had galleries on three sides, and a ribbed, vaulted ceiling. The attached two-storey Sunday School {{is in the same}} style as the chapel, and has a triple-gabled north side, with large arched windows on the first floor. It also has a canted apse on the west end, and a lean-to porch. The building was listed on 3 October 1974, and is currently classed as Grade II*.|$|E
5|$|AJ gets a {{job from}} Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) as a {{mechanic}} {{to help the}} family with their financial problems.

When Zainab has a job interview, AJ tells the interviewer she has short-term memory loss. However, when he apologises via a Post-It note, she returns the apology. AJ supports Masood when his relationship with Zainab ends. When AJ has to look after Masood's young son Kamil Masood (Arian Chikhlia), {{he admits that he}} is not good with children, and was scared when Aliyah wanted one, because he feels he cannot look after himself properly, let alone a child.
