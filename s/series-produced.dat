5|$|T-26 model 1931: twin-turreted version {{armed with}} two DT tank machine guns. The first <b>series-produced</b> {{variant of the}} T-26 that was {{equipped}} with turrets differing from the initial Vickers design (Soviet turrets were higher and had an observation window). Tanks produced from 1931 to March 1932 had a riveted hull and turrets, a silencer affixed with two clamps, and lacked any cover over the air outlet window. About 1,177 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks armed with machine guns were accepted by the Red Army, which had 1,015 such twin-turreted tanks on 1 April 1933.|$|E
5|$|The T-26 {{tank was}} a Soviet light {{infantry}} tank used during many conflicts of the 1930s and in World War II. It was a {{development of the}} British Vickers 6-Ton tank {{and was one of}} the most successful tank designs of the 1930s until its light armour became vulnerable to newer anti-tank guns. It was produced in greater numbers than any other tank of the period, with more than 11,000 units manufactured. During the 1930s, the USSR developed 53 variants of the T-26, including flame-throwing tanks, combat engineer vehicles, remotely controlled tanks, self-propelled guns, artillery tractors, and armoured carriers. Twenty-three of these were <b>series-produced,</b> others were experimental models.|$|E
5|$|The T-26-4 {{with the}} KT tank gun passed tests {{successfully}} and five vehicles {{were built in}} 1933–1934 as pilot batch. Initially it was planned to arm three of these T-26-4 with the 76.2mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 {{and the other two}} tanks with the 76.2mm PS-3 tank gun. The PS-3 tank gun was developed at the Experimental Engineering-Mechanical Department (OKMO) of the Factory No. 174 by engineer P. Syachentov. The PS-3 had better specifications in comparison with the <b>series-produced</b> KT tank gun and also had several technical innovations (foot firing switch, original training gear, travelling position fixing, binocular optical sight). The T-26-4 armed with the PS-3 tank gun was tested in October 1933 but {{it was found that the}} PS-3 was too powerful for the T-26 light tank—turret's race ring and hull roof were deformed during gun fire, and the suspension springs were damaged. It was decided to arm the T-26-4 with the 76.2mm KT tank gun only. All five experimental T-26-4 artillery tanks were tested during military exercises near Leningrad in September 1934 before scheduled series production of 50 such vehicles in 1935. But on 19 September 1934 an incident with a T-26-4 took place: a blow-back because of shell case destruction during gun fire. Despite the fact that this defect was unrelated to turret design, the military representatives cancelled the order to produce the T-26-4. Also the work to design turretless AT-1 artillery tanks armed with the powerful 76.2mm PS-3 tank gun started at that time. The T-26-4's turret construction was the design used in the <b>series-produced</b> BT-7A artillery tank.|$|E
500|$|T-26TU (TU {{stands for}} tank upravleniya or [...] "command tank"): twin-turreted version with a simplex radio station No. 7N (communication range: 10km) and a {{hand-rail}} frame antenna on the hull. The antenna lead {{was located in}} the front part of the underturret box roof between the turrets. The vehicle was intended for platoon (and higher) commanders. Three such tanks were successfully tested in September 1932 and seven more radio stations were delivered to the Factory No. 174, but it is unknown whether they were ever mounted on twin-turreted T-26 tanks. Series production of twin-turreted command radio tanks was scheduled to begin on 1 January 1933, but this did not occur because radio stations No. 7N were in short supply {{and because of the}} introduction of single-turreted T-26s with <b>series-produced</b> 71-TK-1 radio stations.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the fuel}} {{crisis of the}} 1970s, Saab-Valmet {{developed}} and <b>series-produced</b> the Saab 99 Petro that ran on kerosene, turpentine or gasoline. The project, codenamed [...] "Project Lapponia", was headed by Simo Vuorio, and {{towards the end of}} the 1970s, a working prototype was produced based on the Saab 99 GL. The car was designed to run on two fuels. Gasoline was used for cold starts and when extra power was needed, but normally it ran on kerosene or turpentine. The idea was that the gasoline could be made from peat using the Fischer–Tropsch process. Between 1980 and 1984, 3,756 Saab 99 Petros and 2,385 Talbot Horizons (a version of the Chrysler Horizon that integrated many Saab components) were made. One reason to manufacture kerosene-fueled cars was that in Finland kerosene was less heavily taxed than gasoline.|$|E
2500|$|The first unit {{equipped}} with the T-26 was the 1st Mechanized Brigade named after K.B. Kalinovsky (the Moscow Military District). Tanks delivered to the Red Army {{through the end of}} 1931 were unarmed and intended for training, and the T-26 entered active service in 1932 only. The first <b>series-produced</b> T-26 tanks were shown to the public during the military parade on Red Square in Moscow on 7 November 1931—the 14th anniversary of the October Revolution. [...] New mechanized brigades, each {{equipped with}} 178 T-26 tanks, were also organized at that time. The RKKA Staff decided to form larger tank units based on experience gained in military exercises of 1931–1932: so mechanized corps were created in the Moscow Military District, the Ukrainian Military District and the Leningrad Military District in autumn 1932. Each mechanized corps consisted of two mechanized brigades (one {{equipped with the}} T-26 and another – with the BT). From 1935, mechanized corps were only equipped with BT tanks.|$|E

5000|$|ZSU-37 was a Soviet-made, light, {{self-propelled}} {{anti-aircraft gun}} (SPAAG), {{developed by the}} end of 1943 and produced at Works No. 40 in Mytishchi. It was the first Soviet <b>series-produced</b> tracked SPAAG. ZSU stands for Zenitnaya Samokhodnaya Ustanovka (Зенитная Самоходная Установка), meaning [...] "anti-aircraft self-propelled mount".|$|E
50|$|For {{producing}} single {{pieces as}} well as small batches with the same precision and efficiency as <b>series-produced</b> parts, a spring back compensation is helpful. A bending accuracy of +/- 0.2° startingfrom the first work piece is achieved due to calculated spring back compensation and the useof electronic tools.|$|E

It was mainly for road use and lower budget club racing on short tracks (750 motor club).|$|E
5000|$|Fuel {{capacity}} {{was greatly}} reduced, {{owing to the}} elimination of the wingtip tanks. Initially it was planned to include a single UBS machine gun, but this was omitted on <b>series-produced</b> aircraft.

50|$|There existed three <b>series-produced</b> variations, differing {{mostly in}} their equipment. The first series {{utilized}} German engines and batteries, {{while the second}} was produced with domestic machinery. The third series introduced further improvements aimed mostly at lowering production cost and time, and the fourth series, albeit planned, was cancelled due {{to the beginning of}} the war.|$|E

A high-energy laser {{is focused on}} microscopic droplets of molten tin to produce a plasma, which emits EUV light. In 2009, the IMEC research center in Belgium produced the world’s first functional 22 nm CMOS SRAM memory cells with a prototype EUV lithography machine. <b>Series-produced</b> (non-prototype) EUV machines were shipped in 2011.|$|E
50|$|The Maybach Mb.IVa (written in German {{sources as}} Mb IVa, without a dot) was a six-cylinder inline, {{water-cooled}} aircraft and airship engine developed in Germany during World War I by Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH, {{a subsidiary of}} Zeppelin. It {{was one of the}} world's first <b>series-produced</b> engines designed specifically for high-altitude use. It was quite different engine design than the previous Maybach Mb.IV, not just a simple modification.|$|E
5000|$|The T-14 Armata (Т-14 «Армата»; {{industrial}} designation [...] "Ob'yekt 148") is a Russian main {{battle tank}} {{based on the}} Armata Universal Combat Platform. It is the first <b>series-produced</b> next generation tank. The Russian Army plans to acquire 2,300 T-14s in the period 2015-2020. The first batch of T-14 Armata tanks will be deployed to the Taman division after 2020, tanks will be transferred only {{after the completion of}} all state tests.|$|E
5000|$|The {{increased}} {{difficulty with}} oil consumption and cylinder-assembly lubrication was reported as never having been solved in <b>series-produced</b> engines. Railroad {{and other large}} single sleeve-valve engines emit more smoke when starting; as the engine reaches operating temperature and tolerances enter the adequate range, smoke is greatly reduced. For two-stroke engines, a three-way catalyst with air injection in the middle was proposed as best solution in a SAE Journal article around the year 2000.|$|E
50|$|The BA-27 was a Soviet first <b>series-produced</b> {{armoured}} car, manufactured from 1928 to 1931, {{and used}} for scouting and infantry support duties early in the Second World War. The BA-27 was a heavy armoured car, having the same turret and armament as the first Soviet tank, T-18, manufactured at the same time: the main gun was a modified copy of the French 37 mm Puteaux SA 18 cannon, and it was supported by an additional machine gun.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{political}} decisions, which {{were associated with}} Soviet interests, the Baade 152 program and all other aircraft programs in development at VEB Flugzeugwerke Dresden, {{which at the time}} was the entire aircraft industry of the GDR, were stopped in 1961. Except for minor remnants, the aircraft industry in the GDR was then dissolved. The Pirna 014 engines that were already <b>series-produced</b> (revisions A0 and A1) at VEB Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde (Factory 807) were put to other uses, including as emergency power generators.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{he won the}} BAFTA Factual Series Award for his epic 8 x 50’ BBC 1 {{documentary}} series The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities. He directed and <b>series-produced</b> this over three years, charting the extremes of contemporary society by focusing on a tower block within {{one of the poorest}} council estates in London which was being sold as luxury flats. The series was also nominated for a Grierson and Broadcast Award, and won the RTS Award for Factual Editing.|$|E
50|$|In the Empire style timepieces, bronze was {{the main}} {{material}} used and both the patinated and specially ormolu techniques were extensively used, reaching its zenith during this age. Indeed, the fine modeling, gilt and patina finishes used in these <b>series-produced</b> pendulum clocks are matchless. Most cases were totally cast in bronze and others combined with a stone base made of marble, alabaster or porphyry. However, wood (mahogany or fruit wood) and carved crystal (the latter used during the Restoration) were (less frequently) employed too.|$|E

50|$|The {{situation}} didn’t {{change during}} the second half of 1933; the leadership of the Army and Spetzmashtrest, the governing trust, demanded large amounts of T-37A’s to be produced at Factory No. 37, expecting to receive no more than 800 tanks. In reality, only 126 T-37A’s had been produced by 1 January 1934, two of which had built-in radios. Some of the tanks participated in a military parade on 7 November 1933 at the Red Square in Moscow. The early T-37A’s did not differ much from the later, <b>series-produced</b> tanks - the earlier ones lacked wave-diffusing shields and floats.|$|E
50|$|At the Geneva Motor Show in 2005, Škoda {{unveiled}} a concept {{car in the}} compact SUV category which it called the Yeti. Although the conceptual study of the Yeti was taken seriously {{with a view to}} the feasibility of a future <b>series-produced</b> vehicle, some of the solutions were ahead of their time and did not make it to the production stage, i.e. a single vertical windscreen wiper moving horizontally across the whole of the glass or horizontally divided hatch, the lower part of which was split into an inner and outer section so that two bicycles could safely be secured to the lowered outer section.|$|E
