25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{structured}} programming movement led to many other structured approaches applied to software design. The techniques of <b>structured</b> <b>analysis</b> and structured design are outgrowths of {{structured programming}} concepts and techniques, and of the early ideas about modular design. Principles of modularity were strengthened by Larry Constantine's concepts of coupling (to be minimized between modules) and cohesion (to be maximized within modules), by David Parnas's techniques of information hiding, and by abstract data types. A number of tools and methods employing structured concepts were developed, such as Structured Design, Jackson's Structured Programming, Ross' <b>Structured</b> <b>Analysis</b> and Design Technique (SADT), Yourdon's Structured Method, Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), and James Martin's Information Engineering. The field of software metrics is often considered as a direct influence of the structured programming movement on software engineering in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Structured</b> <b>Analysis</b> and Design Technique (SADT) is a {{software}} engineering methodology for describing systems as {{a hierarchy of}} functions, a diagrammatic notation for constructing a sketch for {{a software}} application. It offers building blocks to represent entities and activities, {{and a variety of}} arrows to relate boxes. These boxes and arrows have an associated informal semantics. SADT {{can be used as a}} functional analysis tool of a given process, using successive levels of details. The SADT method allows to define user needs for IT developments, which is used in industrial Information Systems, but also to explain and to present an activityâ€™s manufacturing processes, procedures.|$|E
40|$|The {{asymptotically}} distributed free (ADF) {{method is}} often used to estimate parameters or test models without a normal distribution assumptions on variables, both in covariance <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> and in correlation <b>structure</b> <b>analysis.</b> However, little has been done to study the differences in behaviors of the ADF method in covariance <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> and correlation <b>structure</b> <b>analysis.</b> In this thesis the behaviors of the ADF method in covariance <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> and correlation <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> were studied for three test statistics, chi-square test T AGLS and its small-sample improvements T YB and T F(AGLS). Results showed that the ADF method in correlation <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> with test statistic T AGLS performs much better at small sample sizes than the corresponding test for covariance structures. However, test statistics T YB and T F(AGLS) under the same conditions generally perform better with covariance structures than with correlation structures. Results also showed that condition numbers of weight matrices are systematically increased with substantial increase in variance as sample size decreases. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|The IDEF0 Functional Modeling {{method is}} {{designed}} to model the decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system. [...] It {{was derived from the}} established graphic modeling language <b>Structured</b> <b>Analysis</b> and Design Technique (SADT) developed by Douglas T. Ross and SofTech, Inc.. In its original form, IDEF0 includes both a definition of a graphical modeling language (syntax and semantics) and a description of a comprehensive methodology for developing models. The US Air Force commissioned the SADT developers to develop a function model method for analyzing and communicating the functional perspective of a system. IDEF0 should assist in organizing system analysis and promote effective communication between the analyst and the customer through simplified graphical devices.|$|E

40|$|Local protein <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{informative}} to protein <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> and {{has been}} used successfully in protein structure prediction and others. Proteins have recurring structural features, such as helix caps and beta turns, which often have strong amino acid sequence preferences. And the challenges for local <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> have been identification and assignment of such common short structural motifs. This paper proposes a new mathematical framework {{that can be applied}} to analysis of the local structure of proteins, where local conformations of protein backbones are described using differential geometry of folded tetrahedron sequences. Using the framework, we could capture the recurring structural features without any structural templates, which makes local <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> not only simpler, but also more objective.
