40|$|This paper {{studies the}} market {{phenomenon}} of non-convergence between futures and spot {{prices in the}} grains market. We postulate that the positive basis observed at maturity stems from the futures holder's timing options to exercise the <b>shipping</b> <b>certificate</b> delivery item and subsequently liquidate the physical grain. In our proposed approach, we incorporate stochastic spot price and storage cost, and solve an optimal double stopping problem to give the optimal strategies to exercise and liquidate the grain. Our new models for stochastic storage rates lead to explicit no-arbitrage prices for the <b>shipping</b> <b>certificate</b> and associated futures contract. We calibrate our models to empirical futures data during the periods of observed non-convergence, and illustrate the premium generated by the <b>shipping</b> <b>certificate.</b> Comment: 24 pages, Journal of Commodity Markets (forthcoming 2017...|$|E
40|$|In a well-functioning futures market, {{the futures}} price at {{expiration}} equals {{the price of}} the underlying asset. This condition failed to hold in grain markets for most of 2005 - 2010, calling into question the ability of these markets to perform their price discovery and risk management functions. During this period, futures contracts expired up to 35 % above the cash grain price. We develop a dynamic rational expectations model of commodity storage that explains how these recent convergence failures were generated by the institutional structure of the delivery system. When delivery occurs on a grain futures contract, the firm on the short side of the market provides a delivery instrument (a warehouse receipt or <b>shipping</b> <b>certificate)</b> to the firm on the long side of the market. The firm taking delivery may hold the delivery instrument indefinitely, providing it pays a daily storage rate. The futures exchange sets the maximum allowable storage rate at a fixed value. We show that non-convergence arises in equilibrium when the market price of physical grain storage exceeds the maximum storage rate on delivery instruments. We call the difference between the price of carrying physical grain and the maximum storage rate the wedge, and demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the magnitude of the non-convergence equals the expected present discounted value of a function of future wedges...|$|E

50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2009, Doulos was placed in dry dock in Singapore. Her riveted hull was {{determined}} to be still in remarkably good condition, with plate thicknesses exceeding those of modern ships. However, a survey conducted by the ship's classification society RINA found numerous significant problems and works with the ship's machinery, structure, and systems that would need to have been completed by 31 December 2009 for the <b>ship's</b> <b>certificates</b> to be reissued and the ship to continue sailing. Because the shipyard servicing the Doulos would not accept the ship for repairs until September 2010, and the cost of the work would be a total in excess of 10 million euros, and the limited ministry that Doulos would have after the repairs, it was decided to end Doulos Ministry at the end of 2009, instead of 2010 as originally planned. When the <b>ship's</b> operational <b>certificate</b> ran out on 31 December 2009, her owners made the difficult decision to replace Doulos with a more modern vessel, the Logos Hope, which was compliant with SOLAS 2010. Her books and crew were transferred to the new ship and she was offered for scrap. A caretaker crew remained with Doulos, expecting to sail her to the breakers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} {{storage in}} the presence of backwardation and the exist-ence of the Working curve for Chicago Board of Trade corn, soybeans, and wheat markets and the Kansas City Board of Trade wheat market using 1990 – 2010 data. Two spread measures—the futures-spot and futures-futures—are matched with deliverable stocks on the first Friday of delivery. To account for grade and location aggregation issues, the futures-spot spreads are measured using the lowest spot bid and highest futures price. Storage {{in the presence}} of backwardation is pervasive both in terms of the percentage of observations and the magnitude of the stockholdings. The Working curve emerges most clearly in KCBT wheat and soybeans. Convenience yield is also supported by the negligible holdings of delivery <b>shipping</b> <b>certificates</b> in backwardations. Overall, the results show that the Working curve does indeed still work today. When evaluating policy proposals to deal with heigh-tened price volatility in agricultural markets it is important that models incorporate this well-established relationship...|$|R

40|$|The Lean Concept is a mindset {{widely used}} in various {{industries}} seeking for efficiency and effectiveness through improvement of process flow and elimination of waste. This research applies lean thinking to ship safety inspection at Port of Surabaya to investigate the existing procedure and to identify the wastes and non-value-add (NVA) activity. It used a combination of literature review, examination on the data of 520 inspections that {{have been carried out}} to 201 ships {{in the last two years}} (2009 - 2011), investigation on related regulations and guidelines, observation on the actual conduct of inspection, and interview with 59 marine inspectors and ship officers. Analysis is conducted using Value Stream Mapping (VSM). It is found that the existing procedure lacks significant impact in terms of imposing a reduction in the total number of detected deficiency between the earlier and subsequent inspections. Only 37 % of the ships experience a reduction, indicating that the performance of inspection is currently at the level of 37 on a 100 -point scale. It was mainly due to severe violation of the regulations, which is demonstrated by the issuance of <b>ship</b> <b>certificate</b> regardless of corrective action undertaken relating to the detected deficiency.

5000|$|As a {{signatory}} to the STCW Convention UK {{ships are}} commanded by Deck Officers and Engineering Officers. Officers undergo 3 years of training, {{known as a}} cadetship {{at one of the}} approved maritime colleges in the United Kingdom. These include Warsash Maritime Academy, South Tyneside College, Fleetwood, Plymouth University and City of Glasgow College. Cadets usually have a choice of two academic routes; Foundation Degree or Higher National Diploma. Successful completion of this results in a qualification in marine operations or marine engineering. Generally the costs of a cadetship will be met by sponsorship from a UK shipping company. During the 3 years of training, cadets also go to sea, for a period of a year or more, usually spread across the cadetship. This affords a practical education, that along with the academic time in college prepares a candidate for a separate and final oral exam. This oral exam is carried out with a Master Mariner at an office of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Successful completion of the oral exam will result in the award of a certificate of competency. This is the international qualification, issued by the UK government which allows an Officer to work in their qualified capacity onboard a <b>ship.</b> <b>Certificates</b> are issued for different ranks and as such an Officer will usually return to complete a subsequent series of studies until they reach the highest qualification.|$|R
