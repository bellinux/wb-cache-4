40|$|Continual {{developments}} and advances in Simulation/Optimization (S/O) models {{have led to}} the development of cost-effective and improved groundwater management implementations. S/O models eliminate the excessive time consumed by trial-anderror use of simulation models to reach a “good” strategy. S/O models of groundwater studies have historically used one of two Response Matrix-based surrogate simulators (here termed ICGO 1 and ICGO 2). This research will enrich these S/O models with an innovative and efficient methodology (ICDUAH). The main difference among the different surrogate simulators is in the handling of the <b>stress</b> <b>periods</b> of stimulation and observation. ICDUAH combines the capabilities of ICGO 1 and ICGO 2 and enhances the composite. ICDUAH can employ <b>stress</b> <b>periods</b> of different durations while requiring fewer unitstimulus simulations than ICGO 2. Also, ICDUAH uses a time varying unit stimulus for each stimulus location to increase efficiency. ICDUAH groups consecutive <b>stress</b> <b>periods</b> of equal durations into a management era. Moreover, it allows users, if they wish, to set up their own management eras irrespective of the relative duration of <b>stress</b> <b>periods.</b> All <b>stress</b> <b>periods</b> of a management era must be of equal duration. Each steady-state <b>stress</b> <b>period</b> must have its own management era. A unit stimulus will be applied at the first <b>stress</b> <b>period</b> of each management era. This research compares ICGO 1, ICGO 2 and ICDUAH performance for an optimization problem that maximizes groundwater extraction from a hypothetical study area subject to constraints on state variables. The simulation model of the hypothetical study area uses 12 transient <b>stress</b> <b>periods.</b> The S/O model optimizes for two formulations that differ only in the <b>stress</b> <b>period</b> setup. Posed bounds resemble those for protecting senior surface water or groundwater rights, from proposed management actions. Cycling used in conjunction with the Response Matrix approach allows linearly solving non-linear systems with acceptable accuracy and stability. The result is a better and more efficient surrogate simulator for solving non-linear groundwater management problems. The proposed tool is an improvement over the traditional response matrix algorithm (ICGO 1) because it is capable of handling a broader spectrum of situations. The created surrogate simulator is more efficient than the ICGO 2 approach because it does not require a unit-stimulus simulation at each <b>stress</b> <b>period...</b>|$|R

40|$|A simple balance {{model was}} used to {{simulate}} soil water content during {{the development of a}} maize (Zea mays L.) crop in the area of Balcarce, Buenos Aires province (Argentina). Data were collected during a field experiment at the Unidad Integrada Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias UNMdP-EEA INTA, during the 1998 - 99 growing season. Maize plot was split into three different irrigation treatments. In all plots the soil was covered in order to prevent soil evaporation. Plants were put under water stress period at different phenologic stage. Treatments were irrigated by sprinkling method to maintain an available water level for potential growing outside the <b>stressed</b> <b>period.</b> The plots were irrigated with 217. 5 mm (R 02 R), 216. 5 mm (R 01 R) and 129. 1 mm (RR 0) of water. Soil water content was measured at 2 - 5 days interval by the gravimetric method in the 0 - 0. 1 m layer and by the neutron scattering method in layers between 0. 1 - 1. 0 m. Meteorological data were collected at the INTA Balcarce agro meteorological station, sited 300 -m away from the plots. Also, aerial biomass of plants was sampled six times during growing season on some special phenological stages. Total green leaf area of the sample was estimated from green leaf area of a subsample measured with an area meter. Field studies were conducted on a Balcarce loam (illitic thermic loam petrocalcic Paleudoll) and 130 m above sea level. Balcarce has an annual average precipitation of 910 mm. Simulation was performed from 11 / 27 / 1998 to 03 / 01 / 1999. The seedtime was 10 / 16 / 1998. The proposed balance equation is: where i is a daily time index, Cw is the soil water content in the root zone, ra is the active root depth, Cwo is the soil water content in the zone without root, P is the rainfall, Ir is the irrigation, ´ra is the variation in the root depth, Pe is percolation, EET is the real crop transpiration. Rainfall and irrigation were measured variables. Daily root growth depth was represented by a sinusoidal time function, with a maximum depth value reached at the bloom stage. Percolation was estimated as an instantaneous drainage to the passive root depth of the exceeded water whenever the water content reached field capacity. Crop transpiration was determined using a simpler two-layer model, which calculate separately the evaporation (E) and transpiration (T). The model is based on a ¡¥parallel arrangement¡¦ of resistances, between the heat fluxes from the soil surface and the heat fluxes from leaves in the canopy. The fraction of total available water that the crop can extract from the root zone necessary to obtain potential growing conditions was considered above 65 % during the sub-period V 12 -R 3, and above 50 % {{in the rest of the}} cycle. Simulation results were compared with the observed values for the total soil water content of the depth studied. The model represents adequately daily variations of soil water content at the three plots. The values for determinant coefficient and mean square error are 0. 946 and 0. 0031 for R 02 R, 0. 937 and 0. 0020 for R 01 R and 0. 985 and 0. 0013 for RR 0 of soil water content simulations [...] Pages: 759 - 76...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGiven the {{challenges}} facing African agriculture resulting from climate-induced stresses, building resilience is a priority. Seed systems are important for enhancing such resilience as seed security has direct links to food security, and resilient livelihoods in general. Using data from {{a case study in}} West Nile region in Uganda, we studied practices in farmer seed systems and decisions, particularly in response to climate-induced stress. Results helped to generate recommendations for enhancing seed system resilience. We used social-ecological framework and multinomial logit model to analyze seed systems and factors influencing farmers' decisions about seed use respectively. Farmers ranked drought as the most important climate factor affecting crop production. With over 50 % of farmer seed sourced on farm, the effect of climate factors on seed system functioning was perceived in relation to diminishing levels in quantity and quality of yield. Decline in yield affected farmer seed saving, increased grain prices due to high demand, affecting seed availability and affordability. The relative importance of seed sources varied during normal and <b>stress</b> <b>periods,</b> and by crop. Farmers tended to shift from farm-saved seed to social networks and local markets during <b>stress</b> <b>periods.</b> Local Seed Businesses emerged as an alternative source of planting material during <b>stress</b> <b>periods.</b> Formal seed enterprises were important in delivering improved seed, especially for maize, though their importance during <b>stress</b> <b>periods</b> diminished.

40|$|The {{response}} of photoprotection mechanisms to a short-term water <b>stress</b> <b>period</b> followed by rewatering, to simulate common episodic water <b>stress</b> <b>periods</b> occurring in Mediterranean areas, was studied in 10 potted plants representative of different growth forms and leaf habits. During water stress and recovery, relative water content, stomatal conductance, leaf pigment composition, electron transport rates, maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F v/Fm), thermal energy dissipation and photorespiration rates (Pr) were determined. All the species analyzed {{proved to be}} strongly resistant to photoinactivation of PSII under the imposed water stress conditions. The responses of the analyzed parameters did not differ largely among species, suggesting that Mediterranean plants have similar needs and capacity for photoprotection under episodic water <b>stress</b> <b>periods</b> regardless of their growth form and leaf habit. A general pattern of photoprotection emerged, consisting in maintenance or increase of Pr at mild stress and the increase of the thermal energy dissipation at more severe stress. Adjustments in pigment pool sizes were not an important short-term response to water stress. The increase of thermal energy dissipation because of water stress depended mostly on the de-epoxidation state of xanthophylls, although the slope and kinetics of such relationship strongly differed among species, suggesting species-dependent additional roles of de-epoxidated xanthophylls. Also, small decreases in Fv/Fm at predawn during water stress were strongly correlated with maintained de-epoxidation of the xanthophylls cycle, suggesting that a form of xanthophyll-dependent sustained photoprotection was developed during short-term water stress not only in evergreen but also in semideciduous and annual species.

40|$|ABSTRACT Effects of {{long-term}} climatic stress (heat exposure), short-term hygienic stress [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ], {{or a combination}} of both challenges on the im-mune competence of 4 layer lines was investigated. The lines were earlier characterized for natural humoral im-mune competence and survival rate. Eighty hens per line were randomly divided over 2 identical climate chambers and exposed to a constant high temperature (32 °C) or a control temperature (21 °C) for 23 d. Half of the hens housed in each chamber were i. v. injected with LPS at d 1 after the start of the heat <b>stress</b> <b>period.</b> Within each of the treatment groups, half of the hens were s. c. immu-nized with human serum albumin (HuSA) at d 2 after the start of the heat <b>stress</b> <b>period</b> to measure specific antibody (Ab) titers to HuSA. The effect of heat, LPS, or a combined challenge on specific Ab titers to HuSA, natu-ral Ab titers to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or HuSA (in hens that were not immunized with HuSA), and activit...|$|R
