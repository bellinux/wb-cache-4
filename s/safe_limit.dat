In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened.

25|$|Brazilian {{investigation}} team CENIPA {{was involved}} in the investigation and conducted a 12-month-long investigation into the crash. The final report was released on 19 March 2007, concluding that the crash was categorized as Controlled Flight Into Terrain and was caused by pilot error. The condition of the weather in the area at the time was bad, and it was impossible to make a VFR flight, according to CENIPA. However, the crew of Flight 6865 intentionally changed from IFR to VFR while the visibility was limited. Before the flight, the crew didn't know the weather ahead of them. CENIPA also blamed the crew's poor decision-making, stating that there was inadequate assessment which caused them to fly at a lower altitude than a <b>safe</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|E

25|$|Nociception (physiological pain) signals nerve-damage {{or damage}} to tissue. The {{three types of}} pain receptors are {{cutaneous}} (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research {{in the first half}} of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the brain. The main function of pain is to attract our attention to dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a <b>safe</b> <b>limit</b> because it is dangerous, and thus hurts. Without pain, people could do many dangerous things without being aware of the dangers.|$|E
25|$|Pollution is a {{major concern}} in Patna. According to the CAG report, tabled in the Bihar Legislative Assembly in April 2015, respirable {{suspended}} particulate matter (RSPM) level (PM-10) in Patna was 355, three-and-a-half times higher than the prescribed limit of 100 micro-gram per cubic metre, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions and construction activities in the city. In May 2014, a World Health Organization survey declared Patna the second most air polluted city in India, only after Delhi, with the survey calculating the airborne particulate matter in the state capital's ambient air (PM-2.5) to be 149 micro-grams, six times more than the <b>safe</b> <b>limit,</b> which is 25 micro-grams. Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer, asthma, dysentery and diarrhoea. The dense smog in Patna during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{degree to}} which seed {{predation}} influences plant populations may vary by whether a plant species is <b>safe</b> site <b>limited</b> or seed limited. If a population is <b>safe</b> site <b>limited</b> {{it is likely that}} seed predation will have little impact {{to the success of the}} population. In <b>safe</b> site <b>limited</b> populations increased seed abundance does not translate into increased seedling recruitment. However, if a population is seed limited, seed predation has a better chance of negatively affecting the plant population by decreasing seedling recruitment. Maron and Simms found both <b>safe</b> site <b>limited</b> and seed limited populations depending on the habitat in which the seed predation was taking place. In dune habitats seed predators (deer mice) were limiting seedling recruitment in the population, thus negatively affecting the population. However, in grassland habitat the seed predator had little effect on the plant population because it was <b>safe</b> site <b>limited.</b>|$|R
