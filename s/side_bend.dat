40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the kinematics of the premanipulative position, the angular displacement, and velocity of thrust of 2 commonly used cervical spine manipulative procedures using inertial sensor technology. Methods Thirteen asymptomatic subjects (7 females; mean age, 25. 3 years; mean height, 170. 9 cm; mean weight, 65. 3 kg) received a right-handed and left-handed downslope and upslope manipulation, aimed at C 4 / 5 while cervical kinematics were measured using an inertial sensor mounted on the forehead of the subject. One therapist used the upslope, and another therapist, the downslope, as was their preferred method t tests were used to compare techniques and handiness. Results The results demonstrated differences in the kinematics between the 2 techniques. The downslope manipulation was associated with a mean premanipulative position of 24. 8 ° <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> and 2. 7 ° rotation, thrust displacement magnitude comprising of 4. 5 ° <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> and 5. 4 ° rotation with thrust velocity comprising, on average, of 57. 5 °/s <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> and 74. 8 °/s rotation. Upslope premanipulation was on average comprised of 30. 1 ° <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> and 8. 4 ° rotation, thrust displacement comprised of 4. 5 ° <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> and 12. 7 ° rotation with thrust velocity comprising of 75. 9 °/s <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> and 194. 7 °/s rotation.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{questioned}} whether postural sway increase in {{low back pain}} subjects was related to impaired spine mobility, and especially to {{a decrease in the}} range of motion, which was assumed to represent structural spine stiffness. Ten low back pain subjects and ten healthy control subjects performed spine flexion-extension and spine <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> tests, and standing posturographic examination in different experimental conditions. Low back pain subjects showed increased postural sway along the antero-posterior axis and reduced <b>side</b> <b>bending,</b> i. e. posturographic and range of motion parameters varied in the opposite direction. Moreover, no correlation was found between these two types of parameters. Although significant, the slight decrease in spine <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> did not seem sufficiently great to disturb the low amplitude movements that maintain postural equilibrium. Hence, it was concluded that postural sway increase in low back pain is not related to a reduced spine range of motion, but might be linked to an increase in muscular active tension, which reduces dynamic mobility capacity...|$|R

40|$|Underlying {{this thesis}} is the McKenzie school of thought, a {{physiotherapy}} approach that teaches clinicians to recommend particular exercises {{to their clients}} {{in an attempt to}} accelerate recovery/ prevent recurrence of disc prolapse. The recommendations are based on an untested clinical theory that movements opposite to those that cause disc prolapse can achieve reversal of disc prolapse. Little consideration has been given scientifically to the reversal of the failure process of the lumbar discs. Three in vitro and one in vivo study were designed to attain a greater understanding of both disc failure and the mechanics of its clinical treatment responses and thereby provide a foundation for evidence-based practice. The first in vitro study in this thesis compared in vitro and in vivo herniated discs in an attempt to link the two and provide a more thorough understanding of the in vitro model proposed to test the mechanical theory underlying the McKenzie derangement approach. Ten C 3 / 4 osteoligamentus porcine specimens were repeatedly flexed or flexed and side bent to result in posterior migration of the nucleus. Three of the 10 specimens had posterior migration of the nucleus. Statistically significant (p 33 %) disc height loss occurred in all 10 specimens. The results provide a sub-classification of in vitro herniated discs that is similar to the spectrum of herniated discs that occurs in vivo. Continuing from the disc height loss sub-classification of post-herniated in vitro discs, the second in vitro study in this thesis pursues alternate methods of creating herniation with the goal of creating herniation without causing more than thirty three percent disc height loss of the specimens. Repeated flexion of porcine cervical specimens under a lower compression level (1 kN) resulted in disc herniation but with loss of 50 % of the pre-test disc height (p < 0. 001). Re-hydrating specimens by injecting the disc after a period of failure testing with a barium sulphate nucleus mix (n = 5) or by placing the specimen in a saline bath {{for an extended period of}} time (n = 4) resulted in a significant increase of the disc height of the specimens. Further flexion testing of the specimens significantly reduced the disc height again. Intermittent saline injection of specimens (n = 3) during the failure procedure did not prevent or reduce the disc height loss that occurred in the absence of saline injections. Using higher compression levels (2 and 2. 596 kN, n = 4), failure testing under torque control (n = 3), non-physiologically starting the annular rupture (n = 5) and using hypolordotic thoracic porcine spines (n = 9) instead of porcine cervical spines were unsuccessful attempts at creating herniations. This study indicated that the in vitro model used in the first in vitro study displayed features from one end of the spectrum of damage seen clinically but was then the best-available. Combined these two studies provide a framework for interpretation of the results of the subsequent and third in vitro study in this thesis. The focus of the third study is the mechanical investigation of the McKenzie clinical theory of the treatment response seen in vivo in prolapsed discs, which is that movements or positioning can alter the location of a displaced portion of nucleus in a prolapsed disc. This study is a proof of the principle on which this aspect of the McKenzie approach is based and provides, to the author’s knowledge, the first scientific evidence supporting the theory that repeating movements opposite to those that caused posterior migration of the nucleus can centralize the prolapsed material. The results indicate that the McKenzie approach works on some prolapsed discs and not on others. Consideration of the changes in disc height of the specimens during the testing procedures offers some understanding of the varied success of this approach and exposes a vast area of future research that will refine the clinical approach and mechanical understanding of this specific disc pathology. The fourth study, an in vivo study, provides a first look at the kinematics and kinetics of the current in vivo application of this approach. Twenty asymptomatic subjects volunteered to participate in this study and performed frequently prescribed McKenzie exercises and a selection of activities of daily living during which a 3 -SPACE Isotrak system measured their three dimensional lumbar kinemetics. One subject underwent a series of McKenzie exercises while electromyography and three-dimensional lumbar motion were measured. Mean peak extension of extension in standing and extension in lying exercises were within 3 % (SD 22. 33 %) of each other. An additional 6. 75 % (SD 11. 18 %) of extension occurred when the extension in lying exercise was combined with a Grade 3 Maitland extension mobilization to L 3, a passive physiotherapy technique that involves the therapist applying intermittent low amplitude oscillations to, in this case, the posterior aspect of the spinous process with the goal of subsequently increasing the range of active motion in the direction of the mobilization. The peak extension during the extension in lying exercise was increased after the mobilization relative to the pre-mobilization range. The mean peak right <b>side</b> <b>bend</b> in the right side glide exercise, normalized to the full right <b>side</b> <b>bend</b> range, was 61 % (SD 17. 4 %). The L 4 - 5 forces at the position of peak extension in extension in lying and extension in standing were 828. 97 N and 1368. 86 N respectively. The peak flexion ranges of the activities of daily living investigated match those previously used to create disc prolapse when applied at high repetitions and under moderate axial compression. The lumbar spine ranges achieved in commonly prescribed McKenzie rehabilitative and preventative exercises and those that occur in seemingly non-problematic activities of daily living were quantified. The results of this study will enhance clinical practice by providing quantitative evidence of the relative peak motion of the McKenzie exercises as well as highlighting seemingly benign activities of daily living that involve levels of flexion, <b>side</b> <b>bend</b> and rotation sufficient to cause disc damage and even prolapse. 	 	The macroscopic goal of this thesis was to attain a greater understanding of the mechanics of both disc failure and its clinical treatment responses and thereby provide a foundation for evidence-based practice, a goal that was successfully achieved. This thesis ultimately challenged and increased our understanding of pathological discs while simultaneously adding information to assist clinical decision making. Several new contributions to the existing knowledge of lumbar spine biomechanics and clinical concepts of treating disc prolapse have been made...|$|E
40|$|Background Cervical Spinal Manipulation (CSM) is {{considered}} a high-level skill of {{the central nervous system}} because it requires bimanual coordinated rhythmical movements therefore necessitating training to achieve proficiency. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of real-time feedback on the performance of CSM. Methods Six postgraduate physiotherapy students attending a training workshop on Cervical Spine Manipulation Technique (CSMT) using inertial sensor derived real-time feedback participated in this study. The key variables were pre-manipulative position, angular displacement of the thrust and angular velocity of the thrust. Differences between variables before and after training were investigated using t-tests. Results There were no significant differences after training for the pre-manipulative position (rotation p[*]=[*] 0. 549; <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> p[*]=[*] 0. 312) or for thrust displacement (rotation p[*]=[*] 0. 247; <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> p[*]=[*] 0. 314).

Design: A randomized, single-blind parallel group study was developed. The sample (n = 59) was divided into GI, treated with manual therapy, and GII, treated with myofascial release therapy. Variables studied were intensity of neck pain, cervical disability, quality of life, craniovertebral angle, and ranges of cervical motion. Results: At five sessions, clinical significance was observed in both groups for all the variables studied, except for flexion in GI. At this time point, an intergroup statistical difference was observed, which showed that GII had better craniovertebral angle (P = 0. 014), flexion (P = 0. 021), extension (P = 0. 003), right <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> (P = 0. 001), and right rotation (P = 0. 031).

During tensile tests, {{the strength of the}} osteofixation system was monitored. The stiffness was calculated for the tensile, <b>side</b> <b>bending,</b> and torsion tests. Results: The 2 titanium systems (1. 5 mm and 2. 0 mm) presented significantly higher tensile strength and stiffness compared with the 7 biodegradable systems (2. 0 mm, 2. 1 mm, and 2. 5 mm). The 2. 0 mm titanium system showed significantly higher <b>side</b> <b>bending</b> and torsion stiffness than the other 8 systems.

The three types of heat treatments were alternatively without pre-heat and post-heat, with pre-heat only, and finally with pre-heat and post-heat. Tensile, <b>side</b> <b>bends</b> and impact tests (for weld zone and HAZ) have been conducted. Results show that using low-carbon filler wire along with pre- and post-heat resulted in outstanding mechanical properties...|$|R

This study examined the efficacy of physical therapy intervention for twenty subjects with temporomandibular dysfunction. Outcome measures consisted of upper trapezius strength, cervical range of motion (<b>side</b> <b>bending),</b> mandibular range of motion (protrusion, lateral deviation, and opening), subjective pain rating, disability index, and perceived improvement. Initial measurements and progress 2 ̆ 7 checks were recorded and the results, as determined through the analysis of variance, showed significant (p 3 ̆c. 05) improvement in all outcome measurements except right and. left lateral deviation. The results indicated that physical therapy intervention in temporomandibular dysfunction was efficacious...|$|R

He had galloped like the rest wildly along, with his face buried in his poncho, and saw nothing-- save once or twice, when, raising his head slightly and opening one eye, he saw, or fancied he saw, the Gauchos, like dark phantoms, flying before him, and Quashy at his <b>side,</b> <b>bending</b> flat on his horse's neck. The stout negro seemed to care nothing for his body so long as his face was safe, for he had let his poncho go, and as it was fastened only at the neck, it flapped wildly above his head.|$|R
