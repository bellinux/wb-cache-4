In order to prevent various security attacks, these messages must be protected. In the current standard, the control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> between a HA and a MN are authenticated using IPSec, often with IKEv 2 and X. 509 certificates. Control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> between a MN and a CN are currently protected by an effective but insecure protocol, known as Return Routability. Using IBE (Identity-Based Encryption) for authenticating control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> requires more processing power but significant security enhancements are achieved. The current protocols for protecting control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> are outlined in this paper. Pro-posed approaches for implementing IBE-authentication between a MN and a HA as well as be-tween a MN and a CN are presented. Environments where the MN and the CN use the same Pub-lic Key Generator (PKG) as well as environments where they use different PKGs are taken into account.

40|$|Abstract—Smart grid (SG) {{communication}} {{has recently}} received significant attentions to facilitate intelligent and distributed {{electric power transmission}} systems. However, communication trust and security issues still present practical concerns to the deployment of SG. In this paper, to cope with these challenging concerns, we propose a lightweight message authentication scheme features as a basic yet crucial component for secure SG communication framework. Specifically, in the proposed scheme, the smart meters which are distributed at different hierarchical networks of the SG can first achieve mutual authentication and establish the shared session key with Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol. Then, with the shared session key between smart meters and hash-based authentication code technique, the subsequent messages can be authenticated in a lightweight way. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can satisfy the desirable security requirements of SG communications. In addition, extensive simulations have also been conducted to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed scheme in terms of low latency and few <b>signal</b> <b>message</b> exchanges.

40|$|Abstract. For {{extending}} of hot-spot {{of wireless}} LAN (WLAN), [1] proposes in-ternetworking scheme between WLAN and mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), which employ the same layer- 2 protocol with different mode. Compared to in-ternetworking schemes between UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems) and WLAN [3 - 4], the scheme from [1] has relatively low overhead and latencies because WLAN and MANET are physically and logically similar to each other. However, the mode switching algorithm proposed in [1] for internetworking only considers signal strength and determines handoff, and mobile nodes following a zigzag course in pollution area may frequently per-form handoff at short intervals. Furthermore, [1] employs mobile IPv 6 (MIPv 6) at base, which brings still high delay on handoff and overhead due to <b>signal</b> <b>message</b> exchange. In this paper, we present optimized internetworking scheme between WLAN and MANET, modified from [1]. To settle ping-pong handoff, we propose adaptive mode switching algorithm. HMIPv 6 is employed for IP connectivity and mobility service in WLAN, which solves some shortcomings, {{such as high}} handoff overhead and vulnerable security from MIPv 6. For routing in MANET, OLSR is employed, which operates with current IP protocol com-patibly with no change or modification. The proposed internetworking scheme based on adaptive mode switching algorithm shows better performance than scheme from [1]. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract - The {{advancement}} of technologies {{has made it}} possible to produce tiny wireless sensor devices. These sensors are group together so that their coverage can be maximized. In this paper, we propose the various techniques like closest point approach (CPA), clustering, aggregation. Various sensor nodes are distributed around center point. Each sensor nodes give information <b>signal</b> <b>message</b> to center point node. In CPA technique, each sensor node has different signal strength. We investigate signal strength of each sensor node at different radius distance. In clustering technique, we add many cluster wireless sensor network to main wireless sensor network. Since this allows for more than one cluster to track the same region the system reliability is greatly improved. We investigate signal strength when we add new cluster of wireless sensor network. In aggregation technique, we are increase or decrease the numbers of sensor node. Then we investigate signal strength, when we increase or decrease the no. nodes. We make various type models of wireless sensor network for the closest point approach, clustering and aggregation techniques. Using these structures of wireless sensor networks, we investigate the view results, comparison of various networks, simulation of sensor network, delay of signal strength, traffic, memory usage etc. We compare the result of various graph of various shape model of wireless sensor network. </p...|$|E
40|$|For MIPv 6, once an MN {{changes its}} location, it sends binding update {{messages}} to its HA {{which results in}} significant overhead of the <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> if the handoff frequency increases. HMIPv 6, therefore, was proposed to reduce the <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> and handoff latency by using MAP. However, when {{a large number of}} MNs move in the same MAP domain, the limited capacity and resource of MAP will become the bottleneck of the transmission. This will increase the blocking probability of MNs or even cause the crash of MAP. In this paper, we propose an HMIPv 6 -based distributed architecture with integrated resource allocation mechanism to release the bottleneck problem and reduce the <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> overhead...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes {{the design}} and {{construction}} of fire alarm system which is controlled by 80 C 31 microcontroller. Computer is used to indicate situations of {{the system composed of}} 4 modes of working state, regular working mode, short circuit mode, open circuit of wiring signal mode, and fire mode. Graphic output states are displayed on personal computer, PC, by using software delphi, interfacing with microcontroller. Input signal coming from the normally opened warning devices such as heat detector, smoke detector and master key is sent into a detectable instrument to separate the mode of working state. After that, output signal is despatched to 80 C 31 microcontroller for analysis. This microcontroller can transfer data and display the situation of detector in 6 zone. Thus, the calculated all output data is exposed on PC. In case of fire mode, the data will be sent to PC and to bell simultaneously. Delay time of <b>signal</b> <b>message</b> can be changed directly and easily by PC. In addition, all information including mode of state, date and time are recorded to be database for further analysis that is benefit for the development of fire alarm system to possess both more efficiency and more accuracy. Comparing this controller with another conventional controller in the same specifications, the controller is used and installed easier because of working with no specific fire alarm devices, as well function of working mode and retardation are changed more comfortable because of program computer. Moreover, total price of this fire alarm system unit is significantly cheaper. ...|$|E
