25|$|The main deity in the Mexica {{religion}} was the sun god and war god, Huitzilopochtli. He directed the Mexicas {{to found a}} city on the site where they would see an eagle, devouring (not all chronicles agree on what the eagle was devouring, one <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> precious bird, and though Father Duran <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> snake, this is not mentioned in any pre-Hispanic source) perched on a fruit bearing nopal cactus. According to legend, Huitzilopochtli had to kill his nephew, Cópil, and throw his heart on the lake. But, since Cópil was his relative, Huitzilopochtli decided to honor him, and caused cactus to grow over Cópil's heart which became a sacred place.|$|E
25|$|On January 12, 1985, Chen {{was sentenced}} {{to a year in}} prison for libel {{as a result of his}} editorship of Neo-Formosa, {{following}} the publication of an article critical of Elmer Fung, a college philosophy professor. While appealing the sentence, he returned to Tainan to run for county magistrate in November 1985. Three days after losing the election, his wife, Wu Shu-chen was hit twice by a hand tractor driven by Chang Jong-tsai as Chen and Wu were thanking their supporters. She was left paralyzed from the waist down. His supporters believed this was part of a government campaign to intimidate him, although another theory <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> simple traffic accident.|$|E

25|$|Foreskin relics began {{appearing}} in Europe during the Middle Ages. The earliest recorded sighting came on December 25, 800, when Charlemagne {{gave it to}} Pope Leo III when the latter crowned the former Emperor. Charlemagne claimed {{that it had been}} brought to him by an angel while he prayed at the Holy Sepulchre, although a more prosaic report <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> wedding gift from the Byzantine Empress Irene. Its authenticity was later considered to be confirmed by a vision of Saint Bridget of Sweden, who conrimed tht it was somewhere in Rome. The Descriptio laternansis Ecclesia, written shortly before 1100 indicated that a cypress chest commissioned by Leo III and placed under the altar in the Chapel of St. Lawrence held three caskets. One of the caskets contained a gold jeweled cross. The document stated that in this cross was the foreskin and umbilicus of Jesus.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Naomi sold a {{valuable}} painting to Paul {{in order to}} pay off her debts. However, the painting was given to her by Charles Tranner (David Whiteley), the married man she had an affair with, and his wife, Polly (Michelle O'Grady), soon turned up to reclaim the artwork. O'Reilly explained that as Charles was away on business, there was definite answer as to who the painting belonged to. She continued, [...] "Naomi <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> gift, and belongs to her – but Polly argues that Charles used family money to buy it, so she is the owner." [...] Polly and Naomi later ended up in a scrag fight, which had to be broken up the police. O'Reilly enjoyed filming the fight, saying she had [...] "a great time". The police eventually confiscated the painting and Paul demanded his money back. When Naomi was unable to pay him back, Paul asked her to spend the night with him and he would forget the debt. O'Reilly said while Naomi was not amused, part of her admired Paul's tenacity.|$|E

2500|$|... "La Planchada" [...] is Spanish for [...] "the ironed lady". Contrary to {{what people}} may assume because of the legend's title, La Planchada was not {{a woman who was}} crushed, rather it is similar to La Llorona. Legend <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> nurse who was {{attracted}} to a doctor and he rejected her, or a disgruntled nurse, or a nurse who killed her patient. Many variations of how she was created exist, but one consistent theme is that her ghost appears in many hospitals, though mainly in the metropolitan areas, especially in Mexico City.|$|E

[...] Some Aztecs set out in canoes, others by road to Nonchualco then Tlacopan to cut the Spanish off. [...] The Aztecs attacked the fleeing Spanish on the Tlacopan causeway from canoes, shooting arrows at them. The Spanish fired their crossbows and arquebuses, but were unable to see their attackers or get into formation. [...] Many Spaniards leaped {{into the water and}} drowned, weighed down by armor and booty.|$|E
2500|$|For the French Canadians, {{the chief}} debate among historians {{involves}} the conquest and the {{incorporation into the}} British Empire in 1763. One school <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> disaster that retarded for a century and more the normal development of a middle class society, leaving Quebec locked into a traditionalism controlled by priests and landlords. The other more optimistic school says it was generally advantageous in political and economic terms. For example, it enabled Quebec to avoid the French Revolution that tore France apart in the 1790s. [...] Another example is that it integrated the economy into the larger and faster growing British economy, {{as opposed to the}} sluggish French economy. [...] The optimistic school attributes the backwardness of the Quebec economy to deeply ingrained conservatism and aversion to entrepreneurship.|$|E
