25|$|Despite this, the Aura {{has a few}} criticisms. The Aura's {{interior}} {{has been}} criticized for using cheap materials. Also, the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> has <b>been</b> criticized for being too big for some drivers and that rear headroom was tight when equipped with the optional sunroof. The Aura was also criticized for being noisy over bumps and its lack of a rear armrest and head restraint, and that the push button controls on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> cannot <b>be</b> <b>operated</b> while holding the wheel. Robert Cumberford of Autombile magazine claimed that the Aura is a good car watered down by GM's cost cutting department.|$|R
5000|$|The PlasmaCar is {{a plastic}} ride-on toy car {{designed}} for children, (can be adapted for adults see below), made popular by Canadian toy distributor PlaSmart. The PlasmaCar can be propelled by wiggling the front <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> which <b>is</b> attached to two pivoting wheels touching the ground. It harnesses the natural forces of inertia, centrifugal force, gravity, and friction {{in order to}} drive the car forward and backward. It {{does not require a}} power source such as batteries, fuel, pedals, or gears - it simply runs on the child's ability to wiggle the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> It can <b>be</b> <b>operated</b> indoors and/or outdoors, though it works best on a smooth, flat surface.|$|R
50|$|Prior to Nintendo's own Wii <b>Wheel,</b> several {{third-party}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories had <b>been</b> introduced for the Wii Remote. One {{released by}} Ubisoft, the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel,</b> <b>was</b> developed by Thrustmaster. It is bundled with certain games, such as Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT Pro Series. The accessory, {{which is only}} for aesthetic/ergonomic enhancement, is meant for driving-style gameplay in which the Wii Remote would be held lengthwise in a two-handed gamepad orientation, steering the subject by tilting the controller. The Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>is</b> also sold separately. Since the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>was</b> revealed, other similarly designed <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories have <b>been</b> produced, including the Wii Racing Wheel by Intec.|$|R

50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> therefore harder to turn.|$|R

5000|$|Variable-ratio {{steering}} is {{a system}} that uses different ratios on the rack in a rack and pinion steering system. At the center of the rack, the space between the teeth are smaller and the space becomes larger as the pinion moves down the rack. In the middle of the rack there is a higher ratio and the ratio becomes lower as the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> turned towards lock. This makes the steering less sensitive when the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> close to its center position and makes it harder for the driver to oversteer at high speeds. As the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> turned towards lock, the wheels begin to react more to steering input ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFailure of {{a cracked}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> studied in this paper. <b>Steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{mounted on a}} speed boat, had cracks emanating {{from one of the}} {{fastener}} holes until final fracture occurred. Failure analysis, combining experimental and numerical techniques, was performed. Experimentally, fasteners torque moments were measured, visual inspection performed and material type determined (aluminum alloy AA 6061). Additionally, scanning electron microscopy examination was employed to characterize the microstructure of the fractured surface. Using finite element analysis, stress analysis of a cracked <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> conducted. Stress intensities of uncracked and cracked <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>were</b> compared to find out about stress concentration points. Possible causes of crack occurrence include excessive fastener torque moment, fretting between fastener and hole combined with poor machining that left marks that serve as potential crack initiation points. Obtained results are valuable for predicting fracture behavior of the cracked <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and can <b>be</b> taken as a reference for design and exploitation process of such component...|$|R

50|$|<b>Steering</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> used in {{most modern}} land vehicles, {{including}} all mass-production automobiles, {{as well as}} buses, light and heavy trucks, and tractors. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> {{the part of the}} steering system that is manipulated by the driver; the rest of the steering system responds to such driver inputs. This can be through direct mechanical contact as in recirculating ball or rack and pinion steering gears, without or with the assistance of hydraulic power steering, HPS, or as in some modern production cars with the assistance of computer-controlled motors, known as Electric Power Steering.|$|R
