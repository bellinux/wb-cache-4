5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Working with physicist Alvin Weinberg, Way analyzed {{neutron flux}} data from Enrico Fermi's early nuclear reactor designs to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> would be possible to create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. These calculations were put to use in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Afterwards, she examined the problem of nuclear poisoning of reactors by certain fission products. With physicist Eugene Wigner she developed the Way-Wigner approximation for fission product decay.|$|E

25|$|Experiments on twin {{children}} in concentration camps {{were created to}} show {{the similarities and differences}} in the genetics of twins, as well as to see if the human body can be unnaturally manipulated. The central leader of the experiments was Josef Mengele, who from 1943 to 1944 performed experiments on nearly 1,500 sets of imprisoned twins at Auschwitz. About 200 people survived these studies. The twins were arranged by age and sex and kept in barracks between experiments, which ranged from injection of different dyes into the eyes of twins to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> would change their color to sewing twins together in attempts to create conjoined twins.|$|E

25|$|In 1787, Bligh took {{command of}} Bounty. In {{order to win}} a premium offered by the Royal Society, he first sailed to Tahiti to obtain breadfruit trees, then set course for the Caribbean, where breadfruit was wanted for {{experiments}} to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> would be a successful food crop for slaves there. The notion that breadfruit had to be collected from Tahiti was intentionally misleading. Tahiti was merely one of many places where esteemed seedless breadfruit could be found.

Eid said Gartrell never made any threatening statements about killing Obama, and Johnson could not be considered a credible witness because he was under the influence of drugs when he made accusations against Gartrell and Adolf. Blanchard's attorney, Lawrence Hewitt, said he planned to research the Colorado cases to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> would have any bearing on his client's case. In a letter responding to criticism about not pursuing federal charges against Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson, Eid wrote, “It would have been disgraceful for me or any other prosecutor to charge someone for a crime he didn’t commit. ... There was no probable cause to support such a charge. To the extent you challenge my motives or those of the many investigating agents and career prosecutors who all reached this conclusion in this matter, you’re mistaken.” ...|$|E

500|$|Comic book {{historian}} Peter Sanderson {{criticized the}} story for using a supernatural element to retcon the marriage and not maturely dealing {{with the issue of}} divorce, arguing the writers had forgotten stories where Spider-Man dealt with his causing the death of Uncle Ben, drugs and child abuse. He wrote, [...] "I expect {{there are people who are}} professional comics writers and editors, and people who will someday become professional comics writers and editors, who are outraged that Marvel had Spider-Man make a deal with the devil.

[...] He found the story better than the Clone Saga in the respect that it altered an aspect of canon, instead of erasing it entirely. He also criticized the idea of a hero making a deal with one as evil as Mephisto, effectively the devil.|$|E

Travolta and Krane also signed the cinematographer and most of the principal actors. Corey Mandell, a screenwriter who had previously worked with Ridley Scott on Blade Runner, signed on to write the script for the film, which had previously gone through 10 revisions. Mandell stated in an interview, [...] "I am not a Scientologist… I came on board because John asked me to read the book and said, 'It's not a religious book. It's a science-fiction story.

500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E

2500|$|Scalia {{argued that}} {{a better way to}} {{determine}} whether a prior conviction qualified as a [...] "crime of violence" [...] under the residual provision would be to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> posed at least as much risk of injury as the enumerated crime that posed the least such risk.

[...] In Taylor the Court ruled that [...] "burglary" [...] in the ACCA's definition of [...] "violent felony" [...] had a generic meaningunlawful or unprivileged entry into or remaining in a building or structure with the intent to commit a crime. [...] Scalia posited a generic definition of extortion: [...] obtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force.
