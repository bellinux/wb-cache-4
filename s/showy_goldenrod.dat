2500|$|The North Pond Nature Sanctuary (...) , {{located between}} Fullerton, Diversey, Stockton and Cannon, is a ten-acre pond {{that has become}} an {{important}} wildlife area. Historically the site was a dune, then a dumping ground, and an ornamental pond; it was converted in 1999-2000 into a natural area with a littoral zone that greatly improved the water quality by re-establishing native Midwestern ecology. The upland restoration of prairie, savanna, and woodland plants has included only top quality native species such as little bluestem, sky-blue aster, nodding wild onion, side-oats grama, butterfly weed, purple prairie clover, rough blazing star, wild quinine, prairie phlox, coneflowers, false dragonhead, northern prairie dropseed, <b>showy</b> <b>goldenrod,</b> rattlesnake master, shooting star, and wild bergamot. The North Pond Nature Sanctuary is notable as the site where Mayor Richard M. Daley and the US Fish and Wildlife Service signed an Urban Conservation Treaty for Migratory Birds in April 2004, making the city eligible for federal funds to restore habitat for the lakefront migratory pathway for birds.|$|E

50|$|Solidago erecta is {{a species}} of {{goldenrod}} known by the common names <b>showy</b> <b>goldenrod</b> and slender goldenrod. It is native to the eastern United States, from Massachusetts west to Indiana, and south as far as Georgia and Mississippi.|$|E
50|$|There is much {{confusion}} {{about the role of}} flowers in allergies. For example, the <b>showy</b> and entomophilous <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago) is frequently blamed for respiratory allergies, of which it is innocent, since its pollen cannot be airborne. Instead the allergen is usually the pollen of the contemporary bloom of anemophilous ragweed (Ambrosia), which can drift for many kilometers.|$|R
50|$|Solidago spectabilis is {{a species}} of {{goldenrod}} known by the common names Nevada goldenrod, basin goldenrod, and <b>showy</b> <b>goldenrod.</b> It is native to the western United States in the Great Basin and surrounding areas. It is found in California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah. There are historical records saying it once grew in southwestern Idaho, but is now extirpated there.|$|E
50|$|Solidago speciosa, the <b>showy</b> <b>goldenrod,</b> is a North American {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} sunflower family. It grows {{in the province of}} Ontario in central Canada, {{as well as in the}} eastern and central United States (from the Atlantic coast west as far as the Great Plains, so from Maine to Georgia (except Delaware) west as far as Texas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas).|$|E
50|$|Dower's Prairie is a 14-acre native prairie remnant {{located in}} {{southwest}} Wisconsin, United States. Originally a dairy cow pasture, {{it was originally}} discovered to be home to an abundance of rare plant species by a man hunting {{in the area in}} 1989. After being fenced off from cattle, the parcel of land owned by dairy farmer Steve Dower has grown and diversified with over 150 different species.Notable plant species include Prairie Bushclover (federally threatened), Rattlesnake master, Blazing Star, Compass Plant, <b>Showy</b> <b>Goldenrod,</b> Coneflower, Big Bluestem, Little Bluestem, Indian Grass, Side Oates, Pale Purple Coneflower, and Aster.|$|E
50|$|This plant grows {{only in the}} tallgrass prairie, {{mainly in}} dry areas. The soils may be gravelly, sandy, and/or calcareous, and are {{generally}} well-drained. Other plants in the area include big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), yellow Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis), porcupine grass (Stipa spartea), Penn sedge (Carex pennsylvanica), copper-shouldered sedge (Carex bicknellii), sand-bracted sedge (Carex muhlenbergii), flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), prairie phlox (Phlox pilosa), lead plant (Amorpha canescens), rough blazing star (Liatris aspera), purple prairie clover (Dalea purpurea), <b>showy</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago speciosa), grass-leaved goldenrod (S. graminifolia), prairie gentian (Gentiana puberulenta), hoary puccoon (Lithospermum canescens), blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium albidum), cream wild indigo (Baptisia leucophaea), flax-leaved aster (Ionactis linariifolius), silky aster (Symphyotrichum sericeum), pale prairie coneflower (Echinacea pallida), milkwort (Polygona polygama), prairie violet (Viola pedatifida), and bird's foot violet (Viola pedata). It can be found alongside its relative, Lespedeza capitata, {{and it has been}} known to hybridize with it, though this is rare.|$|E

40|$|Twenty seven {{perennial}} species {{native to}} the Eastern Temperate Forests Level I Ecoregion were exposed to an acute ozone (O 3) treatment consisting of a target peak O 3 concentration of 2. 0 ppm for 30 minutes in a closed chamber environment, {{during the summer of}} 2010. Plants were evaluated for visible foliar injury symptoms and symptoms were described and photographically documented. Ten of the 27 species developed visible foliar injury in which interspecific and intraspecific response to O 3 was observed. A severity index was used to compare response to acute ozone exposure for the ten species displaying visible foliar injury. Species showing visible foliar injury in descending order of severity index were Coreopsis tripteris L. (tall tickseed), Coreopsis palmata Nutt. (stiff tickseed), Penstemon cobaea Nutt. (cobaea beardtongue), Solidago nemoralis Aiton (gray goldenrod), Monarda fistulosa L. (wild bergamot), Silphium integrifolium Michx (wholeleaf rosinweed), Oligoneuron rigidum (L.) Small var. rigidum (stiff goldenrod), Rudbeckia missouriensis Engelm. ex C. L. Boynt. (Missouri orange coneflower), Penstemon pallidus Small (pale beardtongue), and Solidago speciosa Nutt. (<b>showy</b> <b>goldenrod).</b> A range of symptoms was observed including red to purple stipple and tan to yellow or brown flecking; bronzing, leaf margin necrosis, and bifacial necrotic lesions. Subsequently, in June of 2011, four native Coreopsis species (C. lanceolata, C. palmata, C. tinctoria, and C. tripteris), were exposed to four acute ozone (O 3) treatment levels with target peak O 3 concentrations of 1. 2, 1. 7, 2. 2, and 2. 7 ppm, for 30 minutes in a closed chamber environment. Severity index was used as the criterion for comparing ozone susceptibilities among species. All four species showed foliar injury symptoms following the highest target peak exposure level (2. 7 ppm). Two of the four species (Coreopsis palmata and C. tripteris) exhibited foliar injury symptoms at the lowest target peak exposure level (1. 2 ppm). Symptoms varied among species in the study but were generally uniform within each taxon. Coreopsis lanceolata showed the highest degree of ozone tolerance relative to the other three species in the study. Both Coreopsis palmata and C. tripteris developed visible foliar symptoms at the lowest treatment level (1. 2 ppm) indicating ozone susceptibility relative to the other species...|$|E
