25|$|After {{completing}} his graduate studies, Jelinek, who had developed {{an interest in}} linguistics, had plans to work with Charles F. Hockett at Cornell University. However these fell through and during {{the next ten years}} he continued to <b>study</b> <b>information</b> theory. Having previously worked at IBM during a sabbatical, he began full-time work there in 1972at first on leave for Cornell, but permanently from 1974. He remained there for over twenty years. Although at first he had been offered a regular research job, upon his arrival he learned that Josef Raviv had recently been promoted to head of the newly opened IBM Haifa Research Laboratory, and became head of the Continuous Speech Recognition group at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center. Despite his team's successes in this area, Jelinek's work remained little known in his home country because Czech scientists were not allowed to participate in key conferences.|$|E

Air Force Sergeant Richard C. Doty was also involved, said Moore, though Moore thought Doty was [...] "simply a pawn in a much larger game, as was I." [...] (ibid.)
