40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) causes substantial {{economic losses}} to cattle farmers and taxpayers in the British Isles. Disease management in cattle {{is complicated by}} the role of the European badger (Meles meles) as a host of the infection. Proactive, non-selective culling of badgers can reduce the incidence of disease in cattle but may also have negative effects in the area surrounding culls that have been associated with social perturbation of badger populations. The selective removal of infected badgers would, in principle, reduce the number culled, but the effects of <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> on social perturbation and disease outcomes are unclear. We used an established model to simulate non-selective badger culling, non-selective badger vaccination and a selective trap and vaccinate or remove (TVR) approach to badger management in two distinct areas: South West England and Northern Ireland. TVR was simulated with and without social perturbation in effect. The lower badger density in Northern Ireland caused no qualitative change in the effect of management strategies on badgers, although the absolute number of infected badgers was lower in all cases. However, probably due to differing herd density in Northern Ireland, the simulated badger management strategies caused greater variation in subsequent cattle bTB incidence. <b>Selective</b> <b>culling</b> in the model reduced the number of badgers killed by about 83 % but this only led to an overall benefit for cattle TB incidence if there was no social perturbation of badgers. We conclude that the likely benefit of <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> will be dependent on the social responses of badgers to intervention but that other population factors including badger and cattle density had little effect on the relative benefits of <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> compared to other methods, and that this may also be the case for disease management in other wild host populations...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{strategies}} to manage infectious diseases in threatened wildlife are still lacking despite considerable {{concern over the}} global increase in emerging infectious diseases of wildlife and their potential to drive populations to extinction. <b>Selective</b> <b>culling</b> of infected individuals will often be the most feasible option to control infectious disease in a threatened wildlife host, but has seldom been implemented or evaluated as a management tool {{for the conservation of}} threatened species. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is threatened with extinction by an infectious cancer, devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). We assess the success of an adaptive management trial involving <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> of infected Tasmanian devils to control DFTD. Demographic and epidemiological parameters indicative of disease progression and impact were compared between the management site and a comparable unmanaged control site. <b>Selective</b> <b>culling</b> of infected individuals neither slowed rate of disease progression nor reduced population-level impacts of this debilitating disease. Culling mortality simply compensated for disease mortality in this system. Failure of <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> to impede DFTD progress and reduce its impacts in the managed population was attributed to DFTD's frequency-dependent nature, its long latent period and high degree of infectivity, and the presence of a cryptic hidden disease reservoir or continual immigration of diseased individuals. We suggest that increasing the current removal rate and focusing removal efforts prior to the breeding season are options worth pursuing for future management of DFTD in this population. On the basis of our experience, we suggest that disease-management programs for threatened wildlife populations be developed on the principles of adaptive management and utilize a wide variety of strategies with regular reviews and adaptation of strategies undertaken as new information is obtained.

40|$|The {{control of}} bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) in cattle herds in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) is partially hindered by spill-back infection from wild badgers (Meles meles). The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the relative effects of interventions (combinations of culling and/or vaccination) on bTB dynamics in an Irish badger population. A spatial agent-based stochastic simulation model was developed to evaluate the effect of various control strategies for bovine tuberculosis in badgers: single control strategies (<b>culling,</b> <b>selective</b> <b>culling,</b> vaccination, and vaccine baits), and combined strategies (Test vaccinate/cull (TVC)), split area approaches using culling and vaccination, or <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> and vaccination, and mixed scenarios where culling was conducted for five years and followed by vaccination or by a TVC strategy. The effect of each control strategy was evaluated over a 20 -year period. Badger control was simulated in 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % area (limited area strategy) or in the entire area (100 %, wide area strategy). For endemic bTB, a culling strategy was successful in eradicating bTB from the population only if applied as an area-wide strategy. However, this was achieved only by risking the extinction of the badger population. <b>Selective</b> <b>culling</b> strategies (<b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> or TVC) mitigated this negative impact on the badger population's viability. Furthermore, both strategies (<b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> and TVC) allowed the badger population to recover gradually, in compensation for the population reduction following the initial use of removal strategies. The model predicted that vaccination can be effective in reducing bTB prevalence in badgers, when used in combination with culling strategies (i. e. TVC or other strategies). If fecundity was reduced below its natural levels (e. g. by using wildlife contraceptives), the effectiveness of vaccination strategies improved. Split-area simulations highlighted that interventions can have indirect effects (e. g. on population size) in non-treatment areas. Our model suggests that mixed control strategies could maintain infection prevalence to a low level for a considerable period even with a growing population. The model supported the hypothesis that culling strategies appeared to be the most effective method for the control of bTB in badgers using parameters, where available, from ROI, either singly or in combination with other strategies. In this model, the success of a vaccination strategy depended partially upon population density and the proportion of the population infected, therefore an initial culling program (to reduce density and/or remove infected badgers) followed by long-term vaccination may be effective in controlling bTB in badgers. </p...|$|R

40|$|High {{prices for}} {{patented}} pharmaceuticals have prompted many governments to consider allowing competition from parallel imports, or products first sold at lower prices in other countries. This paper examines how pharmaceutical firms {{have responded to}} changes in intellectual property rights and trade barriers that legalized parallel imports within the European Union (EU). The threat of arbitrage by parallel traders reduces the ability of firms to price discriminate across countries. Due to regulations on price and antitrust law on rationing supply, pharmaceutical firms may rely on non-price responses. Such responses include differentiation of products across countries and <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> of product lines to reduce arbitrage opportunities, as well as raising arbitrageurs costs through choice of packaging. Using a dataset of drug prices and sales from 1993 - 2004 covering 30 countries, I find evidence that the behavior of pharmaceutical firms in the EU {{with respect to their}} product portfolios is consistent with attempts to reduce parallel trade. This may at least partially explain why parallel trade has not yet resulted in significant price convergence across EU countries. Accounting for non-price strategic responses may therefore be important in assessing the welfare effects of competition from parallel imports. ...|$|R

The antibody to the gI epitope persisted for at least 15 weeks. The present est, which enables us to distinguish pigs vaccinated with certain attenuated strains from pigs infected with wild-type Aujeszky's disease virus, may be of great value in future combined vaccination-eradication programmes for Aujeszky's disease. In most countries where Aujeszky's disease is enzootic, vaccination of pigs against this herpesvirus infection is practised.

40|$|Emerging {{infectious}} diseases often originate in wildlife, but the complex dynamics of wild animal populations mean that disease {{control is a}} major scientific and policy challenge. Culling and vaccination can be effective but the ecological characteristics of wild animals may confound the outcomes of simple management programs. In Britain, badgers Meles meles are a recognized reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), and are involved in its transmission to cattle. Experiments have shown that culling badgers can increase bTB incidence in badgers and cattle, by perturbing the social structure of badger populations, and increasing contact rates. Selectively removal of infected badgers and vaccination of the remainder has recently been advocated as a potential solution. Simulation modelling suggests that this intuitively appealing policy could at best deliver only a minor advantage over thoroughly applying either vaccination or culling, but carries a risk of making the disease problem much worse. We suggest this counterintuitive outcome arises because: 1, not all animals can be caught and tested 2, some genuinely infected animals will be test negative 3, <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> leaves a larger population of susceptible hosts than non-selective culling 4, some susceptible hosts will not respond to vaccination and 5, perturbation increases contact and transmission rates among a relatively high density population of infectious and susceptible animals...|$|R

The alternative options of zoning or no-action should also be considered, particularly in view of a cost/benefit assessment. Ideally, tools from several fields should be combined in an integrated control strategy.

We combined data from 14 small, fenced reserves to evaluate growth rate parameters and compared them to those in larger and/or open reserves. Growth rates of lions in small fenced reserves were only matched by those in Nairobi National Park (NP), which is relatively small and where the majority of the subadults emigrated away from the park. Initially, South African managers unconsciously mimicked this system by removing subadults to control population numbers, but increasingly chose euthanasia and hunting in the past decade, as the demand for wild lions for translocation decreased. They have, however, expressed a desire to use other methods of population control and mimic other open systems such as Kruger NP and Serengeti NP. Kruger NP had older ages of first reproduction and longer inter-birth intervals that could be mimicked through selective contraception. Alternatively, Serengeti NP had smaller litter sizes and lower cub survival, which could be mimicked through surgery to reduce litter sizes and, less attractively as it still involves lethal management and raises serious ethical concerns, <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> of cubs. Mimicking Kruger NP may be more desirable as it is more ecologically similar to the small reserves than SerengetiNP. This understanding of the current situation,and howit could be altered to more closely mimic natural systems, will facilitate the development of a metapopulation-based management plan for lions in small reserves in South Africa.

40|$|Numerous {{studies suggest}} some cows use certain areas (e. g. {{riparian}} habitats) {{more than others}} (e. g. uplands), but the research generally {{has been based on}} observations of small numbers of animals or on general inspections of entire herds. Consequently, it is not known if individual animals differ in home range (HR) and habitat use (HU) or if behavioral characteristics are a valid selection tool to decrease cattle use of riparian habitats. We conducted field observations of the differences in HR and HU among adult cows on summer range in Idaho. We located 116 cows on 4970 occasions during 1990, and 87 cows on 3995 occasions during 1991. Individual cows occupied one of four HR areas, and the majority (78 %) showed high consistency in HR, despite drought, ad hoc management procedures and occasional herding. Thirty-three percent (n = 29) of the 87 animals monitored during 1990 and 1991 exhibited total HR fidelity between years, whereas 45 % (n = 39), 18 % (n = 16) and 3 % (n = 3) of the animals differed slightly, moderately and substantially in HR use. All cows tended to shift their activities (i. e., centroid) to the south, apparently in response to decreasing water availability between 1990 and 1991. Cows in the four HR groups differed in {{the degree to which they}} foraged and rested in riparian and upland habitats, largely depending on the physical characteristics of the HR area. Given the high degree of home range fidelity in our study and those of others, we submit that <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> may effectively change cattle distribution and decrease the use of riparian areas...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the death}} of the last {{thylacine}} in 1936, the Tasmanian devil was protected by law in June 1941 and the population slowly recovered. In the 1950s, with reports of increasing numbers, some permits to capture devils were granted after complaints of livestock damage. In 1966, poisoning permits were issued although attempts to have the animal unprotected failed. During this time environmentalists also became more outspoken, particularly as scientific studies provided new data suggesting the threat of devils to livestock had been vastly exaggerated. Numbers may have peaked in the early 1970s after a population boom; in 1975 they were reported to be lower, possibly due to overpopulation and consequent lack of food. Another report of overpopulation and livestock damage was reported in 1987. The following year, Trichinella spiralis, a parasite which kills animals and can infect humans, was found in devils and minor panic broke out before scientists assured the public that 30% of devils had it but that they could not transmit it to other species. Control permits were ended in the 1990s, but illegal killing continues to a limited extent, albeit [...] "locally intense". This is not considered a substantial problem for the survival of the devil. Approximately 10,000 devils were killed per year in the mid-1990s. [...] A <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> program has taken place to remove individuals affected with DFTD, and has been shown to not slow the rate of disease progression or reduced the number of animals dying. A model has been tested to find out whether culling devils infected with DFTD would assist in the survival of the species, and it has found that culling would not be a suitable strategy to employ.|$|R

Limited culling resumed in 1998 as part of a 10-year randomised trial cull which was considered by John Krebs and others to show that culling was ineffective. Some groups called for a <b>selective</b> <b>cull,</b> while others favoured a programme of vaccination, and vets support the cull on compassionate grounds as they say that the illness causes much suffering in badgers. [...] Wales and Northern Ireland are currently (2013) conducting field trials of a badger vaccination programme.

[...] In August 2013, a full culling programme began where it is expected about 5,000 badgers will be killed over six weeks in West Somerset and Gloucestershire by marksmen with high-velocity rifles using a mixture of controlled shooting and free shooting (some badgers will be trapped in cages first). The cull has caused many protests with emotional, economic and scientific reasons being cited. The badger is considered an iconic species of the British countryside, it has been claimed by shadow ministers that [...] "The government's own figures show it will cost more than it saves...", and Lord Krebs, who led the Randomised Badger Culling Trial in the 1990s, said the two pilots [...] "will not yield any useful information".|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{are increasingly being}} recognised as significant threatening processes in conservation biology. Developing strategies to effectively manage infectious diseases in wildlife is, therefore, {{of the utmost importance}} to the maintenance of global biodiversity. The effective management of infectious diseases relies on understanding the ecology of the host, the epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen and the impacts of the pathogen on the host population. However, for most wildlife-disease systems this information remains poorly understood. This is particularly true for endangered species threatened by novel infectious agents as opportunities to observe and assess disease impacts and host-pathogen dynamics in the wild are limited. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), the world’s largest carnivorous marsupial, is threatened with extinction {{as a result of an}} epidemic of an emerging disease, a fatal infectious cancer known as Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD). In this thesis I capitalised on a unique dataset from a population of Tasmanian devils where disease arrived part-way through an intensive longitudinal study, and utilised existing genetic samples collected prior to DFTD outbreak, to determine the impact of DFTD on the demography, population dynamics, genetic diversity and population genetic structure of wild Tasmanian devils. I then used this knowledge of the impacts of DFTD impacts in an unmanaged population to evaluate the effectiveness of a disease management trial involving the <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> of infected individuals. I employed mark-recapture models to investigate the impact of DFTD on age-specific and sex-specific apparent survival rates, to examine the pattern of variation in infection rates (force of infection), and to investigate the impact of DFTD on population growth rate. I investigated demography, life-history traits and morphometric parameters of infected and uninfected individuals to determine the impacts of DFTD on age-structure and sex-structure, female fecundity and individual growth rates. I used this information to assess the population’s ability to respond to low population densities and to compensate for the detrimental impacts of DFTD. To determine the genetic consequences of disease-induced population decline I used microsatellite DNA to compare genetic diversity, population genetic structure and dispersal patterns in three Tasmanian devil populations prior to and following DFTD outbreaks. Capture-mark-recapture analyses revealed that the arrival of DFTD triggered an immediate decline in apparent survival rates of devils, the rate of which was predicted well by the increase in disease prevalence in the population over time. Transition rates of healthy individuals to the diseased class (the force of infection) increased in relation to disease prevalence, while the arrival of DFTD coincided with a marked and ongoing decline in the population growth rate. There was a significant change to the age structure following the arrival of DFTD. This shift to a younger population was caused by the loss of older individuals as a direct consequence of DFTD-driven declines in adult survival rates. Evidence of reproductive compensation in response to these disease impacts was observed via a reduction in the age of sexual maturity of females over time. However, widespread precocial breeding in devils was precluded by physiological and ecological constraints that limited the ability of one year olds to breed. Using temporally-replicated spatial genetic data, I found evidence of increased inbreeding following DFTD arrival and greater population genetic differentiation in post-disease populations. These changes appeared to be driven by a combination of selection and altered dispersal patterns of females in DFTD-affected populations. Comparison of demographic and epidemiological parameters indicative of disease progression and impact between the managed and unmanaged populations revealed that <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> of infected individuals neither slowed the rate of disease progression nor reduced the population level impacts of this debilitating disease; with culling mortality simply compensating for disease mortality. This thesis provides one of the few direct empirical evaluations of the impact of an emerging wildlife disease epidemic on a wild population. This thesis revealed that infectious diseases can result in major demographic and genetic changes in host populations over relatively few generations and short time-scales. Results showing dramatic and ongoing population declines and very limited population compensation in DFTD-affected populations indicate that DFTD poses a significant extinction risk for wild devil populations. Hence, this study confirms that host-specific pathogens can pose a significant extinction risk for wild species, even in the absence of alternate reservoir hosts, a finding critical to our understanding of host-pathogen dynamics. My thesis also highlights the potential negative interplay between disease susceptibility and host genetic variability, which is of utmost importance to the management of novel wildlife epizootics and the conservation of threatened wildlife in general. The thorough understanding of the ecology and impacts of DFTD in the wild obtained in this study has provided a solid base from which to both rigorously assess the outcome of management strategies and also formulate recommendations for the management of this disease in the wild. The lack of evidence for successful control of the DFTD epidemic in a wild population during the first phase of a <b>selective</b> <b>culling</b> experimental adaptive management approach, points to the need to implement a multi-faceted disease management program when attempting to control a novel infectious disease in the wild. By drawing on the lessons learnt in this case study I show that it is possible to establish a set of general guidelines for the future management of infectious diseases in threatened wildlife...|$|R
40|$|Gulls are {{commonly}} attracted to landfills, and managers are often required to implement cost-effective and socially accepted deterrence programs. Our {{objective was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive program that integrated the use of trained birds of prey, pyrotechnics, and playback of gull distress calls at a landfill located close to a large ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) colony near Montreal, Quebec, Canada. We used long-term survey data on bird use of the landfill, conducted behavioral observations of gulls during one season and tracked birds fitted with GPS data loggers. We also carried out observations at another landfill located farther from the colony, where less refuse was brought and where a limited culling program was conducted. The integrated program based on falconry resulted in a 98 % decrease in the annual total number of gulls counted each day between 1995 and 2014. A separate study indicated that the local breeding population of ring-billed gulls increased and then declined during this period but remained relatively large. In 2010, there was an average (±SE) of 59 ± 15 gulls/day using the site with falconry and only 0. 4 % ± 0. 2 % of these birds were feeding. At the other site, there was an average of 347 ± 55 gulls/day and 13 % ± 3 % were feeding. Twenty-two gulls tracked from the colony made 41 trips towards the landfills: twenty-five percent of the trips that passed by the site with falconry resulted in a stopover that lasted 22 ± 7 min compared to 85 % at the other landfill lasting 63 ± 15 min. We concluded that the integrated program using falconry, which we consider more socially acceptable than <b>selective</b> <b>culling,</b> was effective in reducing the number of gulls at the landfill...|$|R

Following the February-April 2002 outbreak, vaccination using a killed oil-adjuvanted H 5 N 2 avian influenza vaccine was evaluated {{as an additional}} control measure on 22 farms within a 2 -km radius of the four farms that were depopulated following infection with HPAI H 5 N 1 virus. Vaccination produced satisfactory flock antibody responses. The serological response was improved following a second dose of vaccine and the response to vaccination was poorer when delivered to older birds compared to birds first vaccinated at 8 days of age. Infection with field virus was not detected {{in any of these}} vaccinated flocks so the protective effect of the vaccine was tested under secure laboratory conditions on vaccinated and unvaccinated chickens challenged with HPAI H 5 N 1 virus. Vaccinated birds were protected from disease, virus excretion was not detected in eight of ten vaccinated birds and the two birds that did excrete virus excreted much less virus than unvaccinated controls (> 1000 fold reduction). In December 2002 HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks in 2 waterfowl parks and deaths in wild water birds in Hong Kong were followed by outbreaks on five previously unvaccinated chicken farms. Vaccination used in the face of outbreaks on three of these farms, coupled with <b>selective</b> <b>culling,</b> resulted in elimination of H 5 N 1 virus infection from these farms.
