A <b>shadow</b> <b>price</b> model for calculating the present value of the external damage of a carbon dioxide emission is derived explicitly. Sixteen experts provided subjective high, low and most likely parameter estimates because correct values for the eight model parameters are uncertain. The estimation procedure retains parameter uncertainty while generating the main result, which is a distribution of <b>shadow</b> <b>price</b> estimates. Major assumptions made in the estimation identify the basis for the results.

40|$|A novel dynamic computable general {{equilibrium}} model {{based on}} National Water Resource Input Holding Output Table is proposed to calculate the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Price</b> of water resource in China. Unlike previous approaches, the dynamic <b>Shadow</b> <b>Price</b> of water resource is largely based on the scarcity extent and can reflect the marginal long-term value in the balanced growth path of China. Firstly, the basic concepts of dynamic Input Output analysis and Turnpike Theory are reviewed. Then, Dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (DCGE) is elaborated to calculate the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Price,</b> including the definition and computer-based algorithm. Furthermore, <b>Shadow</b> <b>Price</b> of water resource in China from 1949 to 2050 {{is calculated based on}} the DCGE. Also the sensitivity analysis of the DCGE for <b>Shadow</b> <b>Price</b> of water resource in China is presented. Dynamic <b>Shadow</b> <b>Price</b> of water resource has two meanings for China government: (1) Project evaluation. Every large-scale project in China must have national economic evaluation and the dynamic <b>Shadow</b> <b>Price</b> is prerequisite for national economic evaluation. (2) Market price of water resource. A lesson from this paper is that <b>Shadow</b> <b>Price</b> of water resource in domestic market of China should be rewritten according to the dynamic <b>Shadow</b> <b>Price.</b> In addition, the parallel computations approach could also be used to solve these problems in different countries or for different natural resources...|$|R

5000|$|Although product {{characteristics}} are neither produced nor consumed in isolation, hedonic price models {{assume that the}} price of a product reflects embodied characteristics valued by some implicit or <b>shadow</b> <b>prices.</b> In empirical studies, these implicit characteristic prices are coefficients that relate prices and attributes in a regression model. Hedonic price regression models are estimated using secondary data on prices and attributes of different product or service alternatives. In working with longitudinal data, one adds period-specific dummies and uses their regression coefficients to estimate quality-adjusted price indices. In hedonic regression, independent variables typically include performance-related product and service attributes. Such {{product characteristics}} represent not only value to the user but also resource cost to the producer. It has been demonstrated however that prices in hedonic regression are not determined completely by technical factors and performance-related characteristics. Brand-name and market-segment effects can explain price distortions and premiums that are charged over and above any allowance made for differences in measurable product performance.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the decade}} has been {{published}} a large volume of empirical work and a number of papers referring to the building of models which foster social accounting disclosures, although this early works suffered from problems with subjectivity of analysis as well social and environmental accounting literature (SEAL) was underdeveloped. Information related to the social dimension of accounting have been mostly connected with employees or products. Environmental matters were treated as part of a generally undifferentiated and fairly unsophisticated social accounting movement.Environmental damage included damage to terrain, air, water, noise, visual and aesthetic and other forms of pollution, and solid-waste production. First ideas about <b>shadow</b> <b>prices</b> and mapping of externalities arose to develop. Albeit the contribution of this period was notable for extensive developments in the field of social audit, the methodology was nearly familiar with the historical financial accounting reports.At this time neither financial accounting standards nor regulatory frameworks had been developed to any extent. The empirical studies and research were mainly descriptive. Although several models and similar normative statements were enhanced, the philosophical debate was not widespread.|$|E
5000|$|Barone {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "founder of the pure theory of a socialist economy." [...] In 1908, he presented a mathematical model for a socialist economy under which certain relations, later identified with <b>shadow</b> <b>prices,</b> must be satisfied for [...] "maximum collective welfare." [...] The latter corresponds to least-cost-price of production from Pareto efficiency reached in competitive equilibrium. He stressed that such a result could not be arrived at a priori but only by experimentation on a large scale with great demands on data collection, even assuming unchanging productive conditions. In this, he suggested that movement toward economic efficiency in a socialist economy was not inconceivable, outlining two types of socialism: a centralized and decentralized model. For such regimes, whatever the distribution rule for output and income adopted by the Ministry of Production, the same economic categories would reappear for prices, salaries, interest, rent, profits, saving, etc., though perhaps with different names. His analysis, and the Austrian Economists' responses, fueled discussion of the economic calculation problem and market socialism in the 1930s. [...] His method also anticipated Abram Bergson's seminal formulation of a social welfare function three decades later.|$|E
5000|$|Linda and Morris Tannehill {{believe that}} big {{businesses}} {{will tend to}} pay {{the bulk of the}} defense costs (since they stand to lose the most {{in the event of an}} attack); they would then pass on the costs to their customers, and so the costs of defense would be spread out among the whole population. A landowner seeking to establish a community may sell or lease the land with provisions written into the deed or lease agreement, requiring the new owner or tenant to pay for defense on a permanent basis; this same technique has already been in some neighborhoods to ensure that residents pay for private streets shared in common by all of them. As is true for homeowners today, everyone would be responsible for buying or otherwise being covered by aggression insurance in order to protect themselves against catastrophic loss from foreign attack; in the event of an invasion, a claim would be filed with right of subrogation, and the insurer would hire a private defense company to collect from the aggressor. An argument against this method of funding is that other aggression insurers who didn't pay for defense would still benefit from the reduced risk of attack on their customers in the same area, in effect becoming free riders who could drive the [...] "altruistic" [...] insurer out of business. However, the private defense agency's activity need not be limited to defensive and retaliatory measures funded by the insurer; It could also go after the aggressor in an effort to obtain restitution (including reasonable collection costs), perhaps through ransom or capture of enemy assets, as privateers did in the 18th and 19th centuries under letters of marque and reprisal. Prisoners of war also used to have <b>shadow</b> <b>prices</b> (ransoms) which were a source of income for victorious forces; this represents another potential alternative to taxation.|$|E

We further argue that the use of the cost of capital as the discount rate will be easier than the two-stage procedure, will yield results that are consistent with the <b>shadow</b> <b>price</b> of capital approach, and will be justified by the potential Pareto criterion. Finally, use of the <b>shadow</b> <b>price</b> of capital approach has a potential for achieving considerable consensus in practice as well as in theory, a result that could considerably enhance project evaluation. ...|$|R
