25|$|In general, the {{prognosis}} of esophageal cancer is quite poor, because most patients present with advanced disease. By the time the first symptoms (such as difficulty swallowing) appear, the disease has already progressed.

The latest <b>survival</b> <b>data</b> for England and Wales (patients diagnosed during 2007) show that only one in ten people survive esophageal cancer for at least ten years.|$|E

50|$|The {{survival}} function {{is one of}} several ways to describe and display <b>survival</b> <b>data.</b> Another useful way to display data is a graph showing the distribution of survival times of subjects. Olkin, page 426, gives the following example of <b>survival</b> <b>data.</b> The number of hours between successive failures of an air-conditioning system were recorded. The time between successive failures are 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 11, 11, 12, 14, 14, 14, 16, 16, 20, 21, 23, 42, 47, 52, 62, 71, 71, 87, 90, 95, 120, 120, 225, 246, and 261 hours. The mean time between failures is 59.6. This mean value will be used shortly to fit a theoretical curve to the data. The figure below shows the distribution of the time between failures. The blue tick marks beneath the graph are the actual hours between successive failures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In Unattended Wireless Sensor Networks(UWSNs), sensed {{data are}} stored locally {{for a long}} term till to collector’s retrieval. It is {{motivated}} by the scenarios where only historical information or digest data, not real-time data, are of interest. Such paradigm indeed has been attracted more and more interests in research communities recently. Data storage in UWSNs should be dependable to defend random failure or node compromise, {{as well as the}} efficiency of communication and storage should be maintained. In this paper, we propose a dependable and efficient <b>data</b> <b>survival</b> scheme to maximize the <b>data</b> <b>survival</b> degree upon <b>data</b> retrieval. Our scheme makes use of computational secret sharing to achieve fault tolerance and compromise resilience, and takes advantages of network coding to further improve communication efficiency.

40|$|In {{survival}} analysis, researchers often encounter multivariate <b>survival</b> time <b>data,</b> {{in which}} failure times are correlated {{even in the}} presence of model covariates. It is argued that because observations are clustered by unobserved heterogeneity, the application of standard survival models can result in biased parameter estimates and erroneous model-based predictions. In this article, the author describes and compares four methods handling unobserved heterogeneity in survival analysis: the Andersen-Gill approach, the robust sandwich variance estimator, the hazard model with individual frailty, and the retransformation method. An empirical analysis provides strong evidence that {{in the presence of}} strong unobserved heterogeneity, the application of a standard survival model can yield equally robust parameter estimates and the likelihood ratio statistic as does a corresponding model adding an additional parameter for random effects. When predicting the survival function, however, a standard model on multivariate <b>survival</b> time <b>data</b> can result in serious prediction bias. The retransformation method is effective to derive an adjustment factor for correctly predicting the survival function...|$|R

40|$|Some {{sensor network}} {{settings}} involve disconnected or unattended operation with periodic visits by a mobile sink. An unattended sensor network {{operating in a}} hostile environment can collect data that represents a high-value target for the adversary. Since an unattended sensor can not immediately off-load sensed data to a safe external entity (such as a sink), the adversary can easily mount a focused attack aiming to erase or modify target data. To maximize chances of <b>data</b> <b>survival,</b> sensors must collaboratively attempt to mislead the adversary and hide the location, the origin, and the contents of collected data. In this paper, we focus on applications of well-known security techniques to maximize chances of <b>data</b> <b>survival</b> in unattended sensor networks, where sensed data can not be off-loaded to a sink in real time.
