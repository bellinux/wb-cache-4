5|$|The {{portion of}} NY590 between the Can of Worms and NY104 {{is part of}} the northeastern {{quadrant}} of the Rochester Outer Loop, a series of expressways that form a beltway around the city of Rochester. At NY104, the Outer Loop turns west to follow NY104 through Irondequoit. The <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> Expressway was built in stages from the 1950s to the 1960s and carried various designations until 1970, when the entirety of the Rochester – <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> highway was designated as part of NY47. It was redesignated as NY590 in 1980. In the late 2000s, the section of NY590 north of Titus Avenue was reconfigured into a two-lane road named <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> Drive, and NY590 was truncated to end at Titus Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Rainbands spawned {{near and}} ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which {{are able to}} produce tornadoes. Rainbands {{associated}} with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due {{to the formation of}} a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form with <b>sea</b> <b>breeze</b> and land breeze boundaries, if enough moisture is present. If <b>sea</b> <b>breeze</b> rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.|$|E
25|$|On calm summer afternoons {{with little}} {{prevailing}} wind, <b>sea</b> <b>breezes</b> from both coasts may collide in the middle, creating especially severe storms {{down the center}} of the state. These thunderstorms can drift towards either the west or east coast depending on the relative strengths of the <b>sea</b> <b>breezes,</b> and sometimes survive to move out over the water at night, creating spectacular cloud-to-cloud lightning shows for hours after sunset. Due to its large size Lake Okeechobee may also contribute to this activity by creating its own lake breeze which collides with the east and west coast <b>sea</b> <b>breezes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the terrain}} {{surrounding}} the interchange {{and the location}} of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge, NY104 is forced to run parallel to NY590 for a short distance between the Keeler Street Expressway and NY590's next exit, a diamond interchange connecting to East Ridge Road. Through this stretch, NY590—now just four lanes wide—runs in between NY104 westbound and NY104 eastbound. At East Ridge Road, NY104 turns to the northeast to cross Irondequoit Bay while NY590 continues north through residential areas toward <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze.</b> The road has an at-grade intersection with Sunrise Crescent, a private residential street, before meeting Titus Avenue at a roundabout that serves as NY590's northern terminus. Past this point, the right-of-way of NY590 continues north to Culver Road at the Lake Ontario shoreline as a divided two-lane street named <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> Drive.|$|E
5|$|The freeway travels due north {{along this}} stretch, flanked {{on both sides}} by {{residential}} neighborhoods separated from I-590 only by sound barriers. Not far {{to the north of}} the intersection with NY31 is exit3, a partial diamond interchange for Elmwood Avenue permitting access from I-590 south and to I-590 north. Prior to 1980, NY47 entered the freeway at this point and followed both I-590 and NY590 north to <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze.</b> Another partial interchange with Highland Avenue follows at exit4—making the two connections that exit3 omits—before I-590 enters the Can of Worms, a complex interchange connecting I-590 to I-490. North of the ramps leading to I-490, I-590 descends northeastward into a cut and passes below both I-490 and NY96 as it becomes NY590, which continues onward toward <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze.</b>|$|E
5|$|The typical summer {{weather pattern}} is for heat-produced thermals, powered {{by either the}} Gulf or Atlantic <b>sea</b> <b>breeze</b> (and {{occasionally}} both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over {{the interior of the}} Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, though they may rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds are light or the <b>sea</b> <b>breeze</b> from the Gulf of Mexico is too strong. Occasionally, the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen at night from the beaches as spectacular light shows. Nighttime storms offshore are driven by the land-breeze front which is the dermal counterpart of the daytime sea-breeze front.|$|E
40|$|Local {{precipitation}} {{is often}} observed at an inner {{area between the}} Fukuoka plains and the Chikushi plains. This precipitation {{is related to the}} convergence of the <b>sea</b> <b>breezes</b> from Genkai <b>Sea</b> and Ariake Sea. The collision and the convergence of the two <b>sea</b> <b>breezes</b> make strong upward wind and induces convective precipitation. We examine this local precipitation by the means of data analysis and the local winds by numerical simulation. The local precipitation is generated most frequently in the afternoon of the summer season. The convergence of the <b>sea</b> <b>breezes</b> and the generation of the strong upward wind are confirmed by the numerical simulation...|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s, {{the portion}} of Browncroft Boulevard from the <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> Expressway to Blossom Road was {{upgraded}} into a divided highway. NY286 was rerouted to follow the improved Browncroft Boulevard while NY286A was shifted south onto NY286's former alignment along Blossom Road. The NY286A designation was removed in the early 1970s, but Blossom Road remains state-maintained as NY941V, an unsigned reference route.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Keeler Street Expressway, a limited-access highway extending across Irondequoit from the Genesee River (at the Veterans Memorial Bridge) to the <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> Expressway. The first section from North Goodman Street to the <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> Expressway was completed by 1968 while the remainder opened in late 1969. The name of the expressway was derived from Keeler Street, a small residential street that originally connected to East Ridge Road and St. Paul Street {{by way of a}} traffic circle on the east bank of the Genesee River. The street was turned into a dead-end street {{as a result of the}} expressway's construction. US104 was moved from East Ridge Road to the expressway, which remains known, albeit infrequently, as the Keeler Street Expressway to this day. NY18 remained on East Ridge Road, however, reducing the overlap between US104 and NY18 to just the portion on the Veterans Bridge. NY18 was truncated to its current eastern terminus , eliminating the overlap entirely.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} NY590 {{date back to}} the start of the 1950s when work first began on the <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> Expressway, a part-divided highway, part limited-access highway that {{extended}} from Rochester north to the Lake Ontario shoreline at <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze.</b> The highway was built in stages from north to south, with the first section—a divided highway connecting Culver Road to East Ridge Road in Irondequoit—opening to traffic in the early 1950s as a realignment of NY18. The northern end of the roadway was situated just west of the Irondequoit Bay outlet, where Irondequoit Bay meets Lake Ontario. Construction on the next segment, a limited-access extension south to Empire Boulevard (U.S. Route104 or US104), began in the mid-1950s. The new roadway was completed in the late 1950s, at which time it became part of a rerouted US104.|$|E

The amount of rainfall varies according to the monsoon season. It is generally fairly hot and humid all year round, averaging from 28°C to 30°C in daytime and slightly cooler after dusk. Nevertheless, the <b>sea</b> <b>breeze</b> from South China Sea hsomehow moderates the humidity in offshore areas while the altitude and lush forest trees and plant has cooled the mountain and rural areas.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime <b>sea</b> <b>breeze</b> to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E

5|$|By 1964, {{construction}} was underway {{on a new}} expressway leading south from I-490 at the Can of Worms to Elmwood Avenue east of Twelve Corners. The highway was completed , at which time NY47 was realigned to follow the <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> Expressway and the new expressway south through the Can of Worms to its end at a partial interchange with Elmwood Avenue (now I-590 exit3). It continued west on Elmwood Avenue to Twelve Corners, where it reconnected to its old alignment at Winton Road.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, the Outer Loop was {{complete}} from NY383 to US104 {{west of the}} city and from modern I-590 exit1 to the lakeshore east of Rochester. NY47 followed the loop from US104 south to NY383 and from Elmwood Avenue north to modern NY590 exit8; north of that point, the expressway was part of US104 and NY18. NY47 was extended northward along the remainder of the <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> Expressway in 1970. On March18, 1980, the NY47 designation was removed and replaced with several others, primarily I-390, I-590, NY390, and NY590.|$|E

5|$|The {{winds are}} {{predominantly}} northern. Along the coastline the winds {{flow from the}} north in November – March, from the east in April – August and from the north-east in September – October. The <b>sea</b> <b>breeze</b> causes the high frequency of eastern winds in summer. In the interior the predominant wind direction is more varied with northern winds being the most frequent in January – March and in October.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, {{and may be}} preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a shear line, though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move {{from east to west}} across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and <b>sea</b> <b>breeze</b> boundaries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{the state of}} New York {{submitted}} a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered. As part of the plan, the NY47 designation would be eliminated {{while most of the}} northeastern section of the Outer Loop—from I-490 in Rochester to NY104 (former US104) to Irondequoit—would become the northernmost part of I-590. A replacement designation for NY47 north of NY104 was not named at the time. Most of the proposed changes took effect on March18, 1980, when NY47 was eliminated; however, I-590 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Rochester–Irondequoit leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY590, which continued north to <b>Sea</b> <b>Breeze</b> over former NY47.|$|E
