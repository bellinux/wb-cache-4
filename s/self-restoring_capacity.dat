40|$|The {{aim of the}} Strength and Loading of Coastal Structures (SBW) {{project is}} to improve the models to derive the Hydraulic Boundary Conditions which are {{determined}} along the Dutch coast once per five years. The Amelander inlet is chosen as area of interest in the Wadden Sea. As the Amelander Inlet is morphologically a very active area, this study focuses on the morphological development of the area. The objective {{of this study is to}} see what the influence of sea level rise is on the morphological development of the Amelander Inlet. To achieve this, the available data is analysed over the period 1989 - 2005, after which a morphological model is set-up. The sand balance is analysed to get insight in the current development of the Amelander Inlet system. The model that is used in this study is the process-based model Delft 3 D, in which the parallel-online approach (Roelvink, 2005) is chosen to simulate the long term morphological development. The model has a hydrodynamic part, which is calibrated on the base of tidal water levels and some discharge measurements. The morphological model uses a morphological tide and a schematised wave climate (consisting of 12 wave scenarios) as boundary conditions. The hindcast that is carried out over the period 1989 - 1999 shows a valid behaviour regarding the morphological behaviour until 1993, after which the model enlarges the erroneous behaviour regarding the morphological development. The validation is done over the period 1999 - 2002, wherein is shown that the model is able to predict the morphological behaviour for time spans shorter than five years, while longer time spans show increasing deviations. Finally an experiment is done with relative sea level rise. The intention of this experiment is to see what the relative morphological development of the system will be. From this simulation it became clear that the model is able to predict the hypothesis of the effects due to relative sea level rise. Besides this, the model tends to show a <b>self-restoring</b> <b>capacity</b> regarding the sand balance of the system. In total can be concluded that this experiment to model relative sea level rise with a process based model has potential for future research. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The <b>self-restoring</b> or healing <b>capacity</b> {{of asphalt}} {{has been known}} for quite some time. Yet, to this date, there is no {{consensus}} of the fundamental mechanism underlying this phenomenon. In this paper a multi-scale model is presented which focuses on the healing phenomenon from a thermodynamic point of view. In the model, healing of bituminous material is simulated at the micro scale via a phase field model, utilizing {{a modified version of the}} Cahn Hilliard and Flory-Huggins equations. This model is then connected to a more general elasto-visco-plastic constitutive framework for the simulation of asphalt mixtures. The paper presents the developed hypothesis, the experimental evidence and summarizes some of the theoretical background. The model has been implemented in the 3 D finite element system CAPA- 3 D and preliminary results are shown...|$|R
