5|$|At about 11.00pm {{that night}} William Wainewright <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in Blackburne's study at Eccles vicarage {{to write a}} brief letter to the Mayor of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I {{told him}} the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren had {{not even}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> when his team took the lead. Mendieta's pass let Zenden run down the left wing and cross for striker Joseph-Désiré Job to put Middlesbrough ahead in the second minute. It was the fastest goal scored in a final, a record broken the {{following}} year by Liverpool's John Arne Riise.|$|E
50|$|Now, {{the first}} to come in was a dyer; he <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> by the fire,He <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> by the fire for {{to join in the}} jovial crew.And he <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> with a good graceFor the chimney breast was his own place,And here he could drink and dye his old face,When Jones's ale was new, my boys, when Jones's ale was new.|$|R
60|$|The couple {{therefore}} <b>sat</b> themselves <b>down</b> in arm-chairs and waited.|$|R
60|$|Victor <b>sat</b> sullenly <b>down.</b> The lady {{looked all}} deprecation and submissiveness, but said nothing.|$|R
5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in the pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|One major {{demonstration}} {{took place}} in the Shi'a island of Sitra, where several thousand men, women, and children took to the streets. According to witnesses interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights, hundreds of fully armed riot police arrived on the scene and immediately began firing tear gas and sound grenades into the crowds. They then fired rubber bullets into the unarmed crowd, aiming at people in the front line who had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in the street in protest.|$|E
5|$|We tried {{a similar}} {{approach}} for The Little Shop of Horrors, dropping {{in and out of}} various downtown dives. We ended up at a place where Sally Kellerman (before she became a star) was working as a waitress, and as Chuck and I vied with each other, trying to top each other’s sardonic or subversive ideas, appealing to Sally as a referee, she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at the table with us, and the three of us worked {{out the rest of the}} story together.|$|E
60|$|Sproatly {{took the}} basket, and {{followed}} her into another room, where he <b>sat</b> it <b>down.</b>|$|R
60|$|And very proudly {{and quietly}} she <b>sat</b> herself <b>down</b> again, {{waiting for the}} fateful words.|$|R
60|$|Nicholas <b>sat</b> himself <b>down,</b> {{directly}} {{opposite to}} the party, and, summoning the waiter, paid his bill.|$|R
5|$|A {{week after}} the {{non-stop}} protests in Ottawa ended, non-stop protests began {{on the evening of}} 26 April in front of the Consulate of the United States in Toronto, urging Barack Obama to call for an immediate permanent ceasefire. Protesters <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on University Avenue, occupying {{a large portion of the}} street. On the third day of the non-stop protest (29 April), fifteen arrests were made while one woman was injured after a brief scuffle with police. This incident was the first one to happen among these protests in Canada. The protests later shifted to Queen's Park with a diminished number of protesters.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the {{building}} by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E
5|$|The Christian Scientists came in. Before they <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> {{they stood}} on chairs {{and closed the}} transoms over the two doors to the rooms. Then they made their demand: the series must not be published. S.S. scowled at them and said nothing. To fill the silence, Brynner began rather nervously to assure the Scientists that the {{articles}} were not sensational, not offensive; {{that there was no}} cause for apprehension; that all the facts had been most carefully verified.One of the Scientists cut in to suggest that perhaps there would be no objection to publication of the material if the Scientists were permitted to edit it as they might please.|$|E
60|$|Sabina {{took him}} to a sofa, and <b>sat</b> him <b>down</b> while he made his little moan.|$|R
60|$|M. de Ribaumont made no answer, but <b>sat</b> wearily <b>down</b> {{and asked}} for his little Eustacie.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> in {{the chair}} beside her, took her proffered hand, and leant over her.|$|R
5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E
25|$|And {{he turned}} aside, and <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
25|$|When he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{there was}} thunderous applause.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Bishop <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> on the hatch-coaming, {{took off}} his broad hat, and mopped his brow.|$|R
60|$|They <b>sat</b> them <b>down,</b> the men {{looking on}} from afar, and Mulvaney untangled himself in mighty words.|$|R
60|$|Arnold swung {{himself up}} on {{to the top of}} a barrel and <b>sat</b> looking <b>down</b> at his companion.|$|R
25|$|Using his {{friendly}} {{relations with}} the British, Kâmil Pasha also <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to end the ongoing First Balkan War diplomatically. However, the heavy Ottoman military upsets during the war continued to sap morale, as rumors that the capital {{would have to be}} moved from Istanbul to inland Anatolia spread. The Bulgarian Army had soon advanced as far as Çatalca, a western district of modern Istanbul. At this point, Kâmil Pasha's government signed an armistice with Bulgaria in December 1912 and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to draw up a treaty {{for the end of the}} war at the London Peace Conference.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 1970, {{the two men}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> for lunch. With a red {{felt-tip}} pen, Osborn {{began to}} scrawl a Saint Andrew's cross circumscribed inside a chalice on his placemat.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{entered the}} room {{that had been set}} aside for Crabbe, wet and hurried, and embraced Crabbe with brotherly affection. The royal gift was forgotten— the ample skirt of the coat within which it had been packed, and which he had {{hitherto}} held cautiously in front of his person, slipped back to its more usual position— he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> beside Crabbe, and the glass was crushed to atoms. His scream and gesture made his wife conclude that he had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on a pair of scissors, or the like: but very little harm had been done except the breaking of the glass.|$|E
60|$|Tom and Peter, {{finding that}} no one paid any {{attention}} to them, <b>sat,</b> quietly <b>down</b> by the guard-house.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> him <b>down</b> on a {{chair and}} gaped upon me, while I could not contain myself from laughing.|$|R
60|$|It {{was on a}} {{cold winter}} morning that Robin Gore entered his parlour and <b>sat</b> him <b>down</b> to breakfast.|$|R
25|$|The {{participants}} were Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards. The debate, chaired by Wolf Blitzer, had an unusual format; {{for the last}} forty minutes the candidates <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and the debate took a much more casual tone.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it is then}} {{revealed}} that {{the events of the}} contrived murder and subsequent events were all simply part of the book Gifford had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to begin writing {{at the beginning of the}} film. None of it was real.|$|E
25|$|In the Bhagavata Purana, it is {{described}} that after Balarama {{took part in}} the battle causing the destruction of the remainder of the Yadu dynasty and witnessing the disappearance of Krishna, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in a meditative state and departed from this world.|$|E
60|$|Then Caroline {{went up to}} her bedroom, and Sir Henry <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> near Mr. Bertram's {{chair in}} the dining-room.|$|R
60|$|Then Mopo <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> {{again in}} the circle of the Councillors, and watched and hearkened like a hungry wolf.|$|R
60|$|Here Monsieur Justin yawned again, and, {{returning}} to the garden, <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> in an arbor and resignedly went to sleep.|$|R
