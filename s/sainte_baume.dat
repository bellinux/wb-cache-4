50|$|The RN 8 heads East {{alongside}} the A50 autoroute to Aubagne passing north of Mt. St. Cyr (609 m). The road heads Southeast below the Massif de la <b>Sainte</b> <b>Baume</b> {{and over the}} Col de l'Ange (218 m). The road then passes the Parc d'OK Corral and motor racing circuit Circuit du Castellet Paul Ricard. The road turns South past Le Beausset and the Gorges de Saint Anne {{as well as the}} le Gros Cerveau.|$|E
40|$|Morphologically {{distinct}} {{populations of}} the Gammarus pulex group which should be attributed to at least three species applying morphological criteria postulated by Karaman & Pinkster (1977) {{have been reported in}} the Massif de la <b>Sainte</b> <b>Baume</b> (southern France). These populations proved to be completely interfertile and thus were considered conspecific. This group of populations, in which three major forms A, B and C were distinguished, has been described as Gammarus stupendus Pinkster, 1983. Systematic sampling was carried out to determine the distribution of the various forms of G. stupendus in the Massif de la <b>Sainte</b> <b>Baume</b> and adjacent areas, and the relation between morphological and genetic differentiation has been investigated. Genetic differentiation has been studied in four polymorphic gene loci: Gpi, Got- 1, Mdh- 1, and Mdh- 2. As the populations used in hybridization experiments by Pinkster (1983) proved to be genetically very similar, additional crossbreeding experiments have been carried out with two genetically more distinct populations. Moreover, experiments were run to test the stability of diagnostic characters in each form A, B and C of G. stupendus. No clear correlation could be found between any of the factors morphology, genetic differentiation, and geographic distribution pattern. In the crossbreeding experiments genetically more distinct populations appeared to be incompletely interfertile. Thus, the various G. stupendus populations, exhibiting different degrees of interfertility which may ultimately result in reproductive isolation, may indicate different stages in the process of speciation...|$|E
40|$|The Spirits of the Huveaune (Chemin des Fées) is a {{parcours}} of five permanent public sculptures 'Spirits' that map {{the presence}} of the Huveaune, a coastal river in eastern Provence that originates in the massif of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Baume</b> and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at Marseille, France. The spirit sculptures 'genii loci' invest five locations along the riverbanks and weave an unprecedented link between the past and the present, as they invite visitors to discover a 30 km trail along the Huveaune valley and new ways to explore the history of the valley. Drawing from a research process involving historians and the local community, the historical texts, legends, myths and stories surrounding the foundation of Marsillia, the ancient port of Marseille, recount the strong feminine presence associated with the valley of the Huveaune. The title attributed to the work, Spirits of the Huveaune, also refers to the universal water cycle and raise public awareness of environmental issues related to the river’s fate, questioning water management in the future, here as elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{fundamental}} {{processes involved in}} a severe Mistral event {{that occurred during the}} Mesoscale Alpine Program (from 6 to 9 November 1999). The Mistral refers to a violent north/north-westerly wind blowing in south-eastern France from the Rhône valley to the French Riviera. The study is based on measurements from radiosoundings launched from Lyon and Nîmes and from two UHF wind profilers located near Marseille and Toulon allowing a good description of the flow in the complex terrain formed by the south-western Alps. Observational results are compared with RAMS non-hydrostatic numerical simulations performed with 27 km, 9 km and 3 km nested grids. The numerical simulations capture the flow complexity both upstream of the Alps and in the coastal area affected by the Mistral. They correctly reproduce horizontal wind speeds and directions, vertical velocities, virtual potential temperature and relative humidity documented by the observational network. The simulations are used to point out the main dynamical processes generating the Mistral. It is found that flow splitting around the Alps and around the isolated peaks bordering the south-eastern part of the Rhône valley (Mont Ventoux 1909 m, Massif du Lubéron 1425 m) induces the low-level jet observed near Marseille that lasts for 36 hours. The high-resolution simulation indicates that the transient low-level jet lasting for only 9 hours observed at Toulon is due to a gravity wave breaking over local topography (the <b>Sainte</b> <b>Baume</b> 1147 m) where hydraulic jumps are involved. A mountain wake with two opposite-sign potential-vorticity banners is generated. The mesoscale wake explains the westward progression of the large-scale Alpine wake...|$|E
