5|$|Frigatebirds {{remain in}} the air and do not settle on the ocean. They produce very little oil from their uropygial glands <b>so</b> <b>their</b> {{feathers}} would become sodden if they settled on the surface. In addition, with their long wings relative to body size, they would have great difficulty taking off again.|$|E
5|$|Historically, tigers {{have been}} hunted {{at a large}} scale <b>so</b> <b>their</b> famous striped skins could be collected. The trade in tiger skins peaked in the 1960s, just before {{international}} conservation efforts took effect. By 1977, a tiger skin in an English market {{was considered to be}} worth US$4,250.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do <b>so.</b> <b>Their</b> nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E

5|$|Both spiders and {{scorpions}} are venomous, <b>so</b> <b>their</b> threat displays can {{be considered}} generally aposematic. However, some predators such as hedgehogs and spider-hunting wasps (Pompilidae) actively hunt arachnids, overcoming their defences, so when a hedgehog is startled by, for instance, the sounds made by a scorpion, {{there is reason to}} describe the display as deimatic.|$|E
5|$|Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication. This {{involves}} smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm calls are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained {{by the lack of}} light, <b>so</b> <b>their</b> communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their territory.|$|E
5|$|Male {{cocks-of-the-rock}} are polygamous, {{and have}} nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male’s energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, <b>so</b> <b>their</b> behavior is not easy to see. One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity level as the afternoon period.|$|E

5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, <b>so</b> <b>their</b> {{discovery and}} improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans may {{be killed}} for the {{bushmeat}} trade, crop protection, or for use for traditional medicine. Orangutan bones are secretly traded in souvenir shops in several cities in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Mother orangutans are killed <b>so</b> <b>their</b> infants {{can be sold}} as pets, {{and many of these}} infants die without the help of their mother. Since 2004, several pet orangutans were confiscated by local authorities and sent to rehabilitation centres.|$|E

5|$|The day before, the Ottoman {{government}} had proposed to Wangenheim that a fictitious {{purchase of the}} German ships be arranged, <b>so</b> <b>their</b> presence would not compromise Ottoman neutrality. The next day the German Chancellor had cabled Wagenheim, rejecting the idea and demanding that the Ottomans immediately join the war. The Grand Vizier accosted Wagenheim on the premature arrival of the ships and repeated the demand for a fictitious sale. The Ottoman government subsequently declared that it had purchased both ships for 80 million German marks. On 14 August, Wagenheim advised the German government {{that it would be}} best to go along with the sale, lest they risk angering the Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|The film's budget {{climbed from}} an initial US$150 {{million to a}} then-record-breaking $207 million, making it {{at one point the}} most {{expensive}} film yet made. Universal only agreed to such an outlay after seeing a screening of the unfinished film, to which executives responded enthusiastically. Marketing and promotion costs were an estimated $60 million. The film's length also grew; originally set to be 135 minutes, it soon grew to 200, prompting Universal executives to fly to New Zealand to view a rough cut, but they liked it <b>so</b> <b>their</b> concerns were addressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of Japanese attacks in 1943 put great strain on the Allied forces {{responsible}} for protecting shipping off eastern Australia. The Australian naval authorities were forced in April {{to reduce the number}} of convoys that sailed <b>so</b> <b>their</b> escort could be increased to at least four warships. The RAAF also greatly increased the number of aircraft allocated to escort convoys and ships sailing independently. Further ships and aircraft fitted for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) became available in May, but were still not adequate to counter the Japanese attacks.|$|E
5|$|The star Lambda (λ) Tauri is an {{eclipsing binary}} star. This system {{consists}} of a spectral class B3 star being orbited by a less massive class A4 star. The plane of their orbit lies almost {{along the line of}} sight to the Earth. Every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion. The two stars are separated by only 0.1 astronomical units, <b>so</b> <b>their</b> shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction. This results in a variation of their net magnitude throughout each orbit.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaurids walked {{exclusively}} on their hindlimbs, <b>so</b> <b>their</b> leg bones were massive. In {{contrast to the}} forelimbs, the hindlimbs were longer compared to body size {{than almost any other}} theropods. Juveniles and even some smaller adults, like more basal tyrannosauroids, had longer tibiae than femora, a characteristic of fast-running dinosaurs like ornithomimids. Larger adults had leg proportions characteristic of slower-moving animals, but not to the extent seen in other large theropods like abelisaurids or carnosaurs. The third metatarsals of tyrannosaurids were pinched between the second and fourth metatarsals, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} to world conscience {{was provided by}} an influential 1968 article by Garrett Hardin that critically analyzed the dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of conscience-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and <b>so</b> <b>their</b> continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation {{of the role of}} conscience in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as sustainability and sustainable development of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under United Nations treaties (see common heritage of humanity). Areas designated common heritage of humanity under international law include the Moon, Outer Space, deep sea bed, Antarctica, the world cultural and natural heritage (see World Heritage Convention) and the human genome. It will be a significant challenge for world conscience that as world oil, coal, mineral, timber, agricultural and water reserves are depleted, there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit common heritage of mankind areas.|$|E
