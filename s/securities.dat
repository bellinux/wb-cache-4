5|$|The largest {{shareholder}} on the Arsenal {{board is}} American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke. Kroenke first launched {{a bid for}} the club in April 2007, and faced competition for shares from Red and White <b>Securities,</b> which acquired its first shares off David Dein in August 2007.

Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9%). In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell-Smith and Danny Fiszman, taking his shareholding to 62.89%.

40|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War, <b>security</b> {{approach}} has shifted from state (traditional) to human (nontraditional) <b>security.</b> Unlike traditional <b>security</b> approach which focuses only on threats to states, concern of nontraditional <b>security</b> approach broadens to every aspect of human lives such as economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community, and political. However, as a new approach in <b>security</b> studies, human <b>security</b> seems incompatible to implement in a region which has long embraced traditional <b>security</b> doctrine. While regulated in the Western countries such as Canada and Norway, human <b>security</b> didn’t see serious barriers; but in the Eastern countries, primarily in Southeast Asia, human <b>security</b> is challenged not only by state <b>security,</b> but also comprehensive <b>security</b> and cooperative <b>security</b> which has been existed in the region. Three primary ASEAN states such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore tend to strengthen their national <b>security</b> doctrines rather than to implement human <b>security.</b> Furthermore, ASEAN <b>Security</b> Community as one of ASEAN Community pillars ignores human <b>security.</b> It means thathuman <b>security</b> is hard to implement in this region because its fundamental elements are clash with doctrine of comprehensive and cooperative <b>security.</b> Therefore, human <b>security</b> has to consider its ability to implement without leaving comprehensive and cooperative <b>security</b> values.

40|$|Private <b>security</b> is a multi-disciplined industry, {{requiring}} a {{diverse range of}} knowledge across many domains.

40|$|Abstract—Developing secure {{software}} {{is still a}} software engineering challenge because {{of the complexity of}} software <b>security.</b> Yet integrating <b>security</b> engineering and software engineering is increasingly important, especially for serviceoriented applications, as they are exposed to new <b>security</b> challenges due to their open nature. Current <b>security</b> engineering approaches do not consider existing <b>security</b> architectures, leading to redundant development of <b>security</b> artifacts. Further, present <b>security</b> architecture approaches do not provide relevant information to a <b>security</b> engineering process. Using a service-oriented and <b>security</b> architecturecentric approach for <b>security</b> engineering supports the development of secure service-oriented applications, as existing <b>security</b> solutions can be reused. In this paper a model for service-oriented <b>security</b> architectures is presented, which provides apt information to different consumers, such as <b>security</b> engineering processes and business services, in the form of views to assist the consumers <b>security</b> goals.

5|$|In {{the case}} of Yeap Wai Kong v. Singapore Exchange <b>Securities</b> Trading Ltd. (2012), the High Court {{identified}} various factors {{to determine if the}} decision by Singapore Exchange <b>Securities</b> Trading Ltd. ("SGX-ST") to reprimand a director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange was properly characterized as a public function. These factors include {{the extent to which the}} SGX-ST is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory matrix, whether the reprimand function has a statutory underpinning, and the nature of the reprimand function. Even though the SGX-ST is not a statutory board, it is an approved exchange under section16 of the <b>Securities</b> and Futures Act, which provides that it must take into account the interests of both the investing and general public when discharging its obligations. Also, SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of Singapore's financial sector. Its function to publicly reprimand a listed company's director may potentially result in adverse implications on the company's business reputation and the director's continued service on board committees and directorships of other listed companies. For these reasons, the nature test was satisfied.|$|E

The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were <b>securities.</b> It ordered six LaRouche organizations—Fusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.—to stop their sale. Five other states had already issued injunctions, and 14 states eventually followed. At least one injunction, by the State of Minnesota against Independent Democrats for LaRouche, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which confirmed the lower court ruling.|$|E
