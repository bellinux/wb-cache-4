5|$|The {{station was}} taken into use on 24November 1997, but not {{official}}ly opened until 4January 1998. On {{the day of the}} official opening, the bus terminal {{was taken into}} use. The <b>station</b> <b>costs</b> NOK35 million. At the time, it was estimated to have about 6000 daily users—both boarding and disembarking, including the bus terminal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of construction, the {{railways}} provided a leap in transport for the communities it passed through. NSB saw beautiful and grandeur stations {{as a way to}} draw patronage, and chose, in addition to impressive architecture, to build a park adjacent each stations. As construction went by, funding for stations were reduced, resulting in less grandeur further north. Most stations had two stories and an attic, although some of the stations serving lesser places had smaller buildings. From Steinkjer to Skogn, the ground floors were built in random rubble. As construction continued, budgets were reduced and <b>station</b> <b>costs</b> were cut. From Rinnan to Sparbu, the ground floors were instead built in brick, and from Mære and north, the stations have wooden ground floors. In addition to a station buildings, stations consisted of an outhouse and a freight house; selected stations also featured a water tower and motive power depot.|$|E
25|$|In June 2008, The Local Radio Company, run {{under the}} former chief {{executive}} of 102.2 Jazz FM, Richard Wheatly, signed a three-year deal with GMG Radio to relaunch Jazz FM on DAB. According to The Times, no money exchanged hands in the deal. However, The Telegraph reported that the deal was done for a single pound. The annual report from TLRC published in March 2009 shows that the <b>station</b> <b>costs</b> them £30,000 a month to provide the Jazz FM service on behalf of GMG.|$|E

2500|$|The {{compromise}} involved that Oslo Municipality and Akershus County Road Administration {{would pay}} for the costs exceeding those which had run it the line had been built along the former right-of-way. The new tunnel received a minimum curve radius of , less than the former line. The curvature made the Østfold Line [...] longer. As Bekkelaget Station was located {{on the part of the}} line which would be bypassed, NSB proposed closing the station. Local residents protested and NSB agreed to build a new halt at the southern entrance of the tunnel, [...] south of the former station. The new <b>station</b> <b>costs</b> 340,000 kroner, and way paid jointly by NSB and Oslo Municipality. This station was ultimately closed on 29 May 1983.|$|E
2500|$|Tesla {{designed}} the Model S to allow fast battery swapping, which also facilitates vehicle assembly. At a demonstration Tesla showed a battery swap operation taking around 90 seconds, {{about half the}} time it takes to refill an empty gas tank. In June 2013, Tesla announced plans to deploy Tesla stations, with facilities to support battery pack swaps, although by June 2015 Tesla said that it was unlikely that more battery swap stations would be added. Battery swapping was planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California between San Francisco to Los Angeles, followed by the Washington, D.C. to Boston corridor. Each swapping <b>station</b> <b>costs</b> [...] and stocks about 50 batteries. Owners can pick up their original battery pack fully charged on the return trip, which is included in the swap fee.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} financing plan, {{of using}} the revenues from radio receiver sales to pay <b>station</b> <b>costs,</b> proved to be insufficient {{for a number of}} reasons. Additional expenses included the requirement to pay royalties to musical composers, plus the fact that, unlike the amateur Westinghouse Company staff performers, professional acts started to expect to be paid in something more tangible than publicity. On the revenue side, Westinghouse found that it didn't have the near-monopoly for selling vacuum-tube receivers that it expected it had gotten through the purchase of the commercial rights to the Armstrong regenerative patent. Armstrong had previously sold [...] "amateur and experimental" [...] rights to around 17 small firms, which also began selling receivers to the general public. Westinghouse sued on the grounds that this went beyond their rights, but lost, which resulted in the formation of a series of major competitors, including Crosley and Zenith.|$|E

2500|$|The Bekkelaget Slide {{took place}} on 7 October 1953, when {{a section of the}} ground under the Østfold Line and Mosseveien slid and killed five people in a bus. NSB was aware of the poor {{conditions}} in the ground and had been considering building a tunnel past a section which included the station. The slide was therefore not decisive in deciding to build the tunnel, but rather accelerated the decision to build it. A zoning plan had been decided upon in 1946 and the land had already been expropriated. Part of the land used by the railway was instead taken over and used by Mosseveien. This included demolishing the station building. Local residents protested and NSB agreed to build a new halt at the southern entrance of the tunnel, [...] south of the former station. The new <b>station</b> <b>costs</b> 340,000 kroner, and way paid jointly by NSB and Oslo Municipality. The new station and tunnel both opened on 7 September 1958. The station remained in use until 29 May 1983.|$|E

5000|$|... {{the station}} was at least {{three and a half}} years behind {{schedule}} and more than 50 percent over-budget. Areva and the utility involved [...] "are in bitter dispute over who will bear the cost overruns and there is a real risk now that the utility will default". In August 2009, Areva announced €550 million additional provisions for the build, taking <b>station</b> <b>costs</b> to €5.3 billion, and wiped out interim operating profits for the first half-year of 2009.|$|E
50|$|JFE Engineering Corporation is {{developing}} a quick charge system that it claims can take a battery from zero charge to 50% full in about 3 minutes. It has two batteries, one that stores electrical energy from the grid and another that delivers it to the car at extremely high current (500-600 amps), which allows it to use a low-voltage power supply. The company claims that even though one <b>station</b> <b>costs</b> about $63,000, that’s roughly 40% less than the competing CHAdeMO system.|$|E

5000|$|Electric utility State Grid Corporation of China {{planned to}} build over 2,351 electric-charging and battery-swap {{stations}} by 2016. These {{would have had}} 220,000 charging poles, {{but they did not}} indicate how many, if any, of them would have been battery-swap stations. The director of the State Grid smart grid research center commented [...] "The construction of a large-scale charging <b>station</b> <b>costs</b> 20 to 30 million yuan ($3.05-4.57 million) and a small-scale one costs less than 10 million yuan, but it costs more than 100 million yuan to build a battery-swap station." ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{consideration}} was {{the cost}} of the stations, which was a factor {{of the size of the}} trains. In order to reduce <b>station</b> <b>costs,</b> and {{the cost of}} elevated tracks, the trains would have to be smaller than a normal subway. Finally, to reduce operating costs, the system should be completely automated and have as few moving parts as possible. The new system would be aimed at ridership levels above that of buses, about 5,000 passengers per hour per direction (PPHPD), and subways, at 25,000 PPHPD and over. The result was the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) concept, aimed at ridership levels between 4,000 and 20,000 PPHPD.|$|E
