5|$|A {{review of}} <b>spectacled</b> <b>warbler</b> records was {{initiated}} in 1984. This review {{resulted in the}} species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as a first-year female subalpine warbler, while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. <b>Spectacled</b> <b>warbler</b> has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, {{and there have been}} further subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of moustached warbler, and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, but that one other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, should stand. Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed as part of the 1950–1957 review (see below), and found to be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a breeding pair in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC and found to be unacceptable, leading to the removal of moustached warbler from the British list; it has not re-occurred.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spectacled</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia conspicillata) - first Scillonian {{record on}} 15 October 2000 on Tresco ...|$|E
50|$|These small {{passerine}} {{birds are}} found in dry open country with bushes. 3-6 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush. Like their relatives, the <b>spectacled</b> <b>warbler</b> is insectivorous.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spectacled</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia conspicillata) is {{a species}} in the typical warbler genus Sylvia. The genus name is from Modern Latin silvia, a {{woodland}} sprite, related to silva, a wood. The specific conspicillata is from Latin conspicillum, a place to look from, equivalent to [...] "spectacled".|$|E

50|$|Canarina is a genus of {{flowering}} plants {{within the family}} Campanulaceae. They are herbaceous perennial vines with bell-shaped flowers. The best known species is C. canariensis from the laurel forests of the Canary Islands which is grown as an ornamental plant. Canarina canariensis {{is one of a}} group of unrelated Canarian plants that appear to be adapted for bird pollination, including the members of the genera Isoplexis and Lotus. It was once thought that the original pollinators of these plants were sunbirds which had become extinct on the Canary Islands, explaining why some of these species are rare and considered endangered (Vogel 1954; Vogel et al. 1984; Olesen 1985; Valido et al. 2004). However more recent work has shown that these plants are adequately pollinated by non-specialist flower visiting birds, particularly the Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis) and the Canary Island <b>spectacled</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia conspicillata orbitalis) (Olesen 1985; Ollerton et al. 2008), and in fact show some specific adaptations to infrequent pollination by these birds, such as extended flower lifespans (Ollerton et al. 2008), and a hexose-dominated sugar ratio of the nectar (Dupont et al. 2004).|$|E
40|$|Songbirds with {{recently}} (i. e., early Holocene) founded {{populations are}} suitable models for studying incipient differentiation in oceanic islands. On such systems each colonization event represents a different evolutionary episode {{that can be}} studied by addressing sets of diverging phenotypic and genetic traits. We investigate the process of early differentiation in the <b>spectacled</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia conspicillata) in 14 populations separated by sea barriers from three Atlantic archipelagos and from continental regions spanning from tropical to temperate latitudes. Our approach involved the study of sexual acoustic signals, morphology, and genetic data. Mitochondrial DNA did not provide clear population structure. However, microsatellites analyses consistently identified two genetic groups, albeit without correspondence to subspecies classification and little correspondence to geography. Coalescent analyses showed significant evidence for gene flow between the two genetic groups. Discriminant analyses could not correctly assign morphological or acoustic traits to source populations. Therefore, although theory predicting that in isolated populations genetic, morphological, or acoustic traits can lead to radiation, we have strikingly failed to document differentiation on these attributes in a resident passerine throughout three oceanic archipelagos...|$|E
40|$|A new Isospora (Apicomplexa:Eimeriidae) {{species is}} {{described}} {{from a single}} yellow-throated miner bird (Manorina flavigula) (subspecies M. f. wayensis) in Western Australia. Sporulated oocysts (n = 32) of this isolate are spherical to subspherical, 22. 8 (20. 3 - 23. 8) × 18. 3 (17. 7 - 18. 7) μm, with a shape index (length/width) of 1. 25 (1. 2 - 1. 3); and a smooth and bilayered oocyst wall, 1. 3 μm thick (outer layer 0. 9 μm, inner 0. 4 μm). A polar granule is present, but the micropyle and oocyst residuum are absent. The sporocysts are lemon-shaped, 15. 5 (14. 6 - 15. 8) × 9. 5 (9. 5 - 10. 2) μm, with a shape index of 1. 6. Stieda and substieda bodies are present, the Stieda body being knob-like and the substieda body being subspherical-shaped. A sporocyst residuum is present and composed of numerous granules of different size scattered among the sporozoites, a spheroid or subspheroid refractile body {{is present in the}} sporozoite. Morphologically, the oocysts from this isolate are different from those of all known valid Isospora spp. Molecular analysis was conducted at 3 loci; the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI) gene. At the 18 S locus, this new isolate exhibited 99. 2 % similarity to Isospora gryphoni and three other Isospora spp. Further analysis of a subgroup of 300 bp long 18 S sequences (8), including Isospora anthochaerae was conducted. This new isolate grouped in a clade with I. anthochaerae and exhibited 99. 3 % similarity. At the 28 S locus, this new isolate grouped with I. anthochaerae with which it shared 99. 1 % similarity. At the COI locus, this new isolate exhibited 96. 8 % similarity to Isospora sp. JCI- 2015 from a <b>spectacled</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia conspicillata) in Spain. Further analysis from a subgroup of shorter COI sequences (n = 13) was performed and this new isolate exhibited 99. 1 % similarity to I. anthochaerae. Based on morphological and molecular data, this isolate is a new species of Isospora, which is named Isospora manorinae n. sp. after its host, the yellow-throated miner (Manorina flavigula wayensis) ...|$|E
