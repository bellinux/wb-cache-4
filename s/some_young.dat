5|$|Most house sparrows do {{not move}} {{more than a few}} {{kilometres}} during their lifetimes. However, limited migration occurs in all regions. <b>Some</b> <b>young</b> birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, P. d. bactrianus and P. d. parkini, are predominantly migratory. Unlike the birds in sedentary populations that migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{significant}} human impact {{is a small}} prefabricated hut which is used by researchers while staying on the island. The hut includes a few bunk beds and a solar power source to drive an emergency radio and other key electronics. All visitors check themselves and belongings to ensure no seeds are accidentally introduced by humans to this ecosystem. It is believed that <b>some</b> <b>young</b> boys tried to introduce potatoes, which were promptly dug up once discovered. An improperly handled human defecation resulted in a tomato plant taking root which was also destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius characterizes Urbanus {{as a man}} {{who enjoyed}} some variety in his punishments. One day, shortly after Easter 307, he ordered the virgin Theodosia from Tyre (Ṣūr, Lebanon) thrown to the sea for conversing with Christians {{attending}} trial and refusing sacrifice; the Christians in court, meanwhile, he sent to Phaeno. On a single day, November 2, 307, Urbanus sentenced a man named Domninus to be burned alive, three youths to fight as gladiators, and a priest to be exposed to a beast. On the same day, he ordered <b>some</b> <b>young</b> men to be castrated, sent three virgins to brothels, and imprisoned a number of others, including Pamphilus of Caesarea, a priest, scholar, and defender of the theologian Origen. Soon after, and for unknown reasons, Urbanus was stripped of his rank, imprisoned, tried, and executed, all in one day of expedited proceedings. His replacement, Firmilianus, was a veteran soldier and one of Maximinus's trusted confidants.|$|E

5|$|In his 1931 autobiography, {{the public}} {{relations}} pioneer Harry Reichenbach {{claimed responsibility for the}} controversy surrounding September Morn– and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where <b>some</b> <b>young</b> children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price– from 10 cents to a dollar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the lockout, {{a higher percentage of}} players signed contracts worth the maximum amount possible under the cap. <b>Some</b> <b>young</b> players, such as LeBron James, began signing shorter contracts that allowed for more flexibility in team choice and salary. The agreement expired in 2005, and both sides became concerned about the possibility of another work stoppage. A lockout was prevented, however, when a six-year CBA was reached in June 2005. After the expiration of that CBA, a lockout occurred in 2011; it was the fourth in league history and lasted for about five months before the sides came to an agreement. Each team's schedule in the 2011–12 NBA season was cut by 16 games.|$|E

Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, <b>some</b> <b>young</b> children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.|$|E

5|$|The {{topography}} of the creek's watershed is mountainous in its upper reaches. However, in its lower reaches, the creek flows through a wide valley bordered by steep ridges. The creek's channel is sinuous and flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and limestone, with some iron ore. All of the creek's watershed {{is located in}} the ridge and valley physiographic province. It contains fractured, faulted, and folded sedimentary rocks. While there is <b>some</b> <b>young</b> bedrock in the watershed, parts of it have eroded away to reveal older bedrock, which is more resistant to weathering than the younger bedrock. Old bedrock formations in the watershed include the Tuscarora Formation, the Juniata Formation, and the Bald Eagle Formation. The visible portions of these formations are sandstones and conglomerates. The floor of the Buffalo Creek valley is home to younger carbonates belonging to the Keyser Formation and the Tonoloway Formation.|$|E
5|$|When {{it first}} emerges from its egg, the young red-throated loon {{is covered with}} fine soft down feathers. Primarily dark brown to dark grey above, it is {{slightly}} paler {{on the sides of}} its head and neck, as well as on its throat, chest, and flanks, with a pale grey lower breast and belly. Within weeks, this first down is replaced by a second, paler set of down feathers, which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers. The juvenile's plumage {{is similar to that of}} the adult, though with a few distinguishing features. It has a darker forehead and neck, with heavy speckling on the sides of the neck and the throat. Its back is browner and less speckled, and its underparts are tinged with brown. Its eyes are reddish-brown, and its beak is a pale grey. Though <b>some</b> <b>young</b> birds hold this plumage until mid-winter, many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults, except for their paler bills.|$|E
