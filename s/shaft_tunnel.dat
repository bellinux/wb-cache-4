2500|$|A {{court of}} inquiry convened in Wellington, New Zealand, {{published}} its findings on the sinking in a report dated 15 September 1930; the report was issued by the United Kingdom′s Board of Trade in London on 11 December 1930. The court found that the sinking resulted from a breakage of the starboard propeller shaft that not only punctured Tahiti′s hull at her stern, admitting water to her <b>shaft</b> <b>tunnel</b> – which the court deemed survivable – but also tore {{a hole in the}} bulkhead that divided the <b>shaft</b> <b>tunnel</b> from her engine room and No. 3 hold. The court found that the latter hole ultimately caused the ship to sink, as the increasing weight of water flooding the <b>shaft</b> <b>tunnel</b> widened the hole in the bulkhead despite the crew′s effort to contain the flooding and eventually overwhelmed their damage control efforts. The court found both the crew and officials who had certified the ship′s compliance with standards of seaworthiness blameless in the sinking, stated that the breaking of a propeller shaft was a common event at sea but the level of damage sustained by Tahiti in the breaking of her propeller shaft was exceedingly rare, and determined that Tahiti′s sinking was [...] "due to a peril of the sea which no reasonable human care or foresight could have avoided." ...|$|E

2500|$|The vessel had an {{increased}} baking and a midship deckhouse with underlying engine room. The longitudinal-framed hull was ice-reinforced. Built as a closed shelter-decker, Adele had a grain capacity of [...] and an internal volume of [...] ball steerage. Two {{of the four}} cargo holds were arranged {{in front of the}} bridge structure, two were behind it. The two front rooms were accessible by three hatches, the aft rooms had one hatch each. The cargo consisted of 12 normal light derricks on all hatches and a 25-ton heavy lift on hold 2. The 12 AEG-type winches, manufactured under license by Kampnagel Schaerffe, Hamburg, were designed to lift 3 tons at /min in single gear, or 5 tons at that speed in double gear. Each was driven by an 18.4-kW electric motor. The derricks between the two forward hatches were attached to double post, which served simultaneously as a cargo space ventilation of 20 changes of air per hour, the second front and aft cargo gear was on conventional central derricks. The hatches were fitted with a sliding steel hatch cover, and the main deck was lined with [...] thick Oregon pine to prevent heat radiation, assumably to carry fruits. However, no refrigeration plant was fitted, hence the carriage of any fruit had been restricted to short sea trade, such as from Spain or Canary Islands to North Europe. Besides the <b>shaft</b> <b>tunnel</b> there were cargo tanks.|$|E
60|$|This, however, must be stopped. Jimmy {{remembered that}} he was {{supplied}} with an electric lamp. He fumbled clumsily with the switch, and, as a wavering beam of light ran through the water, he cautiously entered the hold. Sand had filled up the hollows among the stone ballast, {{and there was only}} a broken orlop beam in his way. He began to feel easier, reflecting that he was, after all, only a short distance beneath the surface; though he would have preferred more experienced assistants at the pumps. Making his way aft beside the <b>shaft</b> <b>tunnel,</b> he presently reached a bank of sand which ran up to the splintered deck. The bulkhead shutting off the lazaret was obviously behind it, and Jimmy began to use the shovel.|$|E
40|$|The Norwegian {{hydropower}} {{industry has}} more than 100 {{years of experience in}} constructing the unlined pressure <b>shafts</b> and <b>tunnels.</b> Most of the hydropower projects have long waterway systems consisting unlined high pressure shafts, underground powerhouse cavern, headrace and tailrace tunnels. The maximum static head reached with unlined pressure <b>shaft</b> and pressure <b>tunnel</b> concept is 1047 meter, which is equivalent to almost 10. 5 MPa. It is obvious that the rock mass in the periphery of unlined <b>shafts</b> and <b>tunnels</b> experience high hydrostatic pressure exerted by the flowing water discharge. Experienced gained from the construction and operation of these unlined pressure <b>shafts</b> and <b>tunnels</b> were useful to develop design criterion and principles applied here in the Scandinavia. This paper reviews some of the first attempts of the use of unlined pressure <b>shaft</b> and <b>tunnel</b> concepts, highlights major failure cases, reviews and evaluates the triggering factors for the failure and also discusses about the gradual development of design criterion for the unlined pressure <b>shafts</b> and <b>tunnels.</b> The authors consider this review is a first step in the upgrade on this innovative concept, which could be used in other geological and tectonic environment than of the Scandinavia, such as in the Himalaya...|$|R

Her fuel capacity was specified to be [...] "not less than 4,950 tons", and she had bunker oil tanks in her double bottom, aft peak, and between her machinery space and No. 3 hold.

60|$|The beam he {{attacked}} was soft, but two bolts ran {{through it and}} an iron strap was clamped along its edge. The rotten timber tore away in flakes, but Jimmy could not break out a large piece, and the iron fastenings deflected his bar. He glanced at his companion, who encouraged him by a gesture; and then fell to work again with determined energy. He {{did not know how}} long he continued, but he was disturbed by a movement of the water and saw Clay swaying slackly to and fro. It looked as if he were about to fall, but his heavy boots and buoyant dress kept him upright. Still he might go down, and Jimmy knew {{that it is hard to}} recover one’s balance in a diving dress. Clay must be got out at once. Jimmy seized his arm and made his way toward the opening, thrusting his companion along the side of the <b>shaft</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{went down}} the ladder and Clay {{followed}} him steadily across the sand. The tide was low, the stream slack, and the dim green water was filled with strange refractions of the growing light above. The sloop rode overhead, a patch of opaque shadow, and the wreck loomed up, black and shapeless, in front. They reached her without trouble, and Jimmy switched on his lamp and carefully cleared Clay’s air-pipe and line before he crawled into the dark gap. The man seemed to move with greater ease and confidence than he had shown on the previous day, and Jimmy felt reassured as he guided him {{along the side of}} the <b>shaft</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Glancing at the long streamers of weed that wavered mysteriously through the gloom, he remembered the sense of fear and shrinking he had had to overcome on his first few descents. It looked as if he need not be anxious about his companion.|$|E
60|$|They {{carefully}} fastened on his dress, {{but when}} Bethune {{gave him a}} few instructions he said his own man had told him all {{he needed to know}} during the voyage. Jimmy put on his helmet and went first down the ladder, waiting at the bottom for Clay. It was, he felt, a strange experience to be walking along the sea-floor with {{a man who had been}} his enemy; but he was now master of the situation. Indeed, he had to help his companion when they reached the entrance to the hold and he did not think that Clay could have crept up the dark passage between the <b>shaft</b> <b>tunnel</b> and the hanging weed on the ship’s crushed side without his assistance. Their lamps glimmered feebly through the water that sucked in and out, and it was no easy matter to keep signal-lines and air-pipes clear. Clay, however, though awkward and somewhat feeble in his movements, showed no want of nerve.|$|E

The fellow {{certainly}} found two or three mechanics, and once I crawled into the <b>shaft</b> <b>tunnel</b> to watch them at work. As {{it was impossible to}} get the damaged length out, they worked at it in place, crouching awkwardly in an iron tube about four feet wide while they cut slots in the iron. There was hardly room to use the hammer and hold the chisel; black oil washed about the tunnel mixed with salt-water that had come in through a strained gland. Open lamps smoked and flickered close above their heads as she rolled and the air was foul; but they kept it up in turns with the ship’s engineers for several days while the weather got worse and the boat lurched along before an angry sea with her canvas set. The decks were wet because the big rollers that came up astern splashed in across her rail. It was bitterly cold and a gray haze shut in the horizon. As the captain could get no sights, he had to make his course by dead reckoning, which is seldom accurate.” ...|$|E
