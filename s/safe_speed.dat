5|$|Sensors {{activate}} audible sirens near each {{entrance of}} the tunnel if a vehicle above the posted height attempts to enter the tunnel. Traffic signals at that entrance will turn red, stopping all traffic. The entrance will remain closed until the vehicle {{is removed from the}} freeway, sometimes causing severe delays for all traffic. CDOT noted that prior to the retrofit, about 20,000 vehicles per year tripped the alarm. The trucking industry argued that many of these trucks were under the height requirement but tripped the alarm due to their air suspensions (which can be lowered during their journey through the tunnel) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer. During this time, the trucking industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80% if the clearance could be raised even a few inches. Another feature of the retrofit monitors truck weight—a <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> for each truck on the 7% grades and curves just outside the tunnel is calculated and displayed for each driver.|$|E
25|$|When {{speed limits}} are arbitrary, {{such as when}} set through {{political}} rather than empirical processes, the speed limit's relationship to the maximum <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> is weakened or intentionally eliminated. Therefore, a crash can be counted as speed-related even if it occurs at a <b>safe</b> <b>speed,</b> simply because the speed was in excess of a politically determined limit.|$|E

25|$|To {{prevent a}} runaway due to loss of brake pressure, dynamic (rheostatic) braking can be {{utilized}} so the locomotive(s) will assist in retarding the train. Often, blended braking, the simultaneous application of dynamic and train brakes, {{will be used}} to maintain a <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> and keep the slack bunched on descending grades. Care would then be given when releasing the service and dynamic brakes to prevent draw-gear damage caused by a sudden run out of the train's slack.|$|E
25|$|On March 27, 2006, Alexander and Maria Kotai filed {{a lawsuit}} against BC Ferries for negligence, {{claiming}} that the company failed to train the crew adequately, supervise the bridge crew, keep proper lookout, operate at a <b>safe</b> <b>speed,</b> and conduct the evacuation to prevent or minimize injuries. The Kotais were moving house at the time from Kitimat to Nanaimo, and lost many of their personal possessions in the sinking. The amount of damages that they are seeking has not been specified.|$|E
25|$|During a caution {{period the}} safety car (which {{generally}} {{consists of an}} aptly modified high-performance production car) enters the track ahead of the leader. Depending on the regulations in effect, competitors are not normally allowed to pass the safety car or other competitors during a caution period, and the safety car leads the field at a pre-determined <b>safe</b> <b>speed,</b> which may vary by series and circuit. At {{the end of the}} caution period, the safety car leaves the track and the competitors resume normal racing. The first reliance on this safety measure occurred with the deployment of a pace car during the inaugural Indianapolis 500 in 1911.|$|E

25|$|The Automatic Train Protection {{sub-system}} uses coded {{track circuit}} technology originally supplied by Rochester, New York-based General Railway Signal when {{the line was}} constructed in the 1970s. It is a life-critical system that provides a continuous stream of information to the train regarding the maximum <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> via the running rails. Speed commands are designed to ensure trains maintain a safe stopping distance from any obstruction and do not exceed the speed limit for any segment of track. The system stops trains in advance of any other train traffic, and before stop signals at interlockings. The cab signalling system relies on track circuits to detect track occupancy, and thus send the appropriate speed code. Although the ATP system {{was designed to be}} fail-safe, the track circuit control equipment on which it relies has been prone to parasitic oscillations which can cause the system intermittently to fail to detect the presence of a train. This resulted in the 2009 collision, after which Metro began to operate all trains manually. In September 2014, Metro began reintroducing its computerized control system after taking a number of measures to avoid accidents similar to the 2009 accident.|$|E
500|$|Whiting replied on Sunday, June 19, {{expressing his}} {{surprise}} that Michelin had not brought suitable tyres, {{suggesting that the}} teams should limit their drivers to the maximum <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> specified by Michelin in Turn 13. He also addressed several solutions which had been proposed by the teams, insisting that use of the new specification tyres flown in overnight would be [...] "a breach of the rules to be considered by the stewards", and the placement of a chicane in the turn was [...] "out of the question"– the race would not be sanctioned by the FIA (making it a non-championship race) if the track layout was changed. He deemed the Michelin teams' proposals to be [...] "grossly unfair" [...] to the Bridgestone teams.|$|E
500|$|On 24 July 1940, almost 40 Bf 109s of III./JG 26 {{took off}} for {{operations}} over the English Channel—a phase of the battle known as the Kanalkampf. They were met by 12 54 Squadron Spitfires. The Spitfires forced the larger number of Bf 109s into a turning battle that ran down the Germans' fuel. Galland recalled being impressed by the Spitfire's ability to outmanoeuvre Bf 109s at low speed and to turn into the Bf 109s within little airspace. Only by executing a [...] "Split S" [...] (a half-roll onto his back, followed by pulling into a long, curving dive) that the Spitfire could not follow without exceeding its maximum <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> and risking structural failure, could his aircraft escape back to France at low altitude. The II./Jagdgeschwader 52 covered their retreat, losing two Bf 109s to Spitfires from No. 610 Squadron. During the action, two Spitfires were shot down {{for the loss of}} four Bf 109s. Galland was shocked by the aggression shown by pilots he believed to be relatively inexperienced. Galland later said he realised there would be no quick and easy victory.|$|E

40|$|A {{key element}} of the Safer Journeys {{national}} road safety strategy is <b>safer</b> <b>speeds.</b> In most cases this means lower speeds, both urban and rural. This research considers the level of acceptance of reduced speed limits and forms part of a NZTA research project on the compliance and acceptance of <b>safer</b> <b>speeds.</b> Both aspects are important as higher levels of acceptance of reduced speed limits are {{likely to lead to}} higher levels of compliance. In the absence of acceptance of reduced speed limits then higher levels of speed enforcement and more expensive engineering treatments are likely to be required to get better compliance. The paper presents the results of a literature review and web survey on the acceptance of reduced speed limits, in both urban and rural areas in New Zealand. The acceptance web survey examines drivers understanding of the effects of speed on crash occurrence, including more severe crashes. It seeks to understand drivers current speed choices in both low and high speed areas and their attitudes to reducing speed limits in various speed environments. Drivers are also asked about the type of supporting information that is often provided with reduced speed limits, such as <b>safer</b> <b>speed</b> areas, schools and high crash area...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} hour of time trials, early runs filled the field to 33 cars. Several drivers put in <b>safe</b> <b>speeds,</b> {{including}} John Andretti, Alex Lloyd, Bruno Junqueira, and Sarah Fisher. A. J. Foyt IV parted ways with his grandfather's team and Jaques Lazier was drafted as his replacement.|$|R
2500|$|Drivers are {{required}} to drive at a <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> for conditions. [...] In the United States, this requirement {{is referred to as}} the basic rule, but more generally in Britain and elsewhere in common law as the reasonable man requirement.

2500|$|A good passage {{plan will}} include a track line laid out upon the best-scale charts available. [...] This track is judged with respect to at least nine {{separate}} criteria given in the Guidelines including under-keel clearance, <b>safe</b> <b>speed,</b> air draft, the use of routing and reporting services (TSS and VTS), {{and the availability of}} contingencies in case of emergency.|$|E
2500|$|The line is {{equipped}} with an Automatic Train Operation system (ATO); the train operator [...] closes the train doors and presses a pair of [...] "start" [...] buttons, and if the way ahead is clear, the ATO drives the train at a <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> to the next station. This system has operated since the line opened in 1968, making the Victoria line the world's first full-scale automatic railway.|$|E
50|$|Another {{version of}} the moving block system would be the {{location}} computers on the trains itself. Each train determines its location in relation {{to all the other}} trains and sets its <b>safe</b> <b>speeds</b> using this data. Less wayside equipment is required compared to the off-train system but the number of transmissions is much greater.|$|R

50|$|In speed mode the {{throttle}} is positioned {{to attain a}} set target speed. This mode controls aircraft <b>speed</b> within <b>safe</b> operating margins. For example, if the pilot selects a target speed which is slower than stall speed, or a speed faster than maximum speed, the autothrottle system will maintain a speed closest to the target speed that is {{within the range of}} <b>safe</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
2500|$|It {{soon became}} clear that the spar in the right wing had broken and the outer section of the wing had been torn away by the airstream. The lower boom (or lower flange) in the wing spar had failed in upward bending at station 323 due to extreme overload. [...] The wing had been {{overloaded}} while the aircraft was flying at very high speed, probably in excess of the maximum <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> of [...] indicated airspeed. As an immediate consequence of the aircraft's gyrations during failure of the right wing, the right tailplane had also been subjected to excessive forces and had separated from the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{water tank}} sits {{on top of}} the boiler like a saddle sits atop a horse. [...] Usually the tank is curved in cross-section, {{although}} in some cases there were straight sides surmounted by a curve (like an inverted 'U'), or even an ogee shape (a concave arc flowing into a convex arc). Saddle tanks were a popular arrangement especially for smaller locomotives in industrial use. It gave a greater water supply, but limited the size of the boiler and restricted access to it for cleaning. However, the locomotive has a higher centre of gravity and hence must operate at lower speeds. The driver's vision may also be restricted, again restricting the <b>safe</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Latécoère 340 flew for {{the first}} time in February 1930 at Saint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque, piloted by Prévot. [...] During that month and the next, the aircraft's trials went promisingly. [...] It seemed to have the {{calculated}} performance and could maintain height under full load on the power of two engines. [...] However, on 2 April 1930 it was demonstrated to a French Navy official. It broke up in the air, killing both Prévot and his mechanic Hoff. [...] The accident was ascribed to pilot error, with the suggestion that in his enthusiasm to demonstrate the aircraft's potential, Prévot exceed the <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> range. It was the end of the programme, and F-AKDI was the only one built.|$|E
40|$|Speeding {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to road injuries and fatalities and remains prevalent. Changing community perceptions about speeding is an important priority. Austroads commissioned research to identify a range of potential interventions for future trial and evaluation aimed at creating, increasing, and/or sustaining public demand for <b>safer</b> <b>speeds.</b> This project had three phases: a literature review; consultations with key stakeholders regarding intervention options (including feasibility, and likely benefits and costs of identified interventions); and providing research results, including recommendations for future phases of the program of work. The literature review {{led to the development of}} a draft Campaign Strategy targeting nine aims across three themes underpinning this research: 1) creating, 2) increasing, and 3) sustaining public demand for <b>safer</b> <b>speeds</b> on the road. Twenty-one stakeholders commented on the suitability and feasibility of, and likely barriers to, countermeasures within the draft Campaign Strategy and its applicability to the Australian and New Zealand context. There was overwhelming positive support for the proposed Campaign Strategy by the majority of respondents; many, noting that it addressed key misperceptions and complemented many existing approaches. A small number of respondents expressed some concerns with various aspects. Stakeholder feedback was incorporated into the final proposed Campaign Strategy to enhance its potential effectiveness. Wide diversity across jurisdictions makes the recommendation of individual interventions for specific areas problematic. Individual jurisdictions should consider a range of costs and benefits of the proposed Campaign Strategy to determine the likely feasibility from their unique perspective. Issues to be addressed when considering implementation of the proposed Campaign Strategy include speed limit setting policies, resourcing, messaging and advertising strategies, and political will associated with promoting <b>safer</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R

The extra space allows an exiting vehicle to stop for a {{pedestrian}} without obstructing through traffic. Each crosswalk may traverse a pedestrian island for protection that also forces drivers to slow and begin to change direction, encouraging slower, <b>safer</b> <b>speeds.</b> On the island, the crosswalk may become diagonal, to direct the gaze of those crossing into exiting traffic.|$|R

2500|$|Accident {{investigators}} {{studied a}} scientific report titled The Thunderstorm {{published in the}} USA in 1949. This report proposed that where two thunderstorms were separated, edge to edge, by less than [...] there was a likelihood of severe turbulence in the clear air between the two. The accident investigators believed it was likely that Flight 325, while flying west between two mature thunderstorms, encountered strong turbulence that caused the crew to lose control and the aircraft to lose {{a significant amount of}} height and enter the thunderstorm to the south of the airport. While flying north, possibly in an attempt to escape the thunderstorm, the crew encountered continuing strong turbulence that caused control to be lost again. The aircraft accelerated to its maximum <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> or faster and while the crew were struggling to regain control the aircraft was suddenly subjected to extreme turbulence that caused the right wing and the right tailplane to fail.|$|E
2500|$|Flight 2415 {{took off}} from Moscow-Sheremetyevo International Airport despite bad weather at 6:53 local time.

[...] The plane {{took off from}} the runway at a <b>safe</b> <b>speed</b> of 290 km/h. [...] After takeoff the pilots reduced engine power and radioed the control tower for instructions to proceed. [...] The crew was instructed to head on a bearing of 265°; [...] the pilots performed the maneuver by setting the ailerons for banking to the right. [...] After banking 265° the aircraft continued to bank to the right, losing altitude and picking up speed in the process, putting the aircraft into a steep dive.
