40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{incidence}} of anastomotic stricture varies {{due to the}} different definitions given to the condition. In most cases they are asymptomatic, {{and if there are}} symptoms, they are usually those of a partial intestinal obstruction. Case reportThe case is presented of an 80 year old patient who underwent a lower anterior resection for rectal neoplasm. After ileostomy closure, he presented with subocclusive symptoms caused by stenosis of colorectal anastomosis. This stenosis was managed with endoscopic dilations, and one of these dilations produced an anastomotic perforation with pneumoperitoneum, retropneumoperitoneum, and pneumothorax. Once the patient was clinically and haemodynamically stable, the perforation was treated with conservative measures, resolving the complication satisfactorily. ConclusionsThe literature describes several management options for colorectal anastomoses strictures, such as <b>surgical</b> resection, <b>rubber</b> dilators, endoscopic dilation, all of which might produce colonic perforation. Its management ranges from conservative measures to surgical intervention...|$|R

40|$|Background: Barrier {{membrane}} {{helps in}} periodontal regeneration by preventing {{the migration of}} epithelial cells and cells from the gingival connective tissue onto the root surface. Different types of membranes {{have been used to}} regenerate periodontal tissues.

Case Description: A female patient aged 20 years with localized aggressive periodontal disease participated in this clinical report. Infrabony defect in the lower anterior region was selected for <b>surgical</b> treatment. <b>Rubber</b> dam was trimmed to cover the defect. Orthodontic treatment was done for the realignment of malpositioned teeth 1 year after the surgery and patient was followed up for a period of 3 years after surgery.

40|$|About one in 4000 {{babies in}} the United States is born with their esophageal {{disconnected}} and separated by a gap, which is called esophageal atresia. Esophageal atresia with a relatively short gap can be directly corrected with surgery, whereas babies with a relatively long gap requires a treatment over several weeks to stretch the esophageal pouches. In this thesis, we have designed and developed a hydraulically controlled bougienage system {{as a case study}} for correction of long-gap esophageal atresia. We insert two magnetic bougies into the esophageal pouches and applying stretching force. The key idea is to employ the magnetic force between the two bougies. The bougie is designed based on a piston mechanism, which consists of a barrel and a magnetic plunger. The plunger has a through hole in the center, so that we can push water into the piston to extend the barrel. A catheter is connected to the bougie to transfer the water. Also, the catheter is driven using a friction drive placed near the mouth, which adjusts the neutral gap size between the two magnets. A syringe pump pushes water through the catheter to extend the tip of the bougie. Therefore, the system can stretch the esophageal pouch without changing the gap size between the two magnets, which helps to apply the stretching force in a controllable manner. The piston mechanism also enables measurement of the stretching force while the bougienage is being performed. A prototype bougienage system is built and integrated on a test bench, in which <b>surgical</b> <b>rubber</b> tubing is used as a mock-up of the esophagus. We have experimentally demonstrated that the prototype bougienage system can stretch the mock-up by a desired amount of force. Also, we have shown that the bougie can reliably measure the stretching force when the O-ring friction is compensated with dither. This bench level experiment shows promising results and forms the basis for further efforts towards utilization in patients. by Minkyun Noh. Thesis: S.

40|$|The large {{wounds of}} the body wall, due to traumas, removal of tumors or {{prolonged}} laparostomies are a difficult surgical challenge with complex treatment. This paper presents {{the efficacy of the}} closure of large <b>surgical</b> wounds using <b>rubber</b> elastic bands. One or two circular rubber elastic bands were sutured under mean tension at the opposite edges of 22 large wounds located in different body sites. These rubber strips were replaced when they were broken or re-fixed when they have lost their tension until the complete closure of the wounds. Complete closure was achieved without any other surgical procedure or device in 21 wounds and one wound reduced its dimensions. No major complication due to this treatment was verified. The synthesis of large wounds with rubber elastic bands kept under mean tension is a simple, efficacious and inexpensive surgical option that may be useful for treatment in several circumstances.

5000|$|He also {{devised a}} metal-armoured double {{loophole}} {{that would protect}} the sniper observer from enemy fire. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them.

Some were equipped with <b>rubber</b> <b>surgical</b> tubing so the dummy could [...] "smoke" [...] a cigarette and thus appear realistic.

40|$|Three popular solid {{substrates}} (<b>surgical</b> tape, silicone <b>rubber</b> and EPDM rubber) {{were investigated}} {{to examine the}} lubrication properties of water, aqueous protein solution (3. 9 % solids), skim (0. 1 % fat) and full fat (3. 8 % fat) milk samples with reference with their dry contacts. It was observed that the tribological properties of the test fluids were greatly affected by the physical properties of the solid substrates, particularly wettability. Surgical tape surface, having similar wettability and surface roughness {{to the surface of}} the human tongue, appeared to be the best substrate for tribological investigations because of its ability to differentiate dairy solutions with different compositions. Silicone rubber and EPDM rubber, on the other hand, showed the same friction for all the dairy fluids and were thereby not suitable for this tribology test. For very hydrophobic surface like EPDM rubber, the tribological result is governed by the entrapment of air pockets between the solid substrate and the test fluid; therefore, it cannot be explained solely by its physical properties measured in static condition...|$|R
40|$|RACIONAL: As grandes feridas da parede corpórea, decorrentes de traumas extensos, retirada de tumores ou laparostomias prolongadas constituem um desafio cirúrgico de difícil solução. OBJETIVO: Mostrar a eficácia da aproximação das bordas de grandes feridas, utilizando tira elástica de borracha. MÉTODO: Uma ou duas tiras elásticas de borracha (gominha circular) foram suturadas sob tensão moderada às bordas opostas de 21 grandes feridas, em diversas localizações corpóreas. Essas tiras eram substituídas, quando rompiam, ou refixadas, quando perdiam a tensão, até obter-se a aproximação completa das bordas das feridas. RESULTADO: Em todos os casos houve o fechamento completo das feridas, sem outro procedimento ou artifício auxiliar. Não ocorreu complicação maior decorrente desse tratamento. CONCLUSÃO: A síntese de grandes feridas corpóreas com tiras de borracha mantidas sob tensão moderada é uma alternativa simples, eficaz e de custo baixo, que pode ser utilizada em muitas circunstâncias cirúrgicas.
