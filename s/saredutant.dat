50|$|<b>Saredutant</b> (SR-48,968) is a {{drug that}} acts as a NK2 {{receptor}} antagonist. It was under development by Sanofi-Aventis as a novel antidepressant and anxiolytic and made it to phase III clinical trials. However, in May 2009, Sanofi-Aventis published its quarterly results and announced the cessation of 14 research/development projects, among which was <b>saredutant</b> for the treatment of major depressive disorder.|$|E

But SP (20 nmol/kg, i. v.) {{was able to}} induce salivation, and plasma extravasation in the bladder and the trachea {{significantly}} (P 0. 05). R 116301 (ID 50 = 0. 7 mumol/kg) and R 115614 (ID 50 = 1. 2 mumol/kg) were able to inhibit the salivation response significantly (P septide (7. 9) (both NK 1 receptor agonists) > neurokinin A (NKA) (7. 7) > SP (7. 6) > GR 64349 (NK 2 receptor agonist) (7. 0). For the NK 1 receptor antagonists, the rank order of potency (based on pKB/pA 2 values) to inhibit ileal contraction was: R 116301 (7. 8 - 8. 2) ≈ R 115614 (7. 7 - 8. 3) > CP- 99, 994 (6. 4 - 7. 3) against various NK 1 receptor agonists. Furthermore, NK 2 receptor antagonist <b>saredutant</b> (pA 2 = 7. 3) competitively antagonised GR 64349 -induced ileal contraction. When injected intracerebroventricularly, SP (100 nmol), septide, [Sar 9 Met(O 2) 11] SP, NKA (all at 30 nmol), GR 64349 (10 and 30 nmol), and senktide (NK 3 receptor agonist) (3 - 30 nmol) significantly induced emesis in Suncus murinus (P< 0. 05). They were also effective in inducing locomotor hyperactivity, ano-genital grooming, circling, face washing, hindlimb licking, scratching, and straub tail (3 - 30 nmol, P< 0. 05). R 116301 and R 115614 (both at 3 and 10 mumol/kg, s. c.) significantly antagonised some {{of the actions of}} the agonists including emesis, locomotor hyperactivity, ano-genital grooming, licking, scratching, and straub tail (P< 0. 05). <b>Saredutant</b> and NK 3 receptor antagonist osanetant (both at 30 mumol/kg, s. c.) attenuated emesis induced by GR 64349 and senktide respectively (P< 0. 05). <b>Saredutant</b> (30 mumol/kg, s. c.) was also able to inhibit GR 64349 -induced face washing and scratching, while osanetant (30 mumol/kg, s. c.) also significantly attenuated senktide-induced straub tail (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The tachykinin {{family of}} {{peptides}} are {{distributed throughout the}} nervous system and are thought to {{play a critical role}} in inflammation and immunomodulation. Tachykinins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases and disease processes including inflammatory pain, emesis, depression, Parkinson’s disease and inflammatory bowel syndrome. In the airways of animals, substance P and neurokinin A are released from a subset of airway sensory nerves, and evoke vasodilatation, bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, leukocyte recruitment, airways hyperreactivity and cough. These observations have led to suggestions that tachykinins may also be viable targets for the treatment of obstructive airways disease. Clinical trials in humans assessing the utility of tachykinin receptor antagonists such as nepadutant and <b>saredutant</b> for the treatment of asthma are limited, and the results for the most part have been inconclusive. Several new tachykinin receptor antagonists have been recently designed to target multiple tachykinin receptor subtypes and to readily penetrate into the central nervous system. Future clinical trials with these compounds should help to shed some light on the role of tachykinins in obstructive airways disease. Copyright 2004 Adis Data Information B...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the role of tachykinins in cough induced by citric acid (0. 8 M) in pigs. With this object, we have studied the effect of citric acid on substance P content in the tracheo-bronchial tree and the effects of substance P and of tachykinin receptor antagonists on citric acid-induced cough. Citric acid exposure significantly increased substance P concentration in both broncho-alveolar and tracheal lavage fluids, while it decreased significantly the substance P content in tracheal mucosa. Substance P did not elicit cough, but significantly potentiated the citric acid-induced cough frequency. Tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) or NK(3) receptor antagonists, SR 140333 (nolpitantium), SR 48968 (<b>saredutant)</b> and SR 142801 (osanetant), respectively, significantly inhibited citric acid-induced cough. The same inhibitory effect of tachykinin receptor antagonists was observed, when substance P was nebulised before citric acid challenge. We conclude that citric acid induces in pigs a release of substance P in the tracheo-bronchial tree, which plays a sensitising role on the cough reflex. The involvement of tachykinin NK(1), NK(2), NK(3) receptors are also demonstrated in this reflex. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this report covers two areas of investigation: 1) Devolatilisation of Isotopically Labelled Aromatics via Ge-based Phase-tagging: Isotopically labelled compounds are widely used within the pharmaceutical industry as trace quantities can be easily detected making them ideal for ADME studies on potential drug substances and their metabolites. Generic protocols for the phase-tagged synthesis of aryl-containing. intermediates from C 4 C]-bromobenzene (PhBr) and [14 C]-phenol (PhOH) have been developed. The protocols involve devolatilisation of the above mentioned intermediates {{during the early stages}} of synthesis thus avoiding health, environme' 1 tal, regulatory and cost issues associated with incomplete isotopic containment. In particular, this chemistry has been developed {{in the context of the}} synthesis of N-Bn- 4 -acetylamino- 4 -phenylpiperidine, a key precursor to numerous neuroexcitatory pharmaceuticals including the Sanofi-Aventis neurokinin antagonist <b>saredutant</b> (SR- 48968). The key elaboration steps are Ir-catalysed borylation, Suzuki cross-coupling and Mn-catalysed hydration. The approach constitutes a general strategy for the safe preparation of aryl-containing radiolabelled materials. 2) Towards the Total Synthesis of (+) -Lycorine: Work towards the development of a short asymmetric synthesis of the anti-tumour alkaloid (+) Iycorine using 1, 4 -addition to a cyclic enone and a refro-Cope elimination as key steps has been carried out. As part of this investigation, the diastereoselectivity of 1, 4 -addition of the lithium enolate of methyldithioacetate (. LMDTA) to 4 - 0 -TBS-cyclohex- 2 -en- 1 -one was examined in detail. This study has revealed an intriguing temperature dependent stereodivergency of this process. By controlling the reaction conditions either frans- or cis-selective conjugate addition could be achieved, allowing access to stereochemically defined products previously difficult to access by any other means.
