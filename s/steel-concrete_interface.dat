While {{a lot of effort}} has been devoted to understanding flexural behaviour of such structures, up to now shear strength is an open issue. In this work, an experimental and numerical study on shear response of RC-SJ beams based on a preliminary test campaign is presented. Nine specimens were tested until collapse, which occurred due to shear failure. Numerical models obtained through the use of ABAQUS code were created, and different <b>steel–concrete</b> <b>interfaces</b> were used for the bottom steel plate.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{critical}} analysis of the studies which, since the 1950 s, have attempted to quantify the influence of specimen shape on the determination of concrete compressive strength, with special regard {{to the problem of}} conversion from cylinder to cube strength and vice versa. From such a retrospective analysis, it emerges that the problem of contact between the platens of the testing machine and the concrete specimen plays a crucial role for the explanation of the variability of the concrete compressive strength as a function of specimen shape. To obtain quantitative predictions and to investigate on the influence of the friction coefficient, uniaxial compressive tests are numerically simulated by using a nonlinear finite element model. Both the constitutive nonlinearity of concrete and the nonlinearity due to contact are taken into account in the formulation. The results of the proposed parametric analysis permit to evaluate the evolution of the conversion ratio between cylinder and cube strength {{as a function of the}} friction coefficient. This sheds a new light on the complex nature of this nonlinear relationship, whose value approaches 1 for a friction coefficient close to 0. 01, simulating the presence of Teflon, and then approaches asymptotically 0. 78 for f = 0. 60, as is typical of <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>interfaces...</b>|$|R

The guided waves propagate in a steel plate bonded to concrete substrate, and the analysis aims {{to characterize the}} <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>interface.</b> The modal solutions of guided waves in well-bonded, partially bonded, and dis-bonded interface cases are obtained using the Global Matrix technique. The analytical solutions demonstrate that the attenuation characteristics of the fundamental symmetric (S 0) guided wave mode in the steel plate {{are sensitive to the}} <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>interface</b> bond condition. The attenuation behavior of the S 0 mode are captured and extracted from the complete guided wave signal set obtained by air-coupled ultrasonic tests. Using f-k domain signal analysis, the fundamental anti-symmetric (A 0) mode is suppressed and the S 0 mode is isolated. The S 0 mode attenuation across the scanned spatial points is then estimated and used to characterize the bond condition of the <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>interface.</b> This signal processing approach is verified by a series of numerical simulation and laboratory-scale experiments.

40|$|Abstract. Although <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>interface</b> has {{significant}} influence on bonding strength and shear strength, the composite structure with the consideration of the interface fracture has been rarely conducted. In this study, sensitivity analyses are performed to find out <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>interface</b> characteristics by using interface finite elements, defined as elastic-plastic behavior. In order to verify computational accuracy, the analyzed interface properties are compared with experimental results. Generally, interface in steel-concrete composite structure plays a critical role of controlling bonding strength as well as transferring loads between steel and concrete. The composite interface should be avoided to reach to an interface fracture condition; otherwise composite structure may deviate from intended behavior even under low stress state. It is then led to catastrophic fracture or collapse of the structure. This study shows that interface properties of steel-concrete can be analyzed by using the interface element, and the results provide more reliable prediction for the steel-concrete composite behavior...|$|E

External confinement {{in the form of}} steel rings was advocated to restrict the lateral dilation of CFST columns in order to maintain an intact <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>interface</b> bonding arising from the difference in the Poisson ratios of steel and concrete. To study the effectiveness of the external ring confinement, uni-axial loading tests were carried out on 5 CFST column specimens with and without rings. All the specimens were tested under uni-axial compression in a 5, 000 kN testing machine. From the test results obtained, it is evident that: (1) The external rings could improve the uni-axial strength and stiffness of the CFST columns; (2) The Poisson's ratio of ring-confined CFST columns is smaller than that of the unconfined CFST columns; (3) The Poisson's ratio of the ring-confined CFST columns are all smaller than or close to 0. 2, which is the commonly accepted Poisson's ratio of concrete.

Concrete/mortar corrosion cells with cast-in mild steel electrodes representing the reinforcement were exposed for wetting-drying cycles or submerged in NaCl solution. ParalIei field exposure testes were carried out in sea water. The microstructure of the <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>interface</b> was altered by introduction of a filter paper on the steel surface, by bending of the steel electrode and by compaction voids or cracks formed at or close to the steel surface. The results indicated that corrosion in most cases was initiated in deformed parts of steel electrodes. Defects introduced at or close to the steel surface had a strong negative influence on the chloride threshold for concrete exposed to wetting and drying and for field exposed concrete exposed submerged or in the splash zone, but not for submerged laboratory exposed concrete.
