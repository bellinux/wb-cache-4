40|$|Abstract [...] The {{responses}} of the <b>striped</b> <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle,</b> Trypodendron lineatum (Olivier) (Coteoptera: Scolytidae), to modified rainpipe traps baited with the host attractant ethanol, the aggregation pheromone lineatin, both alone and in combination, were studied in a wind tunnel. Exposure of males to ethanol increased their frequency of steady, upwind flight; however, only lineatin was effective in inducing them to land on and enter the traps. In contrast, exposure of females to either ethanol or lineatin alone resu!ted in an increased frequency of trap landing and entry. Both compounds released simultaneously did not significantly increase the frequency of trap landing and entry for either sex. These responses {{are consistent with the}} life history strategies used by both sexes to seek and colonize suitable host material.

40|$|Abstract—Both enantiomers of the {{aggregation}} pheromone lineatin {{were obtained}} in very high enantiomeric purity by preparative chiral liquid chromatography on microcrystalline cellulose triacetate. Catches of the <b>striped</b> <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle,</b> Trypodendron lineatum, in multiple-funnel traps baited with lineatin enatiomer ratios (plus/minus) of 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100, demonstrated that (+) -lineatin {{is the only}} active enantiomer in interior British Columbia, where two other Trypodendron species are sympatric. In additional experiments using (±) -lineatin, catches of both sexes increased significantly with trap length, either at a constant pheromone dose per trap, or a constant dose per four-funnel unit, up to 16 funnels per trap. When trap length was held constant at eight funnels, increasing the lineatin dose fourfold {{had no effect on}} trap catches.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{response}} of the <b>striped</b> <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle,</b> Trypodendron linea-turn (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), to a semiochemical-baited funnel trap was studied in a wind tunnel {{in the first of}} two experiments. Wind speeds were tested over a range of 0. 0 - 0. 9 m/sec. Percent beetle capture decreased linearly with increasing wind speed within the range tested. A second exper-iment showed that in the presence of wind, beetles flew upwind to a semiochemical-baited substrate. In still air, they tended to fly randomly and erratically; yet in close proximity to the baited substrate, a greater proportion of the beetles were arrested in response to the chemical stimuli and landed on the substrate than when an airflow was present. These results uggest that 7 ". lineatum are capable of responding to semiochemicals under varied wind conditions typically present in a forest where they use wind to orient o olfac-tory stimuli. However, greater numbers are arrested in response to the stimuli under elatively still conditions.

40|$|Thinning {{of forests}} {{has been used}} as a {{management}} tool for bark beetles; however, its effects have only been studied in a limited number of bark beetle species, and the causes of its effectiveness remain unclear. We sampled the abundance and diversity of secondary bark beetles in mature thinned and unthinned lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud., stands (ca. 840 and 2500 trees/ha, respectively) near Whitecourt, Alberta. We examined the factors that might influence any differences in abundance and diversity between thinned and unthinned stands. Breeding habitat for secondary bark beetles (fresh coarse woody debris) was much more abundant in thinned stands than in unthinned stands in the first year after thinning but then returned to background levels. Temperature and wind speeds were higher in thinned stands in all 3 years after thinning. The abundance of <b>striped</b> <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles,</b> Trypodendron lineatum Olivier, and pine engravers, Ips pini (Say), captured in baited funnel traps and window traps remained significantly higher in thinned stands than in unthinned stands in all 3 years after thinning, while the diversity of bark beetles remained constant or increased over this period. Our data suggest that the persistent changes in microclimate following thinning, especially increased wind, were partly responsible for thinned stands having more secondary bark beetles than unthinned stands...|$|R
40|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> Trypodendron lineatum and T. domesticum are {{timber forest}} pests in the Palearctic region and North America. Because {{only a few}} {{pathogens}} are known for Trypodendron species, {{the aim of this}} work was to determine the spectrum of pathogen species of T. lineatum, T. laeve, and T. domesticum. Trypodendron species were collected in pheromone traps at nine localities in the Czech Republic, five localities in Poland, and one locality in Austria. In total, 2, 439 T. lineatum, 171 T. domesticum, and 17 T. laeve beetles were dissected and examined. Infection was found in only two of the 17 specimens of T. laeve and in only two of the 171 specimens of T. domesticum; in all four cases, the parasites were nematodes. Parasitisation of T. lineatum by nematodes was found in T. lineatum at eight localities with a mean (± SE) parasitisation level of 8. 1 ± 4. 7 %. A Chytridiopsis sp. was detected in cells of the midgut epithelium of one T. lineatum specimen, and Gregarina sp. was detected in the midgut lumen of two T. lineatum specimens; no other pathogens were found in T. lineatum. The low infection rates and the tendency for infection by nematodes {{can be explained by the}} monogamy of Trypodendron spp. and their feeding on fungi in short galleries that are not connected to the galleries of conspecifics...|$|R

30|$|AMVL {{has been}} used as a {{precursor}} for the synthesis of lineatin (Figure  1 B), which is a pheromone produced by the female <b>striped</b> <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> (McKay et al. [1982]). This type of beetle is responsible for severe economic damage to the timber and wood industries around the world (Orbay et al. [1994]; Bumrungsri et al. [2008]). Lineatin can act as a lure for mass trapping of the ambrosia beetle; therefore, AMVL is being studied as a possible precursor for a pest control reagent. Interestingly, it has been reported that AMVL can inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. heterohiochii in the presence of mevalonic acid, and it completely inhibits the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. carlsbergensis (Kitamura et al. [1976]). This finding indicates that AMVL can also be used as a compound to inhibit the incorporation of mevalonic acid into cholesterol in the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, not only was AMVL found to be a precursor for two novel pyrones that exhibited anti-oral cavity cancer activity, but its derivatives also offer a wide range of biological activities (Punya et al. [2013]; Busch and Hertweck [2009], Wilk et al. [2009]). Therefore, AMVL has attracted a great deal of attention as a possible precursor for drugs and other valuable compounds that are of economic importance. Despite the interesting aspects of AMVL, scientific reports on its production are very limited. AMVL has previously been chemically synthesized and identified as a metabolite present in the culture broths of various fungi, but the production of AMVL has been hampered by low and unstable yields.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. 1. Bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are crucial}} for woody biomass {{decomposition}} in tropical forests worldwide. Despite that, quantitative data on their host specificity are scarce. 2. Bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> (Scolytinae and Platypodinae) were reared from 13 species of tropical trees representing 11 families from all major lineages of dicotyledonous plants. Standardised samples of beetle-infested twigs, branches, trunks, and roots {{were taken from}} three individuals of each tree species growing in a lowland tropical rain-forest in Papua New Guinea. 3. A total of 81742 beetles from 74 species were reared, 67 of them identified. Local species richness of bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> was estimated at 80 - 92 species. 4. <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> were broad generalists as 95 % of species did not show any preference for a particular host species or clade. Similarity of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> communities from different tree species was not correlated with phylogenetic distances between tree species.

50|$|<b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> are beetles of the weevil subfamilies Scolytinae and Platypodinae (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), which live in {{nutritional}} symbiosis with ambrosia fungi {{and probably}} with bacteria. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead or live trees {{in which they}} cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition.After landing on a suitable tree, an <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near {{the surface of the}} beetle gallery. The majority of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> colonize xylem (sapwood and/or heartwood) of dying or recently dead trees, but some attack live trees. Species differ in their preference for different parts of trees, different stages of deterioration, and in the shape of their tunnels ("galleries").

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} geographical distance on insect species turnover {{in a situation where}} other major environmental factors, including host plant species, altitude, and climate, were constant. We sampled <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera, Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae) from four tree species: Artocarpus altilis, Ficus nodosa, Leea indica and Nauclea orientalis, at three sites forming a 1000 km transect in lowland rainforests of northern Papua New Guinea. A standardized volume of wood from trunk, branches and twigs was sampled for <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> from three individuals of the four tree species at each site. Each tree was killed standing and left exposed to beetle colonization for 20 days prior to sampling. We obtained 12 751 individuals from 84 morphospecies of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles.</b> We surveyed most of the local species richness at each site, predicted by Chao 2 species richness estimates. The similarity of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> communities, estimated by Chao-Sorensen index, was not correlated with their geographical distance. Likelihood analysis and Q-mode analysis using Monte Carlo-generated null distribution of beetles among sites supported the hypothesis that the assemblages of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> at different sites are drawn from the same species pool, regardless of their geographical distance. Tree part (trunk, branch, or twig) was more important predictor of the composition of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> communities than was the host species or geographical location.

40|$|Size is a {{defining}} feature {{of an animal}} and is a result of counteracting forces of selection, and studying size and SSD can reveal what drives selection of body size in a given direction. Scolytinae and Platypodinae are diverse groups, representing many different mating systems and feeding strategies, and are for this reason interesting research subjects. The influence of mating systems, initiating sex, feeding type and initiating sex on evolution of size in species of bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> was investigated for nine species of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> and twelve species of bark beetles. Male biased SSD was found in all highly polygynous species of both bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles.</b> In mildly polygynous and monogynous species, patterns were more diffuse, but in monogynous bark beetles there appeared to be a trend of female biased SSD. In several male initiated systems, where width of females is restricted, females were shown to evolve longer bodies than males. <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> had much less variation in the traits measured than did bark beetles, possibly caused by either tunneling practices or the more uniform resource quality of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles.</b> Female initiated species of bark beetles were significantly wider than male initiated species, suggesting that male initiation limits evolution of body size...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The nursery {{industry}} plays {{a critical}} role in Oregon's economy. An increase in wood-boring insect, or borer, activity has impacted the industry. The goal of this research is to determine key borer species in the nursery industry, flight times so targeted spray schedules can be established, and assess grower knowledge of borer issues and their management. <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> were found to be important with focus on three key species: Monarthrum scutellare (LeConte), Xyleborus dispar (F.), and Xyleborinus saxesenii (Ratzeburg). Flight times were monitored from 7 May 2003 to 3 September 2003 and 18 February 2004 to 1 September 2004, using Lindgren funnel traps. The greatest number of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> for all species peaked in April, with a later peak in June for X saxesenii. The greatest number of specimens collected was X saxesenii.
