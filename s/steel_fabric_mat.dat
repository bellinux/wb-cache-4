40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} manufacturers' {{claims that}} structural polypropylene fibres provide satisfactory {{crack control reinforcement}} and compare the findings against <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> used as crack control in screeds where tensile forces are likely to occur. Design/methodology/approach – The procedure used to provide load, deflection data, toughness indices and residual strength factors was compliant with ASTM C 1018 - 97 and in part ASTM C 78 - 02 to define first crack toughness and first crack strength. Findings – A 142 <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforcement as used in screeds was more effective in producing toughness and residual strength when directly compared {{with the performance of}} structural polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete. Where polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete did have an advantage over the steel reinforced concrete was when I 20 was exceeded and the deflection and crack width was excessive. <b>Steel</b> <b>fabric</b> tended to fail and/or the screed material failed either prior to or in excess of I 20, whereas the fibre reinforced concrete held together albeit at a very much reduced load transfer when compared with <b>steel</b> <b>fabric.</b> Practical implications – If the forces to be encountered through expansion or contraction are small, then, due to the small distances between the fibres redistributing the stress and minimising the cracks within the concrete matrix, polypropylene fibres may be suitable for crack control when directly compared with A 142 fabric reinforcement. The use of fibres has benefits to the floor screed companies, using screed-laying machines as the process avoids laying steel on which the screed machine will have to operate.

40|$|Steel {{reinforcement}} {{used for}} concrete structure has assumed {{a major role}} in construction industry. Many contractors are looking to replace the steel reinforcement used in reinforced concrete structural elements such as shear wall to <b>steel</b> <b>fabrics</b> because its ability to reduce construction time is also in line with Government emphasis on Industrialized Building System (IBS) -prefabrication and automation in order to solve the increasingly great shortage of construction workers in Malaysia. The performance of the wall slab connection becomes more important because most of the reinforced concrete failures occur at the connection of the main structure element not because of any inadequacies in analysis of the structure or in the design but because of inadequate to the detailing of reinforcement. The problem becomes more significant in the case of wall-slab connection as there are no specific provisions design code cater for this type of connection. Analysis of wall-slab connection model can be analyzing using LUSAS of version 14. 3 using 3 dimensional models. In this study 5 : 4 wall to slab thickness ratio, concrete grade 30 N/mm 2, 510 N/mm 2 yield strength of the <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> and 460 N/mm 2 yield strength of the ordinary reinforcement were used to the models. While aspect ratio (h/ 1) and slenderness ratio (h/t) used are 1. 5 and 20 respectively. The models were analyzed under vertical load of 35 kN with eccentricity of approximately 600 mm {{from the face of the}} wall and about 400 mm to the edge of the slab. The support for the model is fully fixed at the wall ends and pinned at the slab far end. The analysis shows that the wall-slab connection model using welded <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> as reinforcement in structure panel would help to reduce the stresses and strain about fifty percent compared to ordinary reinforcement while in term of displacement and deformation shape it would help the concrete elements to reduce the value of the deformation and displacement value at the connection area about ten percent compare to ordinary reinforcement. Thus, further care has to be taken in detailing the connection to ensure safer behaviour was provided during application of vertical loads. From the deformation shape also clearly show that under applied load, the compression forces develop at the upper part of connection and extended throughout the thickness of the slab causing the steel reinforcement to yield. So by using welded <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> with high strength would help to prevent the connection to fail because a welded <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> has ability to elongate the reinforcement during yielding.
