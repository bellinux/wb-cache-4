500|$|Media reports {{stated the}} Chennai Corporation had ignored September {{warnings}} of above-average monsoonal rains {{issued by the}} Indian Meteorological Department, and that extensive and costly projects begun in 2013 to desilt city storm drains had been ineffectively conducted. The drains themselves {{were reported to have}} been shoddily built and improperly designed. Drains carrying surplus water from tanks to other wetlands had also been encroached upon, while city storm water drains were clogged and required immediate desilting. Chennai has only 855km of stormwater drains against 2,847km of urban roads, resulting in flooding after even a marginally heavy downpour. A 2014 CAG report revealed that a diversion channel from the Buckingham canal near Okkiyum Maduvu to the sea (a drain project under the JNNURM scheme) could have saved South Chennai from flooding; the government, however, dropped the ₹100 crore scheme, which, had it been completed, would have drained floodwater from <b>southern</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> at a rate of 3,500 cubic feet per second. The 2014 CAG report said the defective planning of flood control projects caused delays and increased costs, defeating the objective of the scheme. [...] "The fact is that alleviation of inundation of flood water in Chennai city remains largely unachieved", it said.|$|E
