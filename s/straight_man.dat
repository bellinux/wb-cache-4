40|$|The {{relations}} among implicit and explicit measures {{of sexual orientation}} attitudes and sexual-orientation-related behavior and beliefs among gay men (Study 1) and <b>straight</b> <b>men</b> (Studies 1 and 2) were explored. Study 1 found relations between implicit and explicit measures of sexual orientation attitudes, large dif-ferences between gay and <b>straight</b> <b>men</b> on both implicit and explicit measures, and that these measures predicted sexual-orientation-related behaviors among gay <b>men.</b> Also, only <b>straight</b> <b>men</b> exhibited a negative relation between their attitudes toward homosexuality and heterosexuality. Study 2 found that as <b>straight</b> <b>men</b> held more negative attitudes toward homosexu-ality, they more strongly endorsed the importance of heterosexual identity and of traditional masculine gender roles. These endorsements mediated the negative relation between their atti-tudes toward heterosexuality and homosexuality. Implications for assessing attitudes toward sexual orientation and their rela-tions for sexual orientation identity are discussed...|$|R

Michael is a widowed single father. His teenage son, George Michael (Michael Cera), has the same qualities of decency but feels a constant pressure to live up to his father's expectations and is often reluctant to follow his father's plans. He battles with a crush he has on cousin Maeby, which developed from a kiss she gave him as part of a prank.|$|E

40|$|A 2 -stage {{model of}} the {{construction}} of explanations for differences between groups is presented. Category norms affect which of 2 groups becomes "the effect to be explained," and stereotypes shape attributions about that group. In 3 experiments, 288 participants wrote explanations for differences between gay and <b>straight</b> <b>men.</b> Explanations focused on gay men who were also judged to have more mutable attributes. However, these effects were not correlated. Participants focused explanations on <b>straight</b> <b>men</b> when explicitly instructed to do so (Experiment 1), Explanations focused on both groups equally when the gay men constituted the numerically larger sample, when gay men were more typical of the overarching category (i. e., people with AIDS) than <b>straight</b> <b>men,</b> or when more <b>straight</b> <b>men</b> were described as performing the behavior (Experiment 2). Stereotype-consistent information prompted more essentialist references and fewer reconstructive references to gay men than did stereotype-inconsistent information (Experiment 3).

25|$|Tan {{posits that}} most sexual {{language}} in the Philippines is patriarchal: it focuses on the actions and expectations of the male, rather than female, participants. As an example, gamit tends {{to be used as}} Ginamit ako ng mister ko ("My husband 'used' me"), but such turn of phrase would never be used by a <b>straight</b> <b>man.</b> Tan uses other metaphors, such as the relationship between the euphemisms pagdidilig ("to water plants") and magpadilig ("to be watered"), and a woman waiting patiently for sex is described as uhaw (thirsty), to forward this theory: in his view, the Tagalog language subconsciously puts the woman in the passive role.|$|E

40|$|Gender {{stereotypes}} and stereotypes associated with sexual orientation {{have received a}} great deal of research attention, but studies to date have failed to bring together three seemingly connected ideas: likeability, stereotype congruity, and stereotype strength. In order to assess the stereotypes of and attitudes toward gay and <b>straight</b> <b>men,</b> participants rated the likeability of targets whoexhibited either feminine or masculine characteristics. Participants also rated gay <b>men</b> and <b>straight</b> <b>men</b> on a stereotype strength measure, which assessed the extent to which each group was perceived as adhering to or violating their group's stereotypes. Results showed that women liked all targets more than men liked the targets and that women liked gay targets more than men did. Results did not indicate that feminine gay men were liked more than masculine gay men nor did it indicate that masculine <b>straight</b> <b>men</b> were liked more than feminine <b>straight</b> <b>men.</b> Results showed that femininity is a strong component of the gay male stereotype just as masculinity is a strong component of the straight male stereotype.

2500|$|Sexually speaking, {{the same}} 2006 study by Nordling et al. found that gay males {{were aware of}} their S/M {{preferences}} and took part in them at an earlier age, preferring leather, anal sex, rimming, dildos and special equipment or uniform scenes.

25|$|A {{significant}} {{multitude of}} scholastic {{studies have shown}} that the linguistic styles of GLB and straight people are not mutually exclusive. Munson et al. (2006), for instance, examined the gradient nature of perceived sexual orientation by having 40 listeners rate 44 talkers' sexual orientation on a five-point equally appearing interval scale. The 44 talkers included equal number of GLB and straight people. When averaged across the 40 listeners, ratings for individual talkers showed some overlap between GLB and straight people. For example, the two men who were tied with the most-gay average ratings included one self-identified <b>straight</b> <b>man,</b> and one self-identified gay man. While there are group level differences between GLB and straight people in the gay soundness of their voices, overlap does exist, providing a serious challenge to a simple model in which speech differences were the inevitable consequence of sexual orientation. The fact that there is no clean cut between the linguistic patterns of GLB and straight people suggests that too many generations in the study of language and gender can be dangerous.|$|E

[...] Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] continue a long period of excellent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the problems were resolved too quickly at the end of the episode.

Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised Scott for his ability to be both a <b>straight</b> <b>man</b> and a more outrageously funny character, as during his meltdowns in media interviews.

In focus groups, both gay and <b>straight</b> <b>men</b> were presented with photographs of ‘heteroflexible’ representations from the ‘lad mag’ FHMand photographs of ‘real’ lesbians from Gay Times.
