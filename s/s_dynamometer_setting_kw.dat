Those experiments were held in MF- 1 universal testing machine; steel traverses with a cutoff wall placed in between were chosen as foundation models. Foundations models were stressed with hydraulic jacks, so that one foundation was put under consistent stress, whereas the other had few stages of gradual stress. Stresses in sand base were measured on every stress stage with strain-gauge <b>dynamometers</b> <b>set</b> in soil series. Special software was used to register and process the readouts of strain gauges. The experiments were duplicated with computational modeling in PLAXIS software package...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the methodology and results of {{evaluation of the}} flow capacity of the fuel injectors in the automobiles, equipped with spark ignition, port fuel injection engine. Automobiles, which are designed to work with regular gasoline, can be adapted for use of blend of bioethanol and gasoline, for instance, fuel E 85. Certain components have to be evaluated for their compatibility with E 85. The fuel injectors of the adapted engine have to supply a larger amount of E 85 fuel, comparing with the operation with gasoline. The studies were conducted on two unmodified automobiles. The tests were performed on a roll type chassis <b>dynamometer,</b> <b>set</b> in constant speed mode. The measurements were done using a multichannel oscilloscope and piezoelectric microphone. Combined electrical and acoustic injector diagnostic methods were used and are thoroughly explained. The obtained results confirm the efficiency and robustness of the chosen diagnostic method.

40|$|International audienceTen European {{laboratories}} {{worked together}} to study {{the influence of a}} lot of parameters of the measurement of light vehicle emission factors on vehicle bench, in order to improve the accuracy, reliability and representativeness of emission factors: driving patterns (driving cycles, gear choice behaviour, driver and cycle following), vehicle related parameters (technical characteristics of the vehicle, emission stability, emission degradation, fuel properties, vehicle cooling and preconditioning), vehicle sampling (method, sample size), and laboratory related parameters (ambient temperature and humidity, <b>dynamometer</b> <b>setting,</b> dilution ratio, heated line sampling temperature, PM filter preconditioning, response time, dilution air). The results are based on literature synthesis, on about 2700 specific tests with 183 vehicles and on the reprocessing of more than 900 tests. These tests concern the regulated atmospheric pollutants and pre-Euro to Euro 4 vehicles. We did not find any influence of 7 parameters, and find only a qualitative influence for 7 other parameters. 6 parameters have a clear and quantifiable influence and 5 among them allow us to design correction factors to normalise emission measurements: gearshift strategy, vehicle mileage, ambient temperature and humidity, dilution ratio. The sixth influencing parameter is the driving cycle, sometimes more significant than the fuel or the emission standard.

40|$|To measure age-related {{skeletal}} muscle changes, 30 healthy, moderately active women performed isometric and dynamic {{strength and endurance}} tests of their left quadriceps femoris muscle groups. Fifteen of the subjects were ages 20 to 29 years and 15 were ages 50 to 80 years. A Cybex ® II isokinetic dynamometer {{was used to measure}} the torque output isometrically with the knee at 90 degrees of flexion on three trials. In addition, each subject performed three trials from 90 degrees of knee flexion to full knee extension and back to 90 degrees of knee flexion with the velocity of the isokinetic <b>dynamometer</b> <b>set</b> at 10 rpms. Endurance time was calculated to be the length of time a torque output of at least 50 percent of the maximal strength could be maintained. The t tests done revealed {{a significant difference between the}} two groups on isometric and dynamic strength, while no significant difference was found on isometric or dynamic endurance. Statistically correcting for the extraneous variables, height and weight, through a partial correlation revealed a significant negative corre-lation between age and strength. The younger subjects had higher torque outputs, both isometrically and dynamically, than the older subjects. The same partial correlation between isometric endurance and age and dynamic endurance and age demonstrated no significant correlation. The fact that endurance did not change in this older population while strength did may be the result of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers changing with age...|$|R

50|$|For {{the first}} few years Darjeeling Municipality had to run Sidrapong Hydel Power Station at a loss, there being few {{consumers}} of electrical power. But as the demand grew, a 135 <b>kW</b> <b>set</b> was added in 1905 and a third 135 <b>kW</b> <b>set</b> was installed in 1909 in the same power house. A new power house was built in 1916 at a higher location, now known as Jubilee Power House. In this way, the total capacity of the station grew from 130 kW to 1000 kW. However, the limited supply of water meant that power generation could not be increased to match the growing demand of the town and of the factories at the neighbouring tea gardens. Various schemes were prepared to install a larger power station elsewhere. In 1914, while surveying for such, Municipal Engineer George P. Robertson drowned in the Great Rangeet River.|$|R

40|$|Literature remains {{lacking in}} regards to the role that initial {{restrictive}} pressure (IRP) coupled with resistance training as it pertains to the production and accumulation of metabolic byproducts such as lactate, more specifically in women. Purpose: The present study investigates the importance of the IRP as a variable on lactate concentrations during knee extension exercise in combination with blood flow restriction in female subjects. Methods: Thirteen female volunteers (age 21 ± 1. 35) served as the test sample for this study. Initial health screening, PAR-Q, signing of the informed consent, procedural and <b>dynamometer</b> <b>setting</b> familiarization were completed on the first meeting. Prior to exercise, the participants’ maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque of right leg extensors was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Participants performed knee extension exercise with IRP set randomly at either 40 - 45 mmHg or 60 - 65 mmHg on two subsequent visits separated by a minimum of 48 hours. On each visit, participants performed 4 sets (1 × 30 reps and 3 × 15 reps) of dynamic knee extension exercises with the load set at 20 % of their respective MVC. The load lifted for both visits was same and determined using pre-MVC values from the first visit. A lactate analyzer was employed to measure lactate concentration within blood sample from finger pricks. Participants washed their hands before testing started and isopropyl alcohol wipes were used to clean the puncture site before the collection of blood. Levels of lactate concentration were measured prior to exercise, between the second and third sets, and at immediately post exercise. Results: A significant main effects for time (p 0. 05) between the conditions (40 - 45 mmHg vs. 60 - 65 mmHg) over the course of dynamic knee extension exercise. Conclusion: Given that females may store more adipose tissue accumulated around their hip and thighs, magnitude of the effect of IRPs may vary within and across genders, resulting in changes in the type of muscle fibers (type I vs. type IIx) recruited, the total number of muscle fibers recruited, and the level of fatigue. More research is required to determine the impact of various IRPs on the level of byproducts production and accumulation...|$|R

This diagnostic technique involves producing a radioactive tracer in a given surface by bombardment with high energy ions. The decrease in activity of the tracer material may be monitored as the surface is subjected to wear processes and correlated to a depth calibration curve, yielding the eroded depth. Analysis of the activities was achieved through a gamma spectroscopy system.
