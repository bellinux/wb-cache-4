40|$|In OECD Europe {{more than}} 90 % of the {{desulphurization}} facilities operate with the wet scrubbing process (WS), while about 94 % of the installed DeNO_x units are {{selective catalytic reduction}} processes (SCR). The remaining percentages are composed {{in the case of}} SO_ 2 -reduction of the spray dryer absorption (SDA), the Walther process (WAP), the Wellman-Lord process (WL) and dry sorbent injection processes (DSI), in the case of NO_x-reduction of the selective non catalytic reduction (SNCR) {{and in the case of}} combined SO_ 2 - and NO_x-removal of the activated carbon process (AC) and the DESONOX-process. In addition to the <b>secondary</b> <b>flue</b> gas treatment processes, primary measures such as combustion modifications (CM) for NO_x-abatement and the special case of fluidized bed combustion (FBC), where a primary NO_x-reduction is combined with a dry sorbent injection for SO_ 2 -removal, are also regarded within the study.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ground-breaking}} {{ceremony of}} the 10 MWe-scale dry-sorbent CO 2 capture process {{was held in}} August 2012 and the construction was finished in October 2013. It was integrated with a 500 MW power plant and used a slip-stream of that, located at the Hadong coal-fired power plant (Unit # 8), Korea Southern Power Company. From October 2013, Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER), Korea Southern Power Company, and KC Cottrell have executed the test operations {{in order to find}} out the optimal operational conditions and several modification parts to achieve the target project goals of the 10 MWe-scale dry-sorbent CO 2 capture technology. The dry-sorbents have been developed by KEPCO Research Institute and massively produced and supplied by TODA-ISU, which consists of 35 wt. % of active components for the CO 2 sorption and 65 wt. % of supporters for the mechanical strength. The some portions of the dry-sorbents have been tested at the 0. 5 MWe-scale dry-sorbent CO 2 capture process in order to analyze the sorbent performance through the two-week operation campaign in June 2013. During the test operations, the 10 MWe-scale dry-sorbent CO 2 capture process has been divided into four parts such as a sorbent handling part, a flue gas pre-treatment part, a main reactor part, a utility (steam, cooling water, and instrument air) part. In the sorbent handling part, the sorbent feeding system has been tested so that the sorbent has automatically fed to the reactor system and conversely fed to the sorbent silo. In the flue gas pre-treatment part, main blower, the <b>secondary</b> <b>flue</b> gas desulfurization, and the moisture control of the flue gas have been tested. In the main reactor part, the solid hold-up in the carbonation reactor, the solid circulation rate, control concept, and the reaction performance of the sorbent have been tested. In the utility part, steam supply, cooling tower operation, and instrument air compressor operation have been tested. The test operations will be done on January 2014 and the long-term continuous operations will be performed from early March 2014. We plan to continuously operate the 10 MWe-scale dry-sorbent CO 2 capture process from the second quarter of this year, to analyze the economics of the dry-sorbent CO 2 capture technology based on the operational results, and to finish FEED of the 300 MWe-scale dry-sorbent CO 2 capture technology {{until the end of the}} third quarter of this year...|$|E
40|$|Lakvijaya {{power station}} (LVPS) {{is the first}} coal power {{experience}} in Sri Lanka. Even though the main objective of the power plant is to meet the increasing power demand at low cost, still it is behind the expectations due to low reliability of the power plant. Failures in the boiler side equipment have been considerably responsible for this with a huge financial loss to the country. This project studies the suitable designs for design faults and shortcomings of LVPS to improve {{the reliability of the}} power plant related to the boiler side. By analyzing the past data until the first overhaul of the power plant, it is revealed that the main failures are arisen in the primary air system, coal pulverizing system, <b>secondary</b> air and <b>flue</b> gas systems related to the boiler side. In addition to the low reliability of primary air system, it is not supplying the required total amount of primary air to the system to run the pulverizers within the safe margins. Installing a new primary air fan in the system not only meets the deficiency, but also improves the reliability. Failures related to the pitch controllers of forced draft fans and induced draft fans resulting to high vibrations and high bearing temperatures directly affect to the low reliability in the <b>secondary</b> air and <b>flue</b> gas system. Variable speed drivers to control the air flow instead of fan pitch controlling or inlet vane controlling methods are discussed in this paper. According to the past data of the plant, 53 % of failures arose in the pulverizing system have been recovered within ten hours. Rearranging the system with pulverized coal storages for ten hours with a suitable fire protection system is also discussed here. Considering financial losses of these deficiencies, simple pay back periods of each of proposed implementations lies well within the acceptable limits...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{recycling}} or {{disposal of}} flue dusts {{is a continuing}} problem, particularly for secondary smelters treating low-grade Cu scrap. The Bureau of Mines investigated a variety of flue dust treatment approaches and demonstrated the technical feasibility of a bench-scale alkaline method that includes leaching, cementation, precipitation, and roasting. Flue dust was leached at room temperature with an alkaline solution of (NH 4) 2 C 03 and NHpH to solubilize ZnO and Zn metal. Some copper, lead, tin, {{and most of the}} zinc were dissolved in the leach step. Copper, lead, and tin were recovered in the cement product. The Zn in the flltrate was precipitated by pH adjustment to neutral using CO 2 injection. The Zn salt was flltered from solution and roasted to give high-purity ZnO. The leach residue, enriched from 4. 3 to lOA pct Sn, could find a ready market; the metallic cement product can be recycled back to the copper converter; and the high-purity ZnO product can be sold in several markets, leaving no material for disposal. The possibility for recycling of reagents, lower energy demand, and low environmental impact make this method economically and environmentally attractive for recycling <b>secondary</b> copper smelter <b>flue</b> dusts...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis aims {{to study}} the {{possibilities}} of eliminating, or separation of ammonium shares from technological water of plants, where is introduced a <b>secondary</b> method of <b>flue</b> gas denitrification (SCR, SNCR). The need for elimination of ammonium shares arose after introduction of emission cap, which have been tightened since January 2015. The denitrification technologies were installed on devices that did not comply with the new limits. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with the description of combustion processes, as a fluid, and high temperature combustion of solid fuels, mechanisms of emissions and their reduction options. At {{the conclusion of the}} theoretical part is discussed the contents of the ammoniacal nitrogen in waters used in electricity and heating facilities to transport, or from which are separated by solid products of some processes such as desulphurization. There are also discussed some options for removal of ammonium salts from technological waters. Experimental part deals with finding appropriate method of determination of ammoniacal nitrogen, and the possibilities of its elimination by conversion to insoluble compound. Last but not least, the work deals with the evaluation of the sustainability of the proposed solutions. And as well as the real possibilities of their application in practice...|$|R
