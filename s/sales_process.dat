The employees agreed to cut their wages 10 percent and not take sick days during the <b>sales</b> <b>process.</b> One of the main difficulties in the <b>sales</b> <b>process</b> was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's hangar at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to see where to establish its base. In fear that the airline would move to Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase the hangar, which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half the hangar would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 million in annual interest costs.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 20,000 tickets, {{out of a}} total capacity of 52,063. The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park debenture holders, hospitality, sponsors, media and segregation areas. In excess of 1,000 unused debentures were distributed to each club. The allocation was enough to provide for the season ticket holders of each club, with Hearts having 10,000 and Hibs 7,500 approximately, although both clubs anticipated that there would be little or no need for a general public sale. Hearts decided to sell tickets using their loyalty points system, while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during the <b>sales</b> <b>process.</b> Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E

Effective from 1 June 1996, the military was set to retain ownership of the facility for ten years. Parliament granted the Defence Estates Agency the right to sell the air station for market price as part of a large-scale sale of defunct military estates.

25|$|In {{the much}} smaller, {{voluntary}} market, individuals, companies, or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own {{greenhouse gas emissions}} from transportation, electricity use, and other sources. For example, an individual might purchase carbon offsets {{to compensate for the}} greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel. Many companies (see list) offer carbon offsets as an up-sell during the <b>sales</b> <b>process</b> so that customers can mitigate the emissions related with their product or service purchase (such as offsetting emissions related to a vacation flight, car rental, hotel stay, consumer good, etc.). In 2008, about $705 million of carbon offsets were purchased in the voluntary market, representing about 123.4 million metric tons of CO2e reductions. Some fuel suppliers in the UK offer fuel which has been carbon offset such as Fuel dyes.|$|E

Findings: At the present time the enterprises should integrate management processes and their continuousimprovement with quality management, knowledge management and intellectual capital. Such kind of strategywill enable to achieve success for these companies. Research limitations/implications: Described management processes, quality methods and quality analysis ofproduct modernity can be employed in companies, in which quality control has been implemented.

2500|$|Sales staff {{must learn}} to {{recognise}} when the customer is {{ready to make a}} purchase. If the sales person feels that the customer is ready, then they may seek to gain commitment and close the sale. Experienced sales staff soon learn to recognise specific verbal and non-verbal cues that signal the client's readiness to buy. For instance, if a customer begins to handle the merchandise, this may indicate a state of buyer interest. Clients also tend to employ different types of questions throughout the <b>sales</b> <b>process.</b> General questions such as, [...] "Does it come in any other colours (or styles)?" [...] indicate only a moderate level of interest. However, when clients begin to ask specific questions, such as [...] "Do you have this model in black?" [...] then this often indicates that the prospect is approaching readiness to buy. When the sales person believes that the prospective buyer is ready to make the purchase, a trial close might be used to test the waters. A trial close is simply any attempt to confirm the buyer's interest in finalising the sale. An example of a trial close, is [...] "Would you be requiring our team to install the unit for you?" [...] or [...] "Would you be available to take delivery next Thursday?" [...] If the sales person is unsure about the prospect's readiness to buy, they might consider using a 'trial close.' The salesperson can use several different techniques to close the sale; including the ‘alternative close’, the ‘assumptive close’, the ‘summary close’, or the ‘special-offer close’, among others.|$|E
2500|$|South Korea was {{considering}} the F-35, among several other competitors, for its F-X Phase III fighter program. South Korean officials had {{indicated that the}} F-35 would only be available for delivery after 2018, but Steve O'Bryan, Lockheed's vice president for F-35 business development, said that Lockheed can deliver the F-35 to South Korea by 2016. Some Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) officers have oulined possible missions for the stealth fighter, such as surprise raids deep into nuclear armed North Korea. Lockheed has refused to allow ROKAF pilots access to the aircraft to test it prior to the selection, however simulations available to South Korea are more extensive than the processes used by other customers, such as Israel and Japan. In August 2013, the F-35 was essentially eliminated from the competition when the American foreign military <b>sales</b> <b>process</b> prevented Lockheed Martin from offering a price that did not exceed South Korea's budget for the program, leaving just the Boeing F-15SE Silent Eagle within the nation's budget. Lockheed Martin responded that it would work with the American government to continue to offer the F-35 to South Korea. The defense ministry rejected the award and said a new competition would be held to [...] "secure military capability in line with recent aviation technology developments." [...] In November 2013, the Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff Council recommended purchasing 40 F-35A as North Korea seemed to have difficulty dealing with radar-evading aircraft. On 27 January 2014, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration said that a contract for the 40 aircraft would be reviewed and, once approved, signed in September. With deliveries planned to begin in 2018, South Korea would benefit from the scale of F-35 production at the time. [...] With full-scale production having begun, the Unit Recurring Flyaway (URF) cost of one F-35A {{is expected to be}} $80–$85 million, which includes the aircraft, avionics and mission systems, the engine, logistics support, and a flight simulator. [...] Through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreement and past budget issues, the cost projection may be likely to rise. South Korea's formal selection of the F-35 purchase was finalized on 24 September 2014. [...] South Korea is the third FMS country to procure the F-35A after Israel and Japan.|$|E

40|$|Micro-sized {{commercial}} agencies face a poor {{electronic and}} mobile sales support. Most {{of the sales}} information systems are built for the usage within larger-sized companies. Problems particularly appear when processes of multiple suppliers have to {{be integrated into the}} <b>sales</b> <b>processes</b> of the commercial agencies. The paper addresses the issue of process optimization in form of a mobile multi-supplier sales information system for micro-sized commercial agencies. Two major areas of improvements can be realized: Firstly, by an optimized business process integration of multiple SME suppliers and their sales representatives in micro-sized commercial agencies (internal supplier oriented <b>sales</b> <b>processes),</b> and secondly, by an increased mobility in connection with an optimization of <b>sales</b> <b>processes</b> outside of the office infrastructure (external customer <b>sales</b> <b>processes).</b> The paper examines the common processes in commercial agencies and derives relevant processes as well as the appropriate IT-support in form of use cases. The relevant processes and the use cases depend strongly on certain key parameters of a commercial agency's business relationships with its suppliers. Therefore, the paper introduces a branch independent concept for the sales cockpit with the focus on selected sales scenarios, relevant business processes, and derived use cases depending on selected key parameters. By funding the research project M 3 V, the German Ministry of Economies and Technology aims to create a secure, mobile, multi-supplier sales information system as a service for micro-sized commercial agencies...|$|R
