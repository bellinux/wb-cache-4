5|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment. Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by <b>second</b> <b>engineer</b> Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could get no nearer than , and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars could see no indications of life.|$|E
5|$|Benbow {{returned}} to active naval service in September 1693, joining Thomas Phillips, the <b>second</b> <b>engineer</b> of the ordnance, in jointly commanding a flotilla of bomb vessels to attack Saint-Malo. Benbow went aboard the 48-gun HMS Norwich {{and began the}} bombardment on 16 November. It continued intermittently until 19 November when a large fireship was sent into the harbour. An {{attempt was made to}} bring her alongside the town walls, but she ran aground, was set on fire, and exploded. Despite the failure of the initial plan, considerable damage was done, and Benbow's forces were able to take the fort on Quince Rock and disabled it, carrying artillery and prisoners away and bringing them to Guernsey. Benbow was still dissatisfied with the overall result and initiated a court-martial against Captain Henry Tourville, accusing him of cowardice for not bringing his ship in closer. There was no conviction though, as the mortars were proved to be defective.|$|E
25|$|After {{this initial}} trial Archimedes {{embarked}} on a return voyage to London, but while in transit the ship's boiler—which lacked either a gauge or a safety valve—exploded, killing the <b>second</b> <b>engineer</b> and scalding several others. The vessel was then laid up for five months for repairs at Wimshurst's shipyard.|$|E

25|$|In 1825 Roebling got a {{government}} job at Arnsberg, Westphalia, working on military road building for four years. During this period he made sketches for suspension bridges. In 1829 {{he returned to}} his home to work out his final thesis and prepare for his <b>second</b> <b>engineer</b> examination. For unknown reasons, he never took the examination.|$|E

25|$|Buckingham and his then-girlfriend Stevie Nicks {{recorded}} seven demos in 1972 on a one-inch 4-track Ampex recorder kept at his father's coffee {{roasting plant}} in Daly City, then drove to Los Angeles {{to pursue a}} record deal. In 1973, Polydor Records signed the pair. Their album, produced by Keith Olsen and <b>second</b> <b>engineer</b> Richard Dashut, Buckingham Nicks, was released in September 1973; soon after its release, however, Polydor dropped the duo because of poor sales. To help make ends meet, Buckingham toured with Don Everly's backing band, singing Phil Everly's parts.|$|E
25|$|In September 1942 {{numerous}} {{members of}} the ship's company were decorated for their part in the operation. Captain Capon, who had already been awarded the OBE for his service in the First World War, was now awarded the CBE. Chief Officer Dawson and Chief Engineer Richard Francis were awarded the OBE. Second Officer James Golightly, Senior <b>Second</b> <b>Engineer</b> Herbert Weller and Third Officer James Smith were awarded the MBE. Boatswain William Power and ship's carpenter Sydney Milne were awarded the BEM. Margaret Anderson was awarded the George Medal and Veronica ("Vera") Torney was awarded the Member of the Order of the British Empire (Military MBE).|$|E
25|$|The {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a new icebreaker was signed on 17 April 1924 after the Dutch government and the town council of Rotterdam agreed to subsidize the construction costs by 175,000 Dutch guilders, bringing the final cost to ƒ1,563,000 (FIM 26,000,000). She was launched on 26 August 1925 and given the name Jääkarhu, Finnish for polar bear. Curiously, her namesake animal is not a native species to Finland. As the new icebreaker was being built, Captain Johan Rosqvist, who has previously commanded Sampo, was selected as the first captain of the new icebreaker, and in the summer of 1925 he travelled to Rotterdam together with a chief engineer and a <b>second</b> <b>engineer</b> to supervise the construction and outfitting of his new ship.|$|E

25|$|On 16 October 1942 Primrose Hill sailed from Glasgow a {{mixed cargo}} {{including}} 3,000 tons of coal, 1,796 tons of general cargo, war material and 11 aircraft. She {{was as a}} member of convoy ON-139 for Takoradi on the Gold Coast and Apapa in Nigeria. The convoy dispersed, and at 2118 hrs on 29 October she was northwest of the Cape Verde Islands when UD-5, a submarine that the Kriegsmarine had captured from the Dutch Navy after the surrender of the Netherlands, fired two torpedoes at her. One missed but the other hit Primrose Hill in her engine room killing the <b>second</b> <b>engineer,</b> a greaser and a fireman, and setting the fuel oil in her bunkers on fire. Two of her lifeboats and a number of liferafts were destroyed by the concussion of the blast.|$|E
25|$|Barrett {{was talking}} to the <b>second</b> <b>engineer,</b> Mr. Hesketh, when the red light and bells came on {{signalling}} the order to stop the engines. He shouted to the men in the boiler room to shut the dampers, the doors to the furnaces and to shut off the wind for the fires. Then he felt a crash and water came pouring in on him from a large tear in the ship's starboard side. Barrett made his way through the water tight door into boiler room 5. He was ordered to go back into boiler room 6, but there was 8 feet of water there. As some of the engineers attended the pumps, the engine room rang for all the stokers to go up on deck. Barrett was ordered to stay behind by an engineer, Mr. Harvey, in boiler room 5 to get some lamps, draw fires, and lift the manhole plate until water started to rush in.|$|E
25|$|At 19:00 {{overheating}} alarm {{was received}} from the cooling water system of the port main engine and its power had to be reduced to half. At times the engine had to be run at full power for {{short periods of time}} to keep the bow facing the wind. Shortly after 22:00 the speed of the starboard main engine suddenly dropped from 1,000 rpm to roughly 270 rpm, but was restored when the engine was declutched from the shaft. When the <b>second</b> <b>engineer</b> closed the clutch at the normal coupling speed of 400 rpm, the engine stalled. After restarting he attempted coupling the engine again at 1,000 rpm, but it still would not run faster than 270 rpm when connected to the shaft. When the captain received a report that the starboard main engine was no longer usable he decided to abandon the ship and ordered the evacuation of the remaining crew at 22:16. The combination turned parallel to the waves with port side facing the wind and began to drift uncontrollably.|$|E

500|$|Shackleton was now beyond reach, aboard Endurance {{en route}} for Antarctica. [...] Supporters of the {{expedition}} in Australia, notably Edgeworth David who had served as chief scientist on the Nimrod expedition, were concerned at the plight in which Mackintosh's party had been placed. [...] They helped to raise sufficient funds to keep the expedition alive, but {{several members of the}} party resigned or abandoned the venture. [...] Some of the last-minute replacements were raw recruits; Adrian Donnelly, a locomotive engineer with no sea experience, signed as <b>second</b> <b>engineer,</b> while wireless operator Lionel Hooke was an 18-year-old electrical apprentice.|$|E
500|$|Under {{these new}} rules of engagement, UB-43 first sank the Greek steamer Miaoulis [...] from Benghazi on 24 February, {{while she was}} {{carrying}} cottonseed to London. Two days later, the turret hull steamer Clan Farquhar, carrying cotton and coal for London, was torpedoed and sunk. After the attack, which killed 49 of her crew, the ship's <b>second</b> <b>engineer</b> was taken captive by von Mellenthin. On the 27th, Brodmore and her cargo of frozen meat from Majunga were sunk off Libya (and her master taken prisoner), and on the 28th the Japanese steamer Shinsei Maru was sunk nearby.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{began to}} flood immediately, with water pouring in at an {{estimated}} rate of [...] per second, fifteen times faster than it could be pumped out. <b>Second</b> <b>Engineer</b> J. H. Hesketh and Leading Stoker Frederick Barrett were both struck by a jet of icy water in No.6 boiler room and escaped just before the room's watertight door closed. This was an extremely dangerous situation for the engineering staff; the boilers were still full of hot high-pressure steam {{and there was a}} substantial risk that they would explode if they came into contact with the cold seawater flooding the boiler rooms. The stokers and firemen were ordered to reduce the fires and vent the boilers, sending great quantities of steam up the funnel venting pipes. They were waist-deep in freezing water by the time they finished their work.|$|E

500|$|... "Her Majesty" [...] was {{recorded}} by McCartney on 2 July {{when he arrived}} {{before the rest of}} the group at Abbey Road. It was included in a rough mix of the side two medley, appearing between [...] "Mean Mr. Mustard" [...] and [...] "Polythene Pam". McCartney disliked the way the medley sounded when it included [...] "Her Majesty", so he asked for it to be cut. The <b>second</b> <b>engineer,</b> John Kurlander, had been instructed not to throw out anything, so after McCartney left, he attached the track to the end of the master tape after 20seconds of silence. The tape box bore an instruction to leave [...] "Her Majesty" [...] off the final product, but the next day when mastering engineer Malcolm Davies received the tape, he (also trained not to throw anything away) cut a playback lacquer of the whole sequence, including [...] "Her Majesty". The Beatles liked this effect and included it on the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} at the Jungle City Studios and Oven Studios in New York City. Once the musical arrangements were {{done by the}} production team, the music was recorded by Stuart White, Chris Godbey, Ann Mincieli and Bart Schoudel. White and Tony Maserati mixed the track while the audio engineering {{was carried out by}} James Krausse and Matt Weber with assistance from Justin Hergett, Chris Tabron and Matt Wiggers; the <b>second</b> <b>engineer</b> was Ramon Rivas. The audio mastering was done by Tom Coyne and Aya Merrill. Timberlake and Timbaland served as backing vocalists and recorded the vocals of Beyoncé. The spoken section towards the end of [...] "Partition" [...] was recorded by Hajiba Fahmy, one of Beyoncé's dancers. [...] "Partition" [...] officially impacted US urban contemporary radio on February 25, 2014 as the third single from Beyoncé.

500|$|To captain {{the ship}} and act as the expedition's second-in-command Nansen chose Otto Sverdrup, an {{experienced}} sailor who had taken part in the Greenland crossing. Theodore Jacobsen, who had experience in the Arctic as skipper of a sloop, signed on as Fram's mate, and a young naval lieutenant, Sigurd Scott Hansen, took charge of meteorological and magnetic observations. The ship's doctor, and the expedition's botanist, was Henrik Blessing, who graduated in medicine just before Fram's sailing date. Hjalmar Johansen, an army reserve lieutenant and dog-driving expert, was so determined to join the expedition that he agreed to sign on as stoker, the only position by then available. Likewise Adolf Juell, with 20 years' experience at sea as mate and captain, took the post of cook on the Fram voyage. [...] Ivar Mogstad was an official at Gaustad psychiatric hospital, but his technical abilities as a handyman and mechanic impressed Nansen. The oldest man in the party, at 40, was the chief engineer, Anton Amundsen (no relation of Roald). The <b>second</b> <b>engineer,</b> Lars Pettersen, kept his Swedish nationality from Nansen, and although it was soon discovered by his shipmates, {{he was allowed to}} remain with the expedition, the only non-Norwegian in the party. The remaining crew members were Peter Henriksen, Bernhard Nordahl and Bernt Bentzen, the last–named joining the expedition in Tromsø at very short notice.|$|E
