5|$|All of the film's {{special effect}} {{sequences}} were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique {{in which an}} actor is recorded waving his head around at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater <b>shock</b> <b>effect.</b> After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 stop motion short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E

A battery of four BM-13 launchers could fire a salvo in 7–10 seconds that delivered 4.35 tons of high explosives over a [...] impact zone, making its power {{roughly equivalent to}} that of 72 conventional artillery guns. [...] With an efficient crew, the launchers could redeploy to a new location immediately after firing, denying the enemy the opportunity for counterbattery fire. Katyusha batteries were often massed in very large numbers to create a <b>shock</b> <b>effect</b> on enemy forces.

500|$|The {{first name}} of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion, since a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix. Also changed is the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock {{preferred}} to focus the audience's attention on {{the solution to the}} mystery, and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap. Instead of having Sam explain Norman's pathology to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist. (Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother at the time of writing the film.) The novel is more violent than the film; for instance, Crane is beheaded in the shower as opposed to being stabbed to death. Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some <b>shock</b> <b>effect,</b> since toilets were virtually never seen in American cinema in the 1960s. The location of Arbogast's death was moved from the foyer to the stairwell. Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about [...] "Mother" [...] without tipping that something was being hidden. As Janet Leigh put it, this gave Hitchcock more options for his camera.|$|E

Objectives {{for this study}} were to (1) characterize <b>shock</b> <b>effects</b> in a complex polymineralic rock with a significant proportion of hydrous ferromagnesian minerals, both as a function of variable shock pressure and preshock temperature, and (2) to explore the <b>effects</b> of <b>shock</b> impedance contrast between component minerals on the respective abundances and distribution of these features. At any shock pressure, the order of decreasing intensity of <b>shock</b> metamorphic <b>effects</b> in component phases is: cordierite (Crd) biotite (Bt) plagioclase (Pl) K-feldspar (Kfs) quartz (Qtz) garnet (Grt) orthopyroxene (Opx). Samples shocked to pressures below 40 GPa (25 °C) were typically characterized by marked heterogeneous distribution of <b>shock</b> <b>effects</b> on both intragranular and intergranular scales. Shock heterogeneity is mainly attributed to shock impedance contrast between contiguous phases, and manifests as shock amplification locally where shock impedance contrast is greatest, and shock suppression where impedance contrast is least. The heterogeneous distribution of <b>shock</b> metamorphic <b>effects</b> in both experiments and natural rocks is a signature of extreme disequilibrium at the submillimeter scale. The heterogeneous distribution of <b>shock</b> metamorphic <b>effects</b> mitigates against the use of <b>shock</b> <b>effects</b> in minerals exclusively as regional shock pressure barometers, and ought to be augmented by additional constraints on shock pressure from numerical models...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of metallic particles in four shock-melted and seven unshocked ordinary chondrites were studied {{by means of}} the Micro Vickers Hardness Measurement. Together with the morphological and mineralogical properties, they were used to characterize the <b>shock</b> <b>effects</b> in the chondrites. Average value of hardness in Fe-Ni particles is smaller (less hard) than that of troilite. Average values of hardness of taenite particles in Y- 790964 (LL) and Y- 75258 (LL 6) are 144 and 348 kg/mm^ 2,respectively. The hardness increases as the Ni content increases. However, the range of hardness values in Fe-Ni particles shows little systematic changes with the petrologic type. The fractal dimension of two-dimensional shape of metallic particles was measured by the personal-computer-aided image processing system. The Vickers hardness varies in some systematic way. In shock-melted LL chondrites, when the amount of vesicles increases, the average of hardness decreases. <b>Shock</b> <b>effects</b> are heterogeneous even on a microscopic scale, and irregular grains (with higher values of the fractal dimension) seem to show <b>shock</b> <b>effects</b> more strongly...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} revised {{petrographic}} classification of progressive stages of shock metamorphism of 26 ordinary chondrites. Six stages of shock (S 1 to S 6) are defined {{on the basis}} of <b>shock</b> <b>effects</b> in olivine and plagioclase as recognized by thin section microscopy, and the characteristic <b>shock</b> <b>effects</b> of each <b>shock</b> stage are described. It is concluded that <b>shock</b> <b>effects</b> and the sequence of progressively increasing degrees of shock metamorphosis are very similar in H, L, and LL groups. Differences in the frequency distribution of shock stages are relatively minor. It is suggested that the collisional histories of the H, L, and LL parent bodies were similar. Petrologic type- 3 chondrites are deficient in stages S 4 and S 6 and, with increasing petrologic type, the frequency of stages S 4 to S 6 increases. It is suggested that the more porous and volatile-rich Type- 3 chondrites are subject to melting at a lower shock pressure than the nonporous chondrites of higher petrologic type. Stage S 3 is the most abundant in nearly all petrologic types...|$|R
