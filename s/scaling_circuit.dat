In a power <b>scaling</b> <b>circuit,</b> by decreasing just the B+ plate voltage, the cathode bias and screen grid voltage decrease proportionately, while the filament voltage stays constant. However the term power attenuator may be a misnomer for this type of power control because lowering B+ voltage tends to increase distortion, whereas according to convention, an attenuator should not introduce distortion.|$|E

These increased variations have created new challenges for conventional hardware guardbanding, as the additional design margin diminishes the benefits of technology scaling. This dissertation aims at reducing total system design margin with cross-layer approaches on monitoring, margining and mitigation of circuit variability. Since hardware and software adaptation {{can be used to}} reduce design margin with theexposed hardware variability provided by hardware monitors, we start by proposing twodifferent types of performance monitors that can achieve better monitoring accuracy andsmaller monitoring overhead. We also demonstrate the use of these performance monitors in system adaptation with our end-to-end implementation of software testbeds. We also study the dynamic variations and reliability margining problem in presence ofmonitor-and-actuate adaptation and emerging system contexts. In a system with monitor-and-actuate adaptation, dynamic variations require extra margin for monitor and actuate latencies. We analyze and study the margining problem considering different choices of the monitor and actuator types. System reliability margining strategies are also proposed for circuits in the “dark silicon” era, where the low-level design margin should consider the contexts of high-level power/thermal constraints. Last, we propose a clock gating methodology to mitigate the aging induced clock skew,which is difficult to monitor and resolve through adaptation. For certain phenomena andvariation sources, for example, soft error rates at different location/altitude, we also proposesystem/cloud-based monitors.

Current telemetering systems are too heavy and offer too few channels for successful application to the investigation of supersonic test vehicles. A study of the available systems indicates three factors which are uniformly insufficient. These factors are (1) the duplication of circuitry incident to the use of a separate amplifier for each channel; (2) inefficient methods of electronic commutation; (3) water of power by the continuous excitation of measuring bridges. A system is proposed which obviates these three points of inefficiency. A single amplifier for the whole system and a commutation scheme using a binary <b>scaling</b> <b>circuit</b> and a resistance matrix reduce the tube requirements for these two functions from 480 tubes to 45. Power is conserved by exciting the measuring bridges only during the time that information is desired from them. This process reduces the power requirements for bridge excitation from the power required for continuous excitation by a factor equal to the reciprocal of the number of channels. Following these principles, circuits were constructed which indicate that the proposed system seems entirely practical. Such a system should be lighter than any of the present ones and also capable of providing at least four times as many channels. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|When an {{ionizing}} particle or radiation enters the sensitive volume of a counter {{an avalanche of}} electrons is formed by the process known as ionization by collisions. In general a counter is operated with the central wire positive {{with respect to the}} cylinder, and consequently the electrons are collected by the wire. A negative voltage pulse is thus developed. On the wire, the size of which depends upon the capacitance of the wire system and the magnitude of the collected charge. The duration and form of the pulse will depend upon the characteristics of the particular counter usedand upon the time constant of the receiving system. In general each {{ionizing particle}} produces a voltage pulse, and it is the function of the associated electrical circuits to record these pulses and thus count the number of particles entering the sensitive volume of counter. The size of the voltage pulse varies with the counter and the type of particle being detected, but the pulses can be increased to the necessary size to actuate scaling and recording devices by means of an amplifier. For counters operating in the Geiger region the pulse size is independent of the type ofionizing agent being detected, providing the voltage across the counter is kept constant, as the counter voltage is increased the pulse size varies over a considerable range until the voltage is reached at which the counter goes into continuous discharge. In consequence, for use in conjunction with different counters, working at various operating potentials, an amplifier with variable gain is necessary. The amplifier can then be set to give a suitable output pulse to the following circuits independently {{of the size of the}} input pulse. For slow counting rates the counter and amplifier can be used directly in conjunction witha suitable mechanical recorder. Many counters have recovery times as short as 10 seconds and correspondingly high counting rates. Amplifiers can be designed with RC time constants as short as 10 seconds or less, so that the results are not affected by the amplifying stage. On the other hand mechanical recorders have comparatively long time constants and if used directly would seriously decrease the possible counting rate. This is avoided by the use of electrical scaling circuits which pass on only a certain proportion of the pulses to the recording circuit. In this case the recovery time and counting rate of the whole system is governed entirely by the characteristics of the counter itself. The pulses from the last stage of the <b>scaling</b> <b>circuit</b> pass on to the recording circuit. It is the function of this circuit to use these pulses to operate some mechanical recorder. The pulses are not usually able to influence the counter directly, and so a hard valve or thyratron is used in conjunction with a telephone or Cenco counter. It will be seen from the above discussion that the electrical circuits needed for use in association with a Geiger counter are as follows 1. Voltage supply circuits for amplifier, scaling and recording circuits. 2. Pulse amplifier. 3. <b>Scaling</b> <b>circuit.</b> 4. Recording circuit. 5.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. In this work, basic analog integrated circuits such as integrators, multipliers, comparators, summers and impedance scaling networks which serve as the basic building blocks for designing complicated continuous time analog signal processing systems are analyzed and designed. These circuits are designed to operate at low supply voltages and consume low power. Special emphasis is laid on very low frequencies of operation (of the order of a few Hertz). For an Operational Transconductance Amplifier- Capacitor (OTA-C) integrated circuit implementation, this directly translates to a very small transconductance (of the order of a few nA/V) and a very large on-chip capacitance (of the order of several hundred pF). Both the above mentioned aspects of low frequency IC design are addressed in this thesis. Specifically, a family of OTA'S with very small transconductances has been designed using several design schemes such as current division, use of floating gate Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET'S) and bulk driven transistors. A detailed comparison has been made among these schemes in terms of performance characteristics such as power consumption, active silicon area and signal to noise ratio. A multiplier based OTA with very small transconductance has also been designed with a view to obtain a wide transconductance tuning range.

The {{focus of this}} work is implantable electronics for cochlear implants (CIs), surgically implanted devices that utilize existing nerve connections between the brain and inner-ear in cases where degradation of the sensory hair cells in the cochlea has occurred. In the absence of functioning hair cells, a CI processes sound information and stimulates the nderlying nerve cells with currents from implanted electrodes, enabling the patient to understand speech. As the brain of the WIMS CI, the WIMS microcontroller unit (MCU) delivers the communication, signal processing, and storage capabilities required to satisfy the aggressive goals set forth. The 16 -bit MCU implements a custom instruction set architecture focusing on power-efficient execution by providing separate data and address register windows, multi-word arithmetic, eight addressing modes, and interrupt and subroutine support. Along with 32 KB of on-chip SRAM, a low-power 512 -byte scratchpad memory is utilized by the WIMS custom compiler to obtain an average of 18 % energy savings across benchmarks. A synthesizable dynamic frequency <b>scaling</b> <b>circuit</b> allows the chip to select a precision on-chip LC or ring oscillator, and perform clock scaling to minimize power dissipation; it provides glitch-free, software-controlled frequency shifting in 100 ns, and dissipates only 480 μW.

Modes are included to process data, stimulate through electrodes, and allow experimental stimulation or processing.

40|$|Deep {{submicron}} {{technologies are}} beginning to scale poorly with respect to both power and performance. It {{is well known that}} adding timing assumptions to asynchronous circuits can help to simplify circuits and improve performance. Thus, applying timing assumptions can help to extend the eﬀectiveness of technology scaling. However, employing timing assumptions in deep submicron technologies is risky because of the large process variations that are present. This thesis explores the use of low risk timing assumptions to improve asynchronous circuits. We begin with a well-established and robust asynchronous logic style, quasidelay insensitive (QDI) circuits. We expose a timing assumption that exists in the feedback of QDI circuits and extend it for general use. We refer to the resulting logic family as relaxed quasi delay-insensitive circuits (RQDI). RQDI circuits maintain much of the robustness of QDI circuits while providing improved power and performance. Evaluations show that replacing QDI circuits with RQDI equivalents can reduce area and energy by 20 % and 36 %, respectively. RQDI also allows for new types of circuits which are diﬃcult to design using strictly QDI logic. We present RQDI <b>circuits</b> for voltage <b>scaling</b> and two phase signaling. The voltage <b>scaling</b> <b>circuits</b> are novel because they allow for independent voltage scaling of the forward path (data rails) and the return path (acknowledges).

Evaluations show that our two phase circuits can reduce energy con- sumption in these structures by more than 50 % with an area overhead of less than 10 %.
