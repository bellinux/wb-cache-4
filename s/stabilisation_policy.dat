Many European countries followed shortly thereafter, and the United Nations published A System of National Accounts and Supporting Tables in 1952. International standards for national accounting are defined by the United Nations System of National Accounts, with the most recent version released for 2008.|$|E

40|$|If Sweden were to {{be exposed}} to {{asymmetric}} shocks after moving to Stage Three of EMU, fiscal policy would be entirely responsible for the national <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy.</b> Its has been suggested in the economic lite-rature that <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy</b> could be delegated to a politically inde-pendent authority even if the policy instruments are of a fiscal nature. The arguments behind the delegation of monetary policy to independent central banks should presumably also apply to <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy</b> in a fiscal policy regime. In this article we discuss the significance of a delega-tion of national <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy</b> decisions with Sweden in Stage Three of EMU, as well as whether some <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy</b> instruments are more suitable for delegation than others. An interesting question is whet-her fiscal policy instruments can be constructed that resemble the inter-est rate. We show that a cyclically dependent taxation of net interest ear-nings has similar effects to a change in the level of interest rates and that such an instrument may be of interest in a situation where an individual euro country wishes to influence its own real interest rate at a given nominal euro interest rate.

40|$|The recent {{macroeconomic}} {{history of}} emerging market economies is coloured with economic crises of all kinds, ranging from debt-crises, through hyperinflationary periods to currency crises to name but a few. Much of the empirical literature notes that alongside fast-paced structural change this {{has resulted in}} volatile business cycles and a difficult environment for <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy.</b> Both short- and long-run output dynamics are shaped by the multidimensional exposure of EMEs to economic shocks. The paper uses an SVAR analysis and finds {{that in spite of}} high degrees of output volatility, the conduct of <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy</b> has sometimes been successful in dampening short-run output fluctuations. However, even when stabilisation has been successful, the effect on overall output volatility has been negligible when compared to supply-side shocks. The results show that economic crises are associated with large negative supply shocks which are only counteracted by <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy</b> to a very small extent. These crisis-related supply shocks, in turn, have large negative effects on potential GDP growth, which are only reversible when positive supply shocks regain lost ground. Given the institutional origin of the economic crises, the paper suggests that for <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy</b> to become more effective in lowering output volatility and maintaining long-term growth potential, it must be supported by appropriate supply-side measures which insulate EMEs against large negative supply shocks and help them to recover in the wake of economic crises.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{recent developments}} in the theories about macro-economic fluctuations. We start with a review of some important empirical regularities. The New Classical economists interpret the macro-economic fluctuations as responses to unanticipated monetary and persistent real shocks that are transmitted through expectations and the (intertemporal) substitution of activities in response to change in relative prices. A <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy</b> is undesirable because fluctuations reflect the optimal responses {{of the private sector}} to shocks. Transparent and credible policy rules are necessary to prevent that the public sector becomes a source of instability. The New Keynesian economists focus their attention primarily on nominal shocks and the transmission of these shocks through markets characterised by imperfect competition and imperfect information. Fluctuations are caused by nominal shocks because nominal rigidities in combination with real rigidities prevent an immediate full adjustment, as a consequence a <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy</b> can improve welfare. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses an {{estimated}} DSGE {{model for the}} euro area to {{study the effects of}} fiscal <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policies.</b> There are at least two features of the euro area economy which makes this analysis interesting. First, there are nominal rigidities in goods and labour markets, and there are financial market frictions with a significant share of liquidity constrained households. Second, the government is a major sector of the euro area economy. In this paper we look at fiscal stabilisation via government consumption, investment, transfers and wage taxes. Empirical evidence is found for systematic countercyclical fiscal policy. Consistent with previous findings, there is a small positive fiscal multiplier in the case of transitory fiscal shocks. It is found that fiscal policy is effective in stabilising GDP in the presence of demand and supply shocks. Fiscal policy helps to reduce the demand externality arising from nominal rigidities. In addition automatic stabilisation via government transfers helps to smooth consumption of liquidity constrained household. Fiscal policy partly compensates the financial market distortion. With distorted goods, labour and financial markets it is found that the estimated fiscal policy rules reduce fluctuations in euro area GDP by about 14 percent.

With full asset market participation, the optimal policy relies entirely on the interest rate to stabilise cost-push shocks and government expenditure is not changed. When asset market participation is limited, there is a case for fiscal <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy.</b> Active use of public spending raises aggregate welfare because it enables a more balanced distribution of the stabilisation burden across asset-holding and non-asset-holding consumers. The optimal response of government expenditure is sensitive to the financing scheme and whether the policymaker has access to a targeted transfer that can directly redistribute resources between consumers.

Furthermore, we assume that the bank cannot observe the private-sector belief about the inflation target as well as fundamental economic shocks, and has to estimate them. We consider the implications of this ‘double-guessing ’ about inflation target. We show that this uncertainty generates a negative feedback on <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policy</b> by making the bank’s estimation of economic shocks more difficult.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} {{spillover}} sizes and signs and the institutional {{design of the}} co-ordination of macroeconomic <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policies</b> within the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Moreover, in a dynamic setup, {{the consequences of this}} institutional design on macroeconomic outcomes and policies are analysed. We distinguish two types of co-ordination: ex-ante - related to the institutional framework; and ex-post concerning the actual policy decisions. The first type is modeled as the result of an endogenous coalition formation process that leads to the formation of policymakers coalitions. Ex-post co-ordination implies then the implementation by each coalition of its internally co-ordinated macroeconomic <b>stabilisation</b> <b>policies</b> in a non-cooperative dynamic game with the other coalitions, and subject to the constraints of the internal dynamics of the EMU economy. The paper shows that the institutional setting of macroeconomic policy co-ordination is of crucial importance in reaching the Pareto-optimal equilibrium of the game, especially when the number and the magnitude of asymmetries increase. The specific recommendations depend on the particular characteristics of the shocks and the economic structure. In the case of a common shock, fiscal co-ordination is counterproductive but full policy co-ordination is desirable. When asymmetric shocks are considered, fiscal co-ordination improves the performance but full policy co-ordination doesnt produce further gains in policymakers welfare. In general, structural asymmetries reduce the gains from co-operation so that in many cases co-operation cannot be supported without introduction of exogenous factors, e. g. a transfer system...|$|R
