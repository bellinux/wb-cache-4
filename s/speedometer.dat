5|$|As a start, the {{spectrum}} of HAT-P-33 was composed using the digital <b>speedometer</b> at the 1.5-meter Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona. The collected data found that the star was a single dwarf star exhibiting a slight rotation. Several of its parameters, including its effective temperature and surface gravity, were found. Additionally, the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at a 1.93-meter telescope at France's Haute-Provence Observatory was used to observe the star. The resulting data invited the possibility that radial velocity measurements, which can exhibit anomalies that often indicate {{the presence of a}} planet, may have been because of background distortion (and not a planet). This possibility significantly complicated the ability of scientists to verify this planet. After the observations, follow-ups were postponed for several years.|$|E
5|$|Haynes' Model L was {{his most}} popular vehicle. First {{designed}} in 1905, the three-speed car could travel at 35mph (58km/h) and carry four passengers; the company sold over 4,300. Haynes expanded the company significantly in 1908 to accommodate ever-increasing sales. More stock was issued and more capital raised {{to build a}} new and larger factory. By 1909 the company was producing 650 cars annually with models priced between $2,500 and $5,500. In 1910, Haynes Auto became the first company to build a car with a roof, windshield, headlights, and a <b>speedometer</b> as standard on each vehicle to continue their goal of producing the best luxury vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{windscreen}} wipers were {{powered by a}} purely mechanical system: a cable connected to the transmission; to reduce cost, this cable also powered the <b>speedometer.</b> The wipers' speed was therefore dependent on car speed. When the car was waiting at a crossroad, the wipers were not powered; thus, a handle under the <b>speedometer</b> allowed them to be operated by hand. From 1962, the wipers were powered by a single-speed electric motor. The car came with only a <b>speedometer</b> and an ammeter.|$|E

50|$|Around 1896 Stewart and Clark {{founded the}} Sterk Manufacturing Company which {{produced}} <b>speedometers</b> and automobile horns. The flexible shafts from the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company {{were used in}} the production of cables needed for the <b>speedometers.</b>|$|R
40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] growing demands for high-quality products with improved specifications increase the requirements for condition monitoring and quality evaluation {{to ensure that no}} defective or below-specification products reach the customer. This paper presents a low-cost condition-monitoring system using acoustics to evaluate the quality of mechanically driven automotive <b>speedometers</b> during manufacture. Signal conditioning methods employ discrete cosine transformation to simplify the frequency spectrum of the signals. A novelty detection approach is optimized to characterize the 'normal' conditions of the <b>speedometers</b> and to reject any <b>speedometers</b> that are not so categorized {{on the basis of the}} sound waves produced from experimental running of the <b>speedometers.</b> The suggested techniques are found useful in developing an automated condition-monitoring system for deselecting low-quality automotive <b>speedometers...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Stewart- Warner <b>Speedometer</b> Corporation Building {{was built}} in 1925 as the Detroit home of the Stewart-Warner <b>Speedometer</b> Corporation. It was later used as a wheel and brake service center, and the Burroughs Corporation credit union. Wayne State University has used this {{building}} to house their parking and mail departments.|$|E
25|$|As {{a visual}} aid, the {{background}} of the Insight’s digital <b>speedometer</b> glows green when the car is being driven in an efficient manner. Somewhat less-efficient driving makes the meter glow blue-green. Aggressive starts and stops that consume extra fuel make the meter glow blue. By observing the color shift of the <b>speedometer</b> background, the driver receives assistance in developing driving habits that typically enhance fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>speedometers</b> have {{tolerances}} of some ±10%, mainly due to {{variations in}} tire diameter. Sources of error due to tire diameter variations are wear, temperature, pressure, vehicle load, and nominal tire size. Vehicle manufacturers usually calibrate <b>speedometers</b> to read high by an amount {{equal to the}} average error, {{to ensure that their}} <b>speedometers</b> never indicate a lower speed than the actual speed of the vehicle, to ensure they are not liable for drivers violating speed limits.|$|R

25|$|Enhancements to the {{instrument}} panel include white illumination for the vehicle information display and instrument indicator, as well as standardized lettering for <b>speedometer</b> and tachometer.|$|E
25|$|Interiors {{were also}} new for 1965 with a revised {{instrument}} panel featuring two round dials for <b>speedometer</b> and other instruments {{much like the}} 1963–64 models along with new heating/air conditioning controls.|$|E
25|$|The 1962 Valiant {{was given}} a {{completely}} new instrument cluster. Like that of the larger 1962 Plymouth models, the new Valiant cluster was highly regarded for its clean design and easy readability. A large round <b>speedometer</b> was placed at {{the left of the}} cluster, with separate round gauges for fuel level, engine temperature, and charging system condition (amperes) in a row {{to the right of the}} <b>speedometer.</b> Automatic transmission pushbuttons were in a column at the left edge of the panel, and heater pushbuttons were in a column at the right edge. A new shallower-dish steering wheel was also introduced.|$|E

50|$|There were no Australian Design Rules {{in place}} for <b>speedometers</b> in Australia prior to July 1988. They had to be {{introduced}} when speed cameras were first used. This means there are no legally accurate <b>speedometers</b> for these older vehicles. All vehicles manufactured on or after 1 July 2007, and all models of vehicle introduced on or after 1 July 2006, must conform to UNECE Regulation 39.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{also saw the}} {{addition}} of the new safety standards for passenger cars mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The regulations began with seat belts on automobiles produced after March 1, 1967. The 1967 Rambler Americans also included a collapsible, energy-absorbing steering column and steering wheel, more padding on interior surfaces, 4-way hazard flashers, and locking seat back latches for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: The <b>speedometer</b> and odometer was center, with twin, smaller fuel and engine temperature gauges, with matching warning-light pods {{on both sides of the}} <b>speedometer.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the vehicle}} {{instrument}} display, between the <b>speedometer</b> and tachometer, the available shift-lever positions are shown, the current {{position of the}} shift-lever is highlighted (emboldened), and the current gear ratio in use is also displayed as a number.|$|E
25|$|Specialised vehicles, such as {{taxi and}} police versions, were also {{available}} {{directly from the}} factory. Changes included preparations to install additional equipment, a certified calibrated <b>speedometer,</b> uprated brakes with wear indicators and a different level of standard equipment.|$|E

25|$|Inside, a new flat {{instrument}} panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep <b>speedometer</b> that read to only 100mph compared to 120mph {{in previous years}} and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior trimmings received only minor revisions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>speedometers</b> in the {{vehicles}} are calibrated {{from the factory}} and do not require recalibration unless the wheel and overall rolling diameters are changed.|$|R
50|$|Metrication {{is mostly}} complete. Road signs solely use metric measurements, {{as do the}} <b>speedometers</b> and odometers in motor {{vehicles}} produced after 1974; There was no requirement for pre-1974 vehicles to have their <b>speedometers</b> and odometers converted to metric, so any remaining vehicles of this vintage will show miles. Privately imported vehicles, such as classic cars, also {{do not need to}} be so converted. The sale of oil and petrol is by the litre. However, vehicle tyre pressures are still commonly talked about in pounds per square inch.|$|R
