In this paper we have examined the attitudes of local rural development actors (RDA) in Serbia on rural development policy priorities, in particular their attitudes on beneficiaries of rural development measures, policy objectives, and the most efficient strategies of rural development. We also analysed whether the respondents' attitudes differ depending on the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of surveyed regions (South and North of Serbia). Data on attitudes of RDAs were collected through direct survey with representatives of 30 rural communities, and analysed using descriptive statistics methods and Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour. Results indicate that respondents' attitudes on rural policy are conservative and oriented towards objectives related to agriculture and interests of farmers and that <b>socio-economic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the regions contribute to distinction in attitudes of RDAs...|$|R
40|$|Modelling {{of human}} {{behaviour}} during emergencies {{is an important}} issue to be investigated to improve the safety of transportation infrastructures. This behaviour can be influenced by both the environment (i. e. social influences) and characteristics of the users of infrastructures. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the social influences that push a user to manifest a herding behaviour during evacuations. A behavioural model based on discrete choice models is proposed by using data collected through an on-line survey. This approach is able to highlight the heterogenic tastes of decision makers that may influence this choice in exit behaviour. The results show that decision makers are influenced by both people close to the exit and their <b>socio-economic</b> <b>characteristic...</b>|$|R

Besides the fact that petroleum and crude oil are not inexhaustible resources, waste products resulting from this industry present a hazard to {{human health and the}} environment. As such, proper management of waste oil is necessary to prevent its adverse impacts. This paper describes current waste-oil management practices in Lebanon and identifies the extent of potential adverse environmental impacts associated with these practices. Strategies for proper waste-oil management are then proposed in the context of prevailing public perception and environmental awareness. Finally, the economic feasibility of waste-oil recycling as a management option is discussed, taking into consideration country-specific technical and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>characteristic...</b>|$|R

30|$|When {{examining}} separate wage equations {{in column}} four and five, {{we see that}} non-whites face {{more than double the}} wage disadvantage for belonging to the immigrant than native group. Returns for every human capital and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>characteristic</b> appear lower for immigrants than natives, except full-time employment. Years of education and marital status appear to have different partial effects on hourly pay for immigrants and natives. Each additional year of schooling is associated with greater pay for natives than immigrants. Being married or in a civil partnership, as opposed to single/never been married, widowed or divorced, is associated with greater pay for immigrants than natives. These results indicate immigrants possess ‘more’ of the beneficial characteristics that influence wages and thus earn more on average than natives, but they face a wage penalty for belonging to the immigrant group.|$|R

40|$|In Belgium, public {{authorities}} have considerably supported owner-occupied housing {{since the end}} of the nineteenth century, notably through tax concessions. The mechanism studied in this paper (in force for mortgages taken out from 2005 to 2014) allows households to deduct at marginal taxation rate an annually-limited amount of mortgage repayments for their owner-occupied home, including interests and capital under an aggregated form. In this paper, we emphasize the spatial distribution of this tax concession. To this aim, we use a sample of 34, 132 geolocated tax returns (income 2010). Our results show that suburban areas benefit far more from this mechanism than urban areas, mainly because most of the beneficiaries live in these areas. In addition, we observe also that the benefits go for the most part to middle-to-high income families. We hypothesize that this tax relief acts as a catalyst in the spatial sorting of the population on the basis of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>characteristic...</b>|$|R

Furthermore, age, income, educational attainment, farm size and extension contact were the reasons why the respondents participated in the MVP. Therefore, the following recommendations were made: more adult education centers should be established in the area, as well as more facilitators employed to increase the educational level of the programme participants; soft loans should be granted to the farmers to offset the bureaucratic procedures for credit facilities...|$|R
40|$|Adequacy {{and quality}} are crucial for {{household}} water supply. One {{of the major}} problems with public utilities such as drinking water in developing countries is intermittent, insufficient and unreliable supply. Nepal is no exception to this. Water is not supplied round the clock, pressure is insufficient to pump it to the tap {{and the amount of}} water made available to the public, whatsoever, is not directly potable. To combat these problems, households engage in a variety of coping behaviors. Some of the major strategies for coping with intermittent and unreliable water supply are collecting, pumping, storing, treating and purchasing. This paper estimates the cost of coping with unreliable public water supplies and willingness to pay for improved water supplies in Kathmandu valley. Coping costs are calculated from respondents’ answers on averting behavior, market price and value of time. Willingness to pay for improved water supply is calculated using stated preference method and compared with the value obtained from revealed preference method.

His invention came when he was requested by the World Bank and Government of Egypt to take the serious decision of deciding on the villages/municipalities in three selected governorates to which 400 million US dollars of investment in health infrastructure should be channeled. He constructed the so-called socioeconomic vulnerability index (SVI), calculated the SVI for all villages/municipalities and ranked them into four quartiles (poorest, lower middle, upper middle and well-off). The result of his work was a fascinating inventory of villages/municipalities ranked according to their socioeconomic situation. The ministry of health requested him to apply his methodology to the whole country and prioritized the poorest villages/municipalities in its health plans.The statistical analysis for the Socio-economic Vulnerability Index (SVI) had two parts: In the first part, a prediction model for household income was estimated, using the household data of the Egypt’s Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The DHS included data about household’s income and several <b>socio-economic</b> <b>characteristics</b> for a sample of 1586 households selected from several Governorates in Egypt.

It means for increasing of their household income. However, how important mining role on the increasing of household income has to be studied in deeply. The factual problem is the base for research aims, with the spesific stress on studying <b>socio-economic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of sand and stone miner, and {{the contribution of the}} mining income to household income. This research was carried out in Progo catchment area, Yogyakarta Special Region. Survey method was employed by data collecting from respondents. The respondents are head of households (HH) working as sand and stone miner. Sampling technique was proportionally simple random sampling in which 120 HH was taken as respondents sample. They were representatives of upper part, middle part, and lower part of Progo catchments area. Data on socio-economic structure of the household and household income were collected by mean of structured interview. Data analysis was performed through descriptive technique in which frequencies and cross tabulation varians statistic, and multiple regression analysis were mostly used. The research shows that there are relatively similarities on <b>socio-economic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of sand and stone miners, between at lower part, middle part with upper part of Progo catchments area. This existing of sand and stone mining employs about 70 % labours are local miners and 30 % labours came from out of the area. Landless farmers who land own less than 500 m 2 characterize them. The most of them are male, withlow formal education, and as small family (4 people evey HH). Some of them have been as sand and stone miners for more than 4 years. Generally, they work less than 8 hours for mining every day. This research is also finding that the {{income of the}} sand and stone miners are seasonal. The averages of mining income on dry season (Rp 571, 880 per month) are higher than on wet season (Rp 365, 620 per month). The most important factor affecting income in this activity is the working hours spent. In average, the miner’s monthly income is Rp 468, 760 is much higher than minimum level of basic need in Yogyakarta Special Region (Rp 328, 750 per month).
