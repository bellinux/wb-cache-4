5|$|One of {{the most}} <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> proto-{{globalization}} and archaic globalization was the switch from inter-nation trading of rarities to the trading of commodities. During the 12th and 13th centuries it was common to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures. A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as porcelain, silk and spices. Traders of the pre-modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar cane and other crops.|$|E
5|$|The American Dream, or the {{perception}} that Americans enjoy high social mobility, {{plays a key role}} in attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of National Education is {{responsible}} for pre-tertiary education. This is compulsory and lasts twelve years: four years each of primary school, {{middle school and high}} school. Less than half of 25- to 34-year-old Turks have completed at least high school, compared with an OECD average of over 80 percent. Basic education in Turkey is considered to lag behind other OECD countries, with <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> high and low performers. Turkey is ranked 32nd out of 34 in the OECD's PISA study. Access to high-quality school heavily depends on the performance in the secondary school entrance exams, to the point that some students begin taking private tutoring classes when they are 10 years old. The overall adult literacy rate in 2011 was 94.1 percent; 97.9 percent for males and 90.3 percent for females.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{academic}} achievement and social adjustment of mentally retarded students who have had five years of special education with mentally retarded students who have had no special education. This comparison was made to determine if there is a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two groups. The present study was not undertaken to defend or attack special education classes. The study was designed to determine to what extent academic and social <b>differences</b> existed <b>between</b> the two groups. It is hoped the results of this study can be used in planning programs for the educable mentally retarded children in the Weber County Schools. The writer proposes the following hypotheses: 1. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two groups in reading. 2. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two groups in arithmetic. 3.

5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation {{may be seen}} as part of the background to the later development of attachment theory, there are many <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the two. At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little research in this area and no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development of attachment theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from ethology, cybernetics, information processing, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. The first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised thinking on the nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E
5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E
