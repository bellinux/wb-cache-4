At one side the bottom is, for instance, connected to a <b>single</b> <b>clevis,</b> whereas at the other side, the piston rod is also foreseen with a <b>single</b> <b>clevis.</b> The cylinder shell normally has hydraulic connections at both sides; that is, a connection at the bottom side and a connection at the cylinder head side. If oil is pushed under the piston, the piston rod is pushed out and oil that was between the piston and the cylinder head is pushed back to the oil tank.|$|E
