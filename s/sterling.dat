5|$|Denmark's <b>Sterling</b> Airways bought ILG's {{share of}} Norway Airlines in mid July. The {{airlines}} announced a partnership, which also included Transwede. The Wallenberg-controlled NRT owned a 48-percent stake in <b>Sterling</b> and 66 percent of Transwede—the remaining third owned by <b>Sterling.</b> The three airlines applied for concessions {{to operate on}} the capital triangle between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS held a monopoly on these routes and the airlines intended to capture the leisure market between the capital regions. Both ILG and <b>Sterling</b> were hindered in owning {{more than a third}} of Norway Airlines because of Norwegian corporate legislation. Fokus Bank had gradually become the largest shareholder in Norway Airline and owned 40.6 percent of the company in July 1991. At a shareholders meeting in July, Stein Øxseth was appointed chairman and all non-Norwegian board members were replaced.|$|E

5|$|The first European Americans {{to visit}} the area were a group of fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827. The {{community}} of Buncom was founded by Chinese miners in 1851 when gold, silver, cinnabar, and chromite were discovered in nearby Jacksonville. In the spring of 1854, James <b>Sterling</b> and Aaron Davis discovered gold in the <b>Sterling</b> Creek area, and hundreds of miners soon arrived. The town of Sterlingville was founded, and by October its population had risen to over 1,500. Mining lasted through the 1850s and 1860s, {{and much of the}} riverbeds of <b>Sterling</b> Creek and the lower Little Applegate River were excavated. The <b>Sterling</b> Ditch and several other ditches were constructed in the 1870s, providing water to large hydraulic mining operations in Sterlingville and surrounding regions. The Sterlingville mine quickly became the largest hydraulic mine in Oregon, and possibly the entire western United States.|$|E
