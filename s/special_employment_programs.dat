40|$|In {{response}} to the substantial increase in unemployment and its duration in the 1980 s, {{a growing number of}} special measures have been launched by Western European governments. Most of the <b>special</b> <b>employment</b> <b>programs</b> fall under {{one or more of the}} following categories: 1. job creation, 2. on-the-job training, 3. mixed work and training, and 4. enterprise promotion. Ten specific initiatives in 7 countries are examined in order to show the major types of <b>special</b> <b>employment</b> <b>programs</b> characteristic of the late 1970 s and 1980 s. With regard to administrative structure, the central government normally establishes the framework through legislation with specific decisions on project design and implementation made at the regional or local level. Most programs are financed out of the national budget. Almost all programs set a maximum period of participation. The most immediate concern of the programs is the effect upon the individuals who participated in them...|$|E
40|$|Since 1987 the Bank's {{operational}} guidelines have required President's Reports supporting structural adjustment loans (SALs) to {{pay particular attention}} to an analysis of the short term impact of the adjustment program on the poor and to measures proposed to alleviate negative effects. The authors review how SAL President's Reports prepared between July 1986 and December 1988 have addressed the social impact issue. The authors find that most efforts to address this issue have focused on targeted projects, including <b>special</b> <b>employment</b> <b>programs,</b> nutrition projects, resettlement projects, and credit, severance pay, and retraining projects for displaced workers. By contrast, there has been little analysis {{of the impact of the}} chosen policy mix on major sub-groups in poverty. Design modifications other than reallocations of social expenditures, have received relatively less attention. For example, the composition, incidence, and effectiveness of public expenditures and their implications for reducing poverty have not generally been examined. In preparing for adjustment operations, Bank staff should explore policy choices that eliminate economic distortions in a way that creates a basis for a more equitable pattern of long-term growth. To the extent that some adjustment measures may hurt the poor in the short term, this should be mitigated through appropriate modifications in SAL design and carefully designed targeted projects.

40|$|We {{examine a}} panel of {{unemployed}} Australian youth to investigate whether participation in a wage subsidy programme offers merely a temporary respite from unemployment, or whether there are longer-lasting positive employability effects. Controlling for selection bias using a bivariate probit analysis, we estimate the effect {{of participation in the}} <b>Special</b> Youth <b>Employment</b> Training <b>Program</b> on the probability of being employed in subsequent waves of the data, up to an average of 26 months after subsidy expiry. We find that far from breaking up when support expires, subsidies extend short duration jobs. Furthermore, we find large and significant effects of participation on the subsequent employability. Much of this arises from retention of subsidised jobs, but even excluding this we find evidence of longer-term positive effects. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} among diabetes, depression and employment status was assessed. It was hypothesized that: (1) unemployment {{would be associated}} with diabetes; and (2) employability problems {{would be associated with}} higher depression levels among diabetic persons than among non-diabetic persons. A case-control design was employed in which the cases (n = 56) were currently active diabetic patients and the controls (n = 56) were non-diabetic patients. Subjects were selected from a computerized data base at a primary care clinic located in Orange Country, California, U. S. A. Depression was measured by the CES-D scale. The results were as follows: (1) diabetes was associated with both depression and unemployment; (2) being employed was the most significant predictor of depressive symptomatology followed by being diabetic; and (3) education, type of diabetes, blood sugar level, medication type were not significant predictors of depressive symptomatology in a stepwise multiple regression analysis. Problems of employment among diabetic persons may warrant <b>special</b> <b>employment</b> and counseling <b>programs.</b> depression diabetes mellitus employment...|$|R

Propensity scores {{are used to}} examine both weighted and un-weighted logistic regression models. Logistic regression models indicate that inmate participation in <b>employment</b> <b>programming</b> during a term of incarceration increases employment rates for females at nine and fifteen months after their release but does not increase employment rates for males. In addition, participation in <b>employment</b> <b>programming</b> during a term of incarceration does not significantly reduce re-arrest rates among either gender. However, participation in community based <b>employment</b> <b>programming</b> significantly increases <b>employment</b> rates among females at three and nine months following their release and significantly increases male employment rates at three, nine, and fifteen months after their release. Participation in community based <b>employment</b> <b>programming</b> following a term of incarceration significantly reduced re-arrest rates among both genders for the time periods examined.

Persons with psychiatric disabilities continue to have lower employment rates than people with visual disabilities and people with hearing disabilities. The purposes of this secondary analysis research study were to identify factors that distinguished those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who obtained employment while participating in an evidenced-based supported <b>employment</b> <b>program</b> from those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who did not obtain employment while participating in an evidenced-based supported <b>employment</b> <b>program</b> and to identify the variables that contributed to job tenure of people with psychiatric disabilities participating in an evidenced-based supported <b>employment</b> <b>program.</b> Participants were clients {{who participated in the}} Back to Work Program at St. Luke's House and were enrolled in the study for 27. 5 months. Univariate and bivariate analyses revealed that the only factor that distinguished those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who obtained employment while participating in an evidenced-based supported <b>employment</b> <b>program</b> from those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who did not obtain employment while participating in an evidenced-based supported employment was social security benefits. No variables were found to contribute to the job tenure for clients with psychiatric disabilities participating in an evidenced-based supported <b>employment</b> <b>program.</b> Due to the low enrollment rate, additional descriptive analyses were used and found interesting patterns for employment and job tenure for clients with psychiatric disabilities participating in an evidenced-based supported <b>employment</b> <b>program.</b> This study introduced the Social Cognitive Career Theory as a proposed framework to understanding employment for persons with psychiatric disabilities and their job tenures while participating in an evidenced-based supported <b>employment</b> <b>program.</b> Attachment to the labor market was used to expand how job tenure was measured.
