5|$|Little archaeological {{evidence}} {{relates to the}} period immediately after the dissolution, or to the Tudor house built on part of the site. A <b>sawpit</b> {{was found in the}} outer courtyard. It is considered that this might date from the early period of the Brookes' house, or it may have been constructed during the later years of the abbey. The kitchens to the south of the Tudor house and their drainage systems appear to have been used by the Brookes, and according to Brown and Howard-Davis, were possibly rebuilt by the family. The areas previously occupied by the cloisters and the guest quarters were probably used as middens. Few archaeological findings remain from the Georgian house, apart from a fragment of a wall from the south front, and the foundations of the north wing. The much-altered medieval undercroft still stands, with its Norman doorway and Victorian replica, barrel vaulting, wine bins, and blind arcading in the former outer parlour.|$|E

50|$|Logging was {{the first}} {{industry}} of the area, with both government logging camps and private contractors felling the biggest trees and dragging them to the Lane Cove River or local <b>sawpits.</b> The Lofberg family, who were established in the area by the 1860s, shipped lumber to the Sydney markets on their boats, and raised nine children on their farm in West Pymble.|$|R
2500|$|The {{expedition}} left Sunbury on May 1. [...] Baker's cavalry rode overland while Elbert's Continentals sailed via {{the inland}} waterway {{with the expectation}} of meeting at <b>Sawpit</b> Bluff, {{near the mouth of}} the Nassau River in what is now Duval County, Florida.

2500|$|MD 51 {{enters a}} rural area and {{parallels}} the C Canal southeast through Spring Gap. [...] The state highway {{turns away from the}} Potomac River and passes through a hilly area south of Warrior Mountain before entering the valley of Mill Run. [...] MD 51 again parallels the C Canal as the highway approaches the unincorporated community of Oldtown. [...] Within Oldtown, the state highway intersects Opessa Street, which leads to a private, low-water toll bridge across the Potomac River to Green Spring Road in Hampshire County, West Virginia. [...] MD 51 separates from the C Canal again as it leaves Oldtown and enters the valley of <b>Sawpit</b> Run, which the road follows to its confluence with Town Creek. [...] The state highway follows the creek to the community of Town Creek, where it makes contact with the C Canal again. [...] MD 51 then climbs a bluff and turns north again, passing through a swath of Green Ridge State Forest before turning east and settling into the valley of Pursiane Run. [...] The state highway turns north out of the stream valley as it loops east over the C Canal and south over the Potomac River into West Virginia, where the highway continues as WV 9 toward Paw Paw.|$|E
60|$|It was not summer yet, but spring; {{and it was}} not gentle spring ethereally mild, as in Thomson's Seasons, but nipping {{spring with}} an easterly wind, as in Johnson's, Jackson's, Dickson's, Smith's, and Jones's Seasons. The grating wind sawed rather than blew; and as it sawed, the sawdust whirled about the <b>sawpit.</b> Every street was a <b>sawpit,</b> and there were no top-sawyers; every {{passenger}} was an under-sawyer, with the sawdust blinding him and choking him.|$|E
50|$|Philipshill Wood is {{an ancient}} woodland, {{although}} it has been cleared and replanted several times during its history. Historic human management of the wood is evidenced by archaeological features such as earthworks and the remains of <b>sawpits,</b> chalk pits and a charcoal hearth. Old Shire Lane on {{the eastern edge of the}} wood is thought to mark part of the boundary between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia.|$|R
50|$|Views of the Howland Great Dock {{from the}} 18th Century show that {{adjacent}} to Odessa Wharf, {{on the opposite}} side of Randall's Rents, were a series of <b>sawpits,</b> some of which have structures which look like mould lofts, used to store the moulds for forming ships. The age, location, orientation to the pits and its long, thin building form suggest that this may well have been the original use of the building.|$|R

60|$|At last I {{came within}} sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had put in a funereal {{execution}} and taken possession. Two dismally absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage,--as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody,--were posted at the front door; and in one of them I recognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple into a <b>sawpit</b> on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy) knocked at the door,--implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.|$|E
6000|$|West of Fourah College, and separated, longo intervallo, by an {{apparently}} unbroken bush, is Bishop's Court, where the Right Reverend lives {{as long as}} he can or will. Nearer the 'city' lies the deep little bight called Susan or <b>Sawpit</b> Bay. It is also known as Destruction Bay--a gloomy name--where ships caught carrying 'bales,' or 'dry goods,' or 'blackbirds,' were broken up. Twenty years ago traces of their ruins were still seen. Susan is now provided with a large factory: here 'factories' do not manufacture. A host of boats and dug-outs, a swarm of natives like black ants, a long wooden jetty, and some very tall houses denote the place where Messrs. Randall and Fisher store and sell their Kola-nuts. This astringent, the Gora of old writers (Sterculia acuminata), acts in Africa like the Brazilian Guaraná, the Kát (Catha edulis) of southern Arabia, the Betel-nut of Hindostan, and the opium of China, against which certain bigots, with all the presumption of utter ignorance, have been, and still are, waging an absurd war. Sá Leone exported 3,445l. worth of Kola-nuts in 1860; in 1870 10,400l.; and, in 1880, 24,422l. The demand therefore increases and will increase. [Footnote: Mr. Griffith says, 'The Mohammedans of Africa have a singular belief that if they die with a portion of this nut in their stomach their everlasting happiness is secured.' This must be some fanciful Christian tale. Amongst them, however, the red Kola, when sent to the stranger, denotes war, the white Kola peace.] ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1567 is {{generally}} {{seen as the}} date of Chatham's establishment as a Royal Naval Dockyard. In {{the years that followed}} the ground was prepared, accommodation was secured and a mast pond was installed. The renowned Tudor shipwright Mathew Baker was appointed to Chatham in 1572 (though he was primarily based at Deptford). Under his supervision the site was developed to include <b>sawpits,</b> workshops, a wharf with a crane and, most significantly, its first dry dock, which opened in 1581. The dockyard received its first royal visit, from Elizabeth I, in 1573. The first ship to be built at the dockyard, HMS Sunne was launched in 1586.|$|R
50|$|By 1850 Maryborough {{was well}} {{established}} as a commercial centre and as a port for shipping wool, hides, timber, and tallow. Boiling down unwanted sheep produced tallow, used to manufacture soap in Britain, and James D. Walker and Edmund Blucher Uhr had established boiling down plants downstream from the settlement. There were also <b>sawpits</b> between the inns and the river, which were used to square-off timber, including Hoop Pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) and South Queensland Kauri (Agathis robusta), for ship transport. The Maryborough to Gayndah road snaked northwards through {{the western side of}} the settlement, near the Palmer's inn. Chinese vegetable gardens were in place along the banks of Muddy Creek, just east of the settlement, and grew potatoes, turnips, leeks and cabbages.|$|R
5000|$|The first European {{to visit}} the region was Charles Torlesse in 1849 {{in the search for}} coal. [...] Torlesse named the area [...] "Gurdon Forrest" [...] this was later renamed in the memory of Sir Robert Peel by Francis Jollie. The {{community}} took off in the 1850s with the rise of the timber industry. Kahikatea, Mataī and Tōtara were all milled in the region and the remains of the <b>sawpits</b> can still be found at Clarke Flat today. Saw milling continued in the region till after the 1900s. A horrified Arthur Mills who was visiting in 1881, was so taken back by the devastation that he personally purchased 16 hectares of untouched forest. [...] This would go on to form the beginnings of the Peel Forest Park.|$|R
60|$|Another {{class of}} tramp is a man, the most {{valuable}} part of whose stock-in-trade is a highly perplexed demeanour. He is got up like a countryman, and you will often come upon the poor fellow, while he is endeavouring to decipher the inscription on a milestone-- quite a fruitless endeavour, for he cannot read. He asks your pardon, he truly does (he is very slow of speech, this tramp, and he looks in a bewildered way all round the prospect while he talks to you), {{but all of us}} shold do as we wold be done by, and he'll take it kind, if you'll put a power man in the right road fur to jine his eldest son as has broke his leg bad in the masoning, and is in this heere Orspit'l as is wrote down by Squire Pouncerby's own hand as wold not tell a lie fur no man. He then produces from under his dark frock (being always very slow and perplexed) a neat but worn old leathern purse, from which he takes a scrap of paper. On this scrap of paper is written, by Squire Pouncerby, of The Grove, 'Please to direct the Bearer, a poor but very worthy man, to the Sussex County Hospital, near Brighton'--a matter of some difficulty at the moment, seeing that the request comes suddenly upon you in the depths of Hertfordshire. The more you endeavour to indicate where Brighton is--when you have with the greatest difficulty remembered--the less the devoted father can be made to comprehend, and the more obtusely he stares at the prospect; whereby, being reduced to extremity, you recommend the faithful parent to begin by going to St. Albans, and present him with half- a-crown. It does him good, no doubt, but scarcely helps him forward, since you find him lying drunk that same evening in the wheelwright's <b>sawpit</b> under the shed where the felled trees are, opposite the sign of the Three Jolly Hedgers.|$|E

50|$|The Hamlet used to {{be larger}} but {{it is known that}} two houses burnt down {{in the early part of}} last century. The Exlade Street Blacksmiths forge {{previously}} stood in the car park of the Highwayman pub and several large barns existed for the storing and working of wood from the local area. It is estimated by the South Oxfordshire Archaeological Group (SOAG)that up to 30 extra buildings existed. In the 1980s SOAG’s founder, Cynthia Graham Kerr, researched the buildings and landscape of Exlade Street. SOAG and The Oxfordshire Woodland Group are now leading a new multipart project, which includes: searching for lost buildings; understanding how local timber buildings were constructed and studying how the local woodlands were exploited for these purposes, in particular how extant <b>sawpits</b> were used to convert timbers.|$|R
50|$|The river terrace, {{the site}} of Aldridge's two inns, the land by Muddy Creek, and {{the site of}} the pioneer graveyard, is largely open grassed parkland dotted with trees. Much of the old {{township}} is located in an adjacent paddock to the northwest. The paddock is largely clear of trees. There is patchy grass cover, with some areas of bare earth. The line of the old Gayndah road can still be seen, descending to the river terrace from near the site of Palmer's inn. There is little above-surface evidence of the town, but the placement of the structure markers enable the town's layout to be understood. Some features such as the marked graves and <b>sawpits</b> are clearly evident. Modern built features within the heritage boundary are not of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{men of the}} Columbia began {{building}} their winter quarters on September 21, 1791. They completed the main building by September 30. This structure measured 36 ft long by 18 ft wide and was two stories tall. Fort Defiance also had a brick fireplace, as the traders had brought with them 5,470 bricks from Boston. The main building had two cannons mounted and musket loop holes for defending against native attacks. Additionally, other buildings constructed included a blacksmith shop, two <b>sawpits</b> for cutting logs, cabins, and a boat builder's shed. [...] Once the fort was complete, four cannons, 40 muskets, and various other weapons were transferred from the Columbia; Robert Haswell was placed {{in charge of the}} base and ten men. At this point, the crew at Fort Defiance began construction of the ship Adventure, which skeleton had been brought aboard the Columbia.|$|R

25|$|Under British {{rule the}} Royal Navy {{made use of}} a {{careening}} wharf at Port Royal and rented a building on the foreshore {{to serve as a}} storehouse. From 1675 a resident Naval Officer was appointed to oversee these facilities; however, development was cut short by the 1692 earthquake. After the earthquake, an attempt was made to establish a naval base at Port Antonio instead, but the climate there proved disagreeable. From 1735, Port Royal once more became the focus of the Admiralty's attention. New wharves and storehouses were built at this time, as well as housing for the officers of the Yard. Over the next thirty years, more facilities were added: cooperages, workshops, <b>sawpits,</b> and accommodation (including a canteen) for the crews of ships being careened there. A Royal Naval Hospital was also established on land a little {{to the west of the}} Naval Yard; and by the end of the 18th century a small Victualling Yard had been added to the east (prior to this ships had had to go to Kingston and other settlements to take on supplies).|$|R
60|$|Now, {{during my}} whole twelve years' {{collecting}} {{in the western}} and eastern tropics, I never enjoyed such advantages in this respect as at the Simunjon coalworks. For several months from twenty to fifty Chinamen and Dyaks were employed almost exclusively in clearing a large space in the forest, and in making a wide opening for a railroad to the Sadong River, two miles distant. Besides this, <b>sawpits</b> were established at various points in the jungle, and large trees were felled to be cut up into beams and planks. For hundreds of miles in every direction a magnificent forest extended over plain and mountain, rock and morass, and I arrived at the spot just as the rains began to diminish and the daily sunshine to increase; a time which I have always found the most favourable season for collecting. The number of openings, sunny places, and pathways were also an attraction to wasps and butterflies; and by paying a cent each for all insects that were brought me, I obtained from the Dyaks and the Chinamen many fine locusts and Phasmidae, as well as numbers of handsome beetles.|$|R
60|$|The {{island of}} Singapore {{consists}} of a multitude of small hills, three or four hundred feet high, the summits of {{many of which are}} still covered with virgin forest. The mission-house at Bukit-tima was surrounded by several of these wood-topped hills, which were much frequented by woodcutters and sawyers, and offered me an excellent collecting ground for insects. Here and there, too, were tiger pits, carefully covered over with sticks and leaves, and so well concealed, that in several cases I had a narrow escape from falling into them. They are shaped like an iron furnace, wider at the bottom than the top, and are perhaps fifteen or twenty feet deep so that it would be almost impossible for a person unassisted to get out of one. Formerly a sharp stake was stuck erect in the bottom; but after an unfortunate traveller had been killed by falling on one, its use was forbidden. There are always a few tigers roaming about Singapore, and they kill on an average a Chinaman every day, principally those who work in the gambir plantations, which are always made in newly-cleared jungle. We heard a tiger roar once or twice in the evening, and it was rather nervous work hunting for insects among the fallen trunks and old <b>sawpits</b> when one of these savage animals might be lurking close by, awaiting an opportunity to spring upon us.|$|R
