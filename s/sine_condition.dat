50|$|If rays issuing from O (fig. 1) be concurrent, it {{does not}} follow that points in a portion of a plane {{perpendicular}} at O to the axis will be also concurrent, even if the part of the plane be very small. With a considerable aperture, the neighboring point N will be reproduced, but attended by aberrations comparable in magnitude to ON. These aberrations are avoided if, according to Abbe, the <b>sine</b> <b>condition,</b> sin u'1/sin u1=sin u'2/sin u2, holds for all rays reproducing the point O. If the object point O is infinitely distant, u1 and u2 are to be replaced by h1 and h2, the perpendicular heights of incidence; the <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> then becomes sin u'1/h1=sin u'2/h2. A system fulfilling this condition and free from spherical aberration is called aplanatic (Greek a-, privative, plann, a wandering). This word was first used by Robert Blair (d. 1828), professor of practical astronomy at Edinburgh University, to characterize a superior achromatism, and, subsequently, by many writers to denote freedom from spherical aberration. Both the aberration of axis points, and the deviation from the <b>sine</b> <b>condition,</b> rapidly increase in most (uncorrected) systems with the aperture.|$|E

40|$|Most studies {{tackling}} hysteresis identification in {{the technical}} literature follow white-box approaches, i. e. they rely {{on the assumption that}} measured data obey a specific hysteretic model. Such an assumption may be a hard requirement to handle in real applications, since hysteresis is a highly individualistic nonlinear behaviour. The present paper adopts a black-box approach based on nonlinear state-space models to identify hysteresis dynamics. This approach is shown to provide a general framework to hysteresis identification, featuring flexibility and parsimony of representation. Nonlinear model terms are constructed as a multivariate polynomial in the state variables, and parameter estimation is performed by minimising weighted least-squares cost functions. Technical issues, including the selection of the model order and the polynomial degree, are discussed, and model validation is achieved in both broadband and <b>sine</b> <b>conditions.</b> The study is carried out numerically by exploiting synthetic data generated via the Bouc-Wen equations.

40|$|The {{choice of}} {{processing}} parameters for vocoded signals {{may have an}} important effect {{on the availability of}} various auditory features. Experiment 1 varied envelope cutoff frequency (30 and 300 Hz), carrier type (sine and noise), and number of bands (2 – 5) for vocoded speech presented to normal-hearing listeners. Performance was better with a high cutoff for sine-vocoding, with no effect of cutoff for noise-vocoding. With a low cutoff, performance was better for noise-vocoding than for sine-vocoding. With a high cutoff, performance was better for sine-vocoding. Experiment 2 measured perceptibility of cues to voice pitch variations. A noise carrier combined with a high cutoff allowed intonation to be perceived to some degree but performance was best in high-cutoff <b>sine</b> <b>conditions.</b> A low cutoff led to poorest performance, regardless of carrier. Experiment 3 tested the relative contributions of comodulation across bands and spectral density to improved performance with a sine carrier and high cutoff. Comodulation across bands had no effect so it appears that sidebands providing a denser spectrum improved performance. These results indicate that carrier type in combination with envelope cutoff can alter the available cues in vocoded speech, factors which must be considered in interpreting results with vocoded signals...|$|R

50|$|The {{condition}} for the reproduction of a surface element {{in the place of}} a sharply reproduced point — the constant of the sine relationship must also be fulfilled with large apertures for several colors. E. Abbe succeeded in computing microscope objectives free from error of the axis point and satisfying the <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> for several colors, which therefore, according to his definition, were aplanatic for several colors; such systems he termed apochromatic. While, however, the magnification of the individual zones is the same, it is not the same for red as for blue; and there is a chromatic difference of magnification. This is produced in the same amount, but in the opposite sense, by the oculars, which Abbe used with these objectives (compensating oculars), so that it is eliminated {{in the image of the}} whole microscope. The best telescope objectives, and photographic objectives intended for three-color work, are also apochromatic, even if they do not possess quite the same quality of correction as microscope objectives do. The chromatic differences of other errors of reproduction have seldom practical importances.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} render spherical {{aberration}} and the {{deviation from the}} <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> small throughout the whole aperture, there is given to a ray with a finite angle of aperture u* (width infinitely distant objects: with a finite height of incidence h*) the same distance of intersection, and the same sine ratio as to one neighboring the axis (u* or h* may not be {{much smaller than the}} largest aperture U or H {{to be used in the}} system). The rays with an angle of aperture smaller than u* would not have the same distance of intersection and the same sine ratio; these deviations are called zones, and the constructor endeavors to reduce these to a minimum. The same holds for the errors depending upon the angle of the field of view, w: astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion are eliminated for a definite value, w*, zones of astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion, attend smaller values of w. The practical optician names such systems: corrected for the angle of aperture u* (the height of incidence h*) or the angle of field of view w*. Spherical aberration and changes of the sine ratios are often represented graphically as functions of the aperture, in the same way as the deviations of two astigmatic image surfaces of the image plane of the axis point are represented as functions of the angles of the field of view.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, the {{converging}} (partial) {{spherical wave}} {{shown in the}} figure above produces an Airy disc in the image plane. The argument of the Airy function is important, because this determines the scaling of the Airy disc (in other words, how big the disc is in the image plane). If Θmax is the maximum angle that the converging waves make with the lens axis, r is radial distance in the image plane, and wavenumber k = 2π/λ where λ = wavelength, then the argument of the Airy function is: kr tan(Θmax). If Θmax is small (only {{a small portion of}} the converging spherical wave is available to form the image), then radial distance, r, has to be very large before the total argument of the Airy function moves away from the central spot. In other words, if Θmax is small, the Airy disc is large (which is just another statement of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for FT pairs, namely that small extent in one domain corresponds to wide extent in the other domain, and the two are related via the space-bandwidth product). By virtue of this, high magnification systems, which typically have small values of Θmax (by the Abbe <b>sine</b> <b>condition),</b> can have more blur in the image, owing to the broader PSF. The size of the PSF is proportional to the magnification, so that the blur is no worse in a relative sense, but it is definitely worse in an absolute sense.|$|E

40|$|In {{designing}} imaging optical systems, {{the primary}} {{task is to}} correct aberrations. Aberrations are deviations from perfect imagery. They depend on both the filed size and pupil position. When the Constant Optical Path Length (OPL) condition is satisfied, an optical system is free of all orders of spherical aberrations, which have zero field dependence. When the Abbe <b>Sine</b> <b>condition</b> is satisfied, all the aberrations with linear filed dependence are corrected. The Abbe <b>Sine</b> <b>condition</b> does not involve any off-axis ray properties, but it predicts the correction of off-axis aberrations. We go one step beyond the Constant OPL condition and the Abbe <b>Sine</b> <b>condition.</b> By using Hamilton's characteristic functions, we developed a set of criteria for correcting the aberrations with quadratic field dependence and all orders of pupil dependence. These criteria involve only properties of the rays originating from the on-axis object point as the Abbe <b>Sine</b> <b>condition</b> does. Using these criteria, we analyzed some known designs and obtained new information about these designs. We also developed an algorithm to implement the criteria in designing well-corrected novel optical systems. Even when the criteria are not exactly satisfied, {{we now have a}} way to predict the residual quadratic field-dependent aberrations without tracing rays from any off-axis object point. We extended the Hamiltonian treatment to bilateral systems and developed similar criteria for correcting the quadratic field-dependent aberrations for this type of system...|$|E

For {{complete}} spherical {{concentration of}} light the maximum theoretically possible {{total energy density}} for a given power input can be, in principle, achieved by appropriate choice of polarization and angular amplitude variation.

For hemispherical concentration the electric energy density can be seven sixteenths of the maximum possible for a given power input, and the total energy density can be seven eighths of the maximum possible.

40|$|Rather than {{measuring}} aberrations {{at several}} locations {{across the field}} to quantify the alignment of an optical system, we show how a simple measurement of the pupil mapping {{can be used to}} measure the off-axis performance of the system. This method uses the Abbe <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> to relate the mapping between the entrance and the exit pupils, where the violations of the generalized <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> are used to determine the pupil mapping error. From this pupil mapping, the linearly field-dependent aberrations can be calculated. One of the advantages to this method is that all of the test equipment can be aligned {{to the center of the}} field while making measurements of the off-axis performance, which reduces the uncertainty of the measurement. This advantage is particularly evident with systems or sub-systems that have large inherent aberrations where off-axis alignment tolerances are very tight. Additionally, in the <b>Sine</b> <b>Condition</b> Test (SCTest), the test equipment can be designed to compensate for the native Siedel coma in the system. This makes it more straightforward to measure the linearly field dependence of the aberrations. By reducing or removing coma, the measurement uncertainty is further reduced. This work begins by explaining the background of the Abbe <b>sine</b> <b>condition,</b> derivation of the pupil mapping error, and an overview of linearly field-dependent astigmatism that arises from misalignment. Next, the general method of implementation is discussed, and expanded further by exploring the two different source options: a point source with a grating or a flat-panel display. Experimental results from proof of concept systems are shown for both cases. Next, this dissertation explains how the SCTest can be implemented on more complex systems. Last, this dissertation shows how the linear aberrations, along with constant field-dependent aberrations, can be used to align a system. Here, the application of the alignment version of the SCTest on a three mirror anastigmat (TMA) is discussed. Using simulation, this dissertation then investigates the behavior of the alignment SCTest for various levels of mirror misalignment, mirror fabrication errors, and misalignment of the test equipment. All of these tests show that the alignment SCTest can successfully align an optical system...|$|E
