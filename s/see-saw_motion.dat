50|$|The {{higher the}} {{amplitude}} the more intense the training). A higher amplitude {{results in a}} higher elongation of ligaments and muscles {{as well as in}} a higher elongation speed. Hence the amplitude influences the maximum stretching as well as the maximum motion velocity. Since the Galileo devices are based on a <b>see-saw</b> <b>motion</b> the amplitude can be varied by the foot position: the further apart the feet the larger the amplitude. If the amplitude can not be increased, additional weights (e.g. weight vests or dumbbells) can be used to increase the training stimulus.|$|E
50|$|X-Scream is a ride {{comprising}} a 68-foot straight {{piece of}} track {{similar to that}} of a conventional roller coaster, which carries a single open top car. This trackway pivots vertically in a <b>see-saw</b> <b>motion,</b> letting the car roll backward and forward along the length. The ride car is allowed to roll quickly forward {{to the end of the}} track, 27 ft past the edge of the building, before braking sharply. The rolling back and forth of the car and the rocking of the track is programmed to take the rider by surprise and feel like they are at risk of falling from the precipice of the building.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBefore the myosin motor head {{can perform}} the next power stroke, it {{undergoes}} a large conformational transition {{in which the}} converter domain, bearing the lever arm, rotates ∼ 65 °. Simultaneous with this “recovery stroke,” myosin activates its ATPase function by closing the Switch- 2 loop over the bound ATP. This coupling between the motions of the converter domain and of the 40 Å-distant Switch- 2 loop is essential to avoid unproductive ATP hydrolysis. The coupling mechanism is determined here by finding a series of optimized intermediates between crystallographic end structures of the recovery stroke (Dictyostelium discoideum), yielding movies of the transition at atomic detail. The successive formation of two hydrogen bonds by the Switch- 2 loop is correlated with the successive <b>see-saw</b> <b>motions</b> of the relay and SH 1 helices that hold the converter domain. SH 1 helix and Switch- 2 loop communicate via a highly conserved loop that wedges against the SH 1 -helix upon Switch- 2 closing...|$|R
50|$|The {{details of}} the {{construction}} {{are the subject of}} debate, but the most widely accepted design is that proposed by Ladislao Reti, based on fragments of contemporary descriptions. A large water wheel powered a revolving belt with buckets or amphora that transported water {{to the top of a}} tower. When the buckets reached the top of the tower they would upend pouring the water into a small tank from where it would travel down to a smaller tower via a pipe. A second water wheel provided mechanical power to pumps that drove a series of cups mounted on arms inside the second tower. The arms of the cups were hollow with an opening at the end which allowed water to run down inside the arm and out of the opposite end. A <b>see-sawing</b> <b>motion</b> of the arms lifted the water to successive levels in the cups. Once the final level was reached the water flowed down a second pipe to a third tower which contained further cups on arms and was also activated by the mechanical power derived from the second water wheel. This final tower raised the water high enough to allow it to flow into the storage tanks at the Alcázar.|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{acoustic}} pressure gradients {{is critical in}} many applications such as directional microphones for hearing aids and sound intensity probes. This measurement is especially challenging with decreasing microphone size, which reduces the sensitivity due to small spacing between the pressure ports. Novel, micromachined biomimetic microphone diaphragms are shown to provide high sensitivity to pressure gradients {{on one side of}} the diaphragm with low thermal mechanical noise. These structures have a dominant mode shape with <b>see-saw</b> like <b>motion</b> in the audio band, responding to pressure gradients as well as spurious higher order modes sensitive to pressure. In this dissertation, integration of a diffraction based optical detection method with these novel diaphragm structures to implement a low noise optical pressure gradient microphone is described and experimental characterization results are presented, showing 36 dBA noise level with 1 mm port spacing, nearly an order of magnitude better than the current gradient microphones. The optical detection scheme also provides electrostatic actuation capability from both sides of the diaphragm separately which can be used for active force feedback. A 4 -port electromechanical equivalent circuit model of this microphone with optical readout is developed to predict the overall response of the device to different acoustic and electrostatic excitations. The model includes the damping due to complex motion of air around the microphone diaphragm, and it calculates the detected optical signal on each side of the diaphragm as a combination of two separate dominant vibration modes. This equivalent circuit model is verified by experiments and used to predict the microphone response with different force feedback schemes. Single sided force feedback is used for active damping to improve the linearity and the frequency response of the microphone. Furthermore, it is shown that using two sided force feedback one can significantly suppress or enhance the desired vibration modes of the diaphragm. This approach provides an electronic means to tailor the directional response of the microphones, with significant implications in device performance for various applications. As an example, the use of this device as a particle velocity sensor for sound intensity and sound power measurements is investigated. Without force feedback, the gradient microphone provides accurate particle velocity measurement for frequencies below 2 kHz, after which the pressure response of the second order mode becomes significant. With two-sided force feedback, the calculations show that this upper frequency limit may be increased to 10 kHz. This improves the pressure residual intensity index by more than 15 dB in the 50 Hz- 10 kHz range, matching the Class I requirements of IEC 1043 standards for intensity probes without any need for multiple spacers.

40|$|A {{sequence}} of shallow earthquakes alternated around 1959 in the Chubu district. Coinci-dentally, at the Ogoya observation station, {{the rate of}} ground tilts {{in the direction of}} the tectonicforce changed and the mode of the anomalous variation of ground tilts accompanied by the indi-vidual earthquakes also changed. A similar phenomenon was found in the mode of tilt variations at the Kamioka observationstation. It was confirmed that the change in the rate of gradual ground tilts appeared in the direc-tion of N 45 °W-S 45 °E from the fact that the acceleration of gradual tilting movements accumulatein this direction. It is a remarkable fact that this direction closely coincides with that of Ogoya(N 25 °W-S 25 °E). On the contrary, it has been ascertained that the tilt variation as <b>see-saw</b> <b>motion</b> correspondingto three active stages in the Kitamino earthquake series appears in the direction parallel to theAtotsugawa fault (N 60 °E-S 60 °W). In other words, it may be imagined that a <b>see-saw</b> <b>motion</b> withthe shorter period superposes on the gradual movements in the direction of N 45 °W-S 45 °E...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} a general report on the long term {{observation}} of crustal move-ments at the Hosokura station in the T 6 hoku district, and further, {{the first of a}} series ofpapers in which the relation between the seismic activities and crustal movements in somerestricted areas will be presented. Observational results in the case of the outer zone of the T 6 hoku district are as fol-lows: as far as the E-W direction is concerned, the mean velocity of tilting motion ofthe ground at Hosokura changes coincidentally with the alternations of sequence ofshallow earthquakes occurred in the region of Sanrikuoki (Off the eastern coast of thedistrict), and elastic deformations as shown by the <b>see-saw</b> <b>motion</b> superpose on thesestepwise motion of secular ground tilt, decreasing its amplitude and shortening its periodwith time. Earthquake swarms occur near the peaks of the curve showing the see-sawmotion. These modes of crustal movements at Hosokura are essentially similar to thoseof the Makimine station related to the seismic activities in the sea area of Hyoganada. Besides, an attention is drawn to the plastic deformation caused by a series of veryshallow earthquakes originated near Hosokura...|$|E
40|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes of quintessence to the upkeep of superhelical DNA, and {{are vital}} for replication, {{transcription}} and recombination. An atomic-resolution model for human topoisomerase I in covalent complex with DNA is simulated using molecular dynamics with external potentials that mimic torque and bias the DNA duplex downstream of a single-strand cut to rotate around the intact strand, {{according to the}} prevailing enzymatic mechanism. The simulations reveal the first dynamical picture of how topoisomerase accommodates large-scale motion of DNA as it changes its supercoiling state, and indicate that relaxation {{of positive and negative}} supercoils are fundamentally different. To relax positive supercoils, two separate domains (the ‘lips’) of the protein open up by about 10 – 14 Å, whereas to relax negative supercoils, a continuous loop connecting the upper and lower parts (and which was a hinge for opening the lips) stretches about 12 Å while the lips remain unseparated. Normal mode analysis is additionally used to characterize the functional flexibility of the protein. Remarkably, the same combination of low-frequency eigenvectors exhibit the dominant contribution for both rotation mechanisms through a <b>see-saw</b> <b>motion.</b> The simulated mechanisms suggest mutations to control the relaxation of either type of supercoiling selectively and advance a hypothesis for the debated role of the N-terminal domain in supercoil relaxation...|$|E
