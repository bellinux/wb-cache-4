5|$|After {{four and}} a half months of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service in Naples. He was surprised to find seven <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E

Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.|$|E
25|$|Shards {{of broken}} glass or glass rods were being used in mosaics from the Augustan period onwards, but by the {{beginning}} of the 1st century <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> tiles, known as tesserae, were being produced specifically for use in mosaics. These were usually in shades of yellow, blue or green, and were predominantly used in mosaics laid under fountains or as highlights.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{departure}} from the previous game, there are elements from it that have remained. This includes the Magic Weapons, which are secondary weapons to Simon's whip. Each {{of them have a}} different use. Like most games in the series, some of these require the usage of hearts. One of them returning from Castlevania is the Holy Water, a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> which can disintegrate walls that conceal hidden items. Some Magic Weapons make their first appearance in Simon's Quest, such as the Diamond, which attacks enemies while bouncing off any surrounding walls.|$|E
25|$|The avocado tree can {{be grown}} {{domestically}} and used as a (decorative) houseplant. The pit germinates in normal soil conditions or partially submerged in a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> (or container) of water. In the latter method, the pit sprouts in four to six weeks, at which time it is planted in standard houseplant potting soil. The plant normally grows {{large enough to be}} prunable; it does not bear fruit unless it has ample sunlight. Home gardeners can graft a branch from a fruit-bearing plant to speed maturity, which typically takes four to six years to bear fruit.|$|E
25|$|The {{dissipation}} constant is {{a measure}} of the thermal connection of the thermistor to its surroundings. It is generally given for the thermistor in still air, and in well-stirred oil. Typical values for a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> bead thermistor are 1.5mW/°C in still air and 6.0mW/°C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a thermistor may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the thermistor may be used as a flow rate sensor, since the dissipation constant increases with the rate of flow of a fluid past the thermistor.|$|E

25|$|Crofton {{was founded}} in 1902 by Henry Croft, who owned the nearby copper mine in Mt. Sicker. He built a smelter on the coast and {{exported}} the refined copper. The residue {{left over from the}} smelter blackened the local beaches, and the <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> particles often stuck to peoples' feet and hands. In 1906 Henry Croft sold the smelter to Britannia Mine. The smelter closed in January 1908, and soon after, rumours began that a large sawmill would be built. Nothing came of the rumours, and when Henry Croft died in 1917, his namesake was struggling to survive.|$|E
25|$|Enlightened by {{impressive}} chandeliers {{which are}} applied in countless <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> lamps, the nave opens {{into the south}} portico of the courtyard by a monumental delicately carved wooden door, made in 1828 under {{the reign of the}} Husainids. This sumptuous door, which has four leaves richly carved with geometric motifs embossed on the bottom of foliages and interlacing stars, is decorated at the typanum by a stylized vase from which emerge winding stems and leaves. The other doors of the prayer hall, some of which date {{from the time of the}} Hafsids, are distinguished by their decoration which consists essentially of geometric patterns (hexagonal, octagonal, rectangular patterns, etc.).|$|E
25|$|On May 24, 1802, in the Catacombs of Priscilla on the Via Salaria Nova, an inscribed loculus (space {{hollowed}} {{out of the}} rock) was found, and {{on the following day}} it was carefully examined and opened. The loculus was closed with three terracotta tiles, on which was the following inscription: lumena paxte cumfi. It was and is generally accepted that the tiles had not been positioned in the sequence of the words, and that the inscription originally read, with the leftmost tile placed on the right: pax tecum Filumena ("Peace with you, Philomena"). Within the loculus was found the skeleton of a female between thirteen and fifteen years old. Embedded in the cement was a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> phial with vestiges of what was taken to be blood. In accordance with the assumptions of the time, the remains were taken to be those of a virgin martyr named Philomena. Her name means 'daughter of light'. Philomena is the patron saint of infants, babies, and youth.|$|E

25|$|A <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> {{industry}} {{existed in}} Newcastle from the mid-15th century. In 1615 restrictions {{were put on}} the use of wood for manufacturing glass. It was found that glass could be manufactured using the local coal, and so a glassmaking industry grew up on Tyneside. Huguenot glassmakers came over from France as refugees from persecution and set up glasshouses in the Skinnerburn area of Newcastle. Eventually, glass production moved to the Ouseburn area of Newcastle. In 1684 the Dagnia family, Sephardic Jewish emigrants from Altare, arrived in Newcastle from Stourbridge and established glasshouses along the Close, to manufacture high quality flint glass. The glass manufacturers used sand ballast from the boats arriving in the river as the main raw material. The glassware was then exported in collier brigs. The period from 1730 to 1785 was the highpoint of Newcastle glass manufacture, when the local glassmakers produced the 'Newcastle Light Baluster'. The glassmaking industry still exists in the west end of the city with local Artist and Glassmaker Jane Charles carrying on over four hundred years of hot glass blowing in Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{the walls}} are single skinned. The {{south-west}} end of the building contains the office and the former goods room, with a small walled cubicle at the south-west (goods room) end. The partition wall between the office and the goods room has been removed. There are two windows (one casement and one with timber louvres) at the south-west end of the space, along with a door to the platform and a casement window to the south-east (Kamerunga Road) elevation. The office space, which retains some timber counters, has a casement window and a modern sliding window on the south-east side, two sash windows on the north-west elevation, and a stable door and ticket window on the north-east side, through to the waiting shed. The waiting shed retains its bench seating, and has a glass-louvre window to the south-east elevation and a timber double folding door to the platform. North-east of the waiting shed is the ladies toilet, with a doorway to the platform and a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> louvre window to the south-east. The remains of gardens, with concrete retaining walls to Kamerunga Road, are located south- west of the station building.|$|E
500|$|The Glaser {{device was}} a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> {{cylinder}} (...) filled with ether. By suddenly reducing {{the pressure in}} the device, the liquid could be placed into a temporary superheated state, which would boil along the disturbed track of a particle passing through. Glaser was able to maintain the superheated state {{for a few seconds}} before spontaneous boiling took place. The Alvarez team built chambers of 1.5in, 2.5in, 4in, 10in, and 15in using liquid hydrogen, and constructed of metal with glass windows, so that the tracks could be photographed. The chamber could be cycled in synchronization with the accelerator beam, a picture could be taken, and the chamber recompressed in time for the next beam cycle.|$|E

500|$|East of Lape Road (County Route66 or CR66), {{the amount}} of {{development}} along NY43 begins to decline and give way to small, open fields located amongst forested areas. However, as NY43 enters the town of Sand Lake, the number of homes and businesses on the highway rises once more. The level of development reaches its greatest point in West Sand Lake, a community centered around NY43's junction with NY150. NY43 continues on, passing through residential areas of Sand Lake as it intersects NY351 and heads eastward to Averill Park. The route meets NY66 east of the community, and the two routes overlap for [...] southeastward along the eastern shores of the <b>small</b> <b>Glass</b> and Crooked Lakes.

500|$|The {{first piece}} of {{evidence}} consists of three small objects which contain both of their praenomen next to one another: the aforementioned <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> bead, a small feldspar amulet and a broken stele, {{all of which are}} written in the proper style for the early 18th dynasty. The last stele said that Amenhotep was [...] "given life eternally", which is an Egyptian idiom meaning that a king is alive, but the name of Ahmose does not have the usual epithet [...] "true of voice" [...] which is given to dead kings. Since praenomen are only assumed upon taking the throne, and assuming that both were in fact alive at the same time, it is indicated that both were reigning at the same time. There is, however, the possibility that Amenhotep I merely wished to associate himself with his beloved father, who reunited Egypt.|$|E
500|$|Stark and Yinsen quietly build a small, {{powerful}} {{electric generator}} called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and {{a suit of}} powered armor to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles {{his way out of}} the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit, as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. Personal assistant Pepper Potts places the original reactor inside a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> showcase. Though Stane requests details, Stark keeps his work to himself because he is suspicious of his company.|$|E
