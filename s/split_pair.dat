5|$|If {{a player}} is dealt {{a pair of}} eights, the total of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 {{is said to be}} the worst hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, there is a strong chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting eights limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research of expected value scenarios shows that by splitting eights one can convert a hand that presents an expected loss to two hands that may present an expected profit or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A <b>split</b> <b>pair</b> of eights is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. If a player hits on a pair of eights, he is expected to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the eights, he is expected to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E

40|$|Let g be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra and U_h(g) its {{quantized}} enveloping algebra. The quantum Weyl group {{operators of}} U_h(g) and the universal R-matrices of its Levi subalgebras endow U_h(g) {{with a natural}} quasi-Coxeter quasitriangular quasibialgebra structure which underlies {{the action of the}} braid group of g and Artin's braid groups on the tensor product of integrable, category O modules. We show that this structure can be transferred to the universal enveloping algebra Ug[[h]]. The proof relies on a modification of the Etingof-Kazhdan quantization functor, and yields an isomorphism between (appropriate completions of) U_h(g) and Ug[[h]] preserving a given chain of Levi subalgebras. We carry it out in the more general context of chains of Manin triples, and obtain in particular a relative version of the Etingof-Kazhdan functor with input a <b>split</b> <b>pair</b> of Lie bialgebras. Along the way, we develop the notion of quasi-Coxeter categories, which are to generalized braid groups what braided tensor categories are to Artin's braid groups.

40|$|A {{scenario}} {{based on}} the electron cyclotron maser emission is proposed for the fine structures of solar radio emission in the present discussion.

As an example, the explanation of the observed fine-structure components in the solar type IIIb burst is discussed in detail.

The positive cross-correlations at high transparency found by Mélin, Benjamin and Martin [Phys. Rev. B 77, 094512 (2008) ] are not due to crossed Andreev reflection.

40|$|Rayleigh–Bénard {{convection}} in {{a finite}} rotating cylinder of moderate aspect ratio (radius {{four times the}} depth) is investigated numerically for a fluid of Prandtl number equal to 7 (corresponding essentially to water). We consider the effects of rotation from both the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force and find that the centrifugal force plays a significant dynamic role. In this initial study, we restrict the computations to the axisymmetric subspace in which the convection patterns near onset consist of steady concentric circular cells, the so-called target patterns, which have been studied and observed experimentally under different conditions {{by a number of}} investigators. As the convection is driven far enough beyond onset, the steady cellular patterns give way to time-periodic states in which the target patterns travel radially inward. We have identified two such travelling modes, primarily distinguished by one having alternating warm and cold plumes forming at the cylinder sidewall and then propagating radially inward to quench alternately cold and warm plumes on the axis. The other mode always has a cold plume descending on the sidewall and the adjacent warm plume periodically splits into two, with the innermost of the <b>split</b> <b>pair</b> travelling radially inward. The first of these modes is found when the centrifugal force is weak and the second for stronger centrifugal force. The large-scale meridional circulation driven by the centrifugal buoyancy is seen to favour having a cold plume descending on the sidewall, accounting for the switch to the second travelling mode. 1...|$|E
40|$|The spin Hall {{magnetoresistance}} (SHMR) is {{a recently}} discovered effect {{that occurs in}} a normal metal (NM) that is in contact with a magnetic material. An insulating magnetic material is ideal as it prevents other magnetic effects by confining the electrons to the NM. To study this a new method for making yttrium iron garnet (YIG) has been developed using sputtering techniques so that devices are quicker and cheaper to produce than by existing liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). The YIG material magnetic properties were extensively characterised up to 280 nm thick. The magnetisation drops below the bulk value in thin samples believed {{to be caused by}} a contaminated layer at the substrate interface. As the SHMR is an interface effect the roughness of the films is important and was investigated by X ray reflectivity (XRR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The crystal structure was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SHMR is also significantly improved by a factor of 3 after treating YIG with piranha acid before metals are deposited on top. For SHMR measurements platinum was used first and provided similar results to what is found in the literature. The angular dependence has been measured in a cryostat using four probe resistance measurements with a <b>split</b> <b>pair</b> magnet that allows the sample to be rotated in any direction relative to the applied field. This shows excellent agreement with the theory and was studied for the temperature range of 1. 5 K - 300 K. This data has then been fitted using various models for the spin diffusion length and the conclusion reached is that a variation of the Elliot-Yafet mechanism (EY) is the most likely explanation for the observed temperature dependence. The same effect was found to occur in tungsten but with the important difference that it has a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity. This has been successfully fitted with the same spin relaxation models as the platinum. The tungsten is not believed to be in the beta phase, something which if achieved in further work could allow the size of the effect be improved by an order of magnitude up to several percent and so potentially allow the effect to have applications in a device...|$|E

Lett. 114, 096602 (2015) ], we theoretically investigate Cooper <b>pair</b> <b>splitting</b> current in a graphene based Cooper pair beam splitter geometry. By considering the graphene based superconductor as an entangler device, instead of normal (2 D) BCS superconductor, we show that the Cooper <b>pair</b> <b>splitting</b> current mediated by Crossed Andreev process is amplified compared to its normal superconductor counterpart. This amplification is attributed to the strong suppression of local normal Andreev reflection process (arising from the Cooper <b>pair</b> <b>splitting)</b> from the graphene based superconductor to lead via the same quantum dot, {{in comparison to the}} usual 2 D superconductor. Due to the vanishing density of states at the Dirac point of undoped graphene, a doped graphene based superconductor is considered here and it is observed that Cooper <b>pair</b> <b>splitting</b> current is very insensitive to the doping level in comparison to the usual 2 D superconductor.
