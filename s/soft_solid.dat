The rheological nature of viscoelastic materials {{has long been a}} challenge, and it is still a matter of debate. Here, we provide {{for the first time the}} constitutive equations of linear viscoelasticity for magnetic wires in yield stress materials, together with experimental measurements using Magnetic Rotational Spectroscopy (MRS). With MRS, the wires are submitted to a rotational magnetic field as a function of frequency and the wire motion is monitored by time-lapse microscopy. The <b>soft</b> <b>solids</b> studied are gel-forming polysaccharide aqueous dispersions (gellan gum) at concentrations above the gelification point.

40|$|Repeated {{loading of}} a solid leads to {{microstructural}} damage that ultimately results in catastrophic material failure. While posing {{a major threat to}} the stability of virtually all materials, the microscopic origins of fatigue, especially for <b>soft</b> <b>solids,</b> remain elusive. Here we explore fatigue in colloidal gels as prototypical inhomogeneous <b>soft</b> <b>solids</b> by combining experiments and computer simulations. Our results reveal how mechanical loading leads to irreversible strand stretching, which builds slack into the network that softens the solid at small strains and causes strain hardening at larger deformations. We thus find that microscopic plasticity governs fatigue at much larger scales. This gives rise to a new picture of fatigue in <b>soft</b> thermal <b>solids</b> and calls for new theoretical descriptions of soft gel mechanics in which local plasticity is taken into account.

We extend {{this study to}} the case of <b>soft</b> <b>solids</b> under large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS). We show results from LAOS studies in a monodisperse hydrogel suspension, an aqueous gel, and a biopolymer suspension, and show that constant strain-rate frequency sweep measurements with <b>soft</b> <b>solids</b> can be superimposed onto master curves for higher harmonic moduli, with the same shift factors as for the linear viscoelastic moduli.

We show surface plots of the harmonic moduli and the energy dissipation rate per unit volume in LAOS for <b>soft</b> <b>solids,</b> and show experimentally that the energy dissipated per unit volume depends on the first harmonic loss modulus alone, in both the linear and the nonlinear viscoelastic regime.

A single equation accounting for those two successive processes nicely captures the full rheological response.

40|$|International audienceShear {{waves that}} {{propagate}} in <b>soft</b> <b>solids,</b> {{such as the}} brain, are strongly nonlinear and can develop into shock waves in less than one wavelength. We hypothesize that these shear shock waves could be responsible for certain types of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and that the spherical geometry of the skull bone could focus shear waves deep in the brain, generating diffuse axonal injuries. Theoretical models and numerical methods that describe nonlinear polarized shear waves in <b>soft</b> <b>solids</b> such as the brain are presented. They include the cubic nonlinearities that are characteristic of <b>soft</b> <b>solids</b> and the specific types of nonclassical attenuation and dispersion observed in soft tissues and the brain. The numerical methods are validated with analytical solutions, where possible, and with self-similar scaling laws where no known solutions exist. Initial conditions based on a human head X-ray microtomography (CT) were used to simulate focused shear shock waves in the brain. Three regimes are investigated with shock wave formation distances of 2 : 54 m; 0 : 018 m, and 0 : 0064 m. We demonstrate that under realistic loading scenarios, with nonlinear properties consistent with measurements in the brain, and when the shock wave propagation distance and focal distance coincide, nonlinear propagation can easily overcome attenuation to generate shear shocks deep inside the brain. Due to these effects, the accelerations in the focal are larger {{by a factor of}} 15 compared to acceleration at the skull surface.

40|$|Block {{copolymer}} soft solids {{are emerging}} {{as a means to}} spatially organize and store nanoparticulate material. Soft solids are formed as a disordered triblock copolymer solution [PEOx-PPOy-PEOx] transitions to a lyotropic liquid crystal. For certain chain architectures, the crystal structure of the <b>soft</b> <b>solid</b> undergoes an order-order transition (OOT) from spherical micelles packed in a cubic crystal structure to close packed cylindrical micelles. The focus of this thesis is to determine the impact of processing conditions and formulation on the structural parameters, flow mechanism, and timescales of soft solids. We study the effect of structural history and applied flow fields on the soft solids while the formulation is varied by incorporating nanoparticles into the polymer matrix. In the cubic phase, we found that the ordering kinetics occur on the timescale of minutes to tens of minutes depending on the structural history and the presence of particles. Furthermore, ordering of the cubic phase through the OOT occurs epitaxially. Without nanoparticles, a short application of high amplitude oscillations will macroscopically align the cubic and cylindrical phases into a persistent near single crystal. Changing the formulation through the addition of nanoparticles makes it more difficult to align the micellar crystals by shear, decreases the persistence of the alignment, and can change the unit cell of the micelle structure. By varying the formulation and phase behavior of the polymer matrix, nanoparticles can access different types of flocculation behavior. Specifically, the particles will aggregate in both the liquid and <b>soft</b> <b>solid,</b> remain dispersed in both phases, or re-disperse upon formation of the <b>soft</b> <b>solid.</b> These findings provide additional design parameters to improve the templating of nanoparticles in the <b>soft</b> <b>solid</b> as well as highlight the feasibility of using the phase behavior of the polymer solution to control the flocculation behavior and aggregate size.

40|$|Recent {{large-scale}} {{computer simulations}} {{suggest that it}} may be possible to create a new class of <b>soft</b> <b>solids,</b> called `bijels', by stabilizing and arresting the bicontinuous interface in a binary liquid demixing via spinodal decomposition using particles that are neutrally wetted by both liquids. The interfacial layer of particles is expected to be semi-permeable, hence, if realised, these new materials would have many potential applications, e. g. as microreaction media. However, the creation of bijels in the laboratory faces serious obstacles. In general, fast quench rates are necessary to bypass nucleation, so that only samples with limited thickness can be produced, which destroys the three-dimensionality of the putative bicontinuous network. Moreover, even a small degree of unequal wettability of the particles by the two liquids can lead to ill-characterised, `lumpy' interfacial layers and therefore irreproducible material properties. Here we report a reproducible protocol for creating three-dimensional samples of bijel in which the interfaces are stabilized by essentially a single layer of particles. We demonstrate how to tune the mean interfacial separation in these bijels, and show that mechanically, they indeed behave as <b>soft</b> <b>solids.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
