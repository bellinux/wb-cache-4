In {{this case the}} focus is on the communication of the <b>soft</b> product <b>quality</b> within an organization to achieve right quality. To fulfill the aim of this study a case company has been used to be able to show the absence in the topic. The questions of the study are: How have the customer’s needs been communicated within the organization? What absences are there today concerning the communication of the customer’s needs within the organization? How can the communication of the customer’s needs within the organization improve? The aim of this study is to describe and analyse how the transmitting of the customer’s needs concerning <b>soft</b> product <b>quality</b> is made today in the case company and to reach any improving suggestions. The vision of the study is to be a tool for other companies in a equal situation. The study has been performed through observations and interviews to make a base for reviews of the organizations processes. Then a Gap-analysis where made to identify absence in the present processes, then an ishikawa diagram followed to identify the main problem. A meeting was then held with the case company to discuss what’s been identified. The result of the study shows that the case company communicates hard and <b>soft</b> product <b>quality</b> in different ways. The <b>soft</b> product <b>quality</b> is tacit knowledge and difficult to write and transmit. The hard product quality on the other hand is explicit knowledge and always written and transmitted to everyone. Why the <b>soft</b> product <b>quality</b> doesn´t become communicated can be due to the difficulty to transmitting and incomprehension why the knowledge should be communicated to every personnel. An understanding why and what the gains are with spreading the knowledge must be created for those who possess the knowledge. A commitment by the personnel to embrace the knowledge must be made to achieve this. This study shows that the spoken communication is the major and best way to transmit the <b>soft</b> product <b>quality</b> in the case company...|$|R

50|$|Co-sleeping also {{increases}} {{the risks of}} suffocation and strangulation. The <b>soft</b> <b>quality</b> of the mattresses, comforters, and pillows may suffocate the infants. Some experts, then, recommend that the bed should be firm, {{and should not be}} a waterbed or couch; and that heavy quilts, comforters, and pillows should not be used. Another common advice given to prevent suffocation is to keep a baby on its back, not its stomach. Parents who roll over during their sleep could inadvertently crush and/or suffocate their child, especially if they are heavy sleepers, over-tired or over-exhausted and/or obese. There is also the risk of the baby falling to a hard floor, or getting wedged between the bed and the wall or headboard. A proposed solution to these problems is the bedside bassinet, in which, rather than bed-sharing, the baby's bed is placed next to the parent's bed.|$|E

We further investigate contingency relationships between {{the development of a}} QMS and its organizational contexts. Based on cluster analyses of quality management practices measured by the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) criteria, we found four patterns of service quality management practices: undeveloped, accommodating, strategic, and <b>soft</b> <b>quality</b> systems. Our research indicates that the type of quality system adopted by an organization is highly associated with organizational contextual factors. Our results indicate that environmental uncertainty shapes the development of a QMS in the early stage, while the perceived importance of quality induces the further development of a QMS to a strategic quality system. The results also show that small service firms that compete locally can achieve very good performance results using a <b>soft</b> <b>quality</b> system, a QMS with no formal process management systems.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{interaction}} between users and products is now of great interest due to a renewed consideration of the communicative aspects of products. The perceptions that products cause in users have been identified as the basis systems for evaluating a product, and input of behavioural responses and therefore purchase. Indeed, users go beyond function and technology of objects but pretend to live an experience during their interaction with the product. The materials, being the main substance of the products, are the central theme of these studies and of this research. It is in fact possible to analyze the semantic and expressive meaning of object through the sensory analysis of the materials and technologies used in the project. The properties that describe the interaction between materials and users through our five senses are defined as expressive and sensory properties of materials, also called <b>soft</b> <b>qualities.</b> Thus, this research focuses on materials used in the project and how technology can affect their sensory qualities. A design tool was then created for the visualisation of technologies' impact on materials' sensory properties: the project cards. The project cards reorganize materials and technologies according to the sensory and expressive features to be attributed to the surface with the purpose to link technologies to the effect obtainable with materials. The objective of this research is to generate a link between material selection, processing technologies, and the expressive and sensory characterisation of materials.

Note: this trill technique only works well for semi-tonal trills, it is far more difficult to vibrato trill for an interval of a tone or more.|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{design of}} {{hospital}} environments {{is determined by}} functional requirements and technical regulations, as well as numerous protocols, which define the structure and system characteristics that such environments need to achieve. In order to improve people's well-being {{and the quality of}} their experience within public hospitals, design elements (<b>soft</b> <b>qualities)</b> are added to those 'necessary' features. The aim of this has been to experiment a new design process so as to create health care spaces with high environmental quality and capable of meeting users’ emotional and perceptual needs. Methods. Such needs were investigated with the help of qualitative research tools and the design criteria for one of these <b>soft</b> <b>qualities</b> – colour – were subsequently defined {{on the basis of the}} findings. The colour scheme design for the new San Paolo Hospital Accident and Emergency Department in Milan was used as case study. Focus groups were fundamental in defining the project’s goals and criteria Results. The issues raised have led to the belief that the proper procedure is not the mere consultation of the users in order to define the goals: they should rather be involved in the whole design process and become co-agents of the choices that determine the environment characteristics, so as to best meet the quality requirements identified by the users themselves. Conclusions. The case study has shown the possibility of developing a designing methodology in three steps (or operational tools) in which users’ groups are involved in the choices, therefore leading to the planning of environments where compliance with expectations is already implied and verified by means of the process itself. Thus, the method leads to the creation of participated spaces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Large-scale, {{real-time}} multimedia distribution {{over the}} Internet {{has been the}} subject of research for a substantial amount of time. A large number of mechanisms, policies, methods and schemes have been proposed for media coding, scheduling and distribution. Internet Protocol (IP) multicast was expected to be the primary transport mechanism for this, though it was never deployed to the expected extent. Recent developments in overlay networks has reactualized the research on multicast, with the consequence that many of the previous mechanisms and schemes are being re-evaluated. One of the most important multicast services is real-time media streaming. This extended abstract discusses ongoing research on adapting a popular overlay distribution system, BitTorrent (BT), to provide a streaming service with <b>soft</b> <b>Quality</b> of Service (QoS) guarantees.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} an active grid {{resource}} management system supported by active networks for computational grid. First, we construct a scalable two-level resource management architecture. In this architecture, {{resources in the}} system are divided into multiple autonomous domains. In each domain, an active resource tree (ART) is organized with resources as its leaf nodes and active routers as non-leaf nodes. Resource information is disseminated into each active router in ART, and nodes in ART work cooperatively to discover and schedule resources. Communications between domains are done via the root of ART. Second, the resource trade between consumers and providers is carried out by an improved barter marketing model. The proposed model reduces the complexity and cost of the trade, and provides desired <b>soft</b> <b>quality</b> of service as well. We illustrate that the proposed system exhibits good scalability, autonomy, flexibility, and fault-tolerance. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Proposed as a {{scalable}} {{solution to}} provide <b>soft</b> <b>Quality</b> of Service (QoS), Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture enables service providers to offer each customer {{a range of}} services that are differentiated {{on the basis of}} performance. However, up to now little work discusses how to provide effective communication support for multimedia applications over the differentiated services network. In this paper we present a new enhanced communication approach at the end system to support distributed multimedia applications. Two new mechanisms are highlighted in our approach: enhanced communication stack to support differentiation within one flow, and the network-awareness provision for applications at the end system. Our approach improves the capability of both error resilience and flexible rate control for transmitting compressed multimedia bitstreams, particularly those using scalable coding technologies. We also develop an object-based video transmission system as an application instance {{to take advantage of the}} enhanced communication approach.

Breathiness (whispery voice) in high-pitch intervals is more spontaneously produced, and often appears to express an excited emotional state of the speaker, such as happiness, surprise. Another type is when the whole or almost the whole utterance becomes whispered (unvoiced), appearing in confidential talking, embarrassment, or when the speaker is talking to oneself. A breathy voice quality also appears in sighing speech. In this case, the intonation has a lowering pattern with low pitch and a <b>soft</b> voice <b>quality,</b> expressing disappointment, regret, weariness, or relief. Finally, laughing speech is also characterized by breathiness (aspiration), and further acoustic analysis accounting other prosodic features would be necessary for their identification.|$|R
