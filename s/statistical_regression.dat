25|$|Least-squares {{problems}} {{fall into}} two categories: linear or ordinary least squares and nonlinear least squares, depending {{on whether or not}} the residuals are linear in all unknowns. The linear least-squares problem occurs in <b>statistical</b> <b>regression</b> analysis; it has a closed-form solution. The nonlinear problem is usually solved by iterative refinement; at each iteration the system is approximated by a linear one, and thus the core calculation is similar in both cases.|$|E
25|$|In statistics, linear {{least squares}} {{problems}} correspond to a particularly important type of statistical model called linear regression which arises as a {{particular form of}} regression analysis. One basic form of such a model is an ordinary least squares model. The present article concentrates on the mathematical aspects of linear least squares problems, with discussion of the formulation and interpretation of <b>statistical</b> <b>regression</b> models and statistical inferences related to these being {{dealt with in the}} articles just mentioned.

40|$|The {{potential}} impact of global temperature change on global crop yield has recently been assessed with di erent methods. Here we show that grid-based and point-based simulations and <b>statistical</b> <b>regressions</b> (from historic records), without deliberate adaptation or CO 2 fertilization e ects, produce similar estimates of temperature impact on wheat yields at global and national scales. With a 1 ◦C global temperature increase, global wheat yield is projected to decline between 4. 1 % and 6. 4 %. Projected relative temperature impacts from di erent methods were similar for major wheat-producing countries China, India, USA and France, but less so for Russia. Point-based and grid-based simulations, {{and to some extent}} the <b>statistical</b> <b>regressions,</b> were consistent in projecting that warmer regions are likely to su er more yield loss with increasing temperature than cooler regions. By forming a multi-method ensemble, it was possible to quantify ‘method uncertainty’ in addition to model uncertainty. This significantly improves confidence in estimates of climate impacts on global food security...|$|R
