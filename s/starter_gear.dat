50|$|A {{freewheel}} assembly is also {{widely used}} on engine starters {{as a kind}} of protective device. Starter motors usually need to spin at 3,000 RPM to get the engine to turn over. When the key is held in the start position for any amount of time after the engine has started, the starter can not spin fast enough {{to keep up with the}} flywheel. Because of the extreme gear ratio between <b>starter</b> <b>gear</b> and flywheel (about 15 or 20:1) it would spin the starter armature at dangerously high speeds, causing an explosion when the centripetal force acting on the copper coils wound in the armature can no longer resist the outward force acting on them. In starters without the freewheel or overrun clutch this would be a major problem because, with the flywheel spinning at about 1,000 RPM at idle, the starter, if engaged with the flywheel, would be forced to spin between 15,000 and 20,000 RPM. Once the engine has turned over and is running, the overrun clutch will release the starter from the flywheel and prevent the gears from re-meshing (as in an accidental turning of the ignition key) while the engine is running. A freewheel clutch is now used in many motorcycles with an electric starter motor. It is used as a replacement for the Bendix drive used on most auto starters because it reduces the electrical needs of the starting system.|$|E
50|$|Engines with manual {{transmission}} {{usually have a}} heavy flywheel, typically 5 to 10 kg of cast iron, with the <b>starter</b> ring <b>gear</b> shrunk onto the outside. This is done by heating the ring to around 200 °C to expand the ring which is then placed onto the flywheel, often held in firmly against a location shoulder until cool. The interference fit renders the starter ring firmly attached to the flywheel. Engines with automatic transmissions instead have a pressed steel plate with the <b>starter</b> ring <b>gear</b> usually welded onto {{the outside of the}} plate.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn general {{technical}} applications, truck {{heavy duty}} engine flywheel <b>starter</b> ring <b>gears</b> teeth is conventionally induction {{hardened and tempered}} {{in order to meet}} metallurgical aspects on specification. Especially for large sectioned <b>starter</b> ring <b>gears</b> (in this case diameter of the gear is 470 mm) the critical issue is to maintain a stable hardness distribution on gear cross sections. These hardness variations in process could yield to: 1. High scrap costs due to out of specification parts. 2. Increase in tact time in process, decrease in labor efficiency due to scrap rate and excessive hardness measurements. 3. Potential risk of failure on engine in low mileages. 4. 100 % hardness measurements in ongoing process which leads to time and cost waste. This technical paper summarizes the case study conducted for truck flywheel <b>starter</b> ring <b>gears</b> with diameter of 470 mm in order to reduce hardness variation by optimization of induction hardening and tempering processes...|$|R

50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{are composed}} of a breech, into which the cartridge is inserted, which {{is connected to the}} motor by a short steel pipe, which acts like a gun barrel. The blank cartridge fits into the breech, and is triggered either electrically or mechanically. When the aircraft's ignition is turned on and the cartridge is fired, high-velocity, high-pressure gas (~ at ~600 ft/s) shoots down the pipe, forcing the motor to spin and engage the <b>starter</b> ring <b>gear</b> on the engine, which is attached to the crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|A <b>starter</b> ring <b>gear,</b> {{sometimes}} called a starter ring or ring gear, is a {{medium carbon steel}} ring with teeth that is fitted {{on the periphery of}} a flexplate or flywheel of an internal combustion engine, mostly for automotive or aircraft applications. The teeth of the starter ring are driven by the smaller gear (the pinion) of the starter motor. The primary function of the starter ring is to transfer torque from the starter motor pinion to the flywheel or flexplate to rotate the engine to begin the cycle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electric}} starter motor or cranking motor {{is the most}} common type used on gasoline engines and small diesel engines. The modern starter motor is either a permanent-magnet or a series-parallel wound direct current electric motor with a starter solenoid (similar to a relay) mounted on it. When DC power from the starting battery is applied to the solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch (the [...] "ignition switch"), the solenoid engages a lever that pushes out the drive pinion on the starter driveshaft and meshes the pinion with the <b>starter</b> ring <b>gear</b> on the flywheel of the engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{electric}} <b>starter</b> {{works with}} <b>gears</b> and clutch plate linking the motor and the engine. The clutch {{is used to}} disengage when optimum speed is achieved. This is usually done automatically. The electric supply is used to start the motor {{as well as for}} ignition. The voltage is usually built up slowly as starter gains speed.|$|R
50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{had several}} advantages over other starting systems in {{use at the}} time. Electric starters required large, heavy, and often troublesome batteries to be carried on board, or external charging equipment had to be located at every place where the vehicle was anticipated to operate. Inertia starters used a heavy wheel, usually made of brass, which was spun by a hand crank or electric motor, causing the spinning wheel to engage the <b>starter</b> ring <b>gear.</b> The Coffman system was more lightweight and compact than inertial starters or internal batteries, {{and it did not}} require any special auxiliary equipment, an important feature when operating in remote areas.|$|R
50|$|The <b>starter</b> ring <b>gear</b> is most {{commonly}} made by forming {{a length of}} square or rectangular steel bar into a circle and welding the ends together. There then follow various operations such as normalising (to remove stresses and improve the properties in the weld area), turning, generating the teeth by gear hobbing and finally a heat-treatment operation(s). The teeth of the starter ring need to be hardened {{in order to increase}} their strength and resist wear. The normal hardness at pitch circle diameter is 45-55 HRC. The body of the ring is generally left untreated which gives some ductility for shrinking onto a flywheel or welding to a flexplate.|$|R
5000|$|Corvair Powerglide is a fully {{automatic}}, two-speed, rwd aluminum-cased {{automatic transmission}} mounted {{directly to the}} forward face of the cast iron differential housing. It uses a three-element, welded assembly 10 in diameter torque converter mounted remotely on the rear face of the differential, (that also incorporates the <b>starter</b> ring <b>gear,</b> and a centrifugal fan baffle for cooling, via slots in the engine bellhousing) and is driven directly from the engine crankshaft by a flexplate inside the engine bellhousing. The selector quadrant is arranged R-N-D-L, or Reverse, Neutral, Drive and Low, with no [...] "Park" [...] (except in Pontiac's 1963 version, redesigned to handle the increased torque of a new V8 engine in Tempest and LeMans, added {{by means of a}} separate lever). Range selection is via dash-mounted selector lever operating a sheathed cable that moves a spool valve range selector in the transmission valve body.|$|R
5000|$|The 2008 KTM 300 EXC is {{the first}} {{electric}} start two-stroke enduro bike to be released by a major manufacturer. For 2010, Husaberg the other KTM owned bike company, offered the TE300, an XC-W with minor modifications to the body and suspension settings. From 2011 on the 300s got 6-speed gearboxes, a new exhaust pipe and silencer, and translucent fuel tanks. The 2012s got improvements to the starter, more frame changes resulting in more wheel travel, and a new air box with a filter that can be replaced {{without the use of}} tools. The 2013s got a diaphragm spring clutch, a stronger starter and lighter battery. In 2013, the Husaberg became the Husqvarna TE300 and was given the linkage rear suspension. The 2014 had a new CDI ignition system. The 2015 model chromoly steel frame is painted orange like the motocross models. All the 2015 models have the new White Power 4CS forks with revised damping, the ability to make adjustments on the fly and a smaller front axle. The triple clamps have 2 mm less offset resulting in more trail and different steering characteristics. The rear shock is longer but the travel is unchanged. The electric <b>starter</b> has different <b>gearing</b> to provide higher initial torque from the electric motor, and the battery is lighter and stronger.|$|R
