Meteorological measurements have shown that, in the last 30  years, heavy rainfall events in excess of 50  mm[*]·[*]h− 1 have increased in Japan (The Japan Meteorological Agency [2013]).

In this study, we outline the general structure of the project and the methods used in the activities that have been thus far conducted. A GIS approach was used. We used the soil-landscape paradigm for the prediction of soil classes and their spatial distribution or the prediction of soil properties based on landscape features. The work is divided into two main phases. In the first phase, the available digital data on land cover, geology and topography were processed and classified according to their influence on weathering processes and soil properties. The methods used in the interpretation are based on consolidated and generalized knowledge about the influence of geology, topography and land cover on soil properties. The existing soil data (areal and point data) were collected, reviewed, validated and standardized according to international and national guidelines. Point data considered to be usable were input into a specific database created for the project. Using expert interpretation, all digital data were merged to produce a first draft of the Land Unit Map. During the second phase, this map will be implemented with the existing soil data and verified in the field if also needed with new soil data collection, and the final Land Unit Map will be produced.

Undisturbed soil cores from 12 different sites were collected by a hollow hydraulic auger to a depth of approximately 1400 mm. Primary treated sewage effluent with the following characteristics; 8. 2 mg/L as NO 3 ¬-N, 0. 79 mg/L as PO 43 -, pH 7. 89, EC 0. 9 ds/m and COD 185 mg/L was applied to the soil columns. Due to the heterogeneity of the soil structure and its chemical characteristics, the <b>soil</b> <b>capability</b> for removing effluent contaminants varied widely. The results for the sandy soil types reported an 80 % removal in the nitrate, phosphorus and salt content after 240 mL flow; then the concentration of nutrients started to increase significantly in effluent samples collected from the lower section of the sandy soil columns. The wash-off of the accumulated salts and ammonia fixation resulting from the high organic matter content in this region of the columns. The soils with heavy clay content and a high cation exchange capacity provided 95 % nitrate and total phosphorus removal and 50 % salt reduction in the first few centimetres of the columns. Also, some soils were relatively impermeable due to the amount and type of the clay present in the soil which prevented the effluent from percolating through the columns. This resulted in effluent ponding on the surface for long periods of time. It is hypothesised that in the effluent ponding situations, the effluent would need to find an easier and more convenient path to percolate through the soil such as lateral flow and the evapotranspiration would play a key role in reducing the ponded effluent...|$|E

Decision Support Systems (DSS) are useful tools for such planning. Consequently, it is essential that land decision support systems are no longer confined to research centers but also adopted by the production sector and public administration. The MicroLEIS DSS developed by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) is a user-friendly and suitable user-useful tool for local government officials, consultants and other land use decision makers. The evaluation process entails dynamic interactions between soil, climate and management variables. It includes 12 modules that allow for the assessment of <b>soil</b> <b>capability</b> and vulnerability, and the consequences of future global change scenarios. Here, we illustrate the application of MicroLEIS for land use planning in Asia where this kind of assessment is rather scarce. The decision support system was applied for Ahar, located in East Azarbaijan (Iran). Six agro-ecological land evaluation models, constituents of MicroLEIS DSS software, were selected for land evaluation at the regional level. We identified areas suitable for agricultural production, species suitable for restoring areas marginal for crop production, and suitable crop combinations, and performed a <b>soil</b> <b>capability</b> classification in the soil units.

30|$|One of the {{potential}} sources of organic carbon return to the soils is the crop residue produced during the cropping season and post harvest. These residues usually go waste and create environmental sanitation issues. However, if incorporated in the soils it can increase crop yield (Han et al. 2017). Loss of organic carbon from the soil reduces crop productivity worldwide. Therefore, locally feasible practices are needed to support farmers to help regain soil organic matter (Wei et al. 2015). Farmers usually lack knowledge {{on the importance of}} microbial resources in the above-ground and below-ground soils and benefits of their on-farm implications. They also lack information on biological management of farms using microbial technologies, potentialities of managed integration of on-farm resources and conversion of agro-wastes into organic farm inputs to enhance <b>soil</b> <b>capabilities</b> (Han et al. 2017). These issues, if accepted, worked out and adapted by the resource-poor farmers can help in minimizing dependency on external chemicals and fertilizers, reducing cost of crop production and improving ecosystem services in the soils.

Our study was focused on soil Cu and Zn accumulation and bioavailability as related to some soil properties under a long term vineyard cultivation, in a D. O. C. wine area of South Italy (Calabria region). Soils selected from different landscape units, ranging from acid to alkaline, under homogeneous climate conditions and vineyard management system, were investigated. Each soil was sampled in both a vineyard and a fallow area, at the depth levels of 0 - 10 cm, 10 - 25 cm and 25 - 50 cm. The experimental data were analysed by ANOVA, correlation and multiple stepwise regression pro-cedures. As expected, the results indicated a contamination of the vineyard soils by Cu due to the repeated appli-cation of Cu-based products in the plant disease control, with increments of total Cu content up to 150 % against the fallow soils. On the contrary, the results led to exclude any soil Zn pollution due to the vineyard management and to suppose a main pedogenic origin for this metal. According to the relationships between Cu content and soil properties, Cu accumulation was promoted by higher pH, clay and organic matter contents. These soil properties also showed a strong influence on metal bioavailability, which underwent {{a significant reduction in}} soils with high-er pH and clay contents. A further result of great significance was the adverse impact of soil erosion, enhanced by the application of not suitable management systems in hilly areas, on <b>soil</b> <b>capability</b> to retain polluting metals.

Denitrification, a respiratory process using nitrogen oxides as electron acceptors {{in the absence of}} oxygen, is the main source of N 2 O. The end product of denitrification is benign dinitrogen (N 2) and understanding what regulates the shift in ratio of N 2 O and N 2 emission is crucial for mitigation strategies.
