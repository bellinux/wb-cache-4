Cuman women had a high reputation for their beauty amongst the Russian aristocracy. Robert de Clari reported that the Cumans often wore a sleeveless sheepskin vest, usually worn in conjunction with bracers. [...] Underneath the vest was worn a short or long sleeved tunic/tabard, extended to the mid calf, splitting {{in the front and}} back between the legs. Men wore trousers and a caftan, each fastened by a belt, which was the traditional costume. The women also wore caftans, as well as pants, dresses, and tunics shorter than those worn by men, sometimes split along the front, back, and sides. Clothes were commonly coloured deep crimson for decoration. Cuman men wore distinguishing conical felt or leather hats, pointed at the top with a broad brim (if made of felt) or a fur trim around the base (if made of leather). The brim of the hat formed a sharp angle at the front and upturned on the rear and at the sides. Women wore a large variety of head dresses and also wore conical hats but with a felt top and a cloth veil extending down the back. This veil only covered the back neck and not the hair or face; another source states that it did cover the hair and that sometimes one or two braids were visible. Women wore a variety of jewellery, such as torques, a type of neck ornament consisting of one or several metal strands attached to a ribbon or necklace and hung around the neck, and head dresses that were made of a series of silver rings on a solid, cylindrically <b>shaped</b> <b>material</b> that was fastened at the temples. The men shaved the top of their head, {{while the rest of the}} hair was plaited into several braids; they also had prominent moustaches. Other Cumans also wore their hair very long, without shaving the top. The women had their hair loose or braided with buns twisting at the side. Both men and women followed a tradition of braiding coloured ribbons into their hair. For footwear, Cuman men and women wore long leather or felt boots with support straps connected to their belt. Both men and women wore cloth or metal arm bands.|$|E

A cylindrical <b>shaped</b> <b>material</b> is axially excited by an electromagnetic shaker and consequent displacement waves are investigated. Using a frequency sweep as an excitation signal, the frequency domain displacement response is measured upstream and sideways of the sample itself. A plane cross-section analytical model of the experimental setup is used to estimate Poisson's ratio through a minimisation-based procedure, applied to radial displacement once the complex modulus has been directly determined under the assumption of spring-like behaviour of the axial displacement. The results are presented and discussed for different materials and compared to well-established quasi-static and finite element simulations...|$|E

A recently developed potential formulation that provides a flexible basis for numerical computation of time-harmonic field problems involving continuously and discretely inhomogeneous axially symmetric media is the topic of this paper. The formulation manifests itself in both a differential equation system and, alternately, a variational criterion. Typical numerical applications include solutions of scattering by arbitrarily <b>shaped</b> <b>material</b> bodies of revolution and radiation from inhomogeneously loaded rotationally symmetric antenna structures. Current numerical investigations by the authors, using Mei’s unimoment method in conjunction with both finite-difference and finite-element techniques, have shown the formulation to be highly feasible for computation of field problems having dimensions as large as several wavelengths.
