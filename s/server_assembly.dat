40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} using {{design of experiments}} (DoE) and simulation modeling to optimize the facility layout in a <b>server</b> <b>assembly</b> line, while introducing a new product. The critical factors that impact the performance metrics of cycle time, work-in-process and throughput were identified by using DoE principles. Subsequently, simulation modeling {{was used to evaluate}} the various what-if scenarios for determining the optimal physical location of the key operations in the server fabrication process. The factors identified by DoE, such as distances between operations, batch sizes, frequency of transactions, transportation types and resource utilizations were studied closely for the feasibility of the re-layout scenarios. The performance measures and results from the simulation models were then used to develop the layout for the <b>server</b> <b>assembly</b> process...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{or service}} systems with {{multiple}} product classes, job circulation due to random failures, resources shared between product classes, and some {{portions of the}} manufacturing or assembly carried in series and the rest in parallel are commonly observed in real-life. The web <b>server</b> <b>assembly</b> is one such manufacturing system which exhibits the above characteristics. Predicting the performance measures of these manufacturing systems {{is not an easy}} task. The primary objective of this research was to propose analytical approximations to predict the flow times of the manufacturing systems, with the above characteristics, and evaluate its accuracy. The manufacturing system is represented as a network of queues. The parametric decomposition approach is used to develop analytical approximations for a system with arrival and service rates from a Markovian distribution. The results from the analytical approximations are compared to simulation models. In order to bridge the gap in error, correction terms were developed through regression modeling. The experimental study conducted indicates that the analytical approximations along with the correction terms can serve as a good estimate for the flow times of the manufacturing systems with the above characteristics.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} integrated simulation modeling-Design For Six Sigma (DFSS) framework {{to study the}} design and process issues in a server manufacturing environment. The <b>server</b> <b>assembly</b> process is characterized by long cycle times, high fall-out rates and extremely complex assembly operations. To ensure on-time customer delivery, these enterprises adopt a make-to-plan and build-to-order philosophy. However, this model is extremely complex, resulting in wastes and inefficiencies in the associated processes. Lean and six sigma approaches {{have been successful in}} improving performance by eliminating waste in the design and operational processes. In this study, an integrated simulation modeling- DFSS framework is proposed to (i) address effects of variation, (ii) assess interactions effects between various sub-systems, and (iii) study proposed process (or design) changes, while performing “what-if ” analysis. This framework was then used to identify opportunities for improving the operational and design issues in a server manufacturing environment. ...|$|E

40|$|Reactor noise {{research}} {{has been a long}} established activity in our institute. From the commissioning of the Hungarian Paks NPP units, reactor noise {{research has}} been focussed on the power plant reactors. From that time we have dealt with all aspects of the field, signal conditioning, data acquisition, evaluation and interpretation. We have also taken part in the development of different software and hardware systems to support these activities. Recently we started an upgrading process of all systems. At first we have planned a data acquisition system by a new concept. This new system should consist of four autonomous facilities at the four reactor units. Each facility consists of a 352 channel signal conditioning unit with separate channels for all signals, two 352 channel fast multiplexing assemblies, which feed separate data acquisition modules and a server PC. Fast multiplexing channels are doubled, because input signals are separated into DC and AC components. The system capacity can easily be extended up to 512 signals. The 352 signal capacity was chosen as an optimum. While all <b>server</b> <b>assemblies</b> have also client functions, a central computer is connected to the servers via a high speed network for...|$|R

Research will investigate several methods and find proper way to have an order book simulation where practical optimization problem may contain thousands of variables and the simulation running times of developed algorithms were taken into account with high importance.

40|$|Parallel {{processing}} is {{prevalent in}} many manufacturing and service systems. Many manufactured products are built and assembled from several components fabricated in parallel lines. An {{example of this}} manufacturing system configuration is observed at a manufacturing facility equipped to assemble and test web servers. Characteristics of a typical web <b>server</b> <b>assembly</b> line are: multiple products, job circulation, and paralleling processing. The primary objective {{of this research was}} to develop analytical approximations to predict performance measures of manufacturing systems with job failures and parallel processing. The analytical formulations extend previous queueing models used in assembly manufacturing systems in that they can handle serial and different configurations of paralleling processing with multiple product classes, and job circulation due to random part failures. In addition, appropriate correction terms via regression analysis were added to the approximations in order to minimize the gap in the error between the analytical approximation and the simulation models. Markovian and general type manufacturing systems, with multiple product classes, job circulation due to failures, and fork and join systems to model parallel processing were studied. In the Markovian and general case, the approximations without correction terms performed quite well for one and two product problem instances. However, it was observed that the flow time error increased as the number of products and net traffic intensity increased. Therefore, correction terms for single and fork-join stations were developed via regression analysis to deal with more than two products. The numerical comparisons showed that the approximations perform remarkably well when the corrections factors were used in the approximations. In general, the average flow time error was reduced from 38. 19 % to 5. 59 % in the Markovian case, and from 26. 39 % to 7. 23 % in the general case. All the equations stated in the analytical formulations were implemented as a set of Matlab scripts. By using this set, operations managers of web <b>server</b> <b>assembly</b> lines, manufacturing or other service systems with similar characteristics can estimate different system performance measures, and make judicious decisions - especially setting delivery due dates, capacity planning, and bottleneck mitigation, among others. ...|$|E
40|$|The EU RoHS {{legislation}} {{currently has}} an exemption {{to allow the}} continued use of lead based solder in Class A servers until at least 2010. There are industry proposals in place to extend this exemption to 2012 or beyond due to the added challenge of producing highly reliable lead-free <b>server</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Dell has surpassed the requirements of this legislation by transitioning all recently released Class A server printed circuit board assemblies to lead-free. This case study paper will outline the process followed, the testing performed, the material changes made, and the challenges that were met and overcome in this dedicated year-long effort by a large team of people. A great deal of reliability testing was performed to ensure there was no compromise to the expected life of the product. The most significant challenge was in selecting a PCB surface finish. Immersion silver has been ruled out due to its susceptibility to creep corrosion. OSP finish did not provide sufficient wetting capability after two surface mount passes. In the end, lead-free Hot Air Solder Level (HASL) finish was selected due to its superior solderability and testability. However, laminate material, alloy type, and process conditions had to be carefully selected to ensure compatibility with this surface finish. Since September, 2007, all Dell’s newly released server motherboards were built lead-free and all quality targets have been successfully met...|$|R
