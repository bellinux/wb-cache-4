40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the effect of <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> on cardiorespiratory mortality is modified by cold temperatures. Poisson regression models were used to investigate the relationship between lagged <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> concentration and daily mortality, and whether the effect of <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> on mortality was modified by cold temperature for three Scottish cities from January 1981 to December 2001. For all-cause respiratory and non-cardiorespiratory mortality, there was a significant association between mortality and lagged <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> concentration. Generally the maximum <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> effect occurred at lag 0, although these estimates were not statistically significant. A 10 mgm 23 increase in the daily mean <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> concentration on any given day was associated with a 1. 68 % (95 % CI 0. 72 to 2. 65) increase in all-cause mortality and a 0. 43 % (95 % CI 20. 97 to 1. 86), 5. 36 % (95 % CI 2. 93 to 7. 84) and 2. 13 % (95 % CI 0. 82 to 3. 47) increase in cardiovascular, respiratory and non-cardiorespiratory mortality, respectively, over the ensuing 30 -day period. The effect of <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> on mortality did not vary significantly between seasons (cool and warm periods). For all-cause, cardiovascular and non-cardiorespiratory mortality the inclusion of interaction terms did not improve the models, although for all-cause and non-cardiorespiratory mortality there was a suggestion for interaction between temperature and recent <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure. The results of this study suggested a greater effect of <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> on mortality at low temperatures. Since extremes of cold and particulate pollution may coexist, for example during temperature inversion, these results may have important public health implications...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to investigate whether deprivation index modifies the acute effect of <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> on cardiorespiratory mortality. Generalised linear Poisson regression models were used to investigate whether deprivation index (as measured by the Carstairs deprivation index) modified the acute effect of <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> on mortality in two largest Scottish cities (Glasgow and Edinburgh) between January 1981 and December 2001. Lag periods of up to 1 month were assumed {{for the effects of}} <b>black</b> <b>smoke.</b> Deprivation index significantly modified the effect of <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> on mortality, with <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> effects generally increasing as level of deprivation increased. The interaction coefficient from a parametric model assuming a linear interaction between <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> (μg/m− 3) and deprivation in their effect on mortality—equivalent to a test of ‘linear trend’ across Carstairs categories—was significant for all mortality outcomes. In a model where <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> effects were estimated independently for each deprivation category, the estimated increase in respiratory mortality over the ensuing 1 -month period associated with a 10 μg/m 3 increase in the mean <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> concentration was 8. 0 % (95 % CI 5. 1 to 10. 9) for subjects residing in the ‘most’ deprived category (Carstairs category 7) compared to 3. 7 % (95 % CI − 0. 7 to 8. 4) for subjects residing in the ‘least’ deprived category (Carstairs category 1). The results suggest a stronger effect of <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> on mortality among people living in more deprived areas. The effect was greatest for respiratory mortality, although significant trends were also seen for other groups. If corroborated, these findings could have important public health implications...|$|R

The test material used in this exercise was commercial <b>smoked</b> <b>black</b> peppercorns acquired from an on-line store, which were in the EURL PAH laboratories finely ground and homogenised. Participants also received a solution of PAHs in the solvent of their choice (either toluene or acetonitrile) with known PAH content for the verification of their instrument calibration. Both officially nominated National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) and official food control laboratories (OCLs) of the EU Member States participated in the study. Twenty-nine NRLs and 18 OCLs subscribed for participation. The test material was characterised at the EURL PAH. The assigned values and their uncertainties were determined from independent replicate measurements on two different days by a primary method of measurement. Participants were free to choose the method of analysis. The performance of the participating laboratories in the determination of the target PAHs in the test material was expressed by both z-scores and zeta-scores. Additionally, the compliance of reported method performance characteristics was checked against specifications given in legislation. This PT demonstrated the competence of the participating laboratories in the analysis of regulated PAHs in <b>smoked</b> <b>black</b> pepper. About 67 % percent of the reported test results were graded with z-scores below an absolute value of two, indicating acceptable agreement with the independently assigned values of the test material. The EURL PAH asked participants to assess also compliance of the sample with legislative limits. Seventy one percent of the participants, who answered to this question, assessed the compliance of the test sample with EU legislation correctly.

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} {{investigate}} both {{the influence of}} English slang on Italian current usage and some innovative aspects introduced by the Italian variety. The assumption from which the paper starts is that the contact between the two lexical varieties is not accidental, in that the semantics, the morphology, and even the phonology of English slang have massively affected Italian slang vocabulary, and inspired the creation of neologisms by analogy with pre-existent patterns. In the past, Giacomelli (1988) suggested that, although the contact between English and Italian slang is undeniable {{in the case of}} direct borrowings (flash, freak, pusher) and of some intensifiers (duro, peso, tosto [hard]), the relationship between these two varieties is often accidental. For instance, he claims that the connection between the Italian drug slang words buco, erba, fumo, nero, sniffare and their English counterparts (hole, grass, <b>smoke,</b> <b>black,</b> to sniff) is weak, vague, unnecessary, or even unreal (Giacomelli 1988 : 44, 197). The position I take in this paper is different. On the one hand, I claim that some similarities between English and Italian slang terms could have arisen by coincidence and/or independent figurative developments. For instance, English grass (or herb) and Italian erba could have been independently associated with the idea of ‘marijuana’, because of the consistency and colour of the drug. On the other hand, the possibility of influence is strengthened by the existence of definite calques from English in this field. For instance, the Italian term cavallo acquired the sense ‘opium’ when Trainspotting was translated in Italian: Quasi tutti i tossici che conosco in Inghilterra se lo fumano il cavallo, invece di bucarsi. (Welsh 1993, trans. Zeuli 1996 : 250 cited in Ambrogio and Casalegno 2004 : 82) ‘Maist English junkies ah know smoke horse rather than shoot it up. ’. Hence, I am not basically disagreeing with Giacomelli (1988), but claiming that Italian has evolved since 1988, and the interlinguistic contact with English is at present favoured by many factors, including the Internet, which helps long distance communication...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Research {{evidence}} suggests that exposure to ambient air pollutants can adversely affect the growth {{and development of the}} foetus and infant survival. Much less is known regarding the potential for an association between <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> air pollution and stillbirth risk. This potential association was examined using data from the historical cohort UK Particulate Matter and Perinatal Events Research (PAMPER) study. Methods: Using data from paper-based neonatal records from the two major maternity hospitals in Newcastle upon Tyne (UK), a birth record database of all singletons born during 1961 – 1992 to mothers resident in the city was constructed. Weekly <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> levels were obtained from routine data recorded at 20 air pollution monitoring stations over the study period. A two-stage statistical modelling strategy was used, incorporating temporally and spatially varying covariates to estimate <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure during each trimester and for the whole pregnancy period for each individual pregnancy. Conditional logistic regression models, with stratification on year of birth, were used to assess potential associations between <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> exposures in pregnancy and stillbirth risk. Results: The PAMPER database consists of 90, 537 births, between 1962 and 1992, with complete gestational age and residential address information, of which 812 were stillborn. There was no association between <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> exposures in any trimester or across whole pregnancy and risk of stillbirth. Adjustment for potential confounders did not alter these results. Conclusions: While <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> in pregnancy is likely to be related to other pregnancy outcomes, our findings do not suggest that <b>black</b> <b>smoke</b> air pollution exposure during pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirth...|$|R
