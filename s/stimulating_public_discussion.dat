40|$|Given {{that public}} {{television}} {{is involved in}} the public and political life of our society, we believe that it should be necessary to study the debating skills of moderators and especially their role in <b>stimulating</b> <b>public</b> <b>discussion.</b> We explored the role of the moderator, socio-professional aspects of the profession, with emphasis on the study of verbal expression and specific speech acts, which are used in specific discourse. The aim of the study of the public television moderator's communication strategies is to focus on language skills, competences and facilities in terms of moderators defending the public interest - start from the Act on Czech Television and Czech Television Codex. We focused on specific techniques and strategies of the moderator's discourse. We investigated how the induction of the host achieves cooperation and clarity in communication, as well as how the moderator achieves a minimum of manipulative or persuasive communication. Moderators should in particular avoid any signs of manipulative or persuasive rhetoric, and {{they should be able to}} recognise this. For this they may use the entire system of the language and all types of speech acts...|$|E

These {{papers are}} {{published}} to communicate the results of the Bank’s ongoing research and to <b>stimulate</b> <b>public</b> <b>discussion.</b> In this paper, we report preliminary results from an ongoing effort to improve data on bilateral migration stocks. We set out some working hypotheses on the determinants and socioeconomic implications of South-South migration. Contrary to popular perception that migration is mostly a South-North phenomenon, South-South migration is large. Available data from national censuses suggest that nearly half of the migrants from developing countries reside in other developing countries. Almost 80 percent of South South migration takes place between countries with contiguous borders. Estimates of South-South remittances range from 9 to 30 percent of developing countries’ remittance receipts in 2005. Although the impact of South South migration on the income of migrants and natives is smaller than for South-North migration, small increases in income can have substantial welfare implications for the poor. The costs of South-South remittances are even higher than those of North-South remittances. These findings suggest that policymakers should pay attention to the complex challenges that developing countries face not only as countries of origin, but also as countries of destination.

These {{papers are}} {{published}} {{to communicate the}} results of the Bank’s ongoing research and to <b>stimulate</b> <b>public</b> <b>discussion.</b> This report, produced with the help of Madagascar’s national education team in 2006 - 07, is designed to contribute to ongoing education reform discussions. It analyzes the constraints to system expansion and presents possible next steps for an appropriate course of action. This report aims to encourage discussion among policymakers, stakeholders and donors, and does not promote one approach over another. To promote a more competitive economy in Madagascar in the 21 st century, the government expects to increase the average years of schooling from the current 4. 5 years to about 9 - 10 years by 2015 for the relative age groups. This report discusses the ongoing reform and its impact and provides suggestions for implementation. This report is intended {{to be used as a}} discussion instrument and to be disseminated among Madagascar’s stakeholders in education. We hope this report will contribute to improved implementation of the secondary education reform in Madagascar.

40|$|History {{shows that}} {{different}} rates of poverty reduction {{over the past}} five decades have been closely related to differences in agricultural performance - particularly the rate of growth of agricultural productivity. In Asia, the rapid productivity gains of the Green Revolution increased producers, income, raised labourers, wages and lowered the price of food. In addition, new livelihood opportunities were generated when success in agriculture provided the basis for economic diversification. However, despite decades of investment in new agricultural technology and rural development, hunger and poverty continue to plague large areas of the developing world. The problem is particularly acute in sub-Saharam Africa, where progress towards the Millennium Development Goals is slowest. While increasing agricultural productivity perhaps remains the single most important determinant of economic growth and poverty reduction, serious doubts are emerging as to whether agricultural productivity can be futher increased, where it is most needed and what part, if any, small scale farming will play in future. Development experts need greater understanding of the links between agricultural productivity and poverty. They also need to asess just how far they have changed {{and the extent to which}} small scale agriculture can remain a ladder out of poverty for millions of people living in rural areas. In this paper what we know of the impact of agricultural performance on poverty reduction in the developing world is reviewed, while some emerging issues and questions that arose are addressed.

40|$|The new {{development}} paradigm strongly reconfirms and redefines {{the importance of}} M&E because of some newly incorporated principles. First, increased value is attached to results-orientation, iterative learning and evidence-based policy-making. Realisation of these principles is conditional upon a strong and well-functioning M&E system. A second major principle is an increased role and responsibility for the national government in elaborating and managing the entire M&E system. At the same time, donors are expected to increasingly rely and align to national M&E systems and arrangements. So far, however, a narrowly confined ‘technocratic’ approach to M&E has been adopted, largely neglecting its institutional and political embeddedness. While the fact that politics are {{part and parcel of}} M&E has been acknowledged before in the context of projects and programmes, it seems that when moving to the sectoral and national level (where interests and stakeholders are multiplied) the interaction among ‘politics’ and ‘M&E’ is disregarded. This paper elaborates a conceptual framework that furthers the understanding of the interlinkages among politics and M&E in a context of upwardly moving aid modalities. Bringing in case-study material from Rwanda, it argues that a narrow technocratic approach to M&E risks worsening political constraints and even undermines M&E’s technical soundness. Yet, there exist ways of escaping this downward spiral. ‘Smart’ M&E that acknowledges the institutional and political embeddedness of M&E has the leverage to <b>stimulate</b> <b>public</b> <b>discussion,</b> to bring more ‘sensitive’ issues into the bargaining area, to shift debates on a more factual basis and to eventually open up closed political opportunity structures. ...|$|R

25|$|Years {{after the}} conference, people {{ascribed}} {{a large amount}} of significance to it. According to Paul Berg and Maxine Singer in 1995, the conference marked the beginning of an exceptional era for both science and the <b>public</b> <b>discussion</b> of science policy. The guidelines devised by the conference enabled scientists to conduct experiments with recombinant DNA technology, which by 1995 dominated biological research. This research, in turn, increased knowledge about fundamental life processes, such as the cell cycle. Additionally, the conference along with public debates on recombinant DNA, increased public interest in biomedical research and molecular genetics. For this reason, by 1995, genetics and its vocabulary had {{become a part of the}} daily press and television news. This, in turn, <b>stimulated</b> knowledgeable <b>public</b> <b>discussion</b> about some of the social, political and environmental issues that emerged from genetic medicine and the use of genetically modified plants in agriculture. Another significant outcome of the conference was the precedent it set about how to respond to changes in scientific knowledge. According to the conference, the proper response to new scientific knowledge was to develop guidelines that governed how to regulate it.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{referendum}} {{to legalize}} voluntary, active euthanasia in Washington state, which was narrowly defeated, has <b>stimulated</b> in-creased <b>public</b> <b>discussion</b> of this troubling ethical issue. In this paper we examine two recent statements against euthanasia, which together pose a seemingly formidable array of considerations against legalizing physi-cian assistance {{of patients who}} request to die owing to terminal illness and unbearable suffering. One way to test a controversial moral position such as the legalization of euthanasia, which departs from the tradition of social morality and from traditional medical ethics, is to weigh the merit of the arguments against it. We offer a critique of these arguments and a different ethical view of the issues. In {{the last part of}} this paper, we recommend guidelines for a public policy framework to minimize abuses in social experiments with beneficent voluntary euthanasia that are approved by referenda or state legislatures. Such a framework was lacking in the Washington initiative and also to an extent in the Nether-lands, where the practice of physician-performed euthanasia has be-come institutionalized but remains technically illegal.

(A media feedbox will be set up at the event venue and journalists are welcome to tape {{all or part of}} the discussion.) Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a non-governmental organization that carries out research and advocacy for public policy in Sri Lanka, and Steven Ratner, Professor of public international law at Michigan University Law School who has advised UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on the Sri Lanka conflict, will be the panelists. Sharry Aiken, Associate Professor of Law at Queen’s University Faculty of Law, will moderate the panel discussion. Osgoode Professor and Nathanson Centre Director François Tanguay-Renaud says this event is timely, as it aims to <b>stimulate</b> <b>public</b> <b>discussion</b> in Canada and internationally ahead of next month’s meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The Council is set to review a report from the Sri Lanka Government on its progress on a motion adopted by the Council last year that called for Sri Lanka “to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans. ” “The international community has a crucial role to play in helping to resolve protracted and bloody civil conflicts such as the one involving Sri Lanka’s ethnic groups,” says Tanguay-Renaud. “Instead of turning a blind eye, it is important for countries such as Canada to seek to support and engage peace, reconciliation, justice, and accountability processes. ” Thursday’s panel discussion at Osgoode will be followed by another public meeting on Friday, February 15 at 1 p. m. hosted by Amnesty International Canada and the Law Society of Upper Canada at 130 Queen St. W., 3 rd floor, the Upper Barristers’ Lounge, Toronto.

40|$|The Australian theatre in {{the late}} nineteenth century was in transition: it was, like the country, seeking its own {{identity}} in a period of social change. The contributions made to its development by men are well documented. Those made by women have received much less recognition. This thesis addresses that hiatus, by examining the life, celebrity, and influence of English actress, Janet Achurch. It focuses on her 1889 – 91 Australian tour and the ambivalent responses to her portrayal of Nora in Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House. Achurch, with her husband, actor Charles Charrington, came to Australia under contract to entrepreneurs Williamson, Garner, and Musgrove. On 14 September, 1889 she opened at the Princess’s Theatre in Melbourne with A Doll’s House, the play now most closely connected with the concept of the New Woman. She closed with the same play at Brisbane’s Theatre Royal on 13 November, 1891. A picture of Achurch’s tour has emerged from newspapers and other periodicals accessed through the National Library of Australia’s digitised database, Trove. After siting the tour within the historical and cultural context of Australia and its theatre, this thesis follows Achurch’s progression, revealed in reviews, opinions, letters to the editor, and advertisements. It then discusses the controversies occasioned by the inclusion of Camille, Hedda Gabler, and Doll’s House in her repertoire, before examining Achurch’s achievements during her two years in the country. Most controversy centred on Doll’s House, which polarised the critics and playgoing public. Responses ranged from deeply supportive to highly condemnatory. Although the sometimes acrimonious debate continued, negative reactions to Doll’s House lessened as the tour progressed. A graph of the responses to Doll’s House and Nora, coded for sympathy, neutrality, or antipathy, demonstrates the early trend towards a less hostile reception. Achurch, through her abilities as a performer, personal popularity, and staging of drama that <b>stimulated</b> <b>public</b> <b>discussion,</b> made three contributions to theatre in Australia that were of particular significance. First, she contributed by building audiences throughout the country, most notably by reinvigorating the industry in Brisbane, and pioneering the inclusion of Perth in the itineraries of first-rank companies. Second, she introduced the emerging realist direction in literature to the Australian stage through the works of Henrik Ibsen. Third, she established the stage as a forum for discussion of issues affecting women {{in the late}} nineteenth century. Achurch represents the many women who, to a smaller or greater degree, influenced the development of theatre in Australia as the nineteenth century drew to a close...|$|R
