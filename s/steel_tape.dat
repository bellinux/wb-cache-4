5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a <b>steel</b> <b>tape,</b> and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{formation}} of biomimetic calcium hydroxyapatite (HAP) on the surface of different substrates. Material and Methods. Silica coated stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tapes</b> and thin polymer films (alginate, cellulose, poly lactide-co-glycolide - PLGA) deposited on hydroxyapatite scaffold were used as substrate. Supersaturated simulated body fluid (SBF) and SBF combined with Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) or Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) were used as bioactive liquid medium where biomimetic nucleation of HAP occurred. Infrared spectroscopy with Fourier transformation was used to analyze the formed phases, while scanning electron microscopy indicated the morphology of nucleated phase. Results. The results of measuring the mass with volume adjustments done by the BET method showed that the thickness of the film of nucleated calcium hydroxyapatite depended on the time that samples spent soaked in SBF-in as well as the type of selected biomimetic medium. Conclusion. Biomimetic calcium hydroxyapatite is possible to produce by self nucleation on different substrates in the presence of simulating body fluid...|$|R
40|$|In {{the view}} of {{developing}} a superconductive RF-cable {{on the basis of}} YBCO coated stainless steel ribbons and tubes a demonstrator was built which contains a 1 m long cable piece with an end plug. For the cable piece two stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tapes</b> of 34 mm x 1000 mm were successfully coated first with Yttrium stabilized Zirconium Oxide and then with YBCO. In the same manner a 1 m long tube with a diameter of 9 mm was treated and together with the tapes built to a coaxial cable piece. In addition a plug was developed which allows to feed in the RF-energy sideways and the liquid Nitrogen axial. In the transition region from the ceramic superconductive YBCO to the metallic normal conductor a specially designed Gold layer was put on to smooth the electric transition. (orig.)
