5000|$|Walter Andrew Shewhart (pronounced like [...] "shoe-heart",March 18, 1891 [...] - [...] March 11, 1967) was an American physicist, {{engineer}} and statistician, sometimes {{known as the}} father of statistical quality control and also related to the <b>Shewhart</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
50|$|This is a {{specific}} example of the on-going Japanese devotion to the Plan-Do-Check-Act PDCA decision-making discipline pioneered by W.

50|$|The {{encounter}} began a long {{collaboration between}} Shewhart and Deming that involved work on productivity during World War II and Deming's championing of Shewhart's ideas in Japan from 1950 onwards. Deming developed some of Shewhart's methodological proposals around scientific inference and named his synthesis the <b>Shewhart</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|PDCA (plan-do-check-act or plan-do-check-adjust) is an {{iterative}} four-step {{management method}} used {{in business for}} the control and continual improvement of processes and products. It {{is also known as}} the Deming circle/cycle/wheel, <b>Shewhart</b> <b>cycle,</b> control circle/cycle, or plan-do-study-act (PDSA). Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA. The added [...] "O" [...] stands for observation or as some versions say [...] "Grasp the current condition." [...] This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency with Lean manufacturing/Toyota Production System literature.|$|E
50|$|His {{emphasis}} on a quantitative, mathematical basis for decision-making remains with us today. It is a foundation of the modern notion of Positivism, modern quantitative statistical analysis, and business decision-making. His description of the continuing cyclical relationship {{between theory and practice}} is seen in modern business systems of Total Quality Management (TQM) and Continuous Quality Improvement where advocates describe a continuous cycle of theory and practice through the four-part cycle of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA, the <b>Shewhart</b> <b>cycle).</b> Despite his advocacy of quantitative analysis, Comte saw a limit in its ability to help explain social phenomena.|$|E

5000|$|A quality {{storyboard}} is {{a method}} for illustrating the quality control process (QC story). Some enterprises have developed a storyboard format for telling the QC story, for example at Yokogawa-Hewlett-Packard in Japan, {{the story is told}} using a flip chart which is 6 feet by 6 feet (2 x 2 meters). The project team uses colored markers to show the PDSA cycle (<b>Shewhart</b> <b>cycle)</b> plus the SDSA cycle (SDSA = Standardize, Do, Study, Act). A QC story is an element of policy deployment. After each manager writes an interpretation of the policy statement, the interpretation is discussed with the next manager above to reconcile differences in understanding and direction. In this way they play [...] "catchball" [...] with the policy and develop a consensus.|$|E
30|$|Whereas the {{learning}} process itself can be characterized for example by the Experiential Learning Model (Kolb, 1976) and <b>Shewhart</b> <b>Cycle</b> for Learning and Improvement – the PDSA Cycle (Deming, 1993), which both suggest that learning is an iterative process.|$|E
30|$|Generally, {{there are}} four stages in techno-economic studies for network {{deployment}} planning: scope, model, evaluate, and refine.

40|$|The PDCA cycle had {{its origin}} with Dr. W. Edwards Deming’s lecture in Japan in 1950. Where {{did he get}} these ideas and how have these ideas evolved since those lectures? This {{presentation}} will move from the 1600 ’s with Galileo and the philosophy of science through {{the evolution of the}} scientific method and the science of improvement. Walter Shewhart in 1939 applied the scientific method with his cycle: specification-production-inspection. W. Edwards Deming in 1950 modified the Shewhart cycle: design of the product, make it, put it on the market, test it through market research, then redesign the product. ” The Japanese interpretation of the “Deming wheel ” in Dr. Deming’s lectures of 1950 and 1951 lead to the plan-do-check-action or PDCA cycle. This cycle was integral to the Japanese QC, TQC, and QC circle activities. Deming introduced his <b>Shewhart</b> <b>cycle</b> for learning and improvement in the USA in 1986. Dr. Deming introduced a more abbreviated PDSA cycle i...|$|E
40|$|Falls and {{injuries}} related to falls {{are some of}} the most common and costly incidents that occur in the long-term care environment. Purposeful hourly rounding is a proactive way for nursing staff to identify patient needs and demonstrate positive fall prevention outcomes. This project examined a process improvement endeavor of a long-term care unit that experienced an increase in the number of falls over 3 months. The purpose was to evaluate whether staff education and implementation of an evidence-based hourly rounding program would affect the number of patient falls. The Johns Hopkins nursing evidence-based conceptual model, Kurt Lewin 2 ̆ 7 s change model, and the <b>Shewhart</b> <b>cycle</b> process improvement model were used to implement the change process as well as the Studer Group best practice hourly rounding tools. A sample of 40 residents was included in a quantitative descriptive design describing the implementation of hourly rounding. Staff were educated 30 days prior to implementation. Pre and post project fall rates were retrieved from the VA fall data management system and revealed a 55...|$|E
40|$|Cliff Norman and Ron Moen, of Associates in Process Improvement (API) {{discuss the}} history of the Plan Do Study Act (PDSA Cycle) and their {{research}} on the subject. Cliff and Ron start with how the underpinning of Deming 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy was the idea of 2 ̆ 2 continuous improvement 2 ̆ 2, with the PDSA Cycle underlying that philosophy. They discuss the PDSA Cycle of never-ending improvement and learning, and how the iterative nature of the cycle fits with The Deming System of Profound Knowledge®. As Ron shares, Dr. Deming believed that 2 ̆ 2 business is more exacting than science 2 ̆ 2 as businesses must continually learn and improve to survive. Next Cliff and Ron delve into why they wrote a paper on the PDSA Cycle. Ron explains that the quality movement in America began after the NBC White Paper, If Japan Can [...] Why Can 2 ̆ 7 t We? aired in 1980. This raised interest in the Japan and the Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycle, which originated there. Although Dr. Deming never spoke of PDCA, it was connected to him in the early 802 ̆ 7 s. That incorrect attribution was the inspiration behind the paper. Cliff and Ron discuss the evolution of the PDSA Cycle, starting hundreds of years ago with the theories of Galileo and Aristotle. Listen as they take you through the progression, from the <b>Shewhart</b> <b>Cycle,</b> through the Deming Wheel and ultimately the PDSA Cycle as we know it today. [URL]...|$|E
