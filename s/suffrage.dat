In 1867, he campaigned unsuccessfully to become a delegate to the New York Constitutional Convention of 1867-1868 on a <b>suffrage</b> platform, and in 1869, was elected unanimously as the first president of the American Woman <b>Suffrage</b> Association.|$|E
5|$|Bryant, who {{retained}} {{her maiden}} name and her downtown apartment after her marriage to Trullinger, bridled at doing housework and yearned for professional advancement. Drawn toward politics and the women's <b>suffrage</b> movement by her friend Sara Bard Field, she joined the Oregon branch of the College Equal <b>Suffrage</b> League in 1912. She and Field gave pro-suffrage speeches in smaller Oregon cities, and Bryant rode on the <b>suffrage</b> float in Portland's annual Flag Day parade. Led by Abigail Scott Duniway, women achieved <b>suffrage</b> in Oregon later that year.|$|E
5|$|During 1913-19, {{advocates of}} woman <b>suffrage</b> {{drew on the}} {{educational}} and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings {{to the task of}} political persuasion. The Dallas Equal <b>Suffrage</b> Association developed a <b>suffrage</b> campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the <b>suffrage</b> cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E

5|$|The AERA {{essentially}} collapsed {{after its}} acrimonious convention in May 1869, and two competing woman <b>suffrage</b> organizations {{were created in}} its aftermath. Two days after the convention, Anthony, Stanton and their allies formed the National Woman <b>Suffrage</b> Association (NWSA). In November 1869, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe and their allies formed the competing American Woman <b>Suffrage</b> Association (AWSA). The AWSA initially was {{the larger of the}} two organizations, but it declined in strength during the 1880s.|$|E

5|$|The Indiana Woman's <b>Suffrage</b> Association {{was founded}} in 1851 by {{important}} <b>suffrage</b> leaders such as Agnes Cook, Mary B. Birdsall, Amanda M. Way, and Mary F. Thomas. With the exception of Way, all these women {{were the first to}} address the Indiana State Legislature on January 19, 1859, with petitions calling for women's <b>suffrage,</b> temperance, and equal rights. In 1854 Birdsall had purchased The Lily, the first U.S. newspaper edited by and for women, from its founder, Amelia Bloomer, and moved it to Richmond, Indiana. The newspaper had begun as a temperance newspaper but was later used to campaign for women's <b>suffrage</b> and rights.|$|E

5|$|The {{drive for}} women's <b>suffrage</b> was reinvigorated in the 1870s, and was {{sponsored}} by the leaders of the prohibition movement, especially the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The Indiana branch of the American Woman <b>Suffrage</b> Association was re-established in 1869. In 1878 May Wright Sewall founded the Indianapolis Equal <b>Suffrage</b> Society, which fought for world peace before the nation plunged into World War I. Several Indiana women also became temperance leaders and took {{an active role in the}} movement. The Indiana chapter of the WCTU was formed in 1874 with Zerelda G. Wallace as its first president. Like many other <b>suffrage</b> leaders, Wallace was radicalized for woman's <b>suffrage</b> through her temperance reform work. During her 1875 speech before the Indiana General Assembly in support of prohibition, legislators demonstrated an open contempt for women involved in politics and speaking in public. Afterward, Wallace credited the experience with her embrace of <b>suffrage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Women's <b>suffrage</b> {{began in}} Britain's Australasian colonies {{at the close}} of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of New Zealand {{granting}} women the right to vote in 1893 and South Australia granting female <b>suffrage</b> (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) in 1895. This was followed by Australia granting female <b>suffrage</b> in 1902.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Suffrages</b> {{are short}} prayers to saints, {{asking them to}} intercede {{on behalf of the}} petitioner. The prayers were often {{accompanied}} by portraits of the saints, with the symbols or their martyrdom, or the attributes of their patronage. The <b>Suffrages</b> were arranged in a particular hierarchy: God, Christ, the Virgin Mary, the angels, Saint John the Baptist, apostles, martyrs, confessors, and women saints. This standard pattern of daily prayer provided the framework for the artists' efforts.|$|R

5|$|After {{beginning}} {{her legal}} career in 1879, she continued her <b>suffrage</b> activism. She {{was elected president}} of the California State <b>Suffrage</b> Association from 18841894, and a paid speaker on behalf of the movement in the 1888 presidential election. In 1892, she spoke at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving as}} {{president}} of the local league for four years, Dudley was elected to head the Tennessee Equal <b>Suffrage</b> Association in 1915. During this time she helped to introduce and lobby for a <b>suffrage</b> amendment to the state constitution. Although the amendment was defeated, a later measure to give women the right to vote in presidential and municipal elections was eventually passed by the state legislature in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Although {{best known}} for their joint {{work on behalf of}} women's <b>suffrage,</b> Stanton and Anthony first joined the temperance movement. Together, they were {{instrumental}} in founding the short-lived Woman's State Temperance Society (1852–1853). During her presidency of the organization, Stanton scandalized many supporters by suggesting that drunkenness be made sufficient cause for divorce. But the relationship between the women's <b>suffrage</b> movement and the temperance movement was hardly accidental. The two movements had common interests, with women's <b>suffrage</b> filling the role of cause and prohibition becoming the effect. Later, in state after state, once women gained the right to vote, they could press for various political measures to reduce drunkenness, perceived to be largely a problem involving the male sex. Thus, the two movements became frequently allied.|$|E

5|$|Anne Dallas Dudley (née Annie Willis Dallas; November 13, 1876 – September 13, 1955) was a {{prominent}} activist in the women's <b>suffrage</b> movement in the United States. After founding the Nashville Equal <b>Suffrage</b> League and serving as its president, she moved {{up through the ranks}} of the movement, serving as President of the Tennessee Equal <b>Suffrage</b> Association and then as Third Vice President of the National American Woman <b>Suffrage</b> Association, where she helped lead efforts to get the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution ratified, giving women the right to vote nationwide. She is especially noted for her successful efforts to get the Nineteenth Amendment ratified in her home state of Tennessee, the final state necessary to bring the amendment into force.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth century, {{prohibition}} and women's <b>suffrage</b> had become the major reform issues in the state. Although supporters and their opponents closely linked the two movements, temperance received a broader hearing than the efforts toward equal <b>suffrage.</b> While many Protestant churches in Indiana supported temperance, few provided a forum for discussions on women's voting rights.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Cady Stanton (November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was an American suffragist, social activist, abolitionist, {{and leading}} {{figure of the}} early women's rights movement. Her Declaration of Sentiments, {{presented}} at the Seneca Falls Convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, is often credited with initiating the first organized women's rights and women's <b>suffrage</b> movements in the United States. Stanton {{was president of the}} National Woman <b>Suffrage</b> Association from 1892 until 1900.|$|E

5|$|In 1911 a <b>suffrage</b> {{group was}} formed after the Indianapolis Franchise Society and the Legislation Council of Indiana Women merged {{to form the}} Women's Franchise League of Indiana (WFL). The WFL {{was a member of}} the {{national}} <b>suffrage</b> organization, the National American Woman <b>Suffrage</b> Association. The league was influential in obtaining the vote for women at the state level and formed 1,205 memberships in thirteen districts. After the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted, the Women's Franchise League of Indiana organized the League of Indiana Women Voters.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, sensing {{they were}} close to {{achieving}} <b>suffrage,</b> Rathbone & Stewart-Bright created Municipal Women's Association as {{a branch of the}} society; its aim was to increase awareness of the vote for women, encourage discussion amongst potential women voters and teaching women what to do when they had the vote. In 1912, the Liverpool Women <b>Suffrage</b> Society disagreed with the route that the National Union Women's <b>Suffrage</b> Societies was taking, with its Election Fighting Fund, and instead merged with the Municipal Women's Association to become the Liverpool Women's Citizen's Association. The outbreak of World War I changed the focus of groups to help with the national emergency and in 1919 the groups merged. By 1921 they had 12 branches.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her writing and speaking, Stanton was also instrumental in promoting women's <b>suffrage</b> in various states, particularly New York, Missouri, Kansas, where it was included {{on the ballot in}} 1867, and Michigan, where it was put to a vote in 1874. She made an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Congressional seat from New York in 1866, and she was the primary force behind the passage of the Woman's Property Bill that was eventually passed by the New York State Legislature. She worked toward female <b>suffrage</b> in Wyoming, Utah, and California, and in 1878, she convinced California Senator Aaron A. Sargent to introduce a female <b>suffrage</b> amendment using wording {{similar to that of the}} Fifteenth Amendment passed some eight years previously.|$|E
