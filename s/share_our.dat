In some cases, she adapted the original recipes in collaboration with the chefs.|$|E

25|$|On Jefferson's {{isolated}} mountaintop, sex {{took place}} {{as part of}} a hierarchy that everyone involved understood. Jefferson, and those of his class, did not <b>share</b> <b>our</b> current understanding of sexual morality. Sally Hemings was his servant, and had little power. She was dependent economically, though this does not mean her feelings were irrelevant. But it does mean that he had extraordinary power, and she very little, and so, as his concubine, she had probably replicated her mother's relationship with Jefferson's father-in-law; for she was, in fact, Jefferson's late wife's half-sister, and I have described the Hemings family as a parallel, subordinate family to the all-white Jeffersons.|$|E

Historian R.

Manson explained that the album title Not Your Kind of People was [...] "a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels like we do about the world", saying that [...] "it can be great to be outsider." [...] She felt that this applied to them as the band [...] "never fit into a music scene" [...] and that [...] "in my life I've never been an insider."
