40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between computer premium and job position in Austria. We estimate cross-section wage equations and control <b>for</b> selectivity of <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> via a treatment effects model. We find that the size of the wage effect attributed to <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> varies significantly between job hierarchies. Persons in higher positions receive relatively lower rewards <b>for</b> <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> than workers at lower hierarchy levels. Overall we find that computerisation increased wage inequality in Austria. However, hierarchy-related differences in the relative computer premium in Austria might moderate the effects of <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> on the wage distribution. ...|$|R
