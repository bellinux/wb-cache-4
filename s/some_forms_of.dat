5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in <b>some</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views of}} {{pornography}} range from condemnation of pornography {{as a form}} of violence against women, to an embracing of <b>some</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> pornography as a medium of feminist expression.

5|$|Numerous feminist {{movements}} and ideologies have {{developed over the}} years and represent different viewpoints and aims. <b>Some</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> feminism have been criticized for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives.

5|$|Vision is {{the main}} sense of {{orientation}} in humans, and the primary function of camouflage is to deceive the human eye. Camouflage works through concealment (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle. In modern warfare, <b>some</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> camouflage, for example face paints, also offer concealment from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide concealment from radar.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. <b>Some</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, far-reaching {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. <b>Some</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage {{was first}} practiced in simple {{form in the}} mid 18th century by jäger- or rifle units. Their tasks {{required}} them to be inconspicuous, and they were issued green and later other drab colour uniforms. With the advent of longer range and more accurate weapons, especially the repeating rifle, camouflage was adopted for the uniforms of all armies, spreading to most forms of military equipment including ships and aircraft. Many modern camouflage textiles address visibility not only to visible light but also near infrared, for concealment from night vision devices. Camouflage is not only visual; heat, sound, magnetism and even smell {{can be used to}} target weapons, and may be intentionally concealed. <b>Some</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> camouflage have elements of scale invariance, designed to disrupt outlines at different distances, typically digital camouflage patterns made of pixels.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to obvious dangers such as rodenticides, insecticides, and herbicides, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians, because their livers are less effective at <b>some</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> detoxification {{than those of}} many other animals, including humans and dogs. Some {{of the most common}} causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits. Cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants.

Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The underlying cause of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored.|$|E
