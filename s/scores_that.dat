5|$|During the Classical and Romantic {{periods of}} music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, {{a great deal}} of musical {{instruments}} capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music. The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Matsueda {{is noted}} for her jazzy style, which she often {{incorporated}} into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was {{responsible for most of}} the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are important factors in composition. When asked why she creates music, Matsueda replied that she feels it is an appropriate way to express herself.|$|E
5|$|The {{interview}} and speech events are {{graded by two}} to three judges. The scores from the judges are averaged to give a maximum of 1,000 points per event. The essay is graded with a rubric and is read by two different judges whose scores are then averaged. If {{the difference between the}} judges' scores differs by 200 points or more, then a third reader is asked to grade the student's essay. The two <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> are closest in value are averaged to give the final score.|$|E
25|$|The {{algorithm}} maintains two values, alpha and beta, {{which represent}} the minimum <b>score</b> <b>that</b> the maximizing player is assured of and the maximum <b>score</b> <b>that</b> the minimizing player is assured of respectively. Initially alpha is negative infinity and beta is positive infinity, i.e. both players start with their worst possible score. It can happen that {{when choosing a}} certain branch of a certain node the maximum <b>score</b> <b>that</b> the minimizing player is assured of becomes less than the minimum <b>score</b> <b>that</b> the maximizing player is assured of (beta <= alpha). If this is the case, the parent node should not choose this node, because it will make the score for the parent node worse. Therefore, the other branches of the node {{do not have to}} be explored.|$|R

50|$|The name of {{the game}} is derived from the Hindi word pachis, meaning twenty-five, the largest <b>score</b> <b>that</b> can be thrown with the cowrie shells. Thus this game is also known by the name Twenty-Five. There are other {{versions}} of this game where the largest <b>score</b> <b>that</b> can be thrown is thirty.|$|R
5|$|By 1507, however, Cairano's {{decorative}} lapidary work in {{the interior}} of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia. The architectural <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> punctuate the sequence of the altar and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a work of this magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that has come down to us.|$|E
5|$|The game offers four {{different}} difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, a Boss level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played {{from the perspective}} of the driver seat of the car. Boss levels confront the player with a boss enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first boss is a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower that can not be damaged by the car's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Manne began to compose his own film scores, {{such as that}} for The Proper Time (1959), with the music also played by his own group, Shelly Manne and His Men, and issued on a Contemporary LP. In later years, Manne divided his time playing the drums on, adding special percussive effects to, and {{sometimes}} writing complete scores for both film and television. He even provided a musical setting for a recording of the Dr. Seuss children's classic Green Eggs and Ham (1960) and later performed in and sometimes wrote music for the backgrounds of numerous animated cartoons. For example, he joined other notable jazz musicians (including Ray Brown and Jimmy Rowles) in playing Doug Goodwin's music for the cartoon series The Ant and the Aardvark (19691971). Notable examples of later <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> Manne wrote himself and also performed in are, for the movies, Young Billy Young (1969) and Trader Horn (1973), and, for television, Daktari, 19661969. With these and other contributions to cartoons, children's stories, movies, television programs (and even commercials), Manne's drumming became woven into the popular culture of several decades.|$|E

Morricone's compositions appeared in the German TV series Derrick (1989), the live-action comedy film Inspector Gadget, Ally McBeal (2001), The Simpsons (2002), The Sopranos (2001–2002) and more recently in Dancing with the Stars (2010).|$|E
25|$|The 1960s {{began on}} a {{positive}} note: 1961 marked in fact his real film debut with Luciano Salce's Il Federale (The Fascist). In an interview with American composer Fred Karlin, Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> were easily created, a genre that I never completely abandoned even when I went on to much more important films with major directors.|$|E
25|$|Personality tests – Tests of {{personality}} aim to describe patterns of behavior, thoughts, and feelings. They generally fall within two categories: objective and projective. Objective measures, {{such as the}} MMPI, are based on restricted answers—such as yes/no, true/false, or a rating scale—which allow for computation of <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> {{can be compared to}} a normative group. Projective tests, such as the Rorschach inkblot test, allow for open-ended answers, often based on ambiguous stimuli, presumably revealing non-conscious psychological dynamics.|$|E

25|$|In late 2008, a new {{variable}} {{came into}} play. Previously, applicants to most colleges {{were required to}} submit all scores, with some colleges that embraced Score Choice retaining the option of allowing their applicants {{not to have to}} submit all scores. However, in 2008, an initiative to make Score Choice universal had begun, with some opposition from colleges desiring to maintain score report practices. While students theoretically now have the choice to submit their best score (in theory one could send any score one wishes to send) to the college of their choice, some colleges and universities, such as Cornell, ask that students send all test scores. This had led the College Board to display on their web site which colleges agree with or dislike Score Choice, with continued claims that students will still never have scores submitted against their will. Regardless of whether a given college permits applicants to exercise Score Choice options, most colleges do not penalize students who report poor scores along with high ones; many universities, such as Columbia and Cornell, expressly promise to overlook those <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> may be undesirable to the student and/or to focus more on those <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> are most representative of the student's achievement and academic potential. College Board maintains a list of colleges and their respective score choice policies that is recent as of November 2011.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} widely used instruments, the Rosenberg {{self-esteem}} scale (RSES) is a 10-item self-esteem scale <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> requires participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements about themselves. An alternative measure, The Coopersmith Inventory uses a 50-question battery over a variety of topics and asks subjects whether they rate someone as similar or dissimilar to themselves. If a subject's answers demonstrate solid self-regard, the scale regards them as well adjusted. If those answers reveal some inner shame, it considers them to be prone to social deviance.|$|E
25|$|In Western music, a {{range of}} {{different}} music notation systems are used. In Western Classical music, conductors use printed <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten chord chart indicating the song's chord progression using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.|$|E

25|$|New credit {{scores have}} been {{developed}} {{in the last decade}} by companies such as Scorelogix, PRBC, L2C, Innovis etc. which do not use bureau data to predict creditworthiness. Scorelogix's JSS Credit Score uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's ability to pay. It is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past ability to pay. New credit <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> focus more on future ability to pay are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative credit score that uses utility payment histories to determine creditworthiness, and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> offer other pictures of risk.|$|E
25|$|Semantic {{networks}} {{were also used}} to devise originality <b>scores</b> <b>that</b> yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures. Most recently, an NSF-funded team of researchers led by James C. Kaufman and Mark A. Runco combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system). This system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable, objective, and scalable, thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported. The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of 0.73 to human graders.|$|E
