Relatively high levels of the chemical were found in popular brands such as Mother's Pride, Jacobs crackers, John West, Kraft Dairylea and McVitie's Krackawheat. The same study also found relatively high levels in a range of supermarket own-brands, including Tesco char-grilled beefburgers, Sainsbury's Hot 'n Spicy Chicken Drumsticks and digestive biscuits from Asda. The highest levels of 3-MCPD found in a non- soy sauce product, crackers, was 134 µg per kg. The highest level of 3-MCPD found in soy sauce was 93,000 µg per kg, 700 times higher.

40|$|Objectives The {{existing}} British National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) <b>safety</b> <b>guideline</b> recommends {{testing the}} pH of nasogastric (NG) tube aspirates. Feeding is considered safe if a pH of 5. 5 or lower has been observed; otherwise chest X-rays are recommended.

The {{aim of this}} research is to use a decision analytic modelling approach to systematically assess the safety of the pH test under cut-offs 1 – 9. Materials and methods We mapped out the care pathway according to the existing <b>safety</b> <b>guideline</b> where the pH test is used as a first-line test, followed by chest x-rays. Decision outcomes were scored on a 0 – 100 scale in terms of safety. Sensitivities and specificities of the pH test at each cut-off were extracted from our previous research.

40|$|A Newton Aim To {{establish}} the national picture of prehospital anaesthesia in the UK and to reference practice against the Association of prior to Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland <b>safety</b> <b>guideline</b> on prehospital anaesthesia. Methods Lead clinicians were identified for all prehospital {{services in the}} UK that could potentially be performing prehospital anaesthesia and invited to complete a detailed online survey. The survey requested details on team structure, the process for prehospital anaesthesia, drugs and equipment used and training and governance arrangements. Results 55 responses were received from 63 invitations sent (87. 3 %) yielding usable data for 47 services. 31 of the 47 services (70 %) responded that they performed prehospital anaesthesia. All services performing prehospital anaesthesia utilised a doctor but only 18 services (58 %) always utilised a trained assistant. 28 services (90 %) maintained a database and over half of services (55 %) performed less than 20 prehospital anaesthetics annually. 23 services (74 %) had a designated lead clinician for prehospital anaesthesia and 25 (81 %) had a written difficult airway plan. 19 services (61 %) had mandatory continual training requirements. Conclusions The majority of services are currently complying with the recommendations in the Association of prior to Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland <b>safety</b> <b>guideline.</b> There are still areas of concern, {{particularly with regard to}} ongoing training and the high numbers of services that do not use a trained assistant for the process of prehospital anaesthesia...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although it {{has been}} {{increasingly}} recognised that patient safety in primary care is important, {{little is known about}} the feasibility and effectiveness of different strategies to improve patient safety in primary care. In this study, we aimed to identify the most important strategies by consulting an international panel of primary care physicians and researchers. METHODS: A web-based survey was undertaken in an international panel of 58 individuals from eight countries with a strong primary care system. The questionnaire consisted of 38 strategies to improve patient safety. We asked the respondents whether these strategies were currently used in their own country, and whether they felt them to be important. RESULTS: Most of the 38 presented strategies were seen as important by a majority of the participants, but the use of strategies in daily practice varied widely. Strategies that yielded the highest scores (> 70 %) regarding importance included a good medical record system (82 % felt this was very important, while 83 % said it was implemented in more than half of the practices), good telephone access (71 % importance, 83 % implementation), standards for record keeping (75 % importance, 62 % implementation), learning culture (74 % importance, 10 % implementation), vocational training on patient safety for GPs (81 % importance, 24 % implementation) and the presence of a patient <b>safety</b> <b>guideline</b> (81 % importance, 15 % implementation).

40|$|Printed Spiral Coil (PSC) is a {{coil antenna}} for {{near-field}} wireless power transmission {{to the next}} generation implant medical devices. PSC for implant medical device should be power efficient and low electromagnetic radiation to human tissues. We utilized a physical model of printed spiral coil and applied our algorithm to design PSC operating at 13. 56 MHz. Numerical and electromagnetic simulation of power transfer efficiency of PSC in air medium is 77. 5 % and 71. 1 %, respectively. The simulation results show that the printed spiral coil which is optimized for air will keep 15. 2 % power transfer efficiency in human subcutaneous tissues.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{existing}} British National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) <b>safety</b> <b>guideline</b> recommends {{testing the}} pH of nasogastric (NG) tube aspirates. Feeding is considered safe if a pH of 5. 5 or lower has been observed; otherwise chest X-rays are recommended. Our previous research found that at 5. 5, the pH test lacks sensitivity towards oesophageal placements, a major risk identified by feeding experts. The {{aim of this}} research is to use a decision analytic modelling approach to systematically assess the safety of the pH test under cut-offs 1 - 9. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We mapped out the care pathway according to the existing <b>safety</b> <b>guideline</b> where the pH test is used as a first-line test, followed by chest x-rays. Decision outcomes were scored on a 0 - 100 scale in terms of safety. Sensitivities and specificities of the pH test at each cut-off were extracted from our previous research. Aggregating outcome scores and probabilities resulted in weighted scores which enabled an analysis of the relative safety of the checking procedure under various pH cut-offs. RESULTS: The pH test was the safest under cut-off 5 when there was ≥ 30 % of NG tube misplacements. Under cut-off 5, respiratory feeding was excluded; oesophageal feeding was kept to a minimum to balance the need of chest X-rays for patients with a pH higher than 5. Routine chest X-rays were less safe than the pH test while to feed all without safety checks was the most risky. DISCUSSION: The safety of the current checking procedure is sensitive to the choice of pH cut-offs, the impact of feeding delays, the accuracy of the pH in the oesophagus, as well as the extent of tube misplacements. CONCLUSIONS: The pH test with 5 as the cut-off was the safest overall. It is important to understand the local clinical environment so that appropriate choice of pH cut-offs can be made to maximise safety and to minimise the use of chest X-rays.
