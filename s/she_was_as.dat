5|$|The 1894-S Barber dime {{is one of}} {{the great}} numismatic rarities, with a {{published}} mintage of 24 proof pieces. Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist, the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of worn-out coins, just enough to coin 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> old as he was, and she would be able to sell them for a good price. According to the story, she spent one on a dish of ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.|$|E

West {{did not believe that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> badly injured as her neighbor had been and insisted he be treated first. Officers who responded to the scene incorrectly reported that she did not seem harmed at the time. West herself was under the same impression, however she suffered severe internal injuries and proved to have suffered both a ruptured spleen and a lacerated liver. Her spleen was removed that Friday and, the following Monday, she underwent two more surgeries to stop her liver from bleeding; these ultimately failed in that effort. Doctors said that West knew the extent of her injuries and even visited with Kenny Rogers shortly before her last operation. On September 4, 1991, during her third operation, West died on the operating table at 9:43a.m., at the age of 58.|$|E

500|$|Hepburn's final {{appearance}} in a theatrically released film, {{and her first}} since Grace Quigley ten years earlier, was Love Affair (1994). At 87 years old, she played a supporting role alongside Annette Bening and Warren Beatty.

Roger Ebert noted {{that it was the}} first time she had looked frail, but that the [...] "magnificent spirit" [...] was still there and said her scenes [...] "steal the show".
