5000|$|The minimum {{output voltage}} of the Wilson current mirror must exceed the base emitter voltage of Q2 by enough that Q3 will operate in active mode rather than saturation. Gilbert reports {{data on a}} {{representative}} implementation of a Wilson current mirror that showed constant output current for an output voltage as low as 880 millivolts. Since the circuit was biased for high frequency operation (...) , this represents a <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage</b> for Q3 of 0.1 to 0.2 volts. By contrast, the standard two-transistor mirror operates down to the <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage</b> of its output transistor.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} complication is that liquids also {{exhibit a}} saturation phenomenon: after certain voltage, the <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage,</b> the further increase of voltage {{will not change}} the contact angle, and with extreme voltages the interface will only show instabilities.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Saturation</b> — output <b>voltage</b> {{is limited}} to a peak value, usually {{slightly}} less than the power supply <b>voltage.</b> <b>Saturation</b> occurs when the differential input voltage is too high for the op-amp's gain, driving the output level to that peak value.|$|R
50|$|Low-dropout (LDO) {{regulators}} work in {{the same}} way as all linear voltage regulators. The main difference between LDO and non-LDO regulators is their schematic topology. Instead of an emitter follower topology, low-dropout regulators use open collector or open drain topology. In this topology, the transistor may be easily driven into saturation with the voltages available to the regulator. This allows the voltage drop from the unregulated voltage to the regulated voltage to be as low as the <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage</b> across the transistor.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{blocking}} state nearly the complete voltage drops at the SITh. Thus the MOSFET is {{not exposed to}} high field stress. For fast switching the MOSFET with only 30-50 V blocking voltage is able. In IGBT, charge carrier concentration at emitter side in n-base layer is low as holes injected from collector easily pass to emitter electrode through p-base layer. Thus the wide-base pnp transistor operates {{by virtue of its}} current gain characteristics causing the rise collector-emitter <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
50|$|In an MCS the {{positive}} {{difference between the}} voltage of regulation element and conduction voltage drop of MOSFET is applied to location between the collector region and emitter region of the pnp transistor. Hole concentration is accumulated at emitter side in n-base layer because of impossibility of the hole flow through forward bias collector-base junction of the pnp transistor. Carrier distribution in n-base {{is similar to that}} of saturation bipolar transistor and low <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage</b> of MCS, even at high voltage ratings, can be achieved.|$|E

5000|$|Some audiophiles {{believe that}} the {{clipping}} behavior of vacuum tubes {{with little or no}} negative feedback is superior to that of transistors, in that vacuum tubes clip more gradually than transistors (i.e. soft clipping, and mostly even harmonics), resulting in harmonic distortion that is generally less objectionable. In general though, the distortion associated with clipping is unwanted, and is visible on an oscilloscope even if it is inaudible. Even in a transistorised amplifier with hard clipping, the gain of the transistor will be reducing (leading to nonlinear distortion) as the output current increases and the voltage across the transistor reduces close to the <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage</b> (for bipolar transistors), and so [...] "full power" [...] for the purposes of measuring distortion in amplifiers is usually taken as a few percent below clipping.|$|E
5000|$|The {{input current}} which drives the {{transistor}}'s base sees two paths, one path {{into the base}} and the other path through the Schottky diode and into the collector. When the transistor conducts, there will be about 0.6 V across its base-emitter junction. Typically, the collector voltage will be higher than the base voltage, and Schottky diode will be reverse biased. If the input current is increased, then the collector voltage falls below the base voltage, and the Shottky diode starts to conduct and shunt some of the base drive current into the collector. The transistor is designed so that its collector <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage</b> (...) {{is less than the}} base-emitter voltage [...] (roughly 0.6 V) minus the Shottky diode's forward voltage drop (roughly 0.2 V). Consequently, the excess input current is shunted away from the base and the transistor never goes into saturation.|$|E
5000|$|Direct-coupled {{transistor}} logic (DCTL) {{is similar}} to resistor-transistor logic (RTL) but the input transistor bases are connected directly to the collector outputs without any base resistors. Consequently, DCTL gates have fewer components, are more economical, and are simpler to fabricate onto integrated circuits than RTL gates. Unfortunately, DCTL has much smaller signal levels, has more susceptibility to ground noise, and requires matched transistor characteristics. The transistors are also heavily overdriven; {{that is a good}} feature in that it reduces the <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage</b> of the output transistors, but it also slows the circuit down due to a high stored charge in the base. [...] Gate fan-out is limited due to [...] "current hogging": if the transistor base-emitter voltages (...) are not well matched, then the base-emitter junction of one transistor may conduct most of the input drive current at such a low base-emitter voltage that other input transistors fail to turn on.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model for the dc current of organic thin film transistors is proposed.

Different <b>saturation</b> <b>voltages</b> for different charge states tend to confirm this explanation, suggesting new experiments, as, for example, the substitution of the first stage by an electron gun...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{drawback}} of the Darlington pair is its increased [...] "saturation" [...] voltage. The {{output transistor}} {{is not allowed}} to saturate (i.e. its base-collector junction must remain reverse-biased) because the first transistor, when saturated, establishes full (100%) parallel negative feedback between the collector and the base of the second transistor. Since collector-emitter voltage is equal to the sum of its own base-emitter voltage and the collector-emitter voltage of the first transistor, both positive quantities in normal operation, it always exceeds the base-emitter voltage. (In symbols, [...] always.) Thus the [...] "saturation" [...] voltage of a Darlington transistor is one VBE (about 0.65 V in silicon) higher than a single transistor <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage,</b> which is typically 0.1 - 0.2 V in silicon. For equal collector currents, this drawback translates to an increase in the dissipated power for the Darlington transistor over a single transistor. The increased low output level can cause troubles when TTL logic circuits are driven.|$|E
5000|$|The {{peak-to-peak}} of a solid-state transformerless amplifier (most {{integrated circuit}} and discrete solid state circuits) {{is limited to}} the power supply voltage less a small amount that depends on the design of the circuit (especially the driver configuration) and the <b>saturation</b> <b>voltage</b> (Vce(sat) for bipolar transistors, or Rds(on) for Field Effect Transistors), and further reduced if the output stage does not have a quiescent DC output voltage set to half the supply voltage. For example, with a typical operational amplifier the Absolute Maximum Rating for the supply voltage is 36 volts, but a safe operating design supply voltage is 30 volts; if this was supplied as a perfectly balanced +15V and -15V then the theoretical peak output for an ideal rail-to-rail output opamp would be 15 Volts peak (10.6V RMS, 30V peak-to-peak), but a real-world opamp such as the 741 is likely to only be able to drive about 10 volts peak into loads above 2 kilohms, i.e. about 7.1V RMS).|$|E
