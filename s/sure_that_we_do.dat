500|$|In late 2006, St. John and Howarth {{simultaneously}} began {{contract negotiations}} with their respective shows, which caused rumors that St. John was departing from OLTL, leaving room for Howarth, {{who was with}} the soap opera As the World Turns at the time, to return as Todd. TV Guide sought to clear up the matter and questioned executive producer Frank Valentini, who stated that although {{he was not able}} to comment on contracts, the producers were [...] "doing our best to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> right by the audience". [...] In 2007, TV Guide received official confirmation Howarth would not be returning to the series. [...] The magazine conducted a poll on its website, TV Guide.com, and found that 82 percent of the show's viewers wanted to see Howarth return. [...] Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide.com disagreed with the results, stating, [...] "Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I absolutely adore Trevor St. John", whose portrayal of Todd he found [...] "very cocky, arrogant and humorous in a sexy way".|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> To be correct, I {{started the}} thing without {{thinking}} of anything. Anyway, you believed as firmly {{as the rest}} of us in Sewell and that the men here and at Westerhouse could make a stand that would result in their getting what they wanted." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2016 a 2006 {{audio tape}} emerged that {{contains}} an interview by Eli Chomsky of the Jewish Press with Hillary Clinton. Clinton opined that pushing for elections [...] "in the Palestinian territories ... {{was a big}} mistake", adding [...] "(a)nd {{if we were going}} to push for an election, then we should have made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> something to determine who was going to win." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{news and}} a {{proposition}} for you," [...] Kendricks replied. [...] "I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> ourselves much good by being seen about Paris together just now. I am not sure, even, {{whether it is}} safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{explained}} {{to you the}} measures which I have taken {{in order to make}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>DO</b> lay hands on the Scarlet Pimpernel.

6000|$|... 'Of {{course you}} will do no such thing. I {{have never had a}} butler in the house before who suited me so well. It is a great credit to the man to have such a daughter, and I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not derive some lustre of a humble kind from his {{presence}} in the house. But, seriously, I wonder at your short-sightedness, when you know the troubles we have had through getting new men from nobody knows where.' ...|$|E

I will not allow you to come into my room, if I have to kill myself to prevent it. No, you must not kiss me either; I daresay that I have begun to be infectious. Good-bye, father, till we meet again somewhere else, for I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not altogether die. Oh! now that I know everything, I should have been glad enough to leave this life--if only I had never--met Ernest," [...] and turning, Jane, my daughter, crept away, gliding up the broad oak stairs {{back to the room}} which she was never to quit alive.|$|E
60|$|With these {{extraordinary}} encouragements to population, {{and every}} cause of depopulation, {{as we have}} supposed, removed, the numbers would necessarily increase faster than in any society that has ever yet been known. I have mentioned, on the authority of a pamphlet published by a Dr Styles and referred to by Dr Price, that {{the inhabitants of the}} back settlements of America doubled their numbers in fifteen years. England is certainly a more healthy country than the back settlements of America, and as we have supposed every house in the island to be airy and wholesome, and the encouragements to have a family greater even than with the back settlers, no probable reason can be assigned why the population should not double itself in less, if possible, than fifteen years. But to be quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not go beyond the truth, we will only suppose the period of doubling to be twenty-five years, a ratio of increase which is well known to have taken place throughout all the Northern States of America.|$|E
5000|$|The {{extent of}} al-Qaeda's {{involvement}} {{is not yet}} known. Concerns have been voiced about what role MI6 played in collaborating with the Libyan Islamic Movement. The White House Deputy National Security Adviser John Brennan said [...] "I'm concerned {{about what is going}} on inside of Libya because there's been a fair amount of disorder and upheaval in the country", [...] "The weapons stock piles - whether we're talking about missile systems or we're talking about automatic weapons - these are things that we and our European allies are working very closely with the TNC National Council and Libyan authorities to get some control over. It's a big country, there were a lot of weapons depots that were scattered throughout the country and we're working again with the TNC and Europeans as well as the regional states. ... (we are) very concerned about making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> everything possible to prevent al-Qaeda from acquiring these weapons and threatening them.".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not lay hands on him before that given hour, {{that he will}} be on the ramparts at the Angelus to-morrow," [...] said Chauvelin emphatically.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is annoying, indeed," [...] Gervaise agreed; and {{a murmur}} of {{disappointment}} ran round the assembled knights. [...] "However, {{we have the}} consolation <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have <b>done</b> all <b>we</b> could, and I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>do</b> so in the future." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An American?" [...] Dr. Swinburne replied. [...] "I am glad, indeed, {{they brought}} you here. You may be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will <b>do</b> {{everything}} <b>we</b> {{can to make}} you comfortable. I will attend to you directly I have seen the others brought in." ...|$|R
5000|$|Few dialogues {{written for}} and uttered by Pawan Kalyan's {{character}} in the film. Dialogues like [...] "Naku konchem thikka undi, kani daniko lekka undi" [...] (I am crazy, but my craziness has a calculation) epitomises {{the nature of the}} characterisation of cop roles in Telugu cinema. Director Harish Shankar defended by quoting, [...] "Fans like to see their favourite stars doing incredible things. I just tried to tweak Pawan's character for a better audience connect. The last dialogue of Pawan in the film [...] "Police ane vaadu...Janam lo bhayam pogottevaadu avvali, kaani jananni bhayapette vaadu kaadu" [...] (Police are there to prevent fear among people, but people should not be feared of us) sums up our film. I respect police officers and have made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not offend them in anyway". The lyrics of the song [...] "Kevvu Keka" [...] draw heavily from folk literature (Jana Padams), this art form was developed by uneducated farmers who wrote those songs to entertain themselves while working in the fields.|$|E

50|$|A {{specific}} {{sequence of}} tasks and start times (genes) represents one genome in our population. To {{make sure that}} our genome is a feasible solution we must take care that it obeys our precedence constraints. We generate an initial population using random start times within the precedence constraints. With genetic algorithms we then take this initial population and cross it, combining genomes along {{with a small amount of}} randomness (mutation). The offspring of this combination is selected based on a fitness function that includes one or many of our constraints, such as minimizing time and minimizing defects. We let this process continue either for a pre-allotted time or until we find a solution that fits our minimum criteria. Overall each successive generation will have a greater average fitness, i.e. taking less time with higher quality than the preceding generations. In scheduling problems, as with other genetic algorithm solutions, we must make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not select offspring that are infeasible, such as offspring that violate our precedence constraint. We of course may have to add further fitness values such as minimizing costs; however, each constraint that we add greatly increases the search space and lowers the number of solutions that are good matches.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{just the}} usual thing," [...] was the cheerful answer. [...] "We hear you {{are off to}} America on a buying tour.

5000|$|... "Shell Shock (Part II)" [...] {{is written}} by Gina Monreal and {{directed}} by Tom Wright. Alexandra Holden is introduced as Brooke Fenten, the main suspect Randall J. Kersey's girlfriend. On September 22, 2012, showrunner Gary Glasberg announced the [...] "theme" [...] for the season being [...] "fallen heroes". The two-part episode [...] "Shell Shock" [...] {{is an example of}} this, with Marine Captain Joe Westcott suffering from PTSD after his squad was ambushed back in Iraq. [...] "We've been talking to the Navy and the Marines about doing a PTSD story for a long time", Glasberg said. [...] "It's a delicate subject matter, and a really important subject matter. We wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it properly and handled it properly. So there was a tremendous amount of research that went into this story, and I'm really proud of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] she continued, [...] "the {{times have}} changed since I joined the Society. In Hungary you know how things were. The Socialists were {{carrying}} all before them, a united solid body. The aristocracy were forced to enter {{into some sort of}} combination against them. We saved Austria, I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not save Russia. But England is different. The aristocracy here are a strong resident class. They have their House of Lords, they own the land, and will own it for many years to come, their position is unassailable. It is the worst country in Europe for us to work in. The very climate and the dispositions of the people are inimical to intrigue. It is Muriel Carey who brought the Society here. It was a mistake. The country is in no need of it. There is no scope for it." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{statement}} from the World Bank's directors read that the board had [...] "deep appreciation" [...] for Kim and that all the candidates [...] "enriched {{the discussion of the}} role of the president and of the World Bank Group's future direction. The final nominees received support from different member countries, which reflected the high caliber of the candidates." [...] Kim, who was in Peru at the time, said that as president he would [...] "seek a new alignment of the World Bank Group with a rapidly changing world. It was here in the shantytowns of Lima that I learned how injustice and indignity may conspire to destroy the lives and hopes of the poor. It was here that I saw how communities struggle to prosper because of a lack of infrastructure and basic services...And it was here that I learned that we can triumph over adversity by empowering the poor and focusing on results." [...] Okonjo-Iweala's reaction to the result included criticising the [...] "long-standing and unfair tradition. It is clear to me that we need to make it more open, transparent and merit-based. We need to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not contribute to a democratic deficit in global governance." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Kings {{promoted}} it as a {{legal basis}} of the purported authority that they had long exercised over the local Church. They also used it to extend their pretensions that, by virtue of an old Papal privilege, they possessed ecclesiastical authority in spiritual matters independent of the Pope. Despite doubts expressed concerning {{the authenticity of the}} document, Ferdinand declared on 22 January 1515: [...] "As for the Kingdom of Sicily, where we exercise the supervision of spiritual as well as of secular affairs, we have made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> so legitimately". In consequence of such an exorbitant claim, disputes arose between the Popes and the Sicilian monarchs. Pope Clement VII negotiated with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor concerning the [...] "monarchia Sicula" [...] ("Sicilian monarchy"), but without success. In 1578 Philip II of Spain tried vainly to obtain a formal confirmation of the right from Pope Pius V. In 1597 the King appointed a special permanent judge ("Judex Monarchiae Siculae") to give final decisions in the highest ecclesiastical causes, an appeal from his judgment to that of the Pope being forbidden. The Judex Monarchiae Siculae claimed the general right to visit convents, supreme jurisdiction over the Sicilian Bishops and the Clergy, and the exercise of a number of episcopal rights, such that Papal authority was almost wholly excluded.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the fourth}} day, Robert Croft and Darren Thomas held Warwickshire briefly at bay with a {{partnership}} of 75, but this wasn't enough as Glamorgan succumbed for 323. Warwickshire captain, Nick Knight, said, [...] "Once they were bowled out for 198 on that pitch {{they were always}} going to struggle. They then put down three catches, which proved to be decisive. We {{had a bit of}} luck so {{we are not going to}} start going around saying <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are going to win the Championship just because we have won one match." [...] John Derrick, Glamorgan's coach, said, [...] "Although we batted much better second time around, we made it difficult for ourselves by not scoring enough first innings runs. Warwickshire showed what playing pressure cricket is all about. They bowled with a lot of discipline. They piled up a big score to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not get back into the game." ...|$|R

I should say the family were all away and the house left in charge of servants. The woman may have been a housekeeper, and the girls her children; besides, even had it been otherwise, it was merely by chance that I helped them out. It was John who tied the ladders together and who carried the girls down, one by one. If I had been alone I should only have had time to save the youngest, for I am not accustomed to running up and down ladders, as he is, and by the time I had got her down it would have been too late to have saved the others. Indeed, I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> save them; they were all insensible, and, for aught I know, may not have recovered from the effects of the smoke. My eyes are smarting even now." ...|$|R
40|$|To {{gauge the}} {{accuracy}} of a measuring instrument, engineers analyze possible factors contributing to the instrument 2 ̆ 7 s inaccuracy.

To properly gauge the instrument 2 ̆ 7 s accuracy [...] and thus, to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not compromise our safety by underestimating the inaccuracy [...] we need to also take these 2 ̆ 2 unknown unknowns 2 ̆ 2 into account.

40|$|Picture book {{makers have}} always used frames {{to help their}} readers see. Frames around {{illustrations}} have traditionally selected and isolated images, separated them from white space, and confined flights of fancy to inside the covers of the book. Words have framed mindsets and directed thinking, so that images might be positioned in particular ways in a reader's imagination. Accommodating frames is so naturally a part of reading that we hardly notice ourselves doing it at all. However, a number of picture book makers have begun to use frames explicitly and obtrusively in their work to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> notice. What {{is the effect of}} this jarring the way we make meaning? This chapter considers the framing devices employed in two contemporary picture books: Emily Gravett's Little Mouse's Book of Fears and Weisner's Flotsam. Further, It describes how these books were read by two competent 10 year old readers, and asks how well prepared they were for the challenges that postmodern texts such as these afford...|$|E
