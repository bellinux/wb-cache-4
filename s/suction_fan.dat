50|$|The Swiss firm Zoelly built a turbine {{locomotive}} in 1919. It was a 4-6-0 locomotive {{fitted with}} a condenser. It was {{fitted with a}} cold-air blower feeding into the firebox grate rather than a <b>suction</b> <b>fan</b> in the smokebox. This avoided the complexity of building a fan that could withstand hot, corrosive gases, but introduced a new problem. The firebox was at positive pressure, and hot gases and cinders could be blown out the firebox doors if they were opened while the blower was operating. This potentially dangerous arrangement was eventually replaced with a smokebox fan.|$|E

The clean-air principle is similar to the flow of air through a cylinder/canister cleaner. Rather than the dirt passing directly through the <b>suction</b> <b>fan</b> and being blown into the bag, it passes through the bag first, leaving only clean air to pass through the fan. This principle was soon adopted by many manufacturers, and continues to be used today. Also, the machine was constructed out of hard plastic.

This system would disable half of the cylinders in the engine during caution periods in order to increase fuel economy when speed was not important. Although the system was tested during the season, its failure at the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans led the team to remove it from the cars until it could be further evaluated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a gas-sensitive system ("mobile nose") that is suitable for use on a mobile robot. The stereo architecture comprises of two equivalent sets of gas sensors mounted inside separated ventilated tubes (or "nostrils"). To characterise the dynamic response, the whole system is modelled as a first-order sensor. The corresponding parameters, including the response and recovery time, can be obtained by fitting this model to the values recorded during a simple experiment described in this paper. Our experiments confirmed the suitability of the applied model and permitted a quantitative comparison of different set-ups. It is shown that using <b>suction</b> <b>fans</b> lowers the recovery time of the metal oxide gas sensors by a factor of two, while a solid separation between the tubes ("septum") is necessary to maintain the sensitivity of the mobile nose to concentration gradients...|$|R

50|$|In early tape drives, non-continuous data {{transfer}} was normal and unavoidable. Computer processing power and amounts of available memory were usually insufficient {{to provide a}} constant stream, so tape drives were typically designed for so called start-stop operation. Early drives used very large spools, which necessarily had high inertia and did not start and stop moving easily. To provide high start, stop, and seeking performance, several feet of loose tape was played out and pulled by a <b>suction</b> <b>fan</b> down into two deep open channels {{on either side of}} the tape head and capstans. The long thin loops of tape hanging in these vacuum columns had far less inertia than the two reels and could be rapidly started, stopped and repositioned. The large reels would occasionally move to take up written tape and play out more blank tape into the vacuum columns.|$|E

The Vorwerk unit was also powered by a higher capacity lithium-ion battery, long used in laptop computers, compared to the cheaper nickel-metal hydride battery (NiMh) battery used in Neato models. Differences in details of the charging process for these different types of batteries, {{as well as the}} additional side brush motor, requires different firmware programs for each model's computer.

5000|$|The normal McLaren F1 {{features}} no {{wings to}} produce downforce (compare the LM and GTR editions); however, the overall {{design of the}} underbody of the McLaren F1 {{in addition to a}} rear diffuser exploits ground effect to improve downforce which is increased through the use of two electric Kevlar fans to further decrease the pressure under the car.

The traps tested were the Mosquito Magnet™(MM) -Pro, MM-Liberty, MM-Liberty Plus, MM-Defender, SkeeterVac®(SV) - 35, SV- 27, Mosquito Deleto™(MD) - 2200, MD- 2500, MT 150 -Power Trap, and two models of The Guardian Mosquito Traps (MK- 01 and MK- 12). All trap models except the SV- 35, the SV- 27, the MD- 2500, and the MK- 12 attracted significantly more females than males. The SV- 35 was the most efficient trap, catching significantly more females {{than all the other}} models. The MD- 2200 and MK- 12 models were the least effective in catching either female or male sand flies. These data indicate that several models of propane combustion traps might be suitable substitutes for either CO 2 -baited or unbaited light traps for adult sand fly surveillance tools. One advantageous feature is the traps’ ability to remain operational 24 / 7 for ca. 20 days on a single tank of propane. Additionally, the models that produce their own electricity to power the trap’s fans have an important logistical advantage in field operations over light traps, which require daily battery exchange and charging...|$|R

He was soon contracted to install his dome in the famous opera house, La Scala of Milan. However, for this project he was required to make some adaptations for the dome to be used at its maximum potential.

40|$|Animal {{welfare is}} a matter of {{increasing}} interest due to ethical and economical worries regarding animal rights and the sustainability of meat production. Ammonia, carbon dioxide, and methane can be produced in the livestock buildings and, if not adequately controlled by ventilation, can be dangerous for animals and farmers. The aim of the present paper is to study the effects of different ventilation systems in rabbit buildings based on the temporal patterns and the spatial distribution of these noxious gases. The experimental measurements were conducted in two rabbit farms with genetically homogeneous animals subjected to the same diet. Two buildings with different forced ventilation layouts (cross ventilation - building A and longitudinal ventilation - building B) were subjected to the monitoring of indoor environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity, ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane) over a whole year. In both the buildings, ventilation was adjusted automatically by means of electronic control units, which were controlled by temperature sensors, located at the centre of the buildings. Gas concentrations inside the buildings followed clearly defined sinusoidal patterns on a daily basis with the highest values reached in winter during the morning hours for ammonia and during the night hours for carbon dioxide and methane. In particular, ammonia revealed a maximum concentration of 30. 7 mg m – 3 in building A (cross ventilation) and 12. 9 mg m – 3 in building B (longitudinal ventilation), whereas the minimum values were 6. 0 and 4. 2 mg m – 3, in building A and B, respectively. As a consequence, daily mean concentrations of noxious gases, solely could not be considered representative of the actual conditions of air quality in the buildings. The airflow direction clearly influenced the spatial concentration of ammonia, which showed different patterns in the two buildings. In building A, the highest ammonia concentration was in a diffuse central area, whereas in building B, it was determined to be less extended and located in the proximity of the wall equipped with extraction fans. The results of this study provide important indications for the planning and management of housing systems for rabbits including: the correct positioning of gas sensors for regulating ventilation systems must be central in case of cross ventilation, but close to the <b>suction</b> <b>fans</b> in case of longitudinal ventilation; the cross ventilation can lead to ammonia concentration higher than longitudinal ventilation, which is caused by the close and prolonged contact of airflow with manure surface in the channels; fans for longitudinal ventilation must be positioned in {{the same side of the}} building where scrapers discharge manure; furthermore, manure scraping has to be performed daily in winter during the hours of the day when ventilation rate is at its maximum...|$|R

50|$|Natural {{convection}} is a mechanism, or type of heat transport, {{in which}} the fluid motion is not generated by any external source (like a pump, <b>fan,</b> <b>suction</b> device, etc.) but only by density differences in the fluid occurring due to temperature gradients. In natural convection, fluid surrounding a heat source receives heat, becomes less dense and rises. The surrounding, cooler fluid then moves to replace it. This cooler fluid is then heated and the process continues, forming a convection current; this process transfers heat energy {{from the bottom of}} the convection cell to top. The driving force for natural convection is buoyancy, a result of differences in fluid density. Because of this, the presence of a proper acceleration such as arises from resistance to gravity, or an equivalent force (arising from acceleration, centrifugal force or Coriolis effect), is essential for natural convection. For example, natural convection essentially does not operate in free-fall (inertial) environments, such as that of the orbiting International Space Station, where other heat transfer mechanisms are required to prevent electronic components from overheating.|$|R

To save energy and reduce the drying time, the distribution of temperature between layers should be fast and uniform with minimum difference; otherwise the difference of MC gradient between layers will be high and will induce grain breakage. The difference of final MC between layers in the two methods was 48 - 73 %.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of the subject test were to identify and quantify the mechanisms by which fan broadband noise is produced, and to assess the validity of such theoretical models of those mechanisms as may be available. The test was conducted with the Boeing 18 -inch fan rig in the Boeing Low-Speed Aeroacoustic Facility (LSAF). The rig {{was designed to be}} particularly clean and geometrically simple to facilitate theoretical modeling and to minimize sources of interfering noise. The inlet is cylindrical and is equipped with a boundary layer <b>suction</b> system. The <b>fan</b> is typical of modern high-by-pass ratio designs but is capable of operating with or without fan exit guide vanes (stators), and there is only a single flow stream. Fan loading and tip clearance are adjustable. Instrumentation included measurements of fan performance, the unsteady flow field incident on the fan and stators, and far-field and in-duct acoustic fields. The acoustic results were manipulated to estimate the noise generated by different sources. Significant fan broadband noise was found to come from the rotor self-noise as measured with clean inflow and no boundary layer. The rotor tip clearance affected rotor self-noise somewhat. The interaction of the rotor with inlet boundary layer turbulence is also a significant source, and is strongly affected by rotor tip clearance. High level noise can be generated by a high-order nonuniform rotating {{at a fraction of the}} fan speed, at least when tip clearance and loading are both large.
