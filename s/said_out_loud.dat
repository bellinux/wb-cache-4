2500|$|Conservative and Reform congregations {{sometimes}} abbreviate {{the public}} recitation of the Amidah by saying it once, {{with the first}} three blessings <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> and the remainder silently. This abridged style, {{commonly referred to as}} (...) [...] "heikhe kedusha," [...] is also performed within Orthodox Judaism in certain circumstances; in some communities it is customary for mincha to be recited in this way. It is usually used to lead into the Silent Prayer.|$|E
6000|$|All this passed {{within the}} bishop's bosom while Mrs. Proudie still {{sat with her}} fixed pencil, and the figures of her sum still {{enduring}} on the tablets of her memory. [...] "Â£4 17s. 7d." [...] she said to herself. [...] "Of course Mr. Quiverful must have the hospital," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> to her lord.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a great}} {{exertion}} for Newman Noggs, {{and nobody}} knows to this day how he ever came to make it, the other party being wholly unknown to him, but he drew a long breath and actually <b>said,</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> without once stopping, that if the young gentleman did not object to tell, he should {{like to know what}} his uncle was going to do for him.|$|E
60|$|As {{this was}} <b>said</b> quite <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> {{before all the}} other ladies, Dorothy was {{overcome}} with shame. But her aunt comforted her when they were again at home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray {{be civil}} to the archdeacon, Mr. Slope," [...] <b>said</b> he <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> [...] "but make him quite {{understand}} that in this matter Mr. Harding has {{put it out of}} my power to oblige him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's from Mary," [...] <b>said</b> Beatrice, <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> {{taking the}} letter up and {{examining}} the address. And having said so, she repented {{what she had}} done, as she looked first at her father and then at her mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you'll {{take a bite}} of {{something}} before you start, ma'am," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud.</b> But, no; it was only now twelve o'clock, {{and she would be}} at Bowes Lodge a very little after one. She had still sufficient confidence in Lord Stapledean to feel sure of her lunch. When people reached Hurst Staple Vicarage about that hour, there was always something for them to eat. And so she started.|$|E
6000|$|... "I half {{believe that}} fellow is not honest," [...] {{he had once}} <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> before Frank, and this set Frank a-thinking of what {{dishonesty}} in the matter it was probable that Mr Moffat might be guilty, {{and what would be}} the fitting punishment for such a crime. Nor did he think on the subject in vain; especially after a conference on the matter which he had with his friend Harry Baker. This conference took place during the Christmas vacation.|$|E
6000|$|At last {{we were in}} the Castle Conor stable yard;--for we had {{approached}} the house by some back way; and as we entered the house by a door leading through a wilderness of back passages, Mr. O'Conor <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> [...] "Now, boys, remember I sit down to dinner in twenty minutes." [...] And then turning expressly to me, he laid his hand kindly upon my shoulder and said, [...] "I hope you will make yourself quite at home at Castle Conor, and whatever you do, don't keep us waiting for dinner. You can dress in twenty minutes, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{maybe he}} will," [...] <b>said</b> Jimmy right <b>out</b> <b>loud.</b> And with that, he started {{back up the}} Crooked Little Path, and strange to say Jimmy hurried.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] <b>said</b> Peter right <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> [...] "that I'll {{change my}} mind. I won't {{go back to}} the dear Old Briar-patch just yet, after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] <b>said</b> Peter, {{speaking}} <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> without thinking, [...] "where {{he builds}} his nest. I {{wonder if he}} builds it on the ground, the way Creeper does." ...|$|R
6000|$|A little {{whispering}} {{took place}} between the Fairy and the Duchess, and then the Fairy <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> [...] "Yes. I thought she would have told you." [...] Grandmarina {{then turned to the}} King and Queen, and said, [...] "We are going in search of Prince Certainpersonio. The pleasure of your company is requested at church in half an hour precisely." [...] So she and the Princess Alicia got into the carriage, and Mr Pickles's boy handed in the Duchess who sat by herself on the opposite seat, and then Mr Pickles's boy put up the steps and got up behind, and the Peacocks flew away with their tails spread.|$|E

6000|$|The countess smiled grimly, {{and shook}} her head with a decidedly {{negative}} shake. Had she <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> to the young man, [...] "Your father is such an obstinate, pig-headed, ignorant fool, that it is no use speaking to him; it would be wasting fragrance on the desert air," [...] she could not have spoken more plainly. The effect on Frank was this: that he said to himself, speaking quite as plainly as Lady de Courcy had spoken by her shake of the face, [...] "My mother and aunt are always down on the governor, always; but the more they are down on him the more I'll stick to him. I certainly will take my degree: I will read like bricks; and I'll begin to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Paddy sat looking thoughtfully at the aspen trees {{he would}} have to cut to {{complete}} his store of food for the winter. All those near the edge of his pond had been cut. The others were scattered about some little distance away. [...] "I don't know," [...] <b>said</b> Paddy <b>out</b> <b>loud.</b> [...] "I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could jump}} like that," [...] <b>said</b> Peter right <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> one day, {{as he stood}} with {{his hands on his}} hips {{watching}} Lightfoot leap over a pile of brush.|$|R
5000|$|Were I {{to sum up}} the Basel Congress in a word - which I shall {{guard against}} pronouncing {{publicly}} - it would be this: At Basel I founded the Jewish State. If I <b>said</b> this <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> today, I would be answered by universal laughter. Perhaps in five years, and certainly in fifty, everyone will recognize this.|$|R
6000|$|Instead of it {{he turned}} and tossed and kicked about in the strangest way, and felt so hot all over that he longed {{to get into the}} river and cool himself; and then he fell half asleep, and dreamt that he heard the little white lady crying to him, [...] "Oh, you're so dirty; go and be washed;" [...] and then that he heard the Irishwoman saying, [...] "Those that wish to be clean, clean they will be." [...] And then he heard the church-bells ring so loud, close to him too, that he was sure it must be Sunday, in spite of what the old dame had said; and he would go to church, and see what a church was like inside, for he had never been in one, poor little fellow, in all his life. But the people would never let him come in, all over soot and dirt like that. He must go to the river and wash first. And he <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> again and again, though being half asleep he did not know it, [...] "I must be clean, I must be clean." ...|$|E
6000|$|Herbert eagerly put out {{his hand}} for the letter. [...] "You may trust me with it," [...] said he: [...] "I am not of a {{sanguine}} temperament, nor easily excited; {{and you may be}} sure that I will not take it for more than it is worth." [...] So saying, he at last got hold of the letter, and managed to read it through much more quickly than Mr. Die had done. As he did so he became very red in the face, and too plainly showed that he had made a false boast in speaking of the coolness of his temperament. Indeed, the stakes were so high that it was difficult for a young man to be cool while he was playing the game: he had made up his mind to lose, and to that he had been reconciled; but now again every pulse of his heart and every nerve of his body was disturbed. [...] "Was never his wife," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> when he got to that part of the letter. [...] "His real wife living now in Spinny Lane! Do you believe that Mr. Prendergast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Farmer Brown's boy {{scratched}} {{his head in a}} puzzled way. [...] "I don't understand it," [...] said he. [...] "I don't understand it at all. Something must have gone wrong with the springs that supply the water for the Laughing Brook. They must have failed. Yes, Sir, that is just what must have happened. But I never heard of such a thing happening before, and I really don't see how it could happen. He stared up into the Green Forest just as if he thought he could see those springs. Of course, he didn't think anything of the kind. He was just turning it all over in his mind. [...] "I know what I'll do, I'll go up to those springs this afternoon and find out what the trouble is," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud.</b> [...] "They are way over almost {{on the other side of}} the Green Forest, and the easiest way to get there will be to start from home and cut across the Old Pasture up to the edge of the Mountain behind the Green Forest. If I try to follow up the Laughing Brook now, it will take too long, because it winds and twists so. Besides, it is too hard work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes! quite useless. Would that I {{had done}} it then--then, at the last moment. They asked me whether I would love that man. I whispered {{inwardly}} to myself that I loathed him; but my tongue <b>said</b> 'Yes,' <b>out</b> <b>loud.</b> Can such a lie as that, told in God's holy temple, sworn before his own altar--can such perjury as that ever be forgiven me? ...|$|R

2500|$|Weeks later, CNN's Randi Kaye told an {{audience}} at West Virginia University {{that she had}} been listening to Cooper's interview from outside the Sago Baptist Church."I heard this unfolding on our air and I must have <b>said</b> something <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> because there was a print photographer standing beside me and he said, 'Did you just say what I think you said?' and I said, 'I think there's only one alive,'" [...] the CNHI News Service quoted Kaye as saying.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't behave well to him," [...] {{she said}} to herself; [...] "I never do. I forget how much he is giving up for me; and then, when {{anything}} annoys him, I make it worse instead of comforting him." [...] And upon that she made accusation against herself {{that she did not}} love him half enough,--that she did not let him see how thoroughly and perfectly she loved him. She had an idea of her own, that as a girl should never show any preference for a man till circumstances should have fully entitled him to such manifestation, so also should she make no drawback on her love, but pour it forth for his benefit with all her strength, when such circumstances had come to exist. But she was ever feeling that she was not acting up to her theory, now that the time for such practice had come. She would unwittingly assume little reserves, and make small pretences of indifference in spite of her own judgment. She had done so on this afternoon, and had left him without giving him her hand to press, without looking up into his face with an assurance of love, and therefore she was angry with herself. [...] "I know I shall teach him to hate me," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> to Bell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why wouldn't it {{scare me}} to have a fire [...] Begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know [...] That still, if I repent, I may recall it, [...] But in a moment not: a little spurt [...] Of burning fatness, and then nothing but [...] The fire itself can put it out, and that [...] By burning out, and before it burns out [...] It will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars, [...] And {{sweeping}} round it with a flaming sword, [...] Made the dim trees stand back in wider circle-- [...] Done so much and I know not how much more [...] I mean it shall not do if I can bind it. [...] Well if it doesn't with its draft bring on [...] A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter, [...] As once it did with me upon an April. [...] The breezes were so spent with winter blowing [...] They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them [...] Short of the perch their languid flight was toward; [...] And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven [...] As I walked once round it in possession. [...] But the wind out of doors--you know the saying. [...] There came a gust. You used to think the trees [...] Made wind by fanning since you never knew [...] It blow but that you saw the trees in motion. [...] Something or someone watching made that gust. [...] It put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass [...] Of over-winter with the least tip-touch [...] Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand. [...] The place it reached to blackened instantly. [...] The black was all there was by day-light, [...] That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke-- [...] And a flame slender as the hepaticas, [...] Blood-root, and violets so soon to be now. [...] But the black spread like black death on the ground, [...] And I think the sky darkened with a cloud [...] Like winter and evening coming on together. [...] There were enough things to be thought of then. [...] Where the field stretches toward the north [...] And setting sun to Hyla brook, I gave it [...] To flames without twice thinking, where it verges [...] Upon the road, to flames too, though in fear [...] They might find fuel there, in withered brake, [...] Grass its full length, old silver golden-rod, [...] And alder and grape vine entanglement, [...] To leap the dusty deadline. For my own [...] I took what front there was beside. I knelt [...] And thrust hands in and held my face away. [...] Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating. [...] A board is the best weapon if you have it. [...] I had my coat. And oh, I knew, I knew, [...] And <b>said</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> I couldn't bide the smother [...] And heat so close in; but the thought of all [...] The woods and town on fire by me, and all [...] The town turned out to fight for me--that held me. [...] I trusted the brook barrier, but feared [...] The road would fail; and on that side the fire [...] Died not without a noise of crackling wood-- [...] Of something more than tinder-grass and weed-- [...] That brought me to my feet to hold it back [...] By leaning back myself, as if the reins [...] Were round my neck and I was at the plough. [...] I won! But I'm sure no one ever spread [...] Another color over a tenth the space [...] That I spread coal-black over in the time [...] It took me. Neighbors coming home from town [...] Couldn't believe that so much black had come there [...] While they had backs turned, that it hadn't been there [...] When they had passed an hour or so before [...] Going the other way and they not seen it. [...] They looked about for someone to have done it. [...] But there was no one. I was somewhere wondering [...] Where all my weariness had gone and why [...] I walked so light on air in heavy shoes [...] In spite of a scorched Fourth-of-July feeling. [...] Why wouldn't I be scared remembering that?" ...|$|E

50|$|Traditionally an oath (from Anglo-Saxon , {{also called}} plight) {{is either a}} {{statement}} of fact or a promise with wording relating to something considered sacred {{as a sign of}} verity.
