Since any possible identification would take many months, it was decided to carry out the reburials as soon as the cemetery was ready, and use temporary headstones.

2500|$|Many {{newspaper}} editors in the United States clamored for Polk {{to claim the}} entire region as the Democrats had proposed in the 1844 campaign. Headlines like [...] "The Whole of Oregon or None" [...] by The Union editor Thomas Ritchie appeared on 6 November 1845. In a column in the New York Morning News on December 27, 1845, editor John L. O'Sullivan argued that the United States should claim all of Oregon [...] "by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess {{the whole of the}} continent which Providence has given us..." [...] Soon afterwards, the term [...] "Manifest Destiny" [...] became a <b>standard</b> <b>phrase</b> for expansionists, and a permanent part of the American lexicon.

2500|$|Although an Egyptian man {{was free}} to marry several women at a time, and some wealthy men from Old and Middle Kingdoms did {{have more than one}} wife, monogamy was the norm. There may have been some exceptions, e.g. a Nineteenth Dynasty {{official}} stated as proof of his love to his deceased wife that he had stayed married to her since their youth, even after he had become very successful (P. Leiden I 371). This may suggest that some men abandoned first wives of a low social status and married women of higher status in order to further their careers although even then they lived with only one wife. Egyptian women had right to ask for a divorce if her husband took a second wife. Many tomb reliefs testify to monogamous character of Egyptian marriages, officials are usually accompanied by a supportive wife. [...] "His wife X, his beloved" [...] is the <b>standard</b> <b>phrase</b> identifying wives in tomb inscriptions. The instruction texts belonging to wisdom literature, e.g. Instruction of Ptahhotep or Instruction of Any, support fidelity to monogamous marriage life, calling the wife a Lady of the house. The Instruction of Ankhsheshonq suggests that it is wrong to abandon a wife because of her barrenness.|$|E

5000|$|The phrase [...] "is a part of" [...] is a <b>standard</b> <b>phrase</b> for {{composition}} {{relations that}} can be used to express facts that relate parts to wholes. The other <b>standard</b> <b>phrase</b> [...] "can have as part a" [...] is a phrase for a concept {{that can be}} used to express knowledge that a whole of a particular kind can have as a part a component of a particular kind. The [...] "shall have as part a" [...] relation is intended to be used to express requirements. All phrases have also inverse expressions, such as [...] "has as part" [...] and [...] "can be a part of a," [...] which denote the same concepts (relation types), but which require an inverse sequence of the related objects.

50|$|Kusamakura was {{translated}} into English in 1965 by Alan Turney, under the title The Three-Cornered World. Turney himself explained his choice of the title in an introduction:Kusa Makura literally means The Grass Pillow, and is the <b>standard</b> <b>phrase</b> used in Japanese poetry to signify a journey. Since a literal translation of this title would give none of the connotations of the original to English readers, I thought it better to take a phrase {{from the body of}} the text which I believe expresses the point of the book.|$|E
5000|$|... "Finished saying theses things" [...] is a <b>standard</b> <b>phrase</b> used by Matthew {{to end a}} {{discourse}} by Jesus, also being found at Matthew 11:1, 13:53, 19:1, and 26:1. It makes clear that the Gospel is concluding a section. The term may be based on Old Testament sources. Another common Matthean feature is his mention of the crowds or multitudes. Matthew adds crowds of followers in several verses that are lacking them in Luke. The word translated as astonished can mean both amazed with wonder and overwhelmed with fear, though this verse could very well intend both meanings.|$|E
