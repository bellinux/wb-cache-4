40|$|Conventional {{computed}} tomography (CT) approaches provides limited visualization {{of the entire}} endoluminal changes of aortic dissection (AD), which is essential for its treatment. As an important supplement, three-dimensional CT virtual intravascular endoscopy (VIE) can show relevant details. This study aims to determine the value of VIE in displaying the entry tear and intimal flap of AD. Among 127 consecutive symptomatic patients with suspected AD who underwent CT angiography (CTA), 84 subjects were confirmed to have AD and {{were included in the}} study. Conventional CT and VIE images were observed and evaluated. From the 92 entry tears revealed via conventional CT, 88 (95. 7 %) tears appeared <b>on</b> <b>VIE</b> with round (n = 26), slit-shaped (n = 9), or irregular (n = 53) shapes, whereas the intimal flaps were sheetlike (n = 34), tubular (n = 34), wavelike (n = 13), or irregular (n = 7) in shape. The VIE also showed the spatial relationship between the torn flap and adjacent structures. Among 58 entry tears with multiple-line type flap shown on conventional CT, 41 (70. 7 %) appeared with an irregular shape <b>on</b> <b>VIE,</b> whereas among 30 tears with single-line type flap, 17 (56. 7 %) appeared as round or slit-shaped <b>on</b> <b>VIE.</b> These results demonstrated a significant difference (P < 0. 05). The poor display of tears <b>on</b> <b>VIE</b> was related to the low CT attenuation values in lumen or in neighboring artifacts (P < 0. 01). CT VIE presents the complete configurations and details of the intimal tears and flaps of AD better than conventional CT approaches. Accordingly, it should be recommended as a necessary assessment tool for endovascular therapy and as part of strategy planning in pre-surgical patients...|$|R
