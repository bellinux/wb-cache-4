They would discuss their {{findings}} from surveying Hopeton in their 1848 book, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. They describe the site as consisting of main works {{with a set of}} smaller works {{to the right of the}} main. There is a rectangle <b>shaped</b> <b>work</b> [...] "with an attached circle, the latter extending into the former, instead of being connected with it in the usual manner." [...] The circle is located [...] "somewhat to the right of a line drawn through the centre of the rectangle, parallel to its longest sides." [...] The rectangle site was surveyed at 950 feet by 900 feet in size. The attached circle was noted at 1,050 feet in diameter. The site was reported as having 12 gateways, averaging a 25 feet width. The [...] "line" [...] going from the circle to the rectangle was 530 feet long. The east side of the earthworks were reported as having two more circles. One was measured at 200 feet and the other at 250 feet in diameter. Another small circle is located just north of the site, also noted at 250 feet in diameter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{work has}} been highly praised for its art. Dr. Jan Baetens and Dr. Hugo Frey, {{the authors of the}} book The Graphic Novel: An Introduction, asserts that Alien: The Illustrated Storys art by Simonson has a {{distinctive}} format, particularly the panel and page layout, which serves to provide the audience with a careful and cohesively <b>shaped</b> <b>work</b> which highlights the tension in the plot (as well as for the characters) and brings them to greater attention to the readers. According to Baetens and Frey, Simonson achieves thus by utilizing standard comic frames, but then subtly breaking the images outside of the panels and organizing the pages into a more [...] "free-form" [...] style. In contrast to another acclaimed graphic novel, A Contract with God by Will Eisner, so are more traditional grid panels still present at places but are frequently reduced or are abandoned altogether as the story progresses. In their opinion, so does the characters and backgrounds without framing lend the work a confidence and readability that is impressive. Comparing it again to A Contract with God they express that Simonson's highly planned-out but simultaneously free-flowing approach similarly prepares for three double splash pages of major scenes from the story.|$|E

A major part of this description is the set of constraints that the document or dataset is required to satisfy. W 3 C recently (2014) chartered the RDF Data <b>Shapes</b> <b>Working</b> Group to define SHACL, a standard RDF data shape language. We refer to the ability to name and reference shape language elements as recursion. This article provides a precise definition of the meaning of recursion as used in Resource Shape 2. 0. The definition of recursion presented in this article is largely independent of language-specific details. We speculate that it also applies to ShEx and to all three of the current proposals for SHACL. In particular, recursion is not permitted in the SHACL-SPARQL proposal, but we conjecture that recursion could be added by using the definition proposed here as a top-level control structure.
