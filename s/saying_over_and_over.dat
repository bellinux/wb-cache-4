He is expecting the Soviet Ambassador, Dekanozov, who had been phoning the Minister since early Saturday. Dekanozov had an urgent message from Moscow.

Dekanozov was told that von Ribbentrop wished to meet with him at once. An {{appointment}} was made for 4amVon Ribbentrop is nervous, walking up and down from one end of his large office to the other, like a caged animal, while <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> [...] "The Führer is absolutely right. We must attack Russia, or they will surely attack us!" [...] Is he reassuring himself? Is he justifying the ruination of his crowning diplomatic achievement? Now he has to destroy it [...] "because that is the Führers wish".When Dekanozov finally appeared, Ribbentrop read out a short statement saying that the Reich had been forced into [...] "military countermeasures" [...] because of an alleged Soviet plan to attack Germany in July 1941. Ribbentrop did not present a declaration of war to General Dekanozov, confining himself to reading the statement about Germany being forced to take [...] "military countermeasures".|$|E

6000|$|... "If I could {{understand}} it, it wouldn't be so bad," [...] he kept <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again to himself, [...] "but I don't understand it. I don't understand why Mrs. Whitefoot doesn't love me any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow, they're getting--restive. Caterham keeps harping on {{what may}} happen if it gets loose again. I <b>say</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, it won't, <b>and</b> it can't. But--there it is!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean {{as regards}} yourself; I mean as regards him. I have heard you <b>say</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again {{that it is}} a piteous thing that he should be so treated. Have I not?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Shooting is completed, S. {{returns to}} Switzerland, {{to finish the}} film.

60|$|But it didn't at all soften Miss Pecksniff; {{perhaps because}} her nature was not rugged enough. On the contrary, she persisted in <b>saying,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, that she wasn't quite a fool, and wasn't blind, and wouldn't submit to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must go back}} to him," [...] said Halleck. [...] "He's your husband!" [...] He {{pushed on}} again, <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> as if the words were some spell in which he found safety, [...] "You must go back, you must go back, you must go back!" ...|$|E
50|$|Linfinity is an American {{rock band}} from New York City. The name Linfinity derives from a story told to Dylan by a World War One veteran.

6000|$|Mamie {{returns the}} tender compliments, and Georgina does what the Americans call [...] "endorse them." [...] Mrs. Lirriper {{is proud to}} be so remembered, <b>and</b> <b>says</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again [...] "that it's worth twenty times the trouble she has taken with the narrative, since Barry Cornwall, Esquire, is pleased to like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{would sit}} swaying with the rolling {{of the ship}} and suck at his pipe of blond tobacco and look with an inexpressibly sage but somnolent blue eye at the captain by the hour together. [...] "Captain's a Card," [...] he would <b>say</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again as the outcome of these meditations. [...] "He'd like to know what we're up to. He'd like to know--no end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There must be one. There must be one," [...] he kept <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to himself, to {{keep his}} courage up. [...] "I can't keep dodging much longer. If I don't find a hole pretty soon, Butcher will surely catch me. Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'What can I do? What can I do?' Mrs. 'Gator kept <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b> 'However can I {{keep them}} warm when Mr. Sun {{goes to bed}} at night? Oh, dear! Oh, dear! My {{beautiful}} eggs never, never will turn to darling babies! What can I do?' ...|$|E
6000|$|So down I lay, {{and said}} the {{multiplication}} table industriously for several minutes, trying to turn a deaf ear to the outer world, and curb my unruly thoughts. But it was a failure, and, when I found myself <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> [...] "Four times twelve is twenty-four," [...] I gave up affecting courage, and went in for a good honest scare.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know what}} you mean, you cross thing,' said my mother. 'I {{understand}} you, Peggotty, perfectly. You know I do, and I wonder you don't colour up like fire. But one point at a time. Miss Murdstone is the point now, Peggotty, and you sha'n't escape from it. Haven't you heard her <b>say,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, that she thinks I am too thoughtless and too--a--a--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's always practising--always <b>saying</b> things <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> {{to seize}} the tone. I've her voice in my ears. He wants her not to have any." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} the heart to think so," [...] {{returned}} Biddy, [...] "say so. <b>Say</b> so <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, if {{you have the}} heart to think so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear, I'm so glad you've come. He's better, but it {{has been}} awful. The doctors have had to fight him to keep him in bed. He was crazy to get to town. He kept <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again that he must be at the office. They gave him something, and he was asleep when I left the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Polly re-entered the inn discreetly. He {{found the}} plump woman seated in her bar, her eyes a-stare, her face white and wet with tears. [...] "O God!" [...] she was <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. [...] "O God!" [...] The air {{was full of}} a spirituous reek, and on the sanded boards {{in front of the}} bar were the {{fragments}} of a broken bottle and an overturned glass.|$|E
6000|$|Now Ol' Mistah Buzzard hadn't {{been over}} near the Smiling Pool for some time, and he hadn't heard how the Smiling Pool had stopped smiling, and the Laughing Brook had stopped laughing. When {{he looked down}} and saw how the water was so nearly gone from them that the trout and the minnows had hardly enough in which to live, he was so {{surprised}} that he kept <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to himself: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is just, O God!" [...] {{he would}} <b>say,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. [...] "It is just. On me and mine be the {{punishment}} laid. We have sinned, we have fallen short. There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust, and I held my peace. I preached acceptable folly--my God, what folly!--when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and called upon them to repent--repent! [...] . Oppressors {{of the poor}} and needy [...] . ! The wine press of God!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I do. A fellow can't go on <b>saying</b> so <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> {{again in}} a beastly place like this. If we were {{anywhere}} jolly together, then I could say it often enough.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do say it. I <b>say</b> it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. I don't {{know what}} any gentleman can gain by persecuting a lady. You oughtn't {{to have been}} shown up here at all." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Burtenshaw got {{so excited}} {{at the idea}} she couldn't 'ardly speak, but at last, arter <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> agin she wouldn't {{do such a thing}} for worlds, she and Silas {{arranged}} that he should come in at about {{three o'clock in the morning}} and give Bill a solemn warning. She gave 'im her key, and Silas said he'd come in with his 'air and cap all wet and pretend he'd been drowned.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{it makes}} its way into my mind, dear,' said Rachael, 'and it will come sometimes, though I do all I can to keep it out, wi' {{counting}} on to high numbers as I work, and <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again pieces that I knew when I were a child - I fall into such a wild, hot hurry, that, however tired I am, I want to walk fast, miles and miles. I must {{get the better of}} this before bed-time. I'll walk home wi' you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear! Oh, dear me!" [...] he kept <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to himself. [...] "Wherever shall I go? Whatever shall I do? However shall I {{get enough}} to eat? I won't dare {{go back to}} get food from my little storehouses, and I shall {{have to live in}} a strange place where I won't know where to look for food. I am getting tired. My legs ache. I 'm getting hungry. I want my nice, warm, soft bed. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, I should hope not, indeed!' {{returned}} my mother.

60|$|The farmers' wives {{began to}} leave, <b>saying</b> good-by <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. They {{clung to the}} girl's hand, gazing at her with wistful eyes. It seemed {{as if they could}} not bear to let her go out of their lives again.|$|R
5000|$|Pearl Eliadis, a {{human rights}} lawyer and {{prominent}} supporter of the CHRC, stated that Moon's statement that Section 13 targets only extreme speech [...] "makes explicit what the courts have already said implicitly." [...] However, she opposed shifting the CHRC's role to focus solely on violence as opposed to hatred. Eliadis arged that [...] "when we deal with genocide and ethnic cleansing cases in other countries, what does the international community <b>say</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again? We need a warning system. And one of the warnings is incitement to hatred." [...] However, she opposed criminal investigations into hate speech {{on the basis that}} people should not be put [...] "in jail for their words." ...|$|R
6000|$|How {{exquisite}} they were! As one read them, {{one seemed}} to be floating down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as one pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of colour {{reminded him of the}} gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the tall honey-combed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through the dim, dust-stained arcades. Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he kept <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to himself:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Spotty the Turtle {{said this}} over to himself {{every time he}} felt a little down-hearted, as he plodded along {{the bed of the}} Laughing Brook. And every time he said it, he felt better. [...] "One step, two steps," [...] he kept <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> and each time he said it, he took a step and then another. They were very short steps, very short steps indeed, for Spotty's legs are very short. But each one carried him forward just so much, and {{he knew that he was}} just so much nearer the thing he was seeking. Anyway, he hoped he was.|$|E
6000|$|So Spotty the Turtle {{wasted no}} more time wishing {{that he could do}} {{something}} it was never meant that he should do. Instead, he picked out what looked like the easiest place to climb the bank and started up. My, my, my, it was hard work! You see, he had to carry his house along with him, for he has to carry that wherever he goes, {{and it would have been}} hard enough to have climbed that bank without carrying anything. Every time he had climbed up three steps he slipped back two steps, but he kept at it, puffing and blowing, <b>saying</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to himself: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You'd {{have done}} it yourself, Cherry,' said the little boy, 'if you had only seen how bad he was; he got quite white, and had great drops on his forehead, and panted so, and would not let out {{a bit of a}} cry, only now and then a groan; and so I ran to get the verse Papa used to <b>say</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to you when your foot was bad. And I'm sure it was the right one, but--but--it did him no good, for, oh! he didn't know who our Saviour is;' and the little fellow clung to his brother in a passion of tears, while Felix felt a pang at the contrast.|$|R
60|$|But {{they did}} not stop Christ: and, what is more, they will never stop him. He has said it, and it remains true for ever; for he is <b>saying</b> it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, in a {{thousand}} ways, to his sheep, when they are wandering without a shepherd.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movie is}} based on actual events. On March 24, 1980, Romero was killed, and three Roman Catholic nuns and a lay Catholic missionary were killed on December 2, 1980, by Salvadoran death squads, {{possibly}} funded by the United States. [...] Three of the women dedicated their lives to helping refugees and sick people for years. [...] Jean Donovan had been in El Salvador {{for over two years}} helping the children that she was so devoted to. [...] Donovan <b>says</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> in her letters to her family in the U.S. that God brought her to El Salvador. [...] These women were raped, tortured, and killed by members of a Salvadoran death squad. [...] Attempts from the Salvadoran and American governments were made to try to cover the murders up.|$|R
