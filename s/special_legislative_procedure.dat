40|$|This report {{discusses}} certain {{provisions of}} law that commonly are known as “fast-track” or expedited procedures. They are so labeled because these statutory provisions contain <b>special</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>procedures</b> that apply to one or both houses of Congress and that expedite, or put on a fast track, congressional consideration of a certain measure or a narrowly defined class of measures. This report first presents the nature, purpose, and elements of fast-track procedures.

In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone. The procedure used also depends upon which type of institutional act is being used. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve, but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations.|$|R

5000|$|The cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{were created}} by the Law on Federal Units (Cantons) of 1996, {{which was based on}} the Bosniak-Croat Washington Agreement. The cantons consist of municipalities. A canton has its own {{government}} headed by a prime minister. The prime minister has his own cabinet, and is assisted in his duties by various cantonal ministries, agencies, and cantonal or county services. Five of the cantons (Una-Sana, Tuzla, Zenica-Doboj, Bosnian Podrinje, and Sarajevo) have a Bosniak majority, three (Posavina, West Herzegovina and Canton 10) have a Bosnian Croat majority, while two of them (Central Bosnia and Herzegovina-Neretva) are 'ethnically mixed', meaning neither ethnic group has a majority and there are <b>special</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>procedures</b> for the protection of their political interests.

40|$|The thesis {{offers a}} {{critical}} analysis of legislative acts of the European Union. The objective of the thesis is to determine what concept of legislative act obtains in EU law, and whether the objectives which were sought to be achieved by means of introduction of “language of legislation” into EU law have been achieved. The thesis concentrates on analysis of Articles 289 – 291 TFEU. After analysing ordinary and <b>special</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>procedures,</b> delegated and implementing acts, and legislative acts, it is concluded that no single concept of legislative act currently exists in EU law; the constitutive treaties offer none. The objectives (set forth in the Laeken Declaration) which were sought to be achieved by means of introduction of “language of legislation” into EU law have not been met. Aside from terminological changes the legal position currently obtaining under the Lisbon Treaty does not differ conceptually from that which obtained under the Treaty of Nice. The term “legislative act” employed in Article 289 (3) TFEU is just a shorthand denoting an act adopted via a particular procedure...|$|R

Having been posted outside the entrance to the hemicycle, members can sign the declaration and if a majority do so it is forwarded to the President and announced to the plenary before being forwarded to the other institutions and formally noted in the minutes.|$|R

5000|$|As such, the (Central) RTI Act, 2005 {{applies to}} the Union Government of India {{and all of its}} states and territories, but not to the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Jammu & Kashmir is accorded special {{provisions}} under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which exempts most legislation passed in the Parliament of India from automatically applying to the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Instead, under the Constitution of Jammu & Kashmir, the state's own Legislative Assembly has the option of (a) voting to [...] "extend" [...] a Union Act to its own state using a <b>special</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>procedure,</b> (b) voting to enact a state-specific law of its own using the traditional state-level drafting process, or (c) simply ignoring the Union Act altogether.|$|E
50|$|The other {{legislation}} option is the <b>Special</b> <b>Legislative</b> <b>Procedure</b> (SLP). The SLP {{consists of the}} passing of laws proposed by member states, the Central Bank or Investment Bank, or the Court of Justice. Judicial activism—the interpretation {{of the spirit of}} law rather than the letter of law—is handled by the SLP. The procedure is discussed either in the EP with consultation with the Council, or in the Council with participation of the EP. In other words, the consultative role stops short of the equal weight given to both the EP and the Council. While provided for in the treaties, the SLP is not as formal as the OLP, relying less on the hierarchical structure. This lends more credence to Kleine's argument of the contrariness of the EU's agenda-setting procedure.|$|E

Article 86 provides for the possibility of establishing a European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) from Eurojust in order to combat crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union. The EPPO may be established by the Council, according to a <b>special</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>procedure,</b> acting unanimously and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.
