50|$|A <b>solenoid</b> <b>brake</b> is an {{electrically}} controlled brake. The brake {{is turned}} on and off by an electrical solenoid. Typically a spring engages the brake when unpowered, and the solenoid releases it when powered.|$|E
5000|$|A winch is a {{mechanical}} device {{that is used}} to pull in (wind up) or let out (wind out) or otherwise adjust the [...] "tension" [...] of a rope or wire rope (also called [...] "cable" [...] or [...] "wire cable"). In its simplest form it consists of a spool and attached hand crank. In larger forms, winches stand at the heart of machines as diverse as tow trucks, steam shovels and elevators. The spool can also be called the winch drum. More elaborate designs have gear assemblies and can be powered by electric, hydraulic, pneumatic or internal combustion drives. Some may include a <b>solenoid</b> <b>brake</b> and/or {{a mechanical}} brake or ratchet and pawl device that prevents it from unwinding unless the pawl is retracted.|$|E
25|$|The trams had {{a primary}} dynamic braking {{controlled}} through 12 stages. There are also pnumatic drum brakes, {{although they are}} only used for parking, braking form the back end and for a passenger-induced emergency brake. The MO units were instead equipped with clasp brakes controlled by pneumatics. Trailers were equipped with <b>solenoid</b> <b>brakes,</b> but lacked a parking brake as {{it was found that}} the motor unit's holding brake was sufficient., In addition all units had an emergency rail brake. The trams were connected with Albert couplers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Thruster brake is {{device to}} retard {{the speed of}} moving {{machinery}} and stop it accurately to desire position. The braking {{force is applied to}} brake shoe by pre-stressed compression spring. The convectional thruster brake employs either an electro-mechanical thruster or passive hydraulic thruster. The electro mechanical thruster utilize electro mechanical <b>solenoid</b> to apply <b>braking</b> force, where as hydraulic thruster brake is applied a force via thruster that is operated by hydraulic force. The value of hydraulic force is fixed irrespective of load to under braking force or over braking force leading to slip the load i. e. improve load positioning or over force braking leading to excessive and un-necessary brake wear...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Solenoid valves {{are used}} in air braking system in heavy vehicles. This is {{essentially}} used to prevent skidding in vehicles. Traditionally the coil uses copper wounded coils for producing the working flux for plunger attraction. Recent Cu price increases motivate careful examination of approaches to minimize Cu use. Approaches that can reduce Cu use without increasing losses include careful winding design, trading winding volume for core volume; replacing Cu with Al. Al wire is particularly attractive. The cost of Al is lower than it might appear from the cost per unit mass when the much lower density of Al is also considered, and the disadvantage of higher resistivity becomes less important. This paper shows the design details of a solenoid valve with aluminum wiring along with {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of copper and aluminum. It also includes the testing and performance results of aluminum air solenoid.

40|$|In mixed-mode braking applications, the {{electric}} motor / generator (M/G) and hydraulic pressure valve are controlled {{to meet the}} driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking demand. Controlling these braking elements is achieved by modulating the current generated by the M/G and adjusting the fluid pressure to the wheel brake cylinders. This paper aims to model and design combined regenerative and hydraulic braking systems which, comprise an induction electric machine, inverter, NiMH battery, controller, a pressure source, pressure control unit, and brake calipers. A 15 kW 1500 rpm induction machine equipped with a reduction gear having a gear ratio of 4 is used. A hydraulic brake capable to produce fluid pressure up to 40 bar is used. Direct torque control and pressure control are chosen as the control criteria in the M/G and the hydraulic <b>solenoid</b> valve. The <b>braking</b> demands for the system are derived from the Federal Testing Procedure (FTP) drive cycle. Two simulation models have been developed in Matlab®/Simulink® to analyze {{the performance of the}} control strategy in each braking system. The developed model is validated through experiment. It is concluded that the control system does introduce torque ripple and pressure oscillation in the braking system, but these effects do not affect vehicle braking performance due to the high frequency nature of pressure fluctuation and the damping effect of the vehicle inertia. Moreover, experiment results prove the effectiveness of the developed model...|$|R
