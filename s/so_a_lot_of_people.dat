50|$|On 8 October 1938, 49,335 spectators watched Fulham play Millwall. The {{reason for}} this {{exceptionally}} large crowd was that the game at Stamford Bridge had suddenly been cancelled and <b>so</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> made their way west to the Cottage that afternoon instead. It was the largest attendance ever at Craven Cottage and the record remains today, unlikely to be bettered {{as it is now}} an all-seater stadium with currently no room for more than 25,700. During the 1930-60's era, Fulham often averaged over 25,000. However, the official attendances can be considered somewhat dubious in this era as many fans would get in by climbing over the fence from Bishops Park into the Putney End. As at many other grounds, fans would sometimes pay at the turnstiles but not be counted. This boot money would be given to the players (stuffed in their boots) and would not be counted in the gate money. The ground hosted several football games for the 1948 Summer Olympics, {{and is one of the}} last extant that did.|$|E
50|$|St. Gallen embroidery, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Swiss embroidery, is embroidery {{from the city}} and the region of St. Gallen, Switzerland. The region was once the largest and most important export area for embroidery. Around 1910, its embroidery production was the largest export branch of the Swiss economy with 18 percent of the overall export value. More than 50 percent of the world production came from St. Gallen. With the advent of the First World War, the demand for the luxury dropped suddenly and significantly and <b>so</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> were unemployed, which resulted in the biggest economic crisis in the region. Today, the embroidery industry has somewhat recovered, but it will probably never again reach its former size. Nevertheless, the St. Galler Spitzen (as the embroidery is also called) are still very popular as a raw material for expensive haute couture creations in Paris and count among the most famous textiles in the world. Michelle Obama decided to wear St. Gallen embroidery at the inauguration ceremony of her husband on January 20, 2009.|$|E

5000|$|One {{criticism}} of Jones's time at Musicor, which lasted from 1965 to 1971, {{was the lack}} of quality control. Jones recorded an enormous amount of material during this time and almost all of it got issued on LPs. The label had released a double album called The George Jones Story in 1968, which featured a mix of old and new songs, and My Country repeats the process. These packages, combined with LPs still being released by his earlier labels Mercury and United Artists, resulted in the market being flooded with releases by [...] "the Possum." [...] In the 1989 documentary Same Ole Me, Starday president Don Pierce recalls producer Pappy Daily's stewardship of Jones's career: [...] "Well, we took him to Mercury, and he became the artist for their country division, and then he took him to United Artists, and he was the country music division at United Artists. The he took him to Musicor and he was the country division at Musicor, and <b>so</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> have been ridin' on ol' George."

In addition to the plethora of fictional characters who populate Jane's narrative, Jane and others make many references to historical events and figures over the close-to-a hundred years Miss Jane can recall. In addition to its obvious opening in the American Civil War, Jane alludes to the Spanish-American War and her narrative spans across both World Wars {{and the beginning of}} the Vietnam War. Jane and other characters also mention Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Jackie Robinson, Fred Shuttlesworth, Rosa Parks, and others.

You ought to been here twenty-five, thirty years ago. You ought to been here when poor people had nothing.'" [...] Because of the historical content, some readers thought the book was non-fiction. Gaines commented: Some people have asked me whether or not The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman is fiction or nonfiction. It is fiction. When Dial Press first sent it out, they did not put [...] "a novel" [...] on the galleys or on the dustjacket, <b>so</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> had the feeling that it could have been real. ... I did a lot of research in books to give some facts to what Miss Jane could talk about, but these are my creations.
