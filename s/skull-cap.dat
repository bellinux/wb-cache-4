500|$|The Nonsuch then {{returned}} to England and was paid off on 9 November 1681. Benbow left the Navy and entered the merchant service, sailing a merchant vessel from London and Bristol to ports in Italy and Spain. By 1686 he was a [...] "tough merchant seaman" [...] and the owner and commander of a frigate named the Benbow, trading with the Levant. In May 1687 he commanded a merchant vessel, the Malaga Merchant, and was aboard {{her when she was}} attacked by a Salé pirate. He mounted a successful defence and beat off the attack. It was claimed afterwards that he cut off and salted the heads of thirteen Moors who were slain aboard his ship, and then took them into Cadiz to claim a reward from the magistrates. A Moorish <b>skull-cap,</b> [...] "coated with varnish and set in silver" [...] and bearing the inscription [...] "First adventure of Captain John Benbow, and gift to Richard Ridley, 1687" [...] is referred to in 1844 by Charles Dickens in Bentley's Miscellany where he speaks of Shrewsbury's history, and the 1885 Dictionary of National Biography also relates the story.|$|E
2500|$|On votive reliefs {{they are}} {{depicted}} {{with a variety}} of symbols representing the concept of twinhood, such as the dokana (δόκανα – two upright pieces of wood connected by two cross-beams), a pair of amphorae, a pair of shields, or a pair of snakes. [...] They are also often shown wearing felt caps, sometimes with stars above. [...] They are depicted on metopes from Delphi showing them on the voyage of the Argo (Ἀργώ) and rustling cattle with Idas. Greek vases regularly show them capturing Phoebe and Hilaeira, as Argonauts, as well as in religious ceremonies and at the delivery to Leda of the egg containing Helen. They can be recognized in some vase-paintings by the <b>skull-cap</b> they wear, the pilos (πῖλος), which was already explained in antiquity as the remnants of the egg from which they hatched.|$|E

60|$|But Belarab {{had turned}} toward his three attendants in white robes, with shaven polls under <b>skull-caps</b> of plaited grass, with prayer beads hanging from their wrists, and {{an air of}} {{superior}} calm on their dark faces: companions of his desperate days, men of blood once and now imperturbable in their piety and wisdom of trusted counsellors.|$|R
50|$|In Judaism, men {{cover their}} heads out of reverence for God. Jewish {{religious}} headgear for men include small cloth <b>skull-caps,</b> called kippahs or yarmulkes. Some men wear {{them at all}} times, others in the synagogue. In Orthodox and Hasidic Judaism, the kippah may also be additionally covered by hats such as fedoras or shtreimels. Traditional married Jewish women cover their hair in various ways, such as with headscarfs, called tichels, snoods, or wigs, called sheitels according to the principles and halacha of tzniut.|$|R
2500|$|The best-known {{story of}} the twins' birth is that Zeus {{disguised}} himself as a swan and seduced Leda. Thus Leda's children are frequently said to have hatched from two eggs that she then produced. The Dioscuri can be recognized in vase-paintings by the <b>skull-cap</b> they wear, the pilos, which was explained in antiquity as {{the remnants of the}} egg. [...] Whether the children are thus mortal or half-immortal is not consistent among accounts, nor is whether the twins hatched together from one egg. In some accounts, only Pollux was fathered by Zeus, while Leda and her husband Tyndareus conceived Castor. This explains why they were granted an alternate immortality. It is a common belief that one would live among the gods, while the other was among the dead. The figure of Tyndareus may have entered their tradition to explain their archaic name Tindaridai in Spartan inscriptions, or Tyndaridai in literature, in turn occasioning incompatible accounts of their parentage.|$|E
2500|$|Ibrahim Pasha {{landed at}} Methoni on 24 February 1825, {{and a month}} later he was joined by his army of 10,000 {{infantry}} and 1,000 cavalry. The Greeks had not expected Ibrahim Pasha to land during the stormy winter weather, and were taken by surprise. The Greeks initially laughed at the Egyptian soldiers, who were short, skinny fallāḥīn (peasant) conscripts, many of them blind in one eye owing to the prevalence of parasitic worms that attacked the eye in the Nile, wearing cheap red uniforms comprising a jacket, trousers and a <b>skull-cap.</b> However, the Greeks soon learned that the Egyptians, who were trained by French officers recruited by Mohammed Ali, were tough and hardy soldiers who, unlike the Turkish and Albanian units that the Greeks had been fighting until then, stood their ground in combat. Ibrahim proceeded to defeat the Greek garrison on the small island of Sphacteria {{off the coast of}} Messenia. With the Greeks in disarray, Ibrahim ravaged the Western Peloponnese and killed Papaflessas at the Battle of Maniaki. To try to stop Ibrahim, Kanaris led the raid on Alexandria, an attempt to destroy the Egyptian fleet that failed due to a sudden change of the wind. The British traveller and Church of England minister, Reverend Charles Swan, reported Ibrahim Pasha as saying to him that he [...] "would burn and destroy the whole Morea". Popular opinion in both Greece and the rest of Europe, soon credited Ibrahim Pasha with the so-called [...] "barbarisation project", where it was alleged that Ibrahim planned to deport the entire Christian Greek population to Egypt as slaves and replace them with Egyptian peasants. It is not clear even today if the [...] "barbarisation project" [...] was a real plan or not, but the possibility that it was created strong demands for humanitarian intervention in Europe. The Porte and Mohammed Ali both denied having plans for the [...] "barbarisation project", but pointedly refused to put their denials into writing. Russia warned that if the [...] "barbarisation project" [...] was a real plan, then such an egregious violation of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, under which Russia had a vague claim to be the protector of all the Orthodox peoples of the Ottoman Empire, would lead to Russia going to war against the Ottomans. In turn, the British Foreign Secretary George Canning wrote, rather than run the risk of Russia defeating the Ottomans alone, Britain would have to intervene to stop the [...] "barbarisation project" [...] as the British did not wish to see the Russians conquer the Ottoman Empire. While diplomats and statesmen debated what to do in London and St. Petersburg, the Egyptian advance continued in Greece. The Greek government, in an attempt to stop the Egyptians, released Kolokotronis from captivity, but he too was unsuccessful. By the end of June, Ibrahim had captured the city of Argos and was within striking distance of Nafplion. The city was saved by Makriyannis and Dimitrios Ypsilantis who successfully defended Miloi at the outskirts of Nafplion, making the mills outside the town a fortress causing damage to Ibrahim's far superior forces who were unable to take the position and eventually left for Tripolitsa. Makriyannis was wounded and was taken aboard by Europeans who were overseeing the battle. Among them was De Rigny, who had an argument with Makriyannis and advised him to quit his weak position but Makriyannis ignored him. Commodore Gawen Hamilton of the Royal Navy, placed his ships in a position which looked like he would assist in the defence of the city.|$|E

50|$|The {{site was}} {{occupied}} {{during the early}} Mesolithic archaeological period, contemporary with the preboreal and boreal climatic periods. Though the ice age had ended and temperatures were close to modern averages, sea levels had not yet risen sufficiently to separate Britain from continental Europe. Highlights among the finds include; Britain’s oldest structure, 21 red deer stag <b>skull-caps</b> {{that may have been}} head-dresses and nearly 200 projectile, or harpoon, points made of red deer antler. These organic materials are preserved due to burial in waterlogged peat. Normally all that remains on Mesolithic sites are stone tools.|$|R
5000|$|Inhumations: In 1818 workmen cam {{across three}} burials with a {{substantial}} collection of {{items from the}} very end of the Iron Age: knives, spear heads, ornate enamelled helmets, and thick copper <b>skull-caps.</b> The items were recorded at the time, but lost afterwards. There is no scheduled site as the location within the parish was not recorded, although in 2001, Old Castle Down was tentatively identified. Writing in 1925, Mortimer Wheeler described the finds as [...] "the richest and most remarkable of their kind known to have been discovered in Britain".|$|R
60|$|After her the congregation, {{the well-to-do}} {{and the poor}} alike, poured {{out of the church}} and spread in merry groups over the grass: keel boatmen in tow shirts and party-colored worsted belts, the blacksmith, the shoemaker, the farmer of a small plot in the common fields in large cotton pantaloons and light-wove camlet coat, the more favored in <b>skull-caps,</b> linen small-clothes, cotton stockings, and silver-buckled shoes,--every man pausing, dipping into his tabatiere, for a word with his neighbor. The women, too, made a picture strange to our eyes, the matrons in jacket and petticoat, a Madras {{handkerchief}} flung about their shoulders, the girls in fresh cottonade or calamanco.|$|R

These objects are protected by the government. The Namangan region is widely known for its gardens {{and it is also}} famous for a national dress made of [...] "Beqasam" [...] material, a type of silk called atlas and Chust knives, embroidered <b>skull-caps,</b> as well as the curative waters of its sanatoria and resorts, the most popular resort being in the city of Chartak.|$|R
50|$|In {{the deserts}} of the Sudan, in 1881 a {{province}} of Egypt, a man named Muhammad Ahmad, {{who claimed to be}} the long-awaited Mahdi of the Islamic religion, rose up against the Egyptian governors. He and his Arab followers, clad in turbans, <b>skull-caps,</b> white, colorfully patched jibbehs and wielding swords and spears, as well as shields, defeated several Egyptian garrisons. After a short war with Britain, culminating in the Battle of Tel el-Kebir, Egypt had its army officered partly by Englishmen. One of these men, Colonel William Hicks, led an army of 10,000 along the Nile and then into the vast deserts. There, the thirsty square of white-uniformed Egyptians was wiped out by the Mahdi's men, called Dervishes, who now had guns.|$|R
60|$|This is {{the last}} fashion. As for the beards, {{there is no end}} of them; all my friends the artists have beards who can raise them; and Nature, though she has rather stinted the bodies and limbs of the French nation, has been very liberal to them of hair, as you may see by the {{following}} specimen. Fancy these heads and beards under all sorts of caps--Chinese caps, Mandarin caps, Greek <b>skull-caps,</b> English jockey-caps, Russian or Kuzzilbash caps, Middle-age caps (such as are called, in heraldry, caps of maintenance), Spanish nets, and striped worsted nightcaps. Fancy all the jackets you have ever seen, and you have before you, as well as pen can describe, the costumes of these indescribable Frenchmen.|$|R

60|$|A {{change in}} the {{population}} accompanies that in the natural features of the country, Tibetans replacing the Limboos and Khass-tribes of Nepal, who inhabit the lower region. We daily passed parties of ten or a dozen Tibetans, {{on their way to}} Mywa Guola, laden with salt; several families of these wild, black, and uncouth-looking people generally travelling together. The men are middle-sized, often tall, very square-built and muscular; they have no beard, moustache, or whiskers, the few hairs on their faces being carefully removed with tweezers. They are dressed in loose blanket robes, girt about the waist with a leather belt, in which they place their iron or brass pipes, and from which they suspend their long knives, chopsticks, tobacco-pouch, tweezers, tinder-box, etc. The robe, boots, and cap are grey, or striped with bright colours, and they wear <b>skull-caps,</b> and the hair plaited into a pig-tail.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sudah! It is finished!" [...] A {{movement}} {{passed along}} all the heads, the seated bodies swayed to and fro. Lingard had ceased speaking. He remained seated {{for a moment}} looking his audience all over and when he stood up together with Mrs. Travers and Jorgenson the whole assembly rose from the ground together and lost its ordered formation. Some of Belarab's retainers, young broad-faced fellows, wearing a sort of uniform of check-patterned sarongs, black silk jackets and crimson <b>skull-caps</b> set at a rakish angle, swaggered through the broken groups and ranged themselves in two rows before the motionless Daman and his Illanun chiefs in martial array. The members of the council who had left their bench approached the white people with gentle smiles and deferential movements of the hands. Their bearing was faintly propitiatory; only {{the man in the}} big turban remained fanatically aloof, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Grant’s featurettes {{were often}} {{released}} {{on the lower}} half of cinema double-bills with popular European sex films in order to capitalise on the Eady Levy tax situation, for example the Grant produced ‘Just One More Time’ was released as the support feature to a 1977 re-issue of Just Jaeckin’s Emmanuelle (1974), and the Grant directed ‘Sensations’ starring Cosey Fanni Tutti and Genesis P-Orridge was the support feature to Pussy Talk (1975). [...] Described in a 1978 profile in Punch magazine as “a chubby, boyish forty-year-old, with a youthful, uncorrupted face enfolded in two glossy <b>skull-caps</b> of hair and beard”, Grant liked to refer to himself as the ‘King of Porn’, or the ‘King of Sexploitation’, people who worked with him however would come to nickname the bearded, diminutive Grant ‘The Poison Dwarf’ or 'The Gnome'. Grant enjoyed giving himself Hitchcock cameos in his own films, as well as personally supervising the hardcore scenes for his films.|$|R

6000|$|Such was {{the aspect}} of Belarab's {{settlement}} when Lingard set his eyes on {{it for the first}} time. There were all these things, a great number of faces {{at the back of the}} spare and muffled-up figure confronting him, and in the swiftly increasing light a complete stillness that made the murmur of the word [...] "Marhaba" [...] (welcome), pronounced at last by the chief, perfectly audible to every one of his followers. The bodyguards who stood about him in black <b>skull-caps</b> and with long-shafted lances, preserved an impassive aspect. Across open spaces men could be seen running to the waterside. A group of women standing on a low knoll gazed intently, and nothing of them but the heads showed above the unstirring stalks of a maize field. Suddenly within a cluster of empty huts near by the voice of an invisible hag was heard scolding with shrill fury an invisible young girl: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was a tall}} fellow, with {{an olive}} complexion, long dark hair, and very thick bushy {{whiskers}} meeting under his chin. He wore no neckerchief, {{as he had been}} playing rackets all day, and his Open shirt collar displayed their full luxuriance. On his head he wore one of the common eighteenpenny French <b>skull-caps,</b> with a gaudy tassel dangling therefrom, very happily in keeping with a common fustian coat. His legs, which, being long, were afflicted with weakness, graced a pair of Oxford-mixture trousers, made to show the full symmetry of those limbs. Being somewhat negligently braced, however, and, moreover, but imperfectly buttoned, they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a pair of shoes sufficiently down at heel to display a pair of very soiled white stockings. There was a rakish, vagabond smartness, and a kind of boastful rascality, about the whole man, that was worth a mine of gold.|$|R
60|$|The Marquis did {{the honors}} {{of his house}} with the urbanity of his country. In fact, {{he was proud of}} his old family chateau; for part of it was {{extremely}} old. There was a tower and chapel that had been built almost before the memory of man; but the rest was more modern; the castle having been nearly demolished during the wars of the League. The Marquis dwelt upon this event with great satisfaction, and seemed really to entertain a grateful feeling towards Henry IV., for having thought his paternal mansion worth battering down. He had many stories to tell of the prowess of his ancestors, and several <b>skull-caps,</b> helmets, and cross-bows to show; and divers huge boots and buff jerkins, that had been worn by the Leaguers. Above all, there was a two-handled sword, which he could hardly wield; but which he displayed as a proof that there had been giants in his family.|$|R
60|$|This {{singular}} request {{produced an}} old man in a black <b>skull-cap,</b> unable to walk, who was carried up by a couple of bearers and deposited in the room near the door. Mr. Bucket immediately got rid of the bearers, mysteriously shut the door, and bolted it.|$|E
60|$|No Chinese lad {{of tender}} and beatable years was Ah Kim. His was the store of Ah Kim Company, and {{his was the}} {{achievement}} of building it up through the long years from the shoestring of savings of a contract coolie labourer to a bank account in four figures and a credit that was gilt edged. An even half-century of summers and winters had passed over his head, and, in the passing, fattened him comfortably and snugly. Short of stature, his full front was as rotund as a water-melon seed. His face was moon- faced. His garb was dignified and silken, and his black-silk <b>skull-cap</b> with the red button atop, now, alas! fallen on the ground, was the <b>skull-cap</b> worn by the successful and dignified merchants of his race.|$|E

"But {{undoubtedly}} the grand summary of Entepfuhl child's culture, where as in a funnel its manifold influences were concentrated and simultaneously poured down on us, was the annual Cattle-fair. Here, assembling {{from all the}} four winds, came the elements of an unspeakable hurry-burly. Nut-brown maids and nut-brown men, all clear-washed, loud-laughing, bedizened and beribanded; who came for dancing, for treating, and if possible, for happiness. Topbooted Graziers from the North; Swiss Brokers, Italian Drovers, also topbooted, from the South; these with their subalterns in leather jerkins, leather <b>skull-caps,</b> and long ox-goads; shouting in half-articulate speech, amid the inarticulate barking and bellowing. Apart stood Potters from far Saxony, with their crockery in fair rows; Nurnberg Pedlers, in booths that to me seemed richer than Ormuz bazaars; Showmen from the Lago Maggiore; detachments of the Wiener Schub (Offscourings of Vienna) vociferously superintending games of chance. Ballad-singers brayed, Auctioneers grew hoarse; cheap New Wine (heuriger) flowed like water, still worse confounding the confusion; and high over all, vaulted, in ground-and-lofty tumbling, a particolored Merry-Andrew, like {{the genius of the}} place and of Life itself.|$|R
60|$|One is {{obliged to}} come back to the old disagreeable {{comparison}} of Ireland. Athens may be about as wealthy a place as Carlow or Killarney--the streets swarm with idle crowds, the innumerable little lanes flow over with dirty little children, they are playing and puddling about in the dirt everywhere, with great big eyes, yellow faces, and the queerest little gowns and <b>skull-caps.</b> But in the outer man, the Greek has far the advantage of the Irishman: most of them are well and decently dressed (if five-and-twenty yards of petticoat may not be called decent, what may?), they swagger to and fro with huge knives in their girdles. Almost all the men are handsome, but live hard, it is said, in order to decorate their backs with those fine clothes of theirs. I have seen but two or three handsome women, and these had the great drawback which is common to the race--I mean, a sallow, greasy, coarse complexion, at which it was not advisable to look too closely.|$|R
60|$|I do not {{remember}} any one event of our life more exciting than that attempted burglary of which I have spoken. In a city where the police gave their best attention to political offenders, there were naturally a great many rogues, and the Venetian rogues, if not distinguished for the more heroic crimes, were very skillful in what I may call the genre branch of robbing rooms through open windows, and committing all kinds of safe domestic depredations. It was judged best to acquaint Justice (as they call law in Latin countries) with the attempt upon our property, and I found her officers housed {{in a small room}} of the Doge's Palace, clerkly men in velvet <b>skull-caps,</b> driving loath quills over the rough official paper of those regions. After an exchange of diplomatic courtesies, the commissary took my statement of the affair down in writing, pertinent to which were my father's name, place, and business, with a full and satisfactory personal history of myself down to the period of the attempted burglary. This, I said, occurred one morning about daylight, when I saw the head of the burglar peering above the window-sill, and the hand of the burglar extended to prey upon my wardrobe.|$|R
