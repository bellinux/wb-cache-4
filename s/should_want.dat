25|$|The {{story is}} told by two {{alternating}} first person narrators. One of them is Roy Hubert Straitley, a 65-year-old Classics master who has devoted all his life to St Oswald's and who now, {{nearing the end of}} his professional career, finds himself the last surviving member of the dying breed of classics teachers. The other narrator is the perpetrator, whose identity is only revealed in the final part of the book, and whose plotting the reader is able to follow first hand. Time and again, flashbacks detail the second narrator's childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, thus giving a fully rounded picture of a deranged mind and explaining why someone <b>should</b> <b>want</b> to demolish a school's reputation and do harm to members of the staff.|$|E
25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they <b>should</b> <b>want.</b> Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after being}} appointed, he {{outlined}} {{his views on}} social security: [...] "Every party <b>should</b> <b>want</b> to see welfare spending come down.

2500|$|There is {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} regarding whether vos Savant's formulation of the problem, as presented in Parade magazine, is asking {{the first or second}} question, and whether this difference is significant (Rosenhouse 2009). Behrends (2008) concludes that [...] "One must consider the matter with care to see that both analyses are correct"; {{which is not to say}} that they are the same. One analysis for one question, another analysis for the other question. Several discussants of the paper by (Morgan et al. 1991), whose contributions were published alongside the original paper, strongly criticized the authors for altering vos Savant's wording and misinterpreting her intention (Rosenhouse 2009). One discussant (William Bell) considered it a matter of taste whether or not one explicitly mentions that (under the standard conditions), which door is opened by the host is independent of whether or not one <b>should</b> <b>want</b> to switch.|$|E
2500|$|Sharp used {{to treat}} poor Londoners at his house. One night, he was asked for help by a slave who had been beaten by his owner. Sharp treated the man but also {{discussed}} the case with his brother, Granville Sharp. The man was called Jonathan Strong {{and he had been}} so badly beaten that he was blind and required four months of treatment at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Sharp met the expense of Strong's recovery and arranging his employment with a pharmacist. However, two years later, while Strong was serving as a footman on the pharmacist's coach, he was seen by his owner, David Lisle, who sold him to a Jamaican planter and had him kidnapped. Strong got a message to Granville Sharp, who immediately took the matter up with the Lord Mayor of London, who called a hearing and declared Strong to be now free. Lisle challenged Granville Sharp to a duel, but he declined, later explaining [...] "David Lisle, Esquire, (a man of the law) called on me to demand gentlemanlike satisfaction. I told him that as he had studied the law so many years, he <b>should</b> <b>want</b> no satisfaction that the law could give him." [...] The English courts ultimately sided with the Sharp brothers, denying an application that they should pay Lisle two hundred pounds in damages for taking another man's property. From this encounter, Sharp's younger brother Granville went on to become an early advocate for the abolition of slavery and remained so for fifty years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{developers}} considered having GLaDOS and Chell act as [...] "buddy cops {{against a}} new threat", but felt that since Chell never talked, {{it would not}} work. He compared her transformation into a potato and having her power stripped away to the game Jenga: [...] "You’re taking stuff off the bottom and seeing what happens." [...] While {{she was in the}} potato form, the designers noticed a [...] "very stark difference between this imperious, all-powerful GLaDOS talking to you, and this powerless GLaDOS talking to you on your gun". They found that play testers were not interested in her when she was powerless and insulting players and would question why they were [...] "carting this person along". They decided to give her a personality shift and become Chell's [...] "sidekick" [...] on the basis that [...] "she can’t just be needling you for a half hour". In order to keep players from feeling that they <b>should</b> <b>want</b> to abandon GLaDOS in her powerless form to prevent her from becoming powerful again, the designers made sure to give players reason to bring her with them. In considering the interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, Erik Johnson compared GLaDOS to [...] "a jealous ex-girlfriend", noting [...] " [...] the only person she can have interaction with, but the problem is her only way of interacting with anyone is to test them". While they introduced new characters into the game, the focus of the story in Portal 2 remained the connection and interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, and focuses more on the fallout from Chell's destruction of GLaDOS from the first game.|$|E
