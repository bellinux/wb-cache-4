The consistency of maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators.

Since Pareto data sets are non-normal distributions, {{they must be}} transformed to normal distributions with a constant variance.

30|$|The use of {{two-dimensional}} <b>shape</b> <b>parameters</b> {{to characterize}} abrasive particles {{is a potential}} approach to express their angularity.

This work compares the applicability of two-dimensional <b>shape</b> <b>parameters</b> in describing severe wear of metals in recent pin abrasion tests with cases where {{they could have been}} correlated with the wear rates. Considering these aspects, this work puts in evidence the importance of clogging occurrence and the coated paper structure for a carefully application of <b>shape</b> <b>parameters.</b> In addition, it is proposed a possible relation between the <b>shape</b> <b>parameters</b> and one of the components of the abrasion factor.|$|R

Taking traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) -Rhizoma Corydalis as an example, the chromatographic retention <b>parameters</b> and peak <b>shape</b> <b>parameters</b> of 24 compounds were studied. After recognition of each peak under five different linear gradient conditions, the binary parameters equation was established to calculate the retention parameters on ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with 2. 1 mm i. d. column packed with 1. 7 mu m particles. And further retention times under other binary gradient conditions were predicted. The largest relative error of predicted retention time for each compound in R. Corydalis was 0. 75 %. The exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) model and automatic peak curve-fitting method were used to resolve the overlapping peaks, to calculate the peak <b>shape</b> <b>parameters</b> and to obtain the peak shape rules. The peak <b>shape</b> <b>parameters</b> sigma, tau and W(h/ 2) possessed the linear relationship with the equivalent retention time t(R) (*).
