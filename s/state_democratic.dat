5|$|<b>State</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party leaders accused Daniels and the Republicans {{of passing}} {{controversial}} legislation only to enhance Daniels' image {{so he could}} seek the presidency.

5|$|After graduation, Johnson {{purchased}} half-ownership of The Anderson News {{and served}} as the paper's editor and publisher. In 1925, Shelton M. Saufley asked Johnson {{to enter into a}} joint venture to purchase the Richmond Daily Register. Lured by the idea of publishing a daily paper, Johnson accepted. As a result of one of his editorials, Johnson was named executive secretary of the <b>State</b> <b>Democratic</b> Central Committee in 1932. He continued to hold this position and publish the Register through 1939.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{rather than}} take a job with Roosevelt's {{administration}} in Albany, Howe remained in New York City to prepare for Roosevelt's 1932 presidential run. During this period, he worked closely with James Farley, chairman of the New York <b>State</b> <b>Democratic</b> Committee and another devoted Roosevelt supporter. Roosevelt would later publicly credit the pair with being {{the two men who}} had done the most to secure his election.|$|E

5|$|As Democrats {{took control}} of the House in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned <b>state</b> <b>Democratic</b> leaders against the senator. At the <b>state</b> <b>Democratic</b> convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party.|$|E
5|$|Becoming {{popular among}} the party {{leadership}} during his {{two years as}} commissioner, Minton was encouraged by party leaders {{to run for the}} United States Senate in 1934. At the <b>state</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party Convention he ran against Earl Peters, {{a former chairman of the}} state party. With the support of McNutt, Minton won the nomination on the third ballot with 827 votes to Peters' 586.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1940, Johnson was {{a member}} of the <b>State</b> <b>Democratic</b> National Committee, serving until 1948. On June 6, 1942, he was named to the board of regents of Eastern State College (now Eastern Kentucky University or EKU), a {{position}} he held for eight years. EKU's Keen Johnson Building, a 1939 Works Progress Administration project, was named in honor of him. The building and its clock tower is one of the most recognizable landmarks on the university's campus.|$|E

5|$|In March 1875 and a {{year later}} in March 1876, he was {{appointed}} by Governor John Jeremiah Jacob and the West Virginia Board of Public Works as a director for the West Virginia Hospital for the Insane in Weston.

5|$|Marshall {{remained}} {{active in}} the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping on behalf of other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state. His speeches were noted for their partisanship, but his rhetoric gradually shifted away from a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s {{as he began to}} identify himself with the growing progressive movement. He {{became a member of the}} <b>state</b> <b>Democratic</b> Central Committee in 1904, a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party.|$|E

5|$|The {{week before}} the 2006 New York <b>State</b> <b>Democratic</b> Convention, Brown was {{described}} as a political confidant of Democratic New York Attorney General candidate Andrew Cuomo.

He was noted as (along with Charles Rangel) one of the important black political leaders that Cuomo courted on his road to victory.|$|E
5|$|Tillman spoke {{widely in}} the state in 1885 and after, and soon {{attracted}} allies, including a number of Red Shirt comrades, such as Martin Gary's nephews Eugene B. Gary and John Gary Evans. He sought to mold local farmers' groups into a statewide organization to be a voice for agriculturalists. In April 1886, a convention called by Tillman met in Columbia, the state capital. The goal of {{what became known as the}} Farmer's Association or Farmer's Movement was to control the <b>state</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party from within, and to gain reforms such as the agricultural college. He initially was unsuccessful, though he came within thirty votes of controlling the 1886 <b>state</b> <b>Democratic</b> convention. The lack of success caused Tillman, in late 1887, to announce his retirement from politics, though there was widespread speculation he would soon be back.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Kentucky in 1959, Patton became wealthy {{operating}} coal mines for 20years.

He made an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 1987, but was elected in 1991, serving concurrently as lieutenant governor and secretary of economic development under Governor Brereton Jones.|$|E

5|$|After {{his service}} in the House, Brown took a break from politics, but re-entered the {{political}} arena {{as a candidate for}} governor of Kentucky in 1891. He secured the Democratic nomination in a four-way primary election, then convincingly won the general election over his Republican challenger, Andrew T. Wood. Brown's administration, and the <b>state</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party, were split between gold standard supporters (including Brown) and supporters of the free coinage of silver. Brown's was also the first administration to operate under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, and most of the legislature's time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to the new constitution. Consequently, little of significance was accomplished during Brown's term.|$|E
5|$|As {{his term}} neared expiration, Laffoon removed Ben Johnson {{from his post}} as highway commissioner, {{replacing}} him with Tom Rhea. This move was made in order to groom Rhea {{to be the next}} governor. Due to the influence of Laffoon and Rhea, the Democratic Party again chose a nominating convention in lieu of a primary to choose their gubernatorial candidate. Because Laffoon supporters controlled the <b>state</b> <b>Democratic</b> Central Committee and most of the county political organizations, a convention would favor Laffoon's choice of gubernatorial nominee. The convention was scheduled for May 14, 1935 in Lexington.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, {{like most}} of the New York <b>State</b> <b>Democratic</b> establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton, the United States Senator from New York. This marked a break from his earlier political organization, Grassroots, which supported Barack Obama from the outset. He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano announced that he would attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns. During the New York state September primary elections for state office, The New York Times alleged that Brown was aiding Golisano's attempt to unseat Sam Hoyt in the New York State Assembly.|$|E
