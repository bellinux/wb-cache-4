40|$|Work {{is devoted}} to a {{research}} of spined heat-exchanging pipes that are assumed to use in air-cooler exchangers (ACE). The proposed new geometry of finning allows intensifying heat exchange and improving the efficiency of air coolers. It {{is caused by the}} increased area of finned surface with a value of finning ratio (the ratio of the area of the smooth pipe to a finned one) to 42. 7, while in the commercially available ACE, the figure is 22. Besides, the geometrical arrangement of the pin fins turbulizes the airflow. It should be mentioned that an easier method of manufacturing of heat exchanging pipes is proposed to use, which will reduce their costs. The proposed heat exchange pipes are made by winding cut aluminum strip to the supporting pipe or stretching stamped blanks on it. To increase the efficiency of the heat exchange <b>surface</b> <b>pin</b> fins should be as thin and long as possible; however, their strength should be sufficient for deformation-free operation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{location}} of the temporal horn is important to neurosurgeons during procedures such as amygdalohippocampectomy and intraventricular electrode placement for temporal lobe seizure monitoring. However, sometimes the temporal horn is difficult to localize, especially without neuronavigation. The authors aimed to better localize this structure using superficial anatomic landmarks. METHODS: Twenty-two brain halves were dissected from the midline, and the fornix identified and followed toward {{the left and right}} temporal horns. Once the temporal horn was isolated from a mesial approach, 6 -cm long needles were placed into its anterior and posterior walls of the temporal horn and passed laterally from the axial plane to the cortical <b>surface.</b> <b>Pin</b> exit sites were marked externally and measurements taken between the outer temporal lobe cortex and the underlying temporal horn. RESULTS: No statistical differences were noted between left and right sides. The temporal horn was generally directed anteroinferiorly and best marked externally by the inferior temporal sulcus. The mean length of the temporal horn was 4. 4 cm. Mean distance from anterior temporal tip to anterior wall of the temporal horn was 3. 3 cm. The mean distance from the anterior temporal tip to the posterior wall of the temporal horn was 7 cm. The anterior wall of the temporal horn was a mean of 3 mm superior to the inferior temporal sulcus. The posterior wall was a mean of 1. 2 cm superior to the inferior temporal sulcus. CONCLUSIONS: These landmarks and measurements may help neurosurgeons better localize this part of the lateral ventricular system...|$|E
40|$|Shoot apical meristems produce organs in {{a highly}} stereotypic pattern that {{involves}} auxin. Auxin {{is supposed to be}} actively transported from cell to cell by influx (AUXIN/LIKE AUXIN proteins) and efflux (PIN-FORMED proteins) membrane carriers. Current hypotheses propose that, at the meristem <b>surface,</b> <b>PIN</b> proteins create patterns of auxin gradients that, in turn, create patterns of gene expression and morphogenesis. These hypotheses are entirely based on work in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To verify whether these models also apply to other species, we studied the behavior of PIN proteins during maize (Zea mays) development. We identified two novel putative orthologs of AtPIN 1 in maize and analyzed their expression pattern during development. The expression studies were complemented by immunolocalization studies using an anti-AtPIN 1 antibody. Interestingly, the maize proteins visualized by this antibody are almost exclusively localized in subepidermal meristematic layers. Both tassel and ear were characterized by a compact group of cells, just below the surface, carrying PIN. In contrast to or to complement what was shown in Arabidopsis, these results point to the importance of internally localized cells in the patterning process. We chose the barren inflorescence 2 (bif 2) maize mutant to study the role of auxin polar fluxes in inflorescence development. In severe alleles of bif 2, the tassel and the ear present altered ZmPIN 1 a and ZmPIN 1 b protein expression and localization patterns. In particular, the compact groups of cells in the tassel and ear of the mutant were missing. We conclude that BIF 2 is important for PIN organization and could {{play a role in the}} establishment of polar auxin fluxes in maize inflorescence, indirectly modulating the process of axillary meristem formation and development...|$|E
40|$|Reconfigurable antennas have {{recently}} formed a popular research topic. They are attracting {{the interest of}} many industry professionals. This is basically due to the growing demands for more functionality while occupying the same or even smaller physical volume. Using various antennas for wireless applications is no longer effective because having several antennas take too much space. Reconfigurable antennas are the best solution to provide a better performance in terms of flexibility, efficiency and combination of several electromagnetic spectrum applications. Frequency selective surfaces are exploited in many communication applications, especially in designing reconfigurable antennas due {{to their ability to}} control the electromagnetic field. A frequency selective surface is an important figure concept in reconfigurable antenna structures and has developed rapidly due to their unique properties in suppressing the surface wave propagation. The main topic of this research is to design new reconfigurable radiation pattern antennas with enhanced performance by using switchable frequency selective surfaces. The antenna consists of a central radiating source surrounded by switchable frequency selective surface unit cells to give the antenna beam, shaping capability to scan 360 degree in the azimuth plane. Novel switchable frequency selective surface unit cells with various structures are designed and their characteristics are compared in both the reflective and transparent states. The reconfigurable response is the basic concept in the antenna design. This is achieved by adding PIN diodes to the lines that will connect or disconnect the unit cells and transform the frequency selective surface to be either a reflective or a transparent surface. As a consequence, switching the frequency selective <b>surface</b> <b>PIN</b> diodes leads to control the antenna beam direction. In this thesis, two novel reconfigurable antennas with frequency selective surface unit cells are presented, each antenna works at a different frequency band. The switchable frequency selective surface utilized in the proposed antennas operates at different frequency bands. The research topic in this thesis includes investigations and techniques to increase the bandwidth and improve the radiation characteristics of the reconfigurable antennas by using new switchable frequency selective surface unit cells. Experimental results show the preference of the proposed antennas over those presented in the literature. Thus, two new reconfigurable antennas are implemented and their enhanced performances in terms of bandwidth are proven...|$|E

The so-called <b>surface</b> <b>pinning</b> parameter, directly correlated with the surface anisotropy energy, plays a fundamental role in determining the character of an SWR spectrum in the theory of SWR based on the surface inhomogeneity model. Here we extend the theory of SWR by introducing a new formula representing the <b>surface</b> <b>pinning</b> parameter as a series of contributions from different anisotropies existing in (Ga,Mn) As thin films. We show how to determine the coefficients in this series by comparing the SWR theory with data obtained in a resonance experiment. The proposed procedure allows to determine the proportion with which each type of the anisotropy contributes to the total surface anisotropy of (Ga,Mn) As, and, consequently, to assess to what extent the proportions on the surface differ from those in the bulk. The presented considerations can be used for the study of any other thin-film system, since we provide also a general rule that allows to express the <b>surface</b> <b>pinning</b> parameter of a thin film, as well as its surface anisotropy energy, by the free energy of the considered thin-film system.
