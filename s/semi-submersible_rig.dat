40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringIn a {{few years}} {{there will be a}} {{significant}} increase in wells that need to be permanently plugged and abandoned (PP&A). Statoil operates around 500 subsea wells on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (N. C. S), whilst there exist around 5000 subsea wells worldwide. Some older wells could be extremely challenging to plug, since abandonment requirements were not taken fully into account when the wells were planned, drilled and completed. In later years new requirements have also been implemented for plug and abandonment. Statoil has now increased focus on Plug and Abandonment (P&A), this Thesis is written by request by Statoil. Due to continuing high oil prices, new field discoveries and general optimism in the market, there is currently a shortage of conventional <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>rigs.</b> The future demand for more <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>rigs</b> or other alternatives is likely. For a permanent plug and abandonment operation the main goals are to complete the operation of the well in a safe and cost-effective manner. In this context it is anticipated that some wells could be abandoned in the future solely by a monohull Riserless Light Well Intervention vessel (RLWI). The day rate of a RLWI vessel is significantly less expensive than for an ordinary rig. Traditionally, P&A on subsea wells are intervened by <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>rigs</b> with marine risers. To perform the P&A operation from a RLWI vessel, the development of new technology to overcome some challenges is required. The main challenges demanding new technology identified today includes how to establish the primary and secondary barriers in wells which contain control lines attached to the tubing, and/or wells where the outer barrier element, i. e. the casing cement, is either not verified, not present or in poor condition, and the possibility to remove the tubing and placement of the barrier. The scope of work for this Thesis has been to show that the final plug and abandonment operations that are conventionally being performed using <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>rigs</b> can be performed entirely from a RLWI vessel. The focus has been on equipment and methods to manage to execute the operation. The P&A operation is premised executed with required barriers in place during entire operation and for less cost than for a rig. The Thesis will identify the gaps in technology, attempting to identify status and propose possible solutions, look into the possibility to use Coiled Tubing on a light well intervention without a marine riser, and operations and weather analysis behaviour of <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>rigs</b> and RLWI vessels. This Master Thesis will describe how {{it would be possible to}} perform a final plug and abandonment job using a RLWI vessel, and address further technology development needed for RWLI P&A operations. The new operation would lead to more cost efficient P&A operations for subsea wells. The <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>rigs</b> can thus focus on drilling and completion of new wells and thus increase the efficiency of the total well cycle of well planning, well construction and P&A, and thereby increase the revenue for the operating companies...|$|R

40|$|Normally design bottom {{slamming}} {{pressure of}} semi-submersible type floater is determined {{in a simple}} way using a relative speed obtained from an air-gap analysis.

In this study, to investigate the slamming pressure {{on the bottom of}} <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>rig,</b> a simplified deformable stiffened plate with 0 ˚ dead rise angle is simulated by using nonlinear FEM software, LS-DYNA which can take the influence of Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) into account. To simulate the slamming condition of semi-rig in a similar way, water hitting the structure with fixed boundary conditions is proposed. Various parametric studies are carried out to examine the effect of structural flexibility, coupling stiffness, mesh size, velocity, stiffener size, and air cushion effect. To further investigate the effect of horizontal velocity, the model is expanded and simulated with various horizontal water velocities. Pressure response on the plate by the coupling of fluid and structure is studied and the hydroelastic effect of each parameter is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{handling}} of oil recovery projects {{has become more}} important as the biggest and least complicated oil fields have been exploited. As exploitation of smaller or more complex oil fields are not as obviously profitable, the need for describing {{the risk of the}} recovery projects have become more apparent. In this thesis the uncertainties of the reservoir, expenses, oil prices and more are combined to produce joint risk profiles. The uncertainties may be studied at several levels. Production profile, income profile,expenses profiles. An application that produces distributions for net present value, internal rate of return, capital efficiency, and profiles for cash flow, oil recovery, oil prices, income and various expenses, has been developed. The input needed for the simulations are stochastic variables that are available at the early stages of an oil recovery project. Defining distributions for each stochastic variable, you are able to study the effect that various variables have on the results. Changing exploitation plan from a <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>rig</b> to a drilling ship, greatly decreases capital expenses and abandonment expenses. In turn, the maximum processing capacity drops and field operation time increases, reducing the net present value...|$|E
40|$|Semi-submersible rigs are {{utilized}} to perform drilling, production and intervention {{operations in the}} oil and gas industry. The design of the rigs is a complex task which today is highly dependent on manual iteration and experience. In this thesis, the prospect of using optimization methods to establish the main dimensions of the hull was investigated. A nonlinear optimization model which minimizes the hull weight was developed taking the most important properties of the <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>rig</b> such as stability, motion characteristics and air gap into account. The model was solved in Microsoft Excel to enhance the availability and make it easier to implement for engineers with solid experience using the software. The add-in algorithms solved the model in matter of minutes and the output was compared to other rigs operating in the North Sea. The results were verified by experienced engineers in Aker Solutions and were found feasible and interesting. Based on the results from the computational study and the sensitivity analysis performed, it is concluded that the model {{can be used as a}} decision support tool to establish the main dimensions of the hull structure. </p...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the lay-up {{decision in the}} North Sea offshore rig market from 2010 through march 2017. Using empirical analysis, we have specified a logistic regression model to investigate how rig characteristics, firm size and market variables affect the decision to both cold- and ready-stack a jackup or a <b>semi-submersible</b> <b>rig.</b> We find that that younger jackups with deep water depth owned by companies with multiple rigs in the North Sea, {{are less likely to}} be laid up. In a period with varying market conditions, a higher value of the rig characteristics variable deck load, quarters capacity and blow out preventer (BOP), as well as the specification severe environment, increase the probability of laying up a jackup. For semi-submersibles, we find that younger rigs with a higher value of max water depth and quarters capacity, equipped with self-propulsion, DP- 3 system and classified for severe environment, were less likely to be laid up. While a higher value of variable deck load increased the likelihood of cold-stacking a semi-submersible. The regression results show that a higher day rate and expectations for a higher future oil price strongly decrease the likelihood for both jackups and semi-submersibles being laid up. The thesis supplements the existing literature of the offshore rig market. To our knowledge, no economical investigation regarding the lay-up decision have been carried out on the North Sea offshore rig market. This thesis therefore provides a basis for further research of this market. We hope the findings will be of interest for drilling operators when deciding which rig to send into lay-up. In addition, the findings may be of interest for brokers and banks when evaluating rig companies...|$|E
