60|$|First of {{all they}} <b>stove</b> the <b>heads</b> {{of two of}} the great powder barrels, and they heaped the {{contents}} out upon the table and floor. They piled it round and under the three drunken men, until each sprawled in a heap of it. Then they carried Sharkey to the gun and they triced him sitting over the port-hole, with his body about a foot from the muzzle. Wriggle as he would he could not move an inch either to right or left, and the dumb man trussed him up with a sailor's cunning, so that there was no chance that he should work free.|$|R
60|$|The two captors {{had their}} plans all arranged, {{and they were}} {{somewhat}} elaborate. First of all they <b>stove</b> the <b>heads</b> {{of two of the}} great powder barrels, and they heaped the contents out upon the table and floor. They piled it round and under the three drunken men, until each sprawled in a heap of it. Then they carried Sharkey to the gun and they triced him sitting over the port-hole, with his body about a foot from the muzzle. Wriggle as he would he could not move an inch either to the right or left, and the dumb man trussed him up with a sailor's cunning, so that there was no chance that he should work free.|$|R
60|$|When we {{had done}} all {{we could do to}} make things safe, he {{disappeared}} into his galley. Some time afterward, going forward for a look round, I caught sight of him through the open door. He sat upright on the locker in front of the <b>stove,</b> with his <b>head</b> leaning back against the bulkhead. His eyes were closed; his capable hands held open the front of his thin cotton shirt baring tragically his powerful chest, which heaved in painful and laboured gasps. He didn't hear me.|$|R
5000|$|Well {{known in}} the area, and {{sometimes}} referred to as the [...] "Hermit of Grape Island" [...] (a reference he hated), Lewis Kilborn continued to live on the island much like earlier generations had, collecting rain for his water supply, heating his house with a wood <b>stove,</b> fishing, and <b>heading</b> into town in his boat for groceries. He listened to the world's events through a transistor radio and would read any and all books and newspapers that friends and relatives would bring him. He died in March 1984.|$|R

After a long chase the Little Tramp manages to knock the bully {{unconscious}} by dropping a heavy <b>stove</b> on his <b>head</b> from an upstairs window. On returning to his beat on Easy Street the unruly mob knock the Little Tramp unconscious and drop him into a nearby cellar where he manages to save the aforementioned beautiful young woman from a nasty drug addict after accidentally sitting on the drug addict's needle. Supercharged by the effects of the drug he takes on the mob and heroically defeats them all and as a consequence restores peace and order to Easy Street.|$|R
60|$|It {{was some}} time later when the wagon stopped with a jerk, and she roused herself as a glare of light shone about her. Voices came out of it, {{somebody}} held out a hand, and a man whom she did not recognize lifted her from the wagon. Then she walked unevenly into the brightness of a log-walled hall and grew faint, while a tingling pain ran through her with the change of temperature. A woman whom {{she did not know}} clumsily took her wrappings from her, and then led her into a room where Seaforth drew a chair up to a table beside the <b>stove.</b> Alice Deringham's <b>head</b> was throbbing, but she {{could see that he was}} white and haggard.|$|R
60|$|From {{that hour}} Trafford mended. He {{remained}} clear-minded, helpful, sustaining. His face healed daily. Marjorie {{had had to}} cut away great fragments of gangrenous frozen flesh, and he was clearly destined to have a huge scar over forehead and cheek, but in that pure, clear air, once the healing had begun it progressed swiftly. His leg had set, a little shorter than its fellow and with a lump {{in the middle of}} the shin, but it promised to be a good serviceable leg none the less. They examined it by the light of the <b>stove</b> with their <b>heads</b> together, and discussed when it would be wise to try it. How do doctors tell when a man may stand on his broken leg? She had a vague impression you must wait six weeks, but she could not remember why she fixed upon that time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] resumed Silver, [...] "here it is. You give us {{the chart}} to get the {{treasure}} by, and drop shooting poor seamen and <b>stoving</b> of their <b>heads</b> in while asleep. You do that, and we'll offer you a choice. Either you come aboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then I'll give you my affy-davy, upon my word of honour, to clap you somewhere safe ashore. Or if that ain't to your fancy, some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing, then you can stay here, you can. We'll divide stores with you, man for man; and I'll give my affy-davy, as before to speak the first ship I sight, and send 'em here to pick you up. Now, you'll own that's talking. Handsomer you couldn't look to get, now you. And I hope"--raising his voice--"that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to one is spoke to all." ...|$|R
50|$|There is much sameness in {{the history}} of these estates. Khamboi may be taken as a representative. In 1400 (S. 1456-57) an army under Prince Ahmed Shah I, the founder of Ahmedabad, marched against the Solanki chieftains of Kalrigad, two to three miles {{north-east}} of Becharaji. The fight was long and hard, but in the end the Solanki chieftains Tejmalji, Sarangji, and Vejroji were slain and the fortress stormed. On the victor's side, forty-two nobles among them Moghal Ali Khan, 1300 men, and seventeen elephants were slain. The descendants of the Kalrigad Solankis settled in different places. They went to different places such as Khemat, Virpur, Rupavatinagari, Sagvada and Dharampur. When Vejroji fell his wife Anopbai, a Devri Rajput of the Sirohi stock, being pregnant, fled with 125 horse and many followers, of whom the chief were, Sukhra Virchand the minister, Harivalab a goldsmith, Vasram a barber, Vela a potter, and Dudo the family priest. They fled to the Oghar forest, which stretched for miles round where Oghar Thali now stands, and there founded a village, calling it Dudosan afterDudo, the family priest. Sukhra Virchand the minister built a well, and to the east of the village a temple of Mahadev. Rani Anopbai also built a well and gave birth to a son called Venidas, who, when he grew up, gathered 300 horsemen, and, under the name of Mohologi, took to a life of plunder. When he had laid waste some forty-two villages, the village headmen, with lighted <b>stoves</b> on their <b>heads</b> in token of submission, besought Ahmad Shah, who was now on the throne, for aid. Ahmad Shah sent an army to Dudosan, where, with their hands bound in token of submission, Sukhra Virchand, Dudo, Agra the headman, and others came to meet them. Ahmad Shah ordered them to produce Venidas and they did so, but to hide his origin passed him off as a Koli Thakor. Ahmad Shah forced him to marry Ratanbai, daughter of a Koli Thakor of Tervada, and then gave him the twelve villages of Dudosan, Rakhol, Kharu, Sangla, Akhin, Mahasan, Lodhi, Jalia, Charada, Kalodhi, Vadiu, and Valodu. Ahmad Shah granted these villages in gift, and a copper plate deed and a writing, in the bard Anchla's book, were drawn up.|$|R
