40|$|So far four {{randomized}} studies, {{three of}} them double-blind and placebo-controlled, have investigated the role of bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) {{in the treatment of}} travelers' diarrhea. When compared with placebo BSS significantly reduced the number of unformed stools and increased the proportion of patients free of symptoms {{at the end of the}} trial. In the two studies that compared BSS with loperamide, the latter agent brought significantly faster relief. Diarrhea accompanied by dysenteric symptoms was influenced most favorably by administration of systemic antimicrobial agents. In all four studies only minor adverse effects were noted with BSSor the other active agents. One may include loperamide and a <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> in one's travel kit; however, loperamide should not be used for dysentery, and the antimicrobial agent should not be used in uncomplicated cases.

40|$|Abstract Eczema is {{a chronic}} {{relapsing}} atopic dermatitis (AD) associated with pruritus, sleep disturbance and poor {{quality of life}} of the patient. Treatment of eczema includes use of emollient, topical and <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents,</b> corticosteroid or immunomodulating agents. Many patients also seek alternative treatments such as dietary avoidance, supplementation or both. This article reviews the basic pathophysiology of eczema and clinical trials involving Chinese medicine in the treatment of eczema. Research reports on Chinese herbal medicine for eczema were retrieved from PubMed and the Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews for this review. Only a few RCTs demonstrated the efficacy (or lack of efficacy) of Chinese medicinal herbs in treating atopic eczema. Further larger scale trials are warranted. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} the indication of <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> used by dental professionals {{for treatment of}} patients affected by periodontal diseases. Methods: Interviews by a questionnaire were held with 225 professionals of different dental specialties and who performed periodontal treatment. Results: Among interviewees, 94 % indicated systemic antibiotics {{as a form of}} periodontal disease treatment. Their main indication was for periodontal abscesses (80 %) followed by aggressive periodontitis (62 %) and necrotizing diseases (45 %). The most frequently used antibiotics were amoxicillin (81 %) and metronidazole (57 %). The medications were indicated in association with mechanical therapy by 67 % of the professionals. As regards the occasion of indication, 60 % indicated systemic antibiotic therapy before and after mechanical periodontal scaling and root planing. Seventy-eight percent of the professionals indicated antibiotics associated with periodontal surgery for access to scaling, and 76 % indicated it before and after the surgical procedure. Among the interviewees, 99 % took into account systemic involvement for drug administration. Conclusions: It was concluded that a considerable portion of professionals indicate systemic antibiotic-therapy in an incoherent manner and in situations {{in which there is no}} indication for antibiotic use, or with ineffective protocols...|$|R
40|$|Although {{conventional}} antimicrobial {{drugs have}} been viewed as miraculous cure-alls for the past 80 years, increasing antimicrobial drug resistance requires a major and rapid intervention. However, the development of novel but still conventional <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents,</b> having only a single mode or site of action, will not alleviate the situation because it is probably {{only a matter of}} time until any such agents will also become ineffective. To continue to produce new agents based on this notion is unacceptable, and there is an increasing need for alternative approaches to the problem. By contrast, light-activated molecules called photoantimicrobials act locally via the in-situ production of highly reactive oxygen species, which simultaneously attack various biomolecular sites in the pathogenic target and therefore offer both multiple and variable sites of action. This non-specificity at the target circumvents conventional mechanisms of resistance and inhibits the development of resistance to the agents themselves. Photoantimicrobial therapy is safe and easy to implement and, unlike conventional agents, the activity spectrum of photoantimicrobials covers bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. However, clinical trials of these new, truly broad-spectrum, and minimally toxic agents have been few, and the funding for research and development is almost non-existent. Photoantimicrobials constitute one of the few ways forward through the morass of drug-resistant infectious disease and should be fully explored. In this Personal View, we raise awareness of the novel photoantimicrobial technologies that offer a viable alternative to conventional drugs in many relevant application fields, and could thus slow the pace of resistance development...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} {{etiology of}} gingivitis and periodontitis provides {{the rationale for}} use of adjunctive <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> in the prevention and treatment of periodontal diseases. Although mechanical removal of supra- and subgingival calcified and non-calcified plaque deposits has been proved effective to control the gingival inflammatory lesions {{as well as to}} halt the progression of periodontal attachment loss, some patients may experience additional benefits from the use of <b>systemic</b> or topical <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents.</b> Such agents are able to significantly affect supra- and subgingival plaque accumulation and/or suppress or eradicate periodontal pathogenic microflora. Currently, properly selected local antiseptic and systemic antibiotic therapies can provide periodontal treatment that is generally effective, low-risk and affordable. This paper will briefly review the host-related conditions in which the periodontal preventive and therapeutic approaches may be effectively assisted by a local antimicrobial regimen. Potential future indications for adjunctive local antimicrobial therapy will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Complications {{during the}} life span of an {{artificial}} implant in prosthesis joint implant surgery (arthroplasty) are aspetic biomechanical loosening (ABL) and prosthesis joint infection (PJI). Aseptic loosening is {{the most common cause of}} prosthetic joint failure, followed by infection. It is important to differentiate between these two entities because their management differs. Combination of pre- and peri-operative diagnostic methods is usefull. It is ideal to diagnose or exclude PJI preoperatively to facilitate an appropriate surgical management and initial choice of <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents.</b> At this point preoperative examination of a joint aspirate for cell count and differential as well as for microbiological culture is helpfull for differentiating a septic from an aseptic process. Th e cut-off values for leukocyte count and differential for diagnosing PJI are established and diff er from those applied for native joints. Methods: The pre- and peri-operative cytological joint aspirate examination comprises leukocyte count and differential with PMN % (polimorphonuclear leucocyte). After synovial aspiration the sample is drawn into a lavander blood test tube containing K 2 EDTA solid anticoagulant. Th e examination in the medical laboratory is completed in 1 - 2 hours. Th e gross appearance and a microscopic examination of the sample under 400 xmagnifi cation is sought to assess the cells present in the sample. All samples for the cytological examination are first treated with hyaluronidase solution. Th e leukocytes are counted in the Neubauer’s counting chamber using a leukocyte counting solution (2 – 3 % aq. solgentiana violet in acetic acid). Th e result is expressed in SI units (in 109 /L). Th e differential count is made from a stained smear according to Pappenheim and minimum 200 cells are differentiated. Th e result is exspressed as a percentage of PMN and other types of white blood cells. Conclusion: Pre- and peri-operative joint aspirate cytological examination with leukocyte count and differential is a valuable diagnostic tool for differentiating a prosthesis joint infection from an aseptic loosening. We presume that a reported joint aspirate leukocyte count of > 1. 7 x 109 /L and differential of > 65 % PMN have adequate specificity (88 % and 98 %) and sensitivity (94 % and 97 %) for diagnosing PJI regardless the type of implant. Th e exact values for these diagnostic modalities, defining also NPV (negative predictive value) and PPV (positive predictive value), will be possible after the completion of our study...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Over {{the past}} three decades, gallium {{compounds}} have gained importance in medicine. Radioactive gallium and stable gallium nitrate are used as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in cancer and disorders of calcium and bone metabolism. In addition, gallium compounds have displayed anti inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity in animal models of human diseases. More {{recent studies have shown}} that gallium compounds may also function as <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents.</b> In the review, the potential application of gallium in the future treatment of periodontitis and prevention of tooth loss will be discussed. Gingival inflammation, bacterial infection, alveolar bone destruction and subsequent tooth loss are characteristic features of periodontal disease. Surgical techniques, mechanical debridement of the denuded root surface, and local or <b>systemic</b> application of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> are currently used treatments for periodontitis. However, the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria has prompted a great need for new and alternative treatment methods for infection. Conclusion: The potential anti-periodontitis benefits of gallium are related to eradicating infection due to bacterial biofilms, increasing bone deposition and downregulating unwanted immune responses. Adjunctive use of gallium laser therapy with mechanical instrumentation in combination with gallium-containing gingival gels, toothpastes and mouth rinses may represent the final solutions for tooth loss prevention...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ear swabs were obtained from 362 patients aged 1 to 55 years old with clinically diagnosed otitis externa in Erzurum, Turkey, between January 2006 and April 2007, and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi, using EMB, 5 % sheep's blood, chocolate agar, anaerobic blood agar plate, thioglycollate broth and sabaroud agar using standard microbiological technique to diagnose isolates. RESULTS: 219 cultures were positive {{and a total of}} 267 isolates were obtained. Of the isolates, 68. 16 % (n: 182) were aerobic or facultative bacteria, 1. 12 % (3) were anaerobic bacteria, 30. 71 % (82) were fungi and 17. 5 % (38) were polymicrobial infections. CONCLUSION: Fungal organisms especially Candida species may be isolated from ears of otitis externa patients without fungal infection risk factors such as ear self-cleaning, local antimicrobial, antifungal or corticosteroid drops or <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> or antifungal <b>agents</b> within the preceding week.

Factors other than antimicrobial resistance that promote gastrointestinal colonization by E. faecium have not been identified. We tested {{the ability of a}} colonization-proficient clinical E. faecium isolate (C 68) to transfer colonizing ability to noncolonizing E. faecium recipient strains. Transconjugants derived frommatings that used E. faeciumD 344 SRF as a recipient strain colonizedmouse gastrointestinal tracts in high numbers under selective pressure fromclindamycin or vancomycin, comparedwith control strains that lackedDNA transferred fromC 68. We transferred DNA into a second recipient strain (E. faecium GE- 1), which also colonized mice in significantly greater numbers under selective pressure from clindamycin, compared with a control strain.

Treatment is essential to prevent physical and psychological effects scarring occurred; acne is frequently associated with profound emotional aspects and depression. Although many treatments for acne are available, effective management has become increasingly challenging with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Propionibacterium acnes. Also <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> currently used such as doxycycline and erythromycin to reduce the inflammatory acne they require frequent administration for a long term therapy and some times associated with uncomfortable side effects contributing mainly to a decrease in compliance. Of-late, newer macrolide azithromycin circulated in Sudan market expected to show promising results in this condition due to its unique pharmacokinetic profiles and high thermodynamic properties and penetrative potentials. This study was conducted to evaluate the role of azithromycin in treatment of acne vulgaris. The present study was conducted in Omdurman teaching hospital – department of Dermatology. The main aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the efficacy of oral azithromycin in acne by comparing it with most common therapy used for acne; doxycycline. An opened label randomized comparative study was carried out in (30) patients of moderate to sever acne vulgaris divided them into two groups, group (A) administered azithromycin capsules (15) in a specified and scheduled dose regimen and group (B) administered doxycycline tablets (15) as a usual regimen of therapy. The results obtained from oral azithromycin therapy when compared with oral doxycycline show that statistically there is no difference between the two drugs in response at end of 22 weeks. The overall efficacy rated in terms of reduction of the severity of condition is up to 83 % with azithromycin compared to 50 % with doxycycline In assessment of adverse effects and dropped-out rates the higher dropped- out rate found in doxycycline group (33. 3 %) while only (6. 66 %) for azithromycin group. Also the patients opinion as an outcome measuresmost of them confirm that they feel much better with azithromycin rather than doxycycline. Another minor complementary trial was adopted and we tried a topical formulation of azithromycin emulsion in 10 patients of mildto moderate acne but the results didn’t encourage us to continue due to the skin irritation from the vehicle used. The conclusion from the present study that oralazithromycin provides additionally effective and safe treatment option to the patients,and benefits may be further extended to those patients not responding to available antibiotic therapy. For the topical application of azithromycin the trial suggests that the need for further investigation and larger studies to find out a suitable vehicle and stable formulation for azithromycin to be applied topically and to determine whether it will give any significant results and have any advantages over the currently used topical formulati...|$|R

Etiologic agents are Staphylococcus aureus or Beta-heamolytic Streptococcus group A or combination of these organisms. Adequacy of treatment is related on sensitivity of bacteria to common prescribed antibiotics. Methods: Study of the frequency of bacterial culture results from lesions and antibiograms for four systemic antibiotics cephalexin, erythromycin, cloxacillin and penicillin were assayed. Impetigo cases admitted to the dermatology clinic of Ghaem hospital in Mashhad for one year beginning from June 2001, were studied. These patients had no history of <b>systemic</b> or topical <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> application. Results of antibiograms obtained from culture of skin lesions were analyzed with Chi-Square test. Findings: Twenty two (88 %) patients were younger than 20 years.

Is {{the efficacy of the}} adjunctive <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> therapy dependent {{on the quality of the}} debridement of the subgingival biofilm and the sequence debridement-antibiotic usage? Material and Methods: Relevant papers were searched, critically analysed and their data were extracted. Results: For the first question, studies assessing susceptibility of bacteria in biofilms, and clinical studies evaluating <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> as monotherapy, were reviewed. For the second question, clinical studies comparing <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> as adjuncts to non-surgical debridement or to periodontal surgery and clinical trials using systemic antibiotics with periodontal surgery were evaluated.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine whether MRSP could be found in dogs several months after a clinically apparent infection and whether the length of carriage varied depending on <b>systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> treatment, diagnosis at time of the first positive MRSP culture and the presence of skin disease or wounds. Thirty-one dogs previously diagnosed with a clinical infection were sampled repeatedly for a minimum of eight months or, with the exception of two dogs, until two consecutive negative results were obtained. Five specified locations were sampled, and the results were evaluated to determine future recommendations concerning sample strategies when screening for MRSP carriage. Information was collected from medical records and questionnaires to evaluate factors that may influence length of carriage. Results The overall median length of MRSP carriage was 11 months (48 weeks). The presence of wounds and signs of dermatitis did not influence length of carriage. Systemic treatment for three weeks or longer with <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> to which the bacterium was resistant was associated with prolonged carriage compared to dogs treated for a shorter period of time. Three of five dogs treated with an antimicrobial to which their MRSP-isolates were susceptible (tetracycline) were found to still be MRSP-positive when sampled after the end of treatment. Wound samples had the highest positive MRSP yield (81 %) for the positive sample sites, compared to less than 70 % for each of the other four sample sites. Cultures from the nostrils were less likely to detect MRSP carriage relative to the pharynx, perineum, wounds and the corner of the mouth. Conclusions Dogs can carry MRSP {{for more than a year}} after a clinically apparent infection. <b>Systemic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> treatment of infections with <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> to which the MRSP-bacteria are resistant should be avoided when possible in dogs with possible or confirmed MRSP carriage or infection, since it may prolong time of MRSP carriage.

40|$|Kill-kinetic studies {{often are}} used to {{determine}} the rate and degree of killing of aerobic bacteria by <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents.</b> Few studies, however, make use of this method for determining antimicrobial activity against anaerobic bacteria. To evaluate kill-kinetic studies for anaerobes, kill-kinetic studies were performed for selected <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> against members of the Bacteroides fragilis group and compared with MICs obtained by using a reference agar dilution method and a broth microdilution method. Results of the kill-kinetic studies showed that the degree of killing over a 24 -h test period was related to the MIC for the test organism. In general, the higher the MIC of an <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> for a test organism, the less the killing observed. In addition, these studies demonstrate subtle differences in bactericidal activity at various concentrations of the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents,</b> which cannot be determined by agar or broth dilution methods. Kill-kinetic studies are a useful addition to dilution methods for the evaluation of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> against anaerobes...|$|R

40|$|Background: The protease-antiprotease {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} inflammatory cells and oxidative stress in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) produce {{increased levels of}} proteolytic enzymes (neutrophil elastase, matrix metalloproteinases [MMP]) which contribute to destruction of parenchyma resulting in progressive decline in forced expiratory volume in one second. Doxycycline, a tetracycline analogue, possesses anti-inflammatory properties and inhibits MMP enzymes. Objectives: To assess the effect of 4 weeks doxycycline in a dose of 100 mg once a day in patients of moderate to severe COPD with stable symptoms. Methods : In an interventional, randomized, observer-masked, parallel study design, the effect of doxycycline (100 mg once a day for 4 weeks) was assessed in patients of COPD having stable symptoms after a run-in period of 4 weeks. The study participants in reference group did not receive doxycycline. The parameters were pulmonary functions, systemic inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP), and medical research council (MRC) dyspnea scale. Use of <b>systemic</b> corticosteroids or <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> was not allowed during the study period. Results: A total of 61 patients completed the study (31 patients in doxycycline group and 30 patients in reference group). At 4 weeks, the pulmonary functions significantly improved in doxycycline group and the mean reduction in baseline serum CRP was significantly greater in doxycycline group as compared with reference group. There was no significant improvement in MRC dyspnea scale in both groups at 4 weeks. Conclusion: The anti-inflammatory and MMP-inhibiting property of doxycycline might have contributed to the improvement of parameters in this study...|$|R
