40|$|In {{this paper}} {{particular}} investigation is directed towards the combined effects of {{horizontal and vertical}} motions of real earthquakes to structures resting on <b>sliding</b> <b>base.</b> A simplified method is presented to treat the nonlinear effects of time dependent frictional force of the <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> {{as a function of}} the vertical reaction produced by the foundation. As an example, the El Centro 1940 earthquake record is used on a structural model to show the structural responses due to a <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> with different frictional and stiffness characteristics. The study shows that vertical ground motion does affect both the superstructure response and the base sliding displacement. Nevertheless, the <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> isolator is shown to be effective for the reduction of seismic response of a superstructure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{emphasis}} is placed on the improved dynamic behavior of the infilled frame that results when the frame is mounted on a <b>sliding</b> <b>base.</b> Because the inelastic stiffness of the <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> during the shaking process is difficult to determine analytically, it is determined instead by experiment, on the basis of which an equivalent non-linear foundation model is established. The infilled frame and the equivalent non-linear foundation are then assembled and analyzed by the ADINA program. Experimental and analytical results show that the combined system retains high structural stiffness under normal loading conditions while sustaining a greatly reduced response to base excitation. It is therefore concluded that the adoption of such a system can increase the ability of a building to resist both wind and earthquake loads. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The optimum {{friction}} coefficient of a sliding {{system with a}} restoring force for the minimum acceleration response of a base-isolated structure under earthquake ground motion is investigated. The stochastic model of El-Centro 1940 earthquake which preserves the non-stationary evolution of amplitude and frequency content of the original record {{is used for the}} model of earthquake. The base-isolated structure consists of a linear flexible multi-storey structure supported on the sliding system. The sliding system is modelled to provide a friction force (ideal Coulomb-friction type) and a linear restoring force. The non-stationary stochastic response of the isolated structure is obtained using the time dependent equivalent linearisation technique as the force-deformation behaviour of the sliding system is highly non-linear. The response of the system is analysed for the optimum {{friction coefficient}} of the <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> isolation system. The criterion selected for optimality is the minimisation of the root mean square top floor absolute acceleration. The optimum friction coefficient of sliding isolation system is obtained under important parametric variations such as: period and damping of the superstructure, ratio of the base mass to the superstructure floor mass, the damping ratio of the isolation system, the period of base isolation system and the intensity of earthquake excitation. It has been shown that the above parameters have significant effects on optimum friction coefficient of the <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> isolation system. © Elsevie...|$|E
40|$|Response of {{structures}} {{supported on the}} sliding systems under near-fault earthquake ground motion is investigated. The fault normal and parallel components are applied in two horizontal direction of the system. The superstructure {{is considered to be}} rigid and the frictional forces mobilized at the interface of the sliding system are assumed to be velocity dependent. The interaction between frictional forces of sliding system in two horizontal directions is duly considered and coupled differential equations of motion of the system are solved in the incremental form using step-by-step method with iterations. The iterations are required due to dependence of the frictional forces on the response of the system. The response of the system is analyzed to investigate the performance of sliding systems under near-fault motion. In addition, the effects of velocity dependence and bi-directional interaction of frictional forces on the response of isolated system are also investigated. The response of sliding system due to fault normal and parallel components is found to be more or less uncorrelated and the resultant <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> displacement is mainly contributed by the fault normal component. It is also observed that the dependence of friction coefficient on relative velocity of system does not have noticeable effects on the peak response of the isolated system. However, if the effects of bi-directional interaction of frictional forces are neglected then the <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> displacements under near-fault motion will be underestimated which can be crucial from design point of view. © Elsevie...|$|E

The {{objective of the}} study is to identify the key system parameters that lead to significant torsional coupling in sliding base-isolated structures. The analysis procedure adopted can capture the highly nonlinear behavior of sliding systems in plane motion. The nonlinear biaxial stick-slip characteristics of liding bearings and the velocity de-pendence ofcoefficient of friction are accounted for. The study considers multi-storied structures with variable number of bearings ubjected to the effects of earthquakes with various frequency content and different peak ground accelera-tions. It is shown that, although the total superstructure response is reduced sig-nificantly due to the effects of <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> isolation, torsional coupling can be significant depending on the superstructure eccentricity and the lateral-torsional flexibility of the superstructure and the base...|$|E

40|$|A modern base {{isolation}} system is {{proposed for the}} aseismic control of structures. It is composed of steel-Teflon Flat Sliding Bearings, to support the gravity loads while allowing large horizontal displacements, and simply connected Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) truss elements, to provide the necessary horizontal stiffness aswell as a proper restoring capability. The system {{is referred to as}} Smart Restorable <b>Sliding</b> <b>Base</b> Isolation System (SRSBIS). Depending on the arrangement of the auxiliary SMA elements, SRSBIS can exhibit a geometric nonlinearity in addition to the nonlinearity of materials. In this paper, the dynamic characteristics of SRSBIS are first examined in terms of the force-displacement behavior, effective period of vibration, and equivalent damping. After that, the earthquake response of buildings equipped with SRSBIS, designed in accordance with a direct displacement-based approach, is evaluated through extensive nonlinear time-history analyses. The effects of the design parameters on the system behavior are then investigated within a comprehensive parametric study and the seismic performances of SRSBIS are finally compared to those of similar practical {{isolation system}}s. Based on the results, it is shown that SRSBIS can be suitably used for the seismic protection of structures...|$|E

30|$|The furrows on top {{or most of}} the {{landslides}} in VM {{are much}} similar to those found on terrestrial rock avalanches falling onto glaciers (Lucchitta 1987; Shreve 1966; McSaveney 1978). As the rock avalanche follows the local gradient and opens up in a fan, single parts may tear apart in linear zones which materialize as the longitudinal furrows when the landslide fully develops. Furrows thus require a soft and slippery basal layer for their formation and small friction (Lucchitta 1987; De Blasio 2011 a) that makes the role of inertia dominant (Dufresne and Davies 2009). Our suggested situation is thus that landslides were lubricated by ice of a partly glaciated VM (Lucchitta 1987). In this respect, two possible scenarios can be suggested. In the first scenario, ice impregnates the pores of the subsurface regolith. Upon collapse of the rock mass, intense frictional heat concentrated at the <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> leads internal ice to melting. The resulting water may lubricate the landslide not only reducing the effective friction, but also because wetted fines mixed with water work as a layer of non-Newtonian fluid (De Blasio 2009).|$|E

The responses of the system with bi-directional interaction are compared with those without interaction (2 D idealization in two orthogonal directions) in order to investigate the effects of bi-directional interaction of frictional forces at the sliding supports.

40|$|The {{response}} of liquid storage tanks isolated by the sliding systems is investigated under two horizontal components of real earthquake ground motion. The continuous liquid mass is lumped as convective mass, impulsive mass and rigid mass. The corresponding stiffness {{associated with these}} lumped masses is calculated depending upon {{the properties of the}} tank wall and liquid mass. The governing equations of motion of the tank with a sliding system are derived and solved by Newmark's step-by-step method with iterations. The frictional forces mobilized at the interface of the sliding system are assumed to be velocity dependent and their interaction in two horizontal directions is duly considered. A parametric study is also conducted to study the effects of important system parameters on the effectiveness of seismic isolation of the liquid storage tanks. The various parameters considered are (i) the period of isolation (ii) the damping of isolation bearings and (iii) the coefficient of friction of sliding bearings. It has been found that the bi-directional interaction of frictional forces has noticeable effects and if these effects are ignored then the <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> displacements will be underestimated which can be crucial from the design point of view.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a multi-objective {{optimization}} for {{the optimal}} design of sliding isolation systems for suppression of seismic responses of building structures is presented. Due {{to the presence}} of several parameters affecting the performance of <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> isolation systems, applying a rigorous multi-objective optimization technique is inevitable. Hence, in this study, the genetic algorithm is used to find optimal values of isolator parameters, including coefficient of friction, mass of base raft and the damping ratio of the restoring force device. The restoring device, which is composed of a linear spring and a linear viscous damper, is attached to the base raft in order to minimize the during-event and after-event sliding displacement of the base raft. The simultaneous minimization of the building’s top story displacement and its acceleration, and also the base raft’s displacement, are considered as the objective functions. In order to satisfy the objective functions, a fast and elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to find a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. The isolated building is modeled as a shear-type structure having one lateral degree of freedom at each story level. A ten-story building is used for the numerical study and an ensemble of seven earthquake records is considered for the analysis. The results indicate that by applying the final design parameters obtained from the optimal values found by the NSGA-II approach corresponding to each individual record, the sliding isolator system effectively suppresses the structural seismic responses. Also, it is found that the restoring device with an optimal viscous damper might slightly reduce the performance of the isolation system, but is strongly effective in controlling the maximum base raft displacement and the residual base raft displacement...|$|E
