5|$|Fire {{is another}} {{important}} element in {{the maintenance of the}} Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E

25|$|One {{interpretation}} {{follows the}} insights of the renowned Augustinian scholar, Fr. Fulbert Cayré (1884–1971), who holds to an Augustinian definition of the charism: the Assumption was born of Augustinian inspiration as evidenced, among other things, by its name, its rule, the institute it founded (Les Etudes augustiniennes), the number of references to St. Augustine in the founder’s writings (he once wrote that the City of God <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the Assumption “a kind of second revelation”), and the many Assumptionist authors in the Augustinian tradition (Cayré, Edgar Bourque, Marcel Neusch, Goulven Madec, Ernest Fortin, George Folliet, Rémi Munsch, etc.). This interpretation, strongly founded on the facts, bears witness to the debt Assumption owes to Augustine. Still, in our opinion, Augustine remains second to d’Alzon himself.|$|E

500|$|Fantasound, {{developed}} {{in part by}} Disney engineer William Garity, employed two projectors running at the same time. With one containing the picture film with a mono soundtrack for backup purposes, the other ran a sound film that was mixed from the eight tracks recorded at the Academy to four: three of which contained the audio for the left, center, and right stage speakers respectively, while the fourth became a control track with amplitude and frequency tones that drove variable-gain amplifiers to control {{the volume of the}} three audio tracks. In addition were three [...] "house" [...] speakers placed on the left, right, and center of the auditorium that derived from the left and right stage channels which acted as surround channels. As the original recording was captured at almost peak modulation to increase signal-to-noise ratio, the control track was used to restore the dynamics to where Stokowski thought they <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> <b>For</b> this, a tone-operated gain-adjusting device was built to control the levels of each of the three audio tracks through the amplifiers.|$|E

500|$|Four {{principal}} stars, Delta, Gamma, Epsilon, and Beta Corvi, form a quadrilateral asterism {{known as}} [...] "the [...] "Spica's Spanker" [...] or [...] "the Sail". Although {{none of the}} stars are particularly bright, they lie in a dim area of the sky, rendering the asterism easy to distinguish in the night sky. Gamma and Delta serve as pointers toward Spica. Also called Gienah, Gamma is {{the brightest star in}} Corvus at magnitude 2.59. Its traditional name means [...] "wing", the star marking the left wing in Bayer's Uranometria. 154±1 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white hued giant star of spectral type B8III that is [...] times as massive, and 355 times as luminous as the Sun. Around [...] million years old, it has largely exhausted its core hydrogen and begun expanding and cooling as it moves away from the main sequence. A binary star, it has a companion orange or red dwarf star of spectral type K5V to M5V that is about 0.8 times as massive as the Sun. Around 50 astronomical units distant from Gamma Corvi A, it is estimated to complete an orbit in 158 years. Delta Corvi, traditionally called Algorab, is a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.9, around 87 light-years from Earth. An enigmatic star around 2.7 times as massive as the Sun, it is more luminous (65–70 times that of the Sun) than its <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> its surface temperature of 10,400 K, and hence is either a 3.2 million year-old very young pre-main sequence star that has not settled down to a stable main sequence life stage, or a 260-million-year-old star that has begun to exhaust its core hydrogen and expand, cool and shine more brightly as it moves away from the main sequence. Its spectral type is given as A0IV, corresponding with the latter scenario. Warm circumstellar dust—by definition part of its inner stellar system—has been detected around Delta Corvi A. Delta Corvi B is an orange dwarf star of magnitude 8.51 and spectral class K, also surrounded by circumstellar dust. A post T-tauri star, it is at least 650 AU distant from its brighter companion and takes at least 9400 years to complete an orbit. Delta Corvi's common name means [...] "the raven". It is one of two stars marking the right wing. Located 4.5 degrees northeast of Delta Corvi is [...] Struve 1669, a binary star that is divisible into two stars 5.4" [...] apart by small amateur telescopes, 280 light-years from Earth. The pair, both white stars, is {{visible to the naked eye}} at magnitude 5.2; the primary is of magnitude 5.9 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.0.|$|E
