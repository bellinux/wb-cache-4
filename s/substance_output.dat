40|$|A {{table-top}} prototype {{has been}} constructed {{that uses the}} enzyme malate dehydrogenase to recognize input signal patterns. The device {{is controlled by the}} enzyme in response to injection of Mg 2 + used as a signaling <b>substance.</b> <b>Output</b> is monitored spectroscopically. If Mg 2 + is injected along either of two signal lines (i. e., if the input signal pattern is 10 or 01) the device emits an output of 1. Injection along neither or both lines results in an output of 0. The enzyme in effect is used as a transform that converts the linearly inseparable exclusive-or problem into a linearly separable problem...|$|E

The influence of major irreversibilities on the maximum power output and the corresponding efficiency is analyzed in detail. The inherent relations and the essential differences between the Ericsson heat engine and the Carnot heat engine are expounded.

40|$|The ORWARE {{model is}} {{intended}} {{as a tool for}} simulating different systems for handling organic liquid and solid waste in a densely populated area. The model includes truck transport, incineration, landfill, composting, anaerobic digestion, sewer transport, sewage plant, residue transport and spreading of residues on arable land. All physical flows in the model are described by the same variable vector including 43 <b>substances.</b> The <b>output</b> of the model consists of energy flows, emissions to air and water and the amount of residues returned to arable land, including pollutants and nutrients. The development of an anaerobic digestion sub-model and sewage plant sub-model, included in the ORWARE-model, is described in detail. The anaerobic digestion sub-model included in ORWARE is based on a continuous, single-stage, mixed-tank reactor operating under meso-philic conditions. Degradation dynamics are calculated based on the substrate’s composition of fat, protein and carbohydrates and the retention time. The sewage plant sub-model includes mechanical, biological and chemical purification of the wastewater, as well as anaerobic digestion and dewatering of the sewage sludge. Evaluation of waste handling scenarios indicate, e. g., that source separation systems combined with biological treatment of the organic solid fraction generate lower environmental impacts and a higher recirculation of nutrients, but a lower energy turnover, compared with the incineration or landfilling...|$|R
40|$|A {{watershed}} management framework for mountain areas {{is based on}} lessons learned from {{watershed management}} experience, social and institutional learning, {{and the use of}} a watershed management program evaluation in Nepal. The lessons led to the adoption of a subwatershed-based ecosystem approach based on local participation at the subwatershed level. An integrated watershed management framework (IWMF) consisting of eight steps with three checklists was developed focusing on improvement-oriented adaptive management. The eight steps lead to the preparation of a watershed management plan. In the process three checklists are used. While the first checklist has general questions pertaining to watershed analysis, the second allows participation analysis of stakeholders in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and opens up new prospects for further reinforcing or building new user group institutions based on consensus. The final checklist consists of hierarchical watershed management objectives, including goals, results and activities leading to a program planning matrix. The framework was applied to watershed planning in the Chure Region to compare the framework-based planning with conventional planning procedures. A significant difference in quality and <b>substance</b> of the <b>output,</b> with and without the use of the framework, suggests that an integrated framework is a useful tool for an ecosystem-based approach to natural resource management and socio-technical conservation. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was aimed {{to study the}} effect of the type of fuel delivery system (petrol, dedicated or bifuel), the type of consumed fuel (petrol or gas), the portion of consumed fuel and also the duration of dual-fuelling in producing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and unburned hydrocarbons from Pride and Samand. According to research objectives, data gathering from 2000 vehicles has been done by visiting Hafiz Vehicle Inspection Center every day for 2 months. The results of this survey indicated that although there is no significant difference between various fuel delivery systems in terms of producing the carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and unburned hydrocarbons by Samand, considering the emission amount of carbon dioxide, the engine performance of Pride in bifuel and dedicated state in GTXI and 132 types is more unsatisfactory than that of petrol state by 0. 3 and 0. 4 %, respectively. On the other hand, consuming natural gas increases the amount of carbon monoxide emission in dual- fuel Pride by 0. 18 % and decreases that in dual-fuel Samand by 1. 2 %, which signifies the better design of Samand in terms of fuel pumps, used kit type and other engine parts to use this alternative fuel compared to Pride. Since the portion of consumed fuel and also duration of dual-fuelling does not {{have a significant effect on}} the amount of output pollutants from the studied vehicles, it can be claimed that the <b>output</b> <b>substances</b> from the vehicle exhaust are more related to the vehicle’s condition than the fuel type...|$|R
40|$|In food safety, hazard {{identification}} and hazard characterisation aim to determine safe levels of exposure for substances “reference values” to protect human health, animal health or the environment. Such reference values {{are most often}} derived for the relevant species by applying an uncertainty factor on the “reference point determined from the pivotal toxicological study. Since its creation in 2002, EFSA scientific panels and staff have produced risk assessments for more than 4, 400 substances in over 1, 650 scientific opinions, statements and conclusions through the work of its scientists. OpenFoodTox is a structured database summarising the outcome of hazard characterisation for human health and – depending on the relevant legislation and intended uses – animal health and the environment. For each individual substance, the data model of OpenFoodTox has been designed using OECD Harmonised Template as a basis to collect and structure the data in a harmonised manner. OpenFoodTox reports the <b>substance</b> characterisation, EFSA <b>outputs,</b> reference points, reference values and genotoxicity. OpenFoodTox and can be searched under the following link using a microstrategy tool: [URL] In order to disseminate OpenFoodTox to a wider community, two sets of data can be downloaded: 1. Five individual spreadsheets extracted from the EFSA microstrategy tool providing for all compounds: a. substance characterisation, b. EFSA outputs, c. reference points, d. reference values and e. genotoxicity. 2. The full database. OpenFoodTox contributes actively to EFSA’s 2020 Science Strategy and to the aim of widening EFSA’s evidence base and optimising access to its data as a valuable open source database that can be shared with all scientific advisory bodies and stakeholders {{with an interest in}} chemical risk assessment. In addition, OpenFoodTox has been submitted to the OECD’s Global Portal to Information on Chemical Substances (eChemPortal) so that individual substances can be searched as part of the national and international databases.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the global black carbon (BC) cycle is essentially qualitative due to uncertainties in our knowledge of its properties. This work investigates two source of uncertainties in modelling black carbon: those due {{to the use of}} different schemes for BC ageing and its removal rate in the global Transport-Chemistry model TM 5 and those due to the uncertainties in the definition and quantification of the observations, which propagate through to both the emission inventories, and the measurements used for the model evaluation. The schemes for the atmospheric processing of black carbon that have been tested with the model are (i) a simple approach considering BC as bulk aerosol and a simple treatment of the removal with fixed 70 % of in-cloud black carbon concentrations scavenged by clouds and removed when rain is present and (ii) a more complete description of microphysical ageing within an aerosol dynamics model, where removal is coupled to the microphysical properties of the aerosol, which results in a global average of 40 % in-cloud black carbon that is scavenged in clouds and subsequently removed by rain, thus resulting in a longer atmospheric lifetime. This difference is reflected in comparisons between both sets of modelled results and the measurements. Close to the sources, both anthropogenic and vegetation fire source regions, the model results do not differ significantly, indicating that the emissions are the prevailing mechanism determining the concentrations and the choice of the aerosol scheme does not influence the levels. In more remote areas such as oceanic and polar regions the differences can be orders of magnitude, due to {{the differences between the two}} schemes. The more complete description reproduces the seasonal trend of the black carbon observations in those areas, although not always the magnitude of the signal, while the more simplified approach underestimates black carbon concentrations by orders of magnitude. The sensitivity to wet scavenging has been tested by varying in-cloud and below-cloud removal. BC lifetime increases by 10 % when large scale and convective scale precipitation removal efficiency are reduced by 30 %, while the variation is very small when below-cloud scavenging is zero. Since the emission inventories are representative of elemental carbon-like <b>substance,</b> the model <b>output</b> should be compared to elemental carbon measurements and if known, the ratio of black carbon to elemental carbon mass should be taken into account when the model is compared with black carbon observations...|$|R
40|$|Advanced hemodynamic {{monitoring}} with {{determination of}} cardiac output and other parameters relevant {{for the assessment}} of volume status and heart function is well established {{as an integral part of}} intensive-care monitoring and therapy. Since the introduction of invasive bedside cardiac output measurement using pulmonary thermodilution in the 1970 s, hemodynamic monitoring methods have been continuously improved and now permit minimally or even non-invasive, technically simple, quick and continuous determination of cardiac output, and thus assessment during ongoing therapeutic measures. However, in contrast to thermodilution, using these methods cardiac output is calculated based on complex mathematical models and databases stored in the systems, and thus is estimated rather than actually being measured. The methods are therefore of limited use for hemodynamically unstable critically ill patients because the calculation algorithms cannot at present sufficiently account for changing vascular conditions during therapy with vasoactive <b>substances.</b> Determining cardiac <b>output</b> baed on thermodilution is therefore still to be regarded as the standard in intensive care. Since the 1990 s, the less invasive transpulmonary thermodilution measurement method, which requires only a central venous catheter and a special arterial thermistor catheter, has established itself as an alternative to pulmonary artery thermodilution with pulmonary artery catheters. With the PiCCO system, in addition to measuring the cardiac output using the thermodilution curve, parameters are calculated that should allow conclusions to be drawn about intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV) and extravascular lung water (EVLW). Here too, the calculation is carried out on the basis of complex mathematical models. The validity of the calculated values may be limited by disrupted cardiac output measurement as well as by various other influences. Only with knowledge of the underlying mathematical formulas is it possible to adequately assess plausibility and deviations in the calculation of these values. There are special challenges in terms of hemodynamic management for intensive care patients with renal failure, since their volume status must be frequently regulated with renal replacement therapy and physiological compensation mechanisms are also impaired. The assessment of ITBV and EVLW is therefore of particular importance for these patients, especially because the method used to determine the volume reduction in renal replacement therapy for hemodynamically stable patients on dialysis can hardly be used for intensive care patients. The volumetric parameters calculated using the PiCCO system can here provide valuable information despite the above-mentioned limitations. During on-going renal replacement therapy, however, there may be disruptions in the thermodilution measurements, which in turn affect the determination of ITBV and EVLW. The different hemodynamic monitoring methods available today thus have different advantages, disadvantages and limitations, and are suited for different patient groups. Hemodynamic monitoring methods can provide valuable support in intensive care, but like all the other tests and measurements used in intensive care, they can always only provide building blocks for treatment that must be judged in the context of the overall situation and be continually assessed critically in terms of their significance and reliability...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, the {{environmental}} {{issues from the}} construction sector have attracted increasing attention from {{both the public and}} authorities. Notably, the bridge construction is responsible for considerable amount of energy and raw material consumptions. However, the current bridges are still mainly designed from the economic, technical, and safety perspective, while considerations of their environmental performance are rarely integrated into the decision making process. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a comprehensive, standardized and internationally recognized approach for quantifying all emissions, resource consumption and related environmental and health impacts linked to a service, asset or product. LCA has the potential to provide reliable environmental profiles of the bridges, and thus help the decision-makers to select the most environmentally optimal designs. However, due to the complexity of {{the environmental}} problems and the diversity of bridge structures, robust environmental evaluation of bridges is far from straightforward. The LCA has rarely been studied on bridges till now. The overall aim of this research is to implement LCA on bridge, thus eventually integrate it into the decision-making process to mitigate the environmental burden at an early stage. Specific objectives are to: i) provide up-to-date knowledge to practitioners; ii) identify associated obstacles and clarify key operational issues; iii) establish a holistic framework and develop computational tool for bridge LCA; and iv) explore the feasibility of combining LCA with life cycle cost (LCC). The developed tool (called GreenBridge) enables the simultaneous comparison and analysis of 10 feasible bridges at any detail level, and the framework has been utilized on real cases in Sweden. The studied bridge types include: railway bridge with ballast or fix-slab track, road bridges of steel box-girder composite bridge, steel I-girder composite bridge, post tensioned concrete box-girder bridge, balanced cantilever concrete box-girder bridge, steel-soil composite bridge and concrete slab-frame bridge. The assessments are detailed from cradle to grave phases, covering thousands of types of <b>substances</b> in the <b>output,</b> diverse mid-point environmental indicators, the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) and monetary value weighting. Some analyses also investigated the impact from on-site construction scenarios, which have been overlooked in the current state-of-the-art. The study identifies the major structural and life-cycle scenario contributors to the selected impact categories, and reveals the effects of varying the monetary weighting system, the steel recycling rate and the material types. The result shows that the environmental performance can be highly influenced by the choice of bridge design. The optimal solution is found to be governed by several variables. The analyses also imply that the selected indicators, structural components and life-cycle scenarios must be clearly specified to be applicable in a transparent procurement. This work may provide important references for evaluating similar bridge cases, and identification of the main sources of environmental burden. The outcome of this research may serve as recommendation for decision-makers to select the most LCA-feasible proposal and minimize environmental burdens.   QC 20150311 </p...|$|R
