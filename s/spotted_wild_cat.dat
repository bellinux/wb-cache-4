50|$|The California Spangled is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} cat that was bred to resemble <b>spotted</b> <b>wild</b> <b>cats,</b> like the ocelot and leopard. They were originally bred in the 1980s and were only ever a rare breed, with only 58 ever being registered. They were usually expensive, priced between US$800 and $2,500. The popularity {{of two other}} spotted cats breeds, the Ocicat and the Bengal, overshadowed their development.|$|R

50|$|The Ocicat is an all-domestic {{breed of}} cat which resembles a <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> {{but has no}} wild DNA in its gene pool. The breed is unusual {{in that it is}} <b>spotted</b> like a <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> but has the {{temperament}} of a domestic animal. It is named for its resemblance to the Ocelot. The breed was established from Siamese and Abyssinian stock; later, American Shorthairs (silver tabbies) were added to the mix and gave the breed their silver color, bone structure and distinct markings.|$|R
50|$|There are no {{wildlife}} sanctuaries {{and national}} {{parks in the}} Bidar Forest Division. However, leopards may be seen occasionally far from human habitations. Langurs, wolves, <b>spotted</b> deer, <b>wild</b> boar, hares, porcupines, foxes, <b>wild</b> <b>cats</b> and jackals are also seen. In Karnataka, after Ranebennur Blackbuck Sanctuary in Haveri district and Jayamangali Blackbuck Conservation Reserve in Tumkur district, a sizeable population of near threatened species of blackbucks {{is found in the}} plains of Bidar District.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, a <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> slowly {{comes to}} the scene. The <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> lures the young bird using its tail {{disguised}} as a worm. The <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> captures and runs away with its prey while Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 plays. Pooch, however, sees the deed, and sends other birds to intervene. Despite receiving disruptive acts from the birds, the <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> is able to enter a caged compound with the young bird. But the caged compound {{turns out to be}} a pound occupied by stray dogs which attack the <b>wild</b> <b>cat.</b> The little bird manages to escape.|$|R
40|$|Foreword Increasing human {{pressures}} on ever-dwindling wild areas make {{it necessary to}} keep under review the use man makes of these areas and the wildlife they contain. IUCN is concerned that economic demands do not override other values and unnecessarily destroy natural communities or lead to the extinction of species of plants and animals. The trade in the skins of spotted cats {{has resulted in the}} exploitation of <b>wild</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cat</b> species at a rate which is likely to bring many, if not all, of their present populations to eventual extinction unless remedial action is taken. IUCN in association with its sister organisation, the World Wildlife Fund, commissioned Dr. Norman Myers to undertake a status survey of leopard in Africa south of the Sahara and to assess {{the nature and extent of}} the threats to its survival. The International Fur Trade Federation voluntarily imposed on its members a moratorium on the handling of the skins of several species, including the leopard, for a period of three years and contributed towards th...|$|R
40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> banking {{was only}} one of the factors behind the {{collapse}} of Michigan’s banking system and the state’s subsequent fall into a deep and prolonged depression. The <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> period was brief, less than a year; the number of <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> banks was small, perhaps a dozen; losses to note holders due specifically to <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> banking would have been only about $ 350, 000 {{had it not been for}} an interference with contract; and, there is little evidence that <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> bank notes ever had a general circulation. This study argues that the <b>Wild</b> <b>Cats</b> gained the level of notoriety that they did mainly because of other events, including the state’s interference with contract. The interference first delayed and then completely undermined the collection of the debts owed to the Free Banks of the state and, in so doing, undermined all the Free Banks of the state, whether reckless or not...|$|R

5000|$|Save China's Tigers, a {{charitable}} foundation funding pioneering {{work with the}} South China tiger, has broadened its scope of conservation goals from tigers to include all <b>wild</b> <b>cats</b> around the world. On 7 August 2009, it launched the [...] "Wildcat Fund" [...] to encourage and support <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> research, conservation, and reintroduction efforts for highly endangered and vulnerable <b>wild</b> <b>cats.</b> Historically, funding in <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> conservation has favoured the large, charismatic species. While giving priorities to cat species having the IUCN endangered status or above, the Wildcat Fund encourages projects conducting pioneering biological and ecological research of little known cat species {{in an effort to}} increase understanding of these species and help design improved conservation techniques.|$|R
50|$|Traveling to Washington, D.C. with Alligator {{as part of}} a Seminole {{delegation}} in 1843, <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> {{failed to}} gain financial aid for the Seminoles as the tribe suffered a series of floods and raids by neighboring Creeks (capturing free blacks and Indians and selling them to southern slave holders). This devastated the black and Indian Seminoles. Conditions continued to worsen until 1849 when <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> left the reservation with about one hundred followers, consisting of Seminoles and black Seminoles, which included some former slaves, and escaped to Texas. Joined by about one thousand Kickapoos, <b>Wild</b> <b>Cats</b> band eventually were able to establish a new community in Mexico where the government awarded the tribe an area of land in recognition for their service against Apache and Comanche raiders. Earning a commission of Colonel in the Mexican army, <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> would live with the Seminoles until his death of smallpox in Alto, Mexico in 1857. He was succeeded by his son Gato Chiquito or Young <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat.</b>|$|R

50|$|One of the park's many attractions was {{a wooden}} roller coaster with {{a length of}} 3000 ft and the height of 85 feet high was called the <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat,</b> which opened in 1930. The state-of-the-art, three-minute ride was hailed by roller coaster connoisseurs across the country. The <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> was {{designed}} by Herbert Paul Schmeck, who held 100 patents for roller coaster innovations. In 1984, the <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> was still ranked among the top ten roller coasters in the world.|$|R
50|$|Felidae Conservation Fund (FCF) is a California-based {{non-profit}} {{organization dedicated to}} preserving <b>wild</b> <b>cats</b> and their habitats.

50|$|As a side note, the cat {{also seems}} to be reincarnated. It starts as a <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> that Tetisheri finds and brings home. In most of the stories {{there seems to be a}} <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> i.e.: a cheetah, a black cat, and a black and orange kitten.|$|R
50|$|FCF's {{mission is}} to advance the {{conservation}} of the planet's <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> species and their habitats through partnerships in research, education and technology. Its model is to collaborate on research studies that examine human impact on <b>wild</b> <b>cats</b> and their habitats, then disseminate the results in outreach and education programs designed to convince people {{of the importance of}} preserving the natural environment. Felidae collaborates with scientists, educators, communities and lawmakers with the goal of protecting ecosystems, staving off further extinctions, and promoting healthy ways for humans to coexist with <b>wild</b> <b>cats</b> and their habitats.|$|R
50|$|Cats {{were one}} of the most {{recognizable}} species in Egyptian culture and were domesticated much later than dogs. Two types of smaller cats appeared in ancient Egypt: the jungle cat (Felis chaus) and the African <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> (Felis silvestris libyca). The African <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> was domesticated from the Predynastic Period onward. <b>Wild</b> <b>cats</b> naturally preyed upon the rats and other vermin that ate from the royal granaries. They earned their place in towns and cities by killing mice, venomous snakes, and other pests. They were worshipped by the Egyptians and given jewelry in hieroglyphics.|$|R
