40|$|The design, {{development}} {{and evaluation of}} an experimental translation system that aims to aid transactions between a deaf person and a clerk in a Post Office is described.

The main objective in developing this prototype system was to determine how useful {{it would be to}} a customer whose first language was BSL and to discover what areas of the system required more research and development to make it more effective. The system was evaluated by six pre-lingually profoundly deaf people and three Post <b>Office</b> <b>clerks.</b> Deaf users and Post <b>Office</b> <b>clerks</b> were supportive of the system, but the former group required a higher quality of signing from the avatar and the latter a system that was less constrained in the phrases it could recognize: both these areas are being addressed in the next phase of the development...|$|R
