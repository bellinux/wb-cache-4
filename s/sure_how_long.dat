500|$|On February 3, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Enterprise had been cancelled. This news was passed to the cast and crew during the sixth day of production on [...] "In a Mirror, Darkly". The end of the series marked the first time in 18 years that no new Star Trek episodes were scheduled for broadcast, and Enterprise was the first live-action series of the franchise since The Original Series to last less than seven years. Braga said at a talk to students in Los Angeles shortly after the news of the cancellation was released that [...] "After 18 straight years on the air and 750-some episodes the current run of Star Trek is over. Which is a good thing. It needs a rest". He added that he wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> Star Trek would be off the air, but called it a [...] "gestation" [...] instead of a [...] "cancellation".|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} challenge at Hanford is stabilizing the [...] of {{high-level radioactive waste}} stored in 177underground tanks.

DOE lacks information {{about the extent to which}} the 27 double-shell tanks may be susceptible to corrosion. Without determining the extent to which the factors that contributed to the leak in AY-102 were similar to the other 27 double-shell tanks, DOE cannot be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> its double-shell tanks can safely store waste. That waste was originally scheduled to be removed by 2018. , the revised deadline was 2040. Nearby aquifers contain an estimated [...] of contaminated groundwater as a result of the leaks. , [...] of radioactive waste is traveling through the groundwater toward the Columbia River. This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50 years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule. The site includes [...] of solid radioactive waste.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after missing}} out on the program, Rhys finds himself {{performing}} surgery on Chris Pappas (James Mason). Rhys initially treats Chris at the hospital after he is attacked at work by an unknown assailant. Chris refuses to stay for any further medical treatment and later collapses with a punctured lung. Barber said {{that as soon as}} Rhys sees Chris's X-rays, he [...] "goes beyond the call of duty" [...] to find him. The actor explained [...] "When he finds him on the floor, he knows exactly what's happened, but he isn't <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> he's been unconscious for. For all he knows, Chris could be dead within the minute— so he goes straight into emergency mode." [...] In a bid to save Chris's life, Rhys performs an emergency procedure to get him breathing again using a screwdriver and a piece of piping. Rhys should not be conducting any type of surgery as he is not a qualified surgeon, but he does not think of the consequences. All About Soap's Laura Morgan said Rhys' [...] "quick thinking" [...] pays off and Chris starts breathing again, but at the hospital Karl warns him he will be held accountable if Chris does not pull through.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to Star Wars Headspace was mixed, holding a weighted mean of a 48 out of 100 {{on the site}} Metacritic based on seven reviews. Drew Mcweeny reviewed it for One Thing I Love Today, his daily column on HitFix which is meant to highlight certain aspects of modern-day popular culture. He honored the compilation's concept of an EDM Star Wars tribute as funny: [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> I'll listen to it, because in the end, it's still {{an hour or so}} of EDM, but it was a delightful soundtrack to a busy weekend, and all of the small surprises built into it should make it something that any Star Wars fan will be able to easily enjoy." [...] A correspondent for The Boston Globe wrote that it was much better than he expected it to be, giving all credit to the producers who contributed to the compilation. Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts spotlighted the distinguishing characteristic of each song. [...] Bromwich, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, scored the release a 6.9 out of ten, highlighting the record's goal of just being [...] "simple fun" [...] and [...] "Neither [...] stale tribute nor sloppy lovefest". At the same time, however, he also disliked that the nostalgic style was seemingly [...] "a way of avoiding risk".|$|E
2500|$|Philip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both {{agreed that}} Pokémon Go was [...] "an {{exciting}} social experience", {{but were not}} <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or [...] "end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about {{for a few weeks}} and then is forgotten".|$|E
2500|$|He {{was taken}} to a {{building}} where he was attached to a pulley from the ceiling, suspended by handcuffs on his wrists and hoisted off his feet, left there to dangle hour after hour. Each time he was let down, a uniformed officer with a patch on his chest that said [...] "doctor" [...] examined him and took his pulse, said [...] "okay," [...] and the soldiers hoisted him back up again. They also hung him up backwards, with his hands bound behind his back. Kurnaz is not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> he was suspended by his arms, but other prisoners informed him it was five days. Later he learned that this hanging treatment had killed prisoners at the Bagram base; he believes a prisoner in the room next to his died from being hung up by his arms.|$|E

And {{what would happen if}} he were to see me, and find out, as I am <b>sure</b> he would, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> and why I had inhabited his house, I can scarcely conceive. I have seen him in his bursts of passion; and, although he did not hurt the people he stormed at any more than he would hurt me, they seemed to shrink before him." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1984 and 1985, Krishnamurti {{spoke to}} an invited {{audience}} at the United Nations in New York, {{under the auspices of}} the Pacem in Terris Society chapter at the UN. In October 1985, he visited India for the last time, holding a number of what came to be known as [...] "farewell" [...] talks and discussions between then and January 1986. These last talks included the fundamental questions he had been asking through the years, as well as newer concerns about advances in science and technology, and their effect on humankind. Krishnamurti had commented to friends that he did not wish to invite death, but was not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> his body would last (he had already lost considerable weight), and once he could no longer talk, he would have [...] "no further purpose". In his final talk, on 4 January 1986, in Madras, he again invited the audience to examine with him the nature of inquiry, the effect of technology, the nature of life and meditation, and the nature of creation.|$|E
2500|$|Like many popular manga {{series of}} the time (this is still done today), Legend of Light was turned into an anime series. At the time the {{producers}} of Tatsunoko Productions had picked the manga series to produce it into an anime series. It was first aired in Japan in early 1986. At the time the manga series was still unfinished so the producers of the anime were not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the anime would last since the manga was not finished. Finally they settled at 26 episodes (the average number of episodes done per anime series, at the time highest number of episodes was 52). [...] Due to poor ratings in Japan, the series was left unfinished at only 19 episodes with {{the last couple of}} episodes wrapping up the series in a hurry and left in an open ending in late 1986. The series was aired again abroad during the 1988 Olympics that were happening in Seoul, Korea in hopes that it would help boost the ratings of the anime series. Later on in 1988, the series was released in Europe where it was extremely successful, especially in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. In every country where the series was released, the titles of the anime episodes were changed. The episode titles of the English version are translations of the original Japanese episodes titles.|$|E
