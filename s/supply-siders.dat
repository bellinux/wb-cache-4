Many embrace supply-side economics, arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues.

Some <b>supply-siders</b> have even advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary. However, the Congressional Budget Office has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the Bush tax cuts added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002-2011 and would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.|$|E

For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies are leaving the U.S. to test and build in Europe. “We’re being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars and biologics,” Booker said, “and we cannot get left behind.” He supports long-term deficit reduction efforts to ensure economic prosperity, Cap and Trade taxation to combat climate change, and increased funding for education.

Finally, we point out that a similar analysis applies to the huge pension problem burdening several continental European economies. So part of their high unemployment of late may be ascribed to their looming pension outlays. We conclude, with further argumentation, that a theory of dynamic markup variation is needed, on top of changes in marginal tax rates, to quantitatively account for labor-leisure distortions in the U.

40|$|We study {{here the}} effects of future tax and {{budgetary}} shocks on present levels of economic activity and real interest rates in a nonmonetary and possibly non-Ricardian economy. The paper first takes up an (unanticipated) temporary tax cut to be effective on a given future date - a delayed "debt bomb. " The sudden prospect of this future-dated shock causes at once {{a drop in the}} (unit) value placed on the firms' business asset, the customer, and accordingly on the price of shares - with the result that the hourly wage, hours worked and GDP drop in tandem. This paradox of reduced activity through announcement of future "stimulus" does not hinge on an upward jump of long rates of interest, {{which may or may not}} occur: the short rate of return on shares is increased by the initial drop in their price, but the price has so much farther to fall that this is more than offset for a time by the expectation of ongoing capital loss, so short rates of interest actually drop. The paper next studies a future tax cut lacking a "sunset" provision and requiring instead a gradual welfare benefit adjustment to retain solvency. The same negative effects on present activity result. Third, the paper shows that if the tax cut is effective immediately, its effect is ambiguous, as the Marshallian <b>supply-sider</b> effect works the other way. Finally, the paper also examines the new anticipation of a future increase in the number of retirees in a pay-as-you-go social security program. In conclusion, juxtaposing these results against recent US experience, we hypothesize that the legislation of an unsustainable fiscal gap - the cuts in tax rates and the rise of future obligations owing to the cumulative deficit and the approaching bulge in retirement benefits - is an important cause of the decline in hours worked per employee and in the participation rates over the period...|$|R

Some <b>supply-siders</b> like Don Lambro of the Washington Times credit the Reagan tax cuts with the eventual surpluses of the late 1990s.

40|$|The term "supply-sider" {{has come}} to mean someone who {{believes}} that an x percent cut in tax rates walkthrough {{its effect on the}} incentive to work, to save and invest, and to avoid and evade taxes-lead to much less than an x percent cut, and perhaps even to an increase, in tax revenues. Not all economists are <b>supply-siders</b> in this sense, but many more are now than were during the 1970 s. The reason for the switch is the evidence that has accumulated on the incentive effects of taxes. Many studies have shown that cuts in tax rates for the highest-income taxpayers actually have increased the government's revenue. A key reason for this effect is not a large elasticity of labor supply but rather a large elasticity of tax avoidance with respect to tax rates. The most important policy implication of this evidence is that the government cannot increase its revenue substantially without taxing the non-rich.

40|$|Surely {{the most}} {{polarizing}} and enduring policy {{controversy in the}} annals of government-assisted housing concerns the direction of True North. Where is it most beneficial to point the enacted housing subsidy streams? Are the underhoused’s needs most sensibly ad-dressed by steering resources to the household—the demand side of the market—confer-ring sufficient purchasing power to compensate for lack of affordable housing in the marketplace? Or is True North in precisely the opposite direction, on the supply side? In that view, a concerned government best overcomes the housing deficit—with greater certainty and, in the long term, more cost effectively—by producing or inducing a supply of new housing, affordability assured by subcost rents.
