50|$|Until {{advances}} {{in the late twentieth}} century, navigation depended on the ability to measure latitude and longitude. Latitude can be determined through celestial navigation; the measurement of longitude requires accurate knowledge of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. John Harrison created the first highly accurate marine chronometer in the mid-18th century. The Noon gun in Cape Town still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their chronometers. Many buildings near major ports used to have (some still do) a large ball mounted on a tower or mast arranged to drop at a pre-determined time, for the same purpose. While satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) require unprecedentedly accurate knowledge of time, this is <b>supplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>equipment</b> on the satellites; vehicles no longer need timekeeping equipment.|$|E
40|$|Bellcore {{studies have}} shown that Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) is a {{convenient}} and compact mathematical representation that can account for the burstiness and long-range auto-correlation observed in the traffic of high-speed data networks. The convenience of the FBM representation for a traffic stream {{lies in the fact that}} it is described by just three parameters () m,a,H, where m is the mean rate, a the ‘peakedness ’ and H the Hurst parameter. Clearly, for the FBM traffic model to be applied in practice, the parameters of the model have to be estimated from the measurements that are available in the switching systems <b>supplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>equipment</b> vendors. On the basis of these measurements, traffic capacity management (TCM) algorithms must ensure that the provisioned capacity is sufficient to meet the anticipated traffic of broadband applications, but not so excessive as to render broadband services uneconomical. We investigate how the estimation of the parameters of the FBM model is affected by the frequency of collection of the traffic measurements, and examine this dependency for two methods of estimation applied to two data sets: the method of variance-time plots and the recently-proposed method based on wavelets. If estimation error is judged by its impact on the engineering of link capacity, we find that both the variance-time plot method and the wavelet method offer about the same accuracy, with a slight edge for the wavelet method. Our results suggest tha...|$|E
40|$|From product {{maintenance}} and service point of view, high-value sophisticated {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools in modern manufacturing factories play important roles: they are manufacturing equipment, {{and on the other}} hand, they are also products <b>supplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers. There is a trend that manufacturers are extending their responsibilities to the products use phase to meet customers’ requirements for lifetime support and service. To ensure the effective performance and efficient maintenance of high-value machine tools, information and knowledge from their lifecycle should be collected and reused. However, in the research area of product service systems and related computerised maintenance systems, {{there is a lack of}} research work on how to integrate knowledge from different stakeholders into the maintenance and service planning process, which is important for modern digital manufacturing systems to reduce machine tools’ downtime and improve their working performance. This project proposed a collaborative maintenance planning framework to connect different stakeholders and integrate their knowledge into the maintenance and service process. The potential of advanced content management systems (CMSs), which are widely used non-engineering sectors such as finance, business, publishing and government organisations, has been explored and tested for applications in the manufacturing engineering domain. The research realised that CMSs have several advantages compared with traditional engineering information systems, especially in managing dynamic and unstructured knowledge. A prototype maintenance and service planning system has been developed and evaluated using a real CNC machine tool...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine a Challenge 67 racing yacht and assess its {{suitability}} for conversion into a world cruising yacht. The Challenge Business currently owns a number of ex race yachts which have subsequently been used for adventure sailing and corporate entertaining. The 67 fleet, now twelve years old, has been superseded by a fleet of 72 ’ yachts. Several yachts have been sold to various organisations as training vessels. This study examines an alternative use. The definition of a world cruising yacht has been examined, {{through the use of a}} parametric study. Although this provided some indication of what is required it was found to be rather ambiguous. In an attempt to define a purpose to which the converted yacht could be specified, a passage plan for an extended cruise has been created. Some conclusions with regard to systems and equipment levels have been used to augment the information from the parametric study. Based on the information gathered, a specification has been created using manufacturers literature, drawings and information supplied by Challenge Business. Issues such as the addition of new systems, a new accommodation layout, vessel performance and behaviour, stability and the addition of watertight bulkheads have been considered and evaluated with the help of various software packages and guidance from the MCA code book for small commercial sailing vessels. To carry out a conversion project as described has significant implications in terms of cost and the time required. These issues have been examined and an estimate of both has been made in conjunction with a proposal for the sequence in which it should be carried out. The basis for the estimate is information <b>supplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers and input from industry specialists. The study concludes that a conversion as proposed is viable. Total converted vessel cost is not prohibitive providing the specification exactly fulfils the owners requirements. However there is unlikely to be significant profit in the conversion itself if the yacht is to remain saleable. The converted vessel would have a ‘general’ specification not tailored to an owner and considerable capital would be tied up for the duration of the project. For these reasons it is considered ideal for Challenge to sell the yachts as vessels which are suitable for conversion but not to undertake the conversion themselves...|$|E
