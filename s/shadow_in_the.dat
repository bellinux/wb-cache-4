5|$|Endtroducing..... is {{the debut}} studio album by American music {{producer}} DJ Shadow, released on September 16, 1996 by the British independent record label Mo' Wax Recordings. The album {{is known for}} being composed almost entirely of sampled content, most of which originated from various vinyl records obtained by DJ Shadow during trips to record shops. Endtroducing..... was produced by <b>Shadow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> span of two years using minimal amounts of equipment, most notably the Akai MPC60 sampler. In creating the album's overall atmosphere, he strived to capture the downbeat nature of his previous releases for the Mo' Wax label. The album's content features both moody, slow-paced tracks and upbeat jams reminiscent of DJ Shadow's early hip hop influences.|$|E

Channing Tatum and Ray Park also returned, as Duke and Snake Eyes, respectively. Rachel Nichols, the actress who played Scarlett in the first film, stated that most cast members would not be returning, except for the three aforementioned actors. In March 2011, Sienna Miller stated that she would not be returning for a sequel. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also confirmed {{that he would not be}} returning as Cobra Commander in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its <b>shadow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|Scully, who doesn't want {{to abandon}} her Christmas plans, follows Mulder {{into the house}} to {{retrieve}} her car keys from him, and {{the door to the}} mansion slams shut. Inside the house, the agents experience strange phenomena: creaks are heard in the ceiling from the upper floor, and the <b>shadow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of an old woman in a nightgown is seen, among other occurrences. Mulder and Scully reluctantly decide to investigate the floor above them. There, they find a massive library storing two corpses that have the same clothes and hairstyles as the agents, along with two gunshot wounds. They decide to go search other rooms, only to find that every door they walk through is the same library room they first entered. They then decide to split up, hoping {{to find a way out}} of the room.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the realm}} of tie-in {{speculative}} fiction, {{there was also an}} increase in LGBT representation. In particular, from 2001 onwards there was a concerted effort to explore this in licensed Star Trek literature. In the , the post-series novels following the end of the eponymous television series, a passing line in one series to a certain species, the Andorians, marrying in fours allowed the exploration of a quatri-gendered species, who partnered in broadly two 'male' and two 'female' species. Andrew J. Robinson's Garak novel, A Stitch in Time, suggested the omnisexuality of his character, which was followed up in subsequent novels, in particular Una McCormack's 2014 novel, The Crimson <b>Shadow.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> original series , created by Marco Palmieri and David Alan Mack, two of the main characters were a lesbian Vulcan officer and a lesbian Klingon intelligence agent.|$|E

The Seventh Doctor also met Hitler in the Virgin New Adventures novel , where Hitler was possessed by the powerful being known as the Timewyrm from pre-WW2 to 1940, learning to control its power before the Doctor tricked Hitler into banishing it by claiming that it was doing nothing to help him when in reality the Timewyrm's power was all that kept Hitler remotely stable {{in the early days of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|The Forsaken are the 13 most {{powerful}} channelers that {{went over to}} the Dark One in the age of legends, often commanding the armies of the <b>shadow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battles against the light. They were all sealed in Shayol Ghul, the location of the Bore during Lews Therin Telamon's sealing of the prison, where they did not age for over 3000 years due to its warping of time, save for those very close to the surface.They were each among the strongest channelers of their time, with Ishamael, the strongest, being rumored to equal Lews Therin in power. They also retained extensive knowledge of technology and weaves from their time that far outclass the current world's knowledge and subsequently, they are formidable creatures, viewing most modern Aes Sedai as laughably weak. In competition with each other for the Dark One's favor, the Forsaken distrust and fight each other as much as anyone else. The Forsaken refer to themselves as the Chosen. Though there may have been more in the Age of Legends, these are the only known Forsaken in this Age: Ishamael/Moridin, Lanfear/Cyndane, Moghedien, Graendal/Hessalam, Mesaana, Aginor/Osan'gar, Asmodean, Balthamel/Aran'gar, Be'lal, Rahvin, Sammael, Semirhage, Demandred, M'Hael (recent). All the Forsaken, particularly Semirhage, are widely feared by most, with their names being used to scare children into being good.|$|E
