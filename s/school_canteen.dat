500|$|Peggy Gallagher {{acquired}} a legal notice of separation {{from her husband}} in 1976. Six years later, she finally left him, taking the three boys with her. As teenagers, the Gallagher brothers (especially Noel) were regular truants, often getting into trouble with the police. When his mother took a job working in the <b>school</b> <b>canteen,</b> Gallagher ensured that he stopped by to visit her during lunch before skipping {{the rest of the}} day. He was expelled from school at the age of 15 for throwing a bag of flour over a teacher. He used to hang around with the football hooligan firms Maine Line Crew, Under-5s, and Young Guvnors in the 1980s, and at the age of 13, he received six months' probation for robbing a corner shop. It was during this period of probation, with little else to do, that he first began to teach himself to play a guitar his father had left him, playing his favourite songs from the radio. Gallagher was particularly inspired by the debut of The Smiths on Top of the Pops in 1983, performing their single [...] "This Charming Man". He later reflected that [...] "from that day on ... wanted to be Johnny Marr". He also appeared (and scored) for Manchester Gaelic football outfit CLG Oisín at Croke Park, Dublin in 1983.|$|E
500|$|Louis-Joseph Antoine {{was born}} on 7 June 1846 in Mons-Crotteux, Belgium {{at a place called}} [...] "In the Chapel", the {{youngest}} of a large family, which belonged to the Roman Catholic Church. His mother was Catherine Castille, born in 1797. He was raised in the Priesse street and attended primary school in Mons. From the age of twelve, Louis was employed as a coal miner, {{following in the footsteps of}} his father. One day, while working at the mine, his lamp went out without apparent reason, which he interpreted as a divine sign that he should abandon this work. He worked for two years in the mine, then was a steelworker in the Cockerill factory in Seraing. He was enrolled in the militia of Belgium in 1866, and filled his military obligations in Bruges. During the Franco-Prussian War, he accidentally killed a comrade; although there was no legal action, this event led him to question the meaning of life. After marrying Jeanne Catherine Collon on 15 April 1873, while he was a hammerer, he became the father of a son, Louis Martin Joseph, born in Hamborn, Prussia on 23 September 1873, and baptized five days later in the Catholic Church of St. John. Then the family went to Belgium in August 1876, where Antoine bought a horse and became a vegetable vendor. In 1878, he began to suffer from recurring stomach aches. In February 1879, he returned to Poland where he was hired as hammerer chief by Mr. Pastor in the Pragua steelworks; there his wife ran a <b>school</b> <b>canteen.</b> Five years later, the family moved to Jemeppe-sur-Meuse (Belgium), where he built twenty houses for workers. On 5 February 1886, Antoine was sentenced to a fine of two francs on the grounds of physical violence on Denis Collon on 10 October 1885. Until 1900, he was a portier and a collector of Lexhy factory.|$|E

The school at Angram village was closed by June 1916, and the population was depleted. A certificate of completion was awarded to John Best & Sons on 4 August 1917. For a contract worth £365,493, and lasting fourteen years, it had overrun by just £7,267, which included the cost of some large granite rocks, located near the dam for decoration. Bradford Corporation had already obtained an Act in 1913, allowing them to abandon their plans for a reservoir at High Woodale, and instead to build a much larger one at Scar House. It would submerge the site of Haden Carr reservoir, and the Act allowed them to start construction [...] "when appropriate". The cost of the new works was estimated at £2,161,500, and although three tenders were received, they decided on 14 May 1920 to build it themselves, using direct labour. Scar village was built between 1920 and 1921, consisting of ten hostels for a total of 640 men, a <b>school,</b> <b>canteen,</b> recreation room, concert hall, mission church and some bungalows.|$|E

In the interest of following nutrition doses, there {{has been set up}} so called consumer basket of foodstuffs. The theoretical part focuses on explaining of the term of school nourishment and form. The main aim of my diploma work was to appraise variety of school lunches in chosen <b>school</b> <b>canteens</b> according to months menus from the nutritious point of view. Partial targets were focused on assessing the quality of lunches according to the consumer baskets of foodstuffs and appraising the method of <b>school</b> <b>canteens</b> of drawing up their menus. In the practical part there has been presented own research and its results. The research for this diploma work started in November 2012 and finished in February 2013. Practical part of this research was worked out on the base of quality research. The choice of searched subjects happened with the aid of pure intentional research. The data file was constituted by menus from December 2012, January 2013 and February 2013 and by the consumer baskets of foodstuff for the same season. The analyses of variety of foodstuffs and was supplemented by half-structured interview. I prepared five researching questions before assessment of the research that were answered during the research. These questions were: ?Do the coefficients of variety of foodstuffs agree with the criteria of <b>canteens?</b> ? ?Do the <b>school</b> <b>canteens</b> fulfil the set up norms for recommended fulfilling of the months consumer basket of foodstuffs? ? Does the management of the <b>school</b> <b>canteens</b> follow the recommended principles of a healthy diet while preparing their menus? ?Do <b>school</b> <b>canteens</b> provide various structures of recipes, dishes and technologies? ? ?Can the offer of dishes in <b>school</b> <b>canteens</b> be improved? In the first part I firstly concentrated on appraisal of variety of soups in <b>school</b> <b>canteens.</b> The variety was appraised on a month bases for each canteen. Next I focused on appraisal of variety of main dishes, side dishes and food supplements. The results were registered in well arranged charts. The next part of diploma work focuses on appraisal of consumer foodstuffs baskets. The last part contains interview with the management of <b>school</b> <b>canteens.</b> I have also managed to get answers to asked research questions so I could set down hypothesis. According to the answers I set three hypotheses. The first one is: ?The chosen <b>school</b> <b>canteens</b> from South district provide their diners with various foods and follow the principles of a healthy diet. ? I came up to this hypothesis while looking for answers to researching questions focused on variety and composition menus. The answers to the research questions helped me in formulation the second and third hypothesis: ?<b>School</b> <b>canteens</b> fulfil set up norms for recommended month consumer foodstuffs basket for commodity meat, milk, dairy products, free fat, free sugar, vegetables and potatoes. Third hypothesis was formulated as follows: ?<b>School</b> <b>canteens</b> don´t fulfil set up norms for recommended month consumer foodstuffs basket for commodity fruit and legume. The management of these canteens get further education in the area according to the interviews. I think that this diploma work can be used as an information material for educating workers in the area of nourishment. The results can be useful as a source of information for workers in <b>school</b> <b>canteens...</b>|$|R
