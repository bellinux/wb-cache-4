India has seen rapid increase in the number of players which caused the tariff rates to hit an all time low. This allowed the players to target the low income population thereby increasing the market share. The availability of a number of <b>subscriber</b> <b>options</b> for consumers and varied tariff rates of each player, lead the consumers to switch between service providers. The objectives of the study are to find the factors that influence the consumers in switching the service provider and to delve into finding out the likeliness of switching the service provider. The type of research used for this study is descriptive research design. The area covered under this study was Chennai due to availability of well mixed population base in Tamil Nadu. A well structured questionnaire was designed and administered to collect samples across Chennai. Due to high population and need for variety of respondents, Cluster Sampling method was chosen. The sample size was 112. The variables considered for the study are Consumer demographics, Consumer satisfaction with existing service provider, Factors influencing the switching behaviour and factors that affect the switching behaviour of consumers and these were grouped into 4 categories namely customer service, service problems, usage cost and others. The results from the study reveal that call rates plays the most important role in switching the service provider followed by network coverage, value added service and customer care while advertisement plays the least important role. It is found that there is a relation between switching the service provider and the factors (customer service, service problem, usage cost, etc.).

40|$|Juan Pablo âJ. P. â Perez founded his J & P Organics Community Supported Agriculture {{program in}} 2006, {{while he was}} a college student, with a {{subscriber}} cohort of five friends and advertisements on Craigslist and a campus electronic marketplace. Today, Perez employs his parents and siblings in his expanding farm enterprise, which serves about 300 (and growing) CSA subscribers in towns as geographically and economically disparate as Prunedale, Pacific Grove, and Palo Alto. J & P Organics offers an unusually generous roster of <b>subscriber</b> <b>options,</b> including home delivery for all customers and a choice of pay-as-you-go weekly, alternate-weeks, or monthly orders. Customers who grow their own vegetables can opt to receive boxes only during the months when their gardens lie fallow. Perezâs CSA boxes contain a colorful variety of fruits and vegetables, plus optional fresh eggs and flowersâand he has plans to include more exotic variety in future shares. He also delivers to restaurants and sells at farmersâ markets, where he creates eye-catching displays to attract customers. In his mid-twenties, Perez is one of the youngest organic farmers to run such a burgeoning enterprise. His success testifies not only to his dedication, skills, and entrepreneurial savvy, but also to the effectiveness of the program that mentored him and his father in organic farming: the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA). The son of Mexican-born parents, J. P. was born in Salinas, California, in 1983. When the young Perez was a teenager, his father, who was growing raspberries and cut flowers on five acres of leased land in Watsonville, offered him the choice of working full time with him in the fields, or concentrating on school. Fully aware of the hard work and low pay he could expect as a farmer, J. P. opted for school and opportunities for alternative employment. As it turned out, Perezâs academic career took him full circle. After trying a variety of majors at California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), he gravitated toward earth systems science and policy. This field of study led him into two internships with ALBA and another at Serendipity Farms in Carmel Valley. Eventually, J. P. persuaded his father, Pablo (the âPâ in âJ & Pâ) to enroll with him in ALBAâs Programa Educativa para PequeÃ±os Agricultores (PEPA), which trains small farmers in organic production methods and marketing techniques. Pablo and his wife, Florencia, now oversee most of the farming operation on acreage that the family leases from ALBA, while J. P. takes primary responsibility for sales and marketing. The family hopes to buy its own farmland, where they aim to raise livestock and orchards as well as row crops. Sarah Rabkin interviewed J. P. Perez on June 22 nd, 2009, at Rabkinâs home in Soquel, California...|$|R

Uddevalla Energi ElnÃ¤t AB har sedan 30 Ã¥r haft effektkondensatorbatterier inkopplade nÃ¤stan hela Ã¥ret och dessa behÃ¶ver av Ã¥ldersskÃ¤l snart bytas ut. Uddevalla Energi ElnÃ¤t AB har dÃ¤rfÃ¶r behov av nya rutiner fÃ¶r driftlÃ¤ggning av effektkondensatorbatterier efter det att Svenska KraftnÃ¤t och Vattenfall AB har infÃ¶rt nya regler fÃ¶r de reaktiva effektflÃ¶dena i elnÃ¤tet. I utredningen om effektkondensatorbatterier har det gjorts en investeringskalkyl med tre alternativ fÃ¶r inkÃ¶p. Alternativ 1 med central faskompensering pÃ¥ mottagningsstation, alternativ 2 med faskompensering pÃ¥ mottagningsstation kompletterat med faskompensering pÃ¥ abonnentstationer och alternativ 3 med lokal faskompensering pÃ¥ abonnentstationer. Â  Det framkom i utredningen att alternativ 2 : Central faskompensering kompletterat med faskompensering pÃ¥ abonnentstationer Ã¤r mest lÃ¤mplig att genomfÃ¶ra. Â Â  Det har tidigare konstaterats att det under delar av Ã¥ret har varit lÃ¥g belastning pÃ¥ nÃ¥gra av mottagningsstationernas transformatorer. Det har aldrig utretts om det Ã¤r lÃ¶nsamt att stÃ¤nga av den ena transformatorn under hela eller delar av Ã¥ret. I utredningen om driftlÃ¤ggning av transformatorerna pÃ¥ mottagningsstationerna har det beaktats tre alternativ. Ett alternativ innebÃ¤r att en transformator kÃ¶rs i tomgÃ¥ng utan last och ett alternativ med en helt avstÃ¤ngd transformator. Det tredje alternativet Ã¤r att inte gÃ¶ra nÃ¥gon fÃ¶rÃ¤ndring. I utredningen framkom det att det mest lÃ¤mpliga Ã¤r att inte gÃ¶ra nÃ¥gon fÃ¶rÃ¤ndring eftersom riskerna med avstÃ¤ngning Ã¤r stÃ¶rre Ã¤n den ekonomiska vinsten pÃ¥ c:a 101000 SEK. This report {{contains a}} study of power flows in Uddevalla Energi AB receiving stations and optimization of the operation control of its power capacitor batteries and transformers. For the past thirty years, Uddevalla Energi AB has employed power capacitor batteries almost all year around and these need soon to be replaced due to ageing. Uddevalla Energi ElnÃ¤t AB {{has a need for}} new procedures for the operation control of the power capacitor batteries following new regulations introduced by Svenska KraftnÃ¤t and Vattenfall AB for reactive power flows on the grid. In the study of power capacitor batteries, there has been an investment calculation with three alternative purchase options. Option one is central phase compensation at the receiving station, option two is phase compensation at the receiving station supplemented with phase compensation at <b>subscriber</b> stations and <b>option</b> three is a local phase compensation at subscriber stations. The investment calculation shows that the second option: Central phase compensation supplemented with phase compensation at subscriber stations is the most favourable to implement. It has previously been found that, during certain times of the year, there has been a low load on some of the transformers of the receiving stations. It has never been investigated if it is profitable to turn off one of the transformer for the entire, or part of the year. In the investigation of the operation control of the transformers at the receiving stations, three alternatives have been considered. One alternative is that one transformer is in idle operation without load, the second alternative is that one transformer is completely turned off. The third alternative is to make no change. The study showed that the preferred alternative is to make no change, because the risks of turning off transformers are greater than the economic gain, that is approximately 101000 SEK...|$|R
