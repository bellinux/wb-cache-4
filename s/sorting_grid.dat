40|$|Trials for the {{determination}} of the magnitude of bycatch reduction by sorting grids used in the commercial brown shrimp fishery were carried out from September to December 1997. Trawls with 9 m beam length were used on different fishing grounds in the estuary of the Elbe River near Cuxhaven. The sorting grids tested were made of stainless steel bars spaced at 18, 20, 22, 26 and 30 mm, built into a cylindrical stainless steel frame with a diameter of 65 cm at an angle of attack of 45 degrees. This frame was positioned between the forenet and codend. Simultaneous hauls were made with a trawl of equal construction but without a <b>sorting</b> <b>grid,</b> and the weighed catch components (fish, discard shrimps and commercial size shrimps) separated by means of a riddle were compared. The composition of the sorted out part of the catch of the <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> net could be calculated by comparise the corresponding catch components in both the standard trawl and the <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> trawl.

40|$|Research PaperThe Training Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center has {{completed}} {{a wide range}} of experimental fishing trials on the use of Juvenile and Trash Excluder Devices (JTEDs) over recent years. These trials have investigated the effectiveness of the rigid <b>sorting</b> <b>grid,</b> rectangular window and semi-curved window JTEDs in releasing juveniles of commercially important fish species and trash fish from demersal fish trawling operations. Experimentation began in Thai waters adjacent to the Provinces of Chumpon and Prachuap Kirikhan in 1998. This initial work led to the identification of the rigid <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> device as an effective tool in the exclusion of juvenile and trash fish from fish trawls. Further experimentation focusing on the effects of grid spacing on the performance of this JTED was completed in Brunei Darussalam and Vietnam during 2000 and 2001. In September 2001, the rigid <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> JTED was the subject of experimental fishing trials in Malaysian waters. This work focused on the effects of grid spacing and day/night influences on JTED performance, highlighting that a grid spacing of 1. 2 cm is highly effective in reducing capture of juveniles and trash fish in fishing areas adjacent to the Malaysian Peninsular. JTED performance was also generally greater during day-time fishing trials. More recently, the Training Department {{has completed}} trials in the waters of Indonesia and the Philippines. In 2002, results from Indonesia suggested that the rigid <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> device with the 4 cm spaced <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> achieves the highest releasing rates of juvenile and trash fish in the Arafura Sea region of Eastern Indonesia. In 2003, investigations completed in the Philippines highlighted that the rigid <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> device with a grid spacing greater than 1 cm is generally more effective in the exclusion of juvenile and trash fish than the rectangular and semi-curved window JTEDs. During 2004, demonstration and experiments on the use of JTEDs will be completed in Myanmar and Cambodia to provide a complete coverage of relevant SEAFDEC Member countries. Researchers are confident that the above mentioned activities have been effective in developing regional understanding of the use of JTEDs. All work has been completed in close collaboration with the fisheries departments of the Member countries involved in the project. This has been effective in building capacity for regional governments and fisheries personnel to be responsive to the needs of fishers as they move toward the development of more sustainable fish trawl practices...|$|E

A total of 288 valid hauls and 67 commercial species were caught. Escapement and escape size selectivity were evaluated for the most important target and by-catch species. A decrease {{in the percentage of}} biomass escape was recorded with increasing grid spacing for the two target species, deep-water rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), from 24 % to 8 % for the former and from 86 to 9 % for the latter, with a 15 -mm and 30 -mm grid respectively. In general, high escape rates were found for most finfish and cephalopods. For hake (Merluccius merluccius), as the main by-catch species, the results showed an escape rate decreasing from 96 % to 71 % as the bar spacing increased.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{considerable}} efforts {{in recent years}} to modify fishing gears and practices to target particular sizes and species of fish and other marine organisms more efficiently, as well as to have less impact on bottom habitats. Recent developments in navigational aids and instruments for improving the classification of bottom habitats enables the fishing industry to harvest target resources more efficiently and to reduce impacts on benthic habitats and their communities. These changes hold promise for the achievement of broader ecosystem objectives, such as maintaining species and ecosystem diversities. This paper provides a review of successful developments and applications of selective fishing techniques that have been used to achieve ecosystem objectives. For example, the introduction of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in shrimp trawls has dramatically reduced mortality of endangered sea turtles; the declines of the by-catches and discards of finfish in many shrimp trawl fisheries has mainly been the result of the <b>sorting</b> <b>grids</b> and square mesh panels introduced in these fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Using {{experimental}} data {{and a model}} to predict size selection based on morphological data, we investigated size selection of redfish (Sebastes spp.) in the grid-based selection systems used in Northeast Atlantic trawls. We found that not all redfish make physical contact with the spacing between the bars in the <b>sorting</b> <b>grids</b> while they pass {{in the direction of}} the codend, and therefore the escapement of some undersized redfish depends on size selection in the codend.

We demonstrated that for one of the two grid systems investigated the increase in size selection obtained experimentally by increasing grid-bar spacing is well in line with what could be expected based on the morphology of redfish. However, the size selection observed experimentally was significantly lower than the size-selective potential of the grids estimated based on the morphology of redfish. By computer simulations, we show that a possible explanation for this difference could be that not all redfish that attempt to escape through the grid make their attempt with an optimal angle of attack...|$|R

A bioeconomic model, based on a cohort model of the Baranov-Beverton-Holt type, has been designed for tins purpose. Since fishing gear with perfect selectivity is not available, simulation experiments were used to derive the bioeconomic results. Norwegian costs and earnings data were used. The analysis shows that the Sort-X system performs better than traditional trawl, and that the 1995 improvements of Sort-X yield a system which performs better than the 1990 - 1992 Sort-X.

Alternate hauls {{were used to assess}} the selectivity of 36 -mm square-mesh codend. Selectivity of sorting grids was assessed using a double codend in which fish that escaped through the grid were captured in the lower codend while other fish were guided into the upper codend. The mean selection length (L 50) for European hake was 18. 5 cm and that for the Atlantic horse mackerel was 14. 0 cm with the 36 -mm square-mesh codend. These values are close to their current minimum landing sizes (20 cm for hake and 12 cm for horse mackerel). The <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> with 20 -mm bar spacing showed L 50 value of 13. 3 cm for hake, suggesting that a larger grid-spacing would be needed to obtain sufficient sorting performance. Similarly, for Atlantic mackerel the estimated L 50 of 14. 3 cm indicates that larger grid spacing is required to attain an L 50 that would be close to the current MLS (18 cm). For Atlantic horse mackerel and red mullet, the L 50 obtained with the <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> with 20 -mm bar spacing was close to the MLS of these species (the MLS of red mullet is 11 cm). The selectivity of the <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> with 15 -mm bar spacing was generally very poor. Size-selection performance of sorting grids was assessed {{for the first time in}} the local fisheries. In order to effectively improve size-selection, seasonal and depth-dependent differences between target and by-catch species must be taken into account, which is a good indicator of the difficulty of implementing a single mesh size or grid spacing in the Mediterranean demersal trawl fishery...|$|E

The designs tested (design-A and design-B) were developed following a collaborative workshop held between gear researchers and Pacific hake fishing industry participants. Tests occurred off Oregon and Washington during 2012 aboard the F/V Perseverance. A recapture net was used to quantify the escapement of Pacific hake and nontarget species. Both designs retained a relatively high proportion of Pacific hake (> 93 %). However, the two designs did not perform equally with design-B being much more effective at reducing bycatch. Results showed rockfish bycatch was reduced by 70. 2 % under design-B and only 15. 4 % under design-A. For both designs, the mean lengths of Pacific hake caught between the codend and the recapture net did not differ significantly. A reduction in the catch of Pacific halibut and Chinook salmon, which are prohibited take species, was also noted.

Two experiments were carried out using the covered codend method; the first used different mesh sizes (56 and 70 mm, knot-centre to knot-centre) and shapes (diamond and square), and the second tested different reduction devices (escape panel and <b>sorting</b> <b>grid).</b> We analysed the escape proportions of the species caught and the size frequency distributions of the target species and Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi), the main commercial bycatch species. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to significantly reduce bycatch while keeping losses within acceptable ranges. In particular, the best option for yellow squat lobster was the combination of a 70 -mm diamond mesh with an escape panel that reduced non-target and target catches by 48 % and 7 %, respectively. For nylon shrimp, the best option was the use of a 56 -mm diamond mesh with a <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> that reduced non-target and target catches by 41 % and 11 %, respectively.

Taking {{into account the}} recent very low SSB and the recruitment failure together with the absence of golden redfish in the Greenland surveys, the stock of golden redfish in Subarea 1 {{is considered to be}} severely depleted with no signs of recovery.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} engineering of algo-rithms for computing visibility maps on massive grid ter-rains. Given a terrain T, specified by the elevations of points in a regular grid, and given a viewpoint v, the visibility map or viewshed of v is the set of grid points of T that are visible from v. We describe three new algorithms to compute the viewshed for any given terrain T and viewpoint v. The first two algorithms “sweep ” the terrain by rotating a ray around the viewpoint while maintaining the terrain profile along the ray. On a terrain of n grid points, these algorithms run in O(n logn) time and O(sort(n)) I/Os in the I/O-model of Aggarwal and Vitter. The difference be-tween the two algorithms is in the preprocessing before the sweep: the first algorithm <b>sorts</b> the <b>grid</b> points into concen-tric bands around the viewpoint; the second algorithm <b>sorts</b> the <b>grid</b> points into sectors around the viewpoint. The third algorithm sweeps the terrain centrifugally, growing a star-shaped region around the viewpoint while maintaining the approximate visible horizon of the terrain within the swept region. This algorithm runs in O(n) time and O(scan(n)) I/Os and is cache-oblivious. We tested our algorithms on NASA SRTM data, and found that our fastest new algorithm computes the viewshed of a terrain of 7. 6 billion points (28. 4 GiB) in 203 minutes on a machine with 0. 5 GiB RAM and a laptop-speed hard drive.

We conclude that the observed mortality of haddock is confounded by methodological problems, particularly the instability of the observation cages, and does not reflect the true escape mortality.

To evaluate square meshes and <b>sorting</b> <b>grids</b> as successful size-selective bycatch reduction devices in finfish trawls, we conducted a simulated trawling experiment to assess the effects of illumination, towing speed and mesh or grid orientation on the escape behaviour of undersized fish through square meshes and rigid grids. Juvenile masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) with average body length 13 cm were used as the experimental fish. A speed-controllable motor was used to tow the framed net in a circular water tank. An infrared CCD (charge-coupled devices) camera fixed to the towed net by means of a rotary connector was used to observe fish behaviour. In contrast to the active escape seen under lighted conditions, there was no active voluntary escape under dark conditions. As a result, no fish escaped through parallel and backward-sloping meshes, and only 13 % of fish escaped through the forward-sloping meshes when the towing speed was increased. On the other hand, the encounter probability and passive escape through the longer openings in the backward-sloping grid increased under the dark condition, resulting in the highest escape ratio. This increased from 67 to 87 % on increasing the towing speed from 1 to 1. 5 knots, and shortened the swimming time before escaping from 5 to 1. 5 min (the highest escape ratio and the shortest swimming time before escaping under the dark condition). Frame-by-frame analysis of some escape events demonstrated easy, passive fish escape through the grids with no change in the normal swimming direction. The results support the backward-sloping grid as an efficient bycatch-reduction device, especially in demersal trawling when placed well ahead of the codend, working in the dark at high towing speeds...|$|R

40|$|Mortalities and {{injuries}} of the gadoids haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus L.), cod (Gadus morhua L.) and saithe (Pollachius virens L.) were studied after codend and grid escapement in two full scale trials in 2000 and 2001 in the Barents Sea. The escaped fish were sampled using small meshed cages. Trawl caught controls were sampled {{by removing the}} cod end and attaching the cage directly to the cod end extension. In the 2001 trial, control fish were sampled in fish traps in addition. Acoustic closing and releasing devices were used to time the sampling. Survival rates of cod and saithe escaping through codend and <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> were 100 %. Mortality of haddock were 26. 2 to 50. 4 % (codend escapees), 1. 6 to 20 % (grid escapees), 4. 1 to 26. 5 % (trawl caught controls) and 0 % (trap caught controls). The haddock mortality {{and injuries}} decreased with increasing fish length in all groups, with a mortality peek of the mesh escapees with girth approximately the mesh size circumference. Cod and saithe had significantly less skin and fin injuries than haddock, and in general, frequency of skin injuries increased towards the tail. Grid escaped gadoids had significantly less skin and fin damages than the mesh and control groups...|$|E
40|$|The Mediterranean fishery has {{experienced}} a decline in catches over the past 20 years due to an excessive increase in effort caused by both increased trawler engine power and rapid technological advances in fishing technology and fish location. This has led to overexploitation, in which immature individuals support an increasing portion of the catches. The present study was undertaken to test a <b>sorting</b> <b>grid</b> and square-mesh-panel as juvenile exclusion systems. Our experience was a pilot study of such a system in the western Mediterranean. The purpose of these exclusion systems was to help juvenile hake escape from the net. The results demonstrate {{that the use of}} sorting grids for small fish in trawl gears in the Mediterranean is an efficient and practical means of avoiding the capture and discarding of unwanted individuals, with escape rates of over 50 % (ranging between 50 and 90 %). The grids were efficient and useful for excluding hake (Merluccius merluccius) on bottoms located at depths between 50 and 300 m, where hake are found all year round. A bar spacing of 20 mm yielded escape rates of L 50 at 18. 8 cm TL (L 25 = 16. 8 cm and L 75 = 20. 9 cm). Panels made of square meshes achieved poorer results than the grids. The grid system was effective for most of the species caught in the study area...|$|E
40|$|The {{axisymmetric}} {{form of the}} hydrodynamic equations {{within the}} smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formalism is presented and checked using idealized scenarios taken from astrophysics (free fall collapse, implosion and further pulsation of a Sun-like star), gas dynamics (wall heating problem, collision of two streams of gas) and inertial confinement fusion (ablative implosion of a small capsule). New material concerning the standard SPH formalism is given. That includes the numerical handling of those mass points which move close to the singularity axis, more accurate expressions for the artificial viscosity and the heat conduction term and {{an easy way to}} incorporate self-gravity in the simulations. The algorithm developed to compute gravity does not rely in any <b>sort</b> of <b>grid,</b> leading to a numerical scheme totally compatible with the Lagrangian nature of the SPH equations.

Towards this objective, we use the java ProActive grid technology. We first present some of the challenges to turn such an autonomic management system initially dedicated to distributed applications running on clusters of machines, into one that can provide self-management capabilities to large-scale systems, i. e. deployed on grid infrastructures. This leads us to a brief {{state of the art}} on grid monitoring systems. Then, we recall the architecture of Jade, and consequently propose to reorganize it in a potentially more scalable way. Practical experiments pertain {{to the use of the}} grid deployment feature offered by ProActive to easily conduct the deployment of the Jade system or its revised version on any <b>sort</b> of <b>grid...</b>|$|R
