5|$|However, {{safety issues}} {{continue}} to be a persistent problem in Indonesian aviation. Several accidents have given Indonesia's air transport system the reputation of the least <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, outdated, and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, haze problems caused by plantation fires, and volcanic ash spewed by numerous area volcanoes that disrupts air transportation.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{that the}} plains Indians {{would have no}} {{experience}} on water, the townspeople fled prudently from the Comanche raiders {{to the safety of}} the water. They were saved by remaining aboard small boats and a schooner captained by William G. Marshall, which was at anchor in the bay. While <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, the refugees witnessed the destruction and looting of their town, unable to do a thing except curse them.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over {{the next two weeks}} the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was {{much more difficult to}} fly than had been expected, and would not be <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of an inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|In July 1863, {{during the}} New York Draft Riots, Irish rioters {{attacked}} and burned down the orphan asylum. The children were {{saved by the}} staff and Union troops in the city. During its nearly 30 years, the orphan asylum had admitted 1310 children, and typically had about 200 in residence at a time. After the riots, Smith moved his family and business out of Manhattan, as did other prominent blacks. Numerous buildings were destroyed in their old neighborhoods, and estimates were that 100 blacks {{were killed in the}} rioting. No longer feeling <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower Fourth Ward, the Smiths moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|The Latchkey is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The premise of the plot focuses on two businessmen who are friends Will (or Bill in some publications) and John. Will gives John {{the key to his}} apartment so he had stay there while Will goes on vacation. The landlady of the house leases the apartment to two ladies. John decides to go to Will's apartment and lets himself in with the key and finds the two girls asleep. They awake and take him for a burglar and threaten to kill him and John pleads for mercy instead of addressing the misunderstanding. John is later revealed to be her employer after he is caught opening a <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> office the next morning. The film was released on August 26, 1910 and was met with positive reviews by the trade publications. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|While {{classified}} as generally recognized as <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US, juniper berries may have various side effects {{that have not}} been tested extensively in clinical trials. Mainly due to an increased risk of miscarriage, even in small doses, consuming juniper berries may affect pregnant or breastfeeding women and people with diabetes, bleeding disorders or after surgery. In traditional medicine, juniper berries were used for female birth control. In an in vitro study, juniper essential oil was studied for its possible antimicrobial and antifungal properties.|$|E

5|$|The Joint Communique was not {{implemented}} {{and the situation}} continued to deteriorate, particularly after the Ngô family ordered South Vietnam's Special Forces to attack Buddhist pagodas across the country on 21 August. The U.S. condemned the raids, and began to cut aid to the Special Forces, which was effectively a private Ngô family army, {{in addition to other}} government programs that were closely identified with the ruling clan. Regarding such gestures as a green light, and <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knowledge that the US would not intervene in Diệm's defense, the army staged a successful coup in November, resulting in the assassination of the president. The removal of Diệm resulted in a period of political instability, as a series of military juntas deposed one another. This led to a deterioration in the military situation as the communist Viet Cong made substantial gains against the ARVN, prompting the US to deploy hundreds of thousands of combat troops in 1965, escalating the Vietnam War.|$|E
