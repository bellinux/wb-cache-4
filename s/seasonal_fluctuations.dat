40|$|The Federal Reserve's role as {{a lender}} of last resort may explain why the <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of {{interest}} rates appeared to decline around 1914.

40|$|Recently, it is {{required}} to investigate the spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas on a regional scale for not only the improvement of urban environment but also the conservation of ecosystem. In addition, the <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of vegetation should be also analyzed because the vegetation distribution {{can be used for}} urban landscape management. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the spatial distribution and <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of vegetation on a regional scale. We defined the NDVI calculated from four kinds of Landsat ETM+ data as the potential of vegetation abundance and applied them to the spatial analysis using local spatial autocorrelation. As the results, it was obvious that the areas of high NDVI were extracted independently of <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> while there were various kinds of the extractions depended on <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> We discussed the integration of the seasonal information on the spatial features of vegetation. 1.

25|$|Except during World War I Afghanistan's foreign {{exchange}} rate has been freely determined by market forces. However, for some periods, a dual exchange rate regime existed in Afghanistan: an official exchange rate which was fixed by the Afghan Central Bank, and a free market exchange rate which {{was determined by the}} supply and demand forces in Kabul's money bazaar called Saraye Shahzada. For example, {{in order to avoid the}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in the exchange rate, a fixed exchange rate was adopted in 1935 by the Bank-e Milli, which was then responsible for the country's exchange rate system and official reserves. Bank-e Milli agreed to exchange afghanis at 4 Afs against 1 Indian rupee in 1935. After the establishment of Da Afghanistan Bank as the Central Bank of Afghanistan, such a preferential official fixed exchange rate continued to be practiced. Although Da Afghanistan Bank tried to keep its official rate close to the Saraye Shahzada's exchange rate, the gap between the official and free-market exchange rates widened in the 1980s and during the civil war.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{selection}} {{in an environment}} produces reproductive success, which benefits the species. Speciation {{is a process of}} evolution through which new biological species are formed. Dobzhansky studied the specifics of sexual, physiological, and behavioral isolating mechanisms in Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila paulistrorum. Like many of his other studies, Dobzhansky's work on reproductive isolation was aimed at studying the process of evolution in action. Bringing samples from each population back into the laboratory, Dobzhansky showed that he could vary environmental conditions so as to produce the same changes in frequency of inversion patterns that were observed with changing seasons in the field. Dobzhansky concluded that such <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuations</b> were the result of natural selection at work, with temperature acting as the selecting agent. These masterful studies provided concrete support for the theory of natural selection, at the same time illustrating the fruitfulness of combining field and laboratory work in the study of evolution. Adaptive evolution occurs through the dominance and survival of competing genes within a species. This is caused by increasing the frequency of those alleles whose phenotypic effects selfishly promote their own reproduction. He also believed new species could not arise from single mutations and must be isolated from others of its species by time, geography, habitat, or breeding season.|$|E

Method The monthly TB notification data in Hong Kong from 1991 to 2002 were examined for <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> A <b>seasonal</b> model was then developed after standardization by period, sex, age, history of TB, form of disease, and bacteriological status. Results The raw monthly counts showed remarkably consistent <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> across different periods, sexes, and age groups. A sine model was fitted for 82 104 notifications (adjusted R 2 = 0. 373, P 0. 001). A summer peak was observed with <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of 18. 4 % (P 0. 001), which was substantially higher than that reported previously for temperate regions.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) are more frequently born in spring {{when compared to}} autumn. Fluctuation of UV-light has been hypothesized to drive this phenomenon. Aim: To assess the correlation between fluctuation of sunlight and birth season in persons with MS. Methods: For this record-linkage study, we collected from the international MSBase and the Italian MS iMed-web databases the dates of birth of 11, 415 patients with MS from 36 centres from 15 countries worldwide and compared these to dates of live-births from national registries. From all participating sites, we collected data on UV-light fluctuation and assessed its correlation with <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in MS births. Results: Compared with the reference cohort, an increased proportion of persons with MS were born in spring and a decreased proportion in autumn (odds ratio (OR) to be born in spring versus autumn = 1. 158, χ 2 = 36. 347, P trend = 0. 086). Conclusion: <b>Seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of MS births as found in this worldwide cohort of patients with MS did not correlate with variation in <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of UV-light. Most likely, it results from a complex interplay between fluctuation of sunlight, behavioural factors, other environmental factors and (epi) genetic factors...|$|R

Studies show that it is of instructive significance to study the law of cycle fluctuation of coal production for formulating a reasonable coal resource developing plan and guaranteeing the coal supply.
