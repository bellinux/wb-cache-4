40|$|A <b>simple</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> reader {{system is}} a system {{consisting}} of a reader & card/s, where the information stored in the card is retrieved & decoded by the reader & further can be processed as per need of application. A Smart Card is a standard credit cardsized plastic intelligent token in which a microchip, including microcontroller and memory, has been embedded within its body and which makes it ‘smart’. It provides not only memory capacity, but computational capability as well and thus the chip is capable of processing data. There are contact & contact –less type smart cards. New information and applications can be added depending on the chip capabilities. In this paper, a general reader design is presented which works in synchronism with a smart card hardware. The code is described in VHDL at RTL level. This HDL design is implemented on Spartan- 3 E FPGA & its performance is verified...|$|E
40|$|European {{urban areas}} are marred by the {{problems}} of congestion and environmental degradation due to the prevailing levels of car use. Strong arguments have thus been put forward {{in support of a}} policy based on marginal cost pricing (European Commission 1996). Such policy measures – which would force private consumers to pay for a public service that was previously provided «for free» – are, however, notoriously unpopular with the general public and hence also with their elected representatives – the politicians. There is thus an obvious tension between economic theory, which suggests that marginal cost pricing is the welfare maximising solution to urban transport problems, and practical experience, which suggests that such pricing measures are unwanted by the affected population and hence hard to implement through democratic processes. The AFFORD Project for the European Commission has aimed to investigate this paradox and its possible solutions, through a combination of economic analysis, predictive modelling, attitudinal surveys, and an assessment of fiscal and financial measures within a number of case study cities in Europe. In this paper the methodology and results obtained for the Edinburgh case study are reported in detail. The study analyses alternative road pricing instruments and compares their performance against the theoretical first best situation. It discusses the effect of coverage, location, charging mechanism and interaction with other instruments. The paper shows that limited coverage in one mode may lead to a deviation from the user pays principle in other modes, that location is as important as charge levels and that assumptions about the use of revenues are critical in determining the effect on equity and acceptability. Finally the results show that a relatively <b>simple</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> system can come close to providing the economic first best solution, but that this result should be viewed {{in the context of the}} model assumptions...|$|E

Among others, time redundancy is a good candidate to offer a low hardware cost. The main disadvantage of this scheme is high extra time due to the recomputation. However, this impact can be considerably reduced by exploiting idle hardware in the ALU.

40|$|This {{document}} outlines various {{available and}} emerging {{information and communication}} technologies (ICTs) and provides a framework to assess how these technologies may be used to improve the efficiency of the delivery of safety net programs. These technologies include: mobile computing, biometrics, satellite communications, <b>simple</b> and <b>smart</b> <b>cards,</b> global positioning systems, radio frequency identification tags, automated teller machines and solar power. Their use in the administration, delivery and monitoring of SSN programs offers numerous advantages including increased accuracy, reliability and timeliness of information, performance measurement and service provider accountability. However, these new and emerging technologies typically require higher initial investment costs that benefit current and future time periods. The optimal solution to design an advanced and efficient delivery system for a safety net program may be a combination of traditional service delivery methods and new technologies that draws on a needs assessment that accounts for local conditions and program characteristics. ...|$|R
40|$|Zero {{knowledge}} protocols is {{a lesser}} known {{type of protocol}} {{that can be used}} for identification. These protocols are especially designed not to reveal any information during an identification process that can be misused later on, neither by the one who should be convinced of the identity of the user, nor by anyone else that is eavesdropping. Many of these protocols are also especially designed for implementation in <b>smart</b> <b>cards.</b> The more common type of card with a magnetic stripe has during the last few years become more susceptible to attacks since they are easily copied. <b>Smart</b> <b>cards</b> combined with a secure identification protocol has been predicted to be the solution to this problem. Zero knowledge protocols are one of several types of protocols {{that can be used for}} this purpose. In this thesis a number of zero knowledge protocols are examined that have been presented since the introduction of the concept in the 1980 's. In addition to the protocol descriptions information is also given about how to choose parameter values, and what progress and discoveries have been made concerning the security of the protocols. Some assumptions that are easy to overlook in an implementation are also highlighted, and an evaluation of the protocol performances is made. The conclusion is that zero knowledge protocols are both efficient and adaptable, while they at the same time provide high security. Because of this it may not be necessary to compromise between these properties even for <b>simpler</b> types of <b>smart</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe wide use of <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> {{automatic}} fare collection (AFC) {{systems in}} public transit makes it popular to analyse public transit user behaviour based on <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data. Most smart-card-based researches are time-related, but <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data time is not always reliable because <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> systems are usually off-line and lack of maintenance in China, and <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data of different buses often shares different time references.

The results indicate that the algorithm can work out reliable time offsets by numerical calculation and runs well with integral automatic vehicle location data. Due {{to the fact that the}} time reference of <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data for each bus changes daily, the best way to put an end to <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> time reference problem is to make <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> systems online, such as combining <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> readers with automatic vehicle location systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> is a pocket-sized card {{containing}} an embedded intelligent {{integrated circuit}} (i. e., intelligence {{to respond to}} a request from an external device). <b>Smart</b> <b>cards</b> contain a microprocessor chip that serves the dual functions of communication and extensive data storage.
