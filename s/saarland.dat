5|$|Germany regained {{control of}} the <b>Saarland</b> through a {{referendum}} held in 1935 and annexed Austria in the Anschluss of 1938. The Munich Agreement of 1938 gave Germany {{control of the}} Sudetenland and they seized the remainder of Czechoslovakia six months later. Under threat of invasion by sea, Lithuania surrendered the Memel district in March 1939.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their defeat in World War I and the {{resulting}} Treaty of Versailles, Germany lost Alsace-Lorraine, Northern Schleswig and Memel. The <b>Saarland</b> temporarily became a protectorate of France under the condition that its residents would later decide by referendum which country to join and Poland became a separate nation and was given access to the sea by the creation of the Polish Corridor, which separated Prussia from the rest of Germany, while Danzig was made a free city.|$|E
5|$|By February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division {{crossed the}} Saar and {{established}} a vital bridgehead at Serrig through which Patton pushed units into the <b>Saarland.</b> Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River {{against the advice of}} his officers. Historians such as Charles Whiting have criticized this strategy as unnecessarily aggressive.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 he {{returned}} to Germany {{as a member of}} the International Force supervising the <b>Saarland</b> plebiscite. Afterwards, he joined the German Intelligence Section at the War Office. In 1937 he became Assistant Military attaché in Berlin to Noel Mason-Macfarlane. As such, Strong got to know many senior German military officers personally, including Wilhelm Keitel. Like Mason-Macfarlane, he became convinced that war with Germany was imminent and inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Germany's borders {{underwent}} {{many changes}} during the 20th century, which {{had an effect}} on the make-up of the German football team. After the annexation of Austria, the Austrian team was absorbed into the German team, resulting in the inclusion of several Austrians in Germany's 1938 World Cup squad. After World War II and the break-up of Germany, two breakaway national teams were formed: <b>Saarland</b> (1950–56) and East Germany (1952–90). During this period, the team was commonly known as West Germany until the country's reunification in 1990, when the East German team was reintegrated into the German national team.|$|E
5|$|He {{enlisted in}} 1781 and, in his 30-year career, he saw {{action at the}} major French defeats and {{victories}} in Europe. He fought in André Masséna's Army of Switzerland, where he participated in the Winterthur and First and Second Battles of Zürich, the campaigns of 1806 against Prussia, and Napoleon's invasion of Russia. After the Russian and Saxon campaign, while suffering from exhaustion, he contracted typhus and died in Kusel, in the <b>Saarland.</b> He was buried at the Panthéon, and his name is listed on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the {{inhabitants}} of the French-administered Saar Protectorate voted to join West Germany. Since its establishment as a separate French protectorate in 1947, the Saar had a white Nordic cross on a blue and red background as its flag. To demonstrate the commitment of the Saar {{to be a part of}} West Germany, a new flag was selected on 9 July 1956: the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with the new coat of arms, also proposed on this day. This flag came into force on 1 January 1957, upon the establishment of the <b>Saarland</b> as a state of West Germany.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. He pulled Germany out of the League of Nations in 1933, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair as they applied only to Germany. The <b>Saarland,</b> which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany. In March 1935, Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men and that he was creating an air force. Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{stars on the}} flag is fixed at 12, and {{is not related to}} the number of member states of the EU (although the EU did have 12 member states at the time of Maastricht Treaty). This is because it {{originally}} was the flag of the Council of Europe. In 1953, the Council of Europe had 15 members; it was proposed that the future flag should have one star for each member, and would not change based on future members. West Germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of <b>Saarland,</b> and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region. Twelve was eventually adopted as a number with no political connotations and as a symbol of unity. While 12 is the correct number of stars, sometimes flags or emblems can be found that incorrectly show 15 (as of the rejected proposal) or 25 (as suggested by some after the expansion of the EU to 25 member states in 2004). However, the flag also remains that of the Council of Europe, which now has 47 member states.|$|E
25|$|The Saar protectorate, {{otherwise}} known as <b>Saarland,</b> was split from Germany and put under French control between 1947 and 1956. <b>Saarland</b> {{did not want to}} join French organisations and was barred from participating in pan-German ones. Thus, they sent separate teams to the 1952 Summer Olympics and also to the 1954 World Cup qualifiers, when <b>Saarland</b> finished below West Germany but above Norway in their qualification group, having won in Oslo. Legendary coach Helmut Schön was the manager of the <b>Saarland</b> team from 1952 until 1957, when the territory acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany. He went on to coach the championship-winning team of the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Saarland,</b> under French control between 1947 and 1956, did {{not join}} French organisations, and was barred from {{participating}} in pan-German ones. It sent their own team to the 1952 Summer Olympics and to the 1954 World Cup qualifiers. In 1957, <b>Saarland</b> acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany.|$|E
25|$|The Fifteenth Army was {{originally}} intended to command occupation forces in the Rhine Province, <b>Saarland,</b> Palatinate (Pfalz), and part of Hesse, areas now primarily parts of the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia, the Rhineland-Palatinate and <b>Saarland.</b> However, {{in the summer of}} 1945, the occupation mission in this sector was assumed in the north by the British Army and in the south by the French Army.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2010, the <b>Saarland</b> {{became the}} second federal {{state with a}} {{complete}} ban in bars and restaurants.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, the Saar Protectorate {{had been}} {{established}} under French control, in the area corresponding to the current German state of <b>Saarland.</b> It {{was not allowed to}} join its fellow German neighbors until a plebiscite in 1955 rejected the proposed autonomy. This {{paved the way for the}} accession of the <b>Saarland</b> to the Federal Republic of Germany as its 12th state, which went into effect on 1 January 1957.|$|E
25|$|France lost several strongholds {{covering}} her frontiers: Bouillon (Ardennes NE of Sedan), Saarlouis (<b>Saarland</b> NW of Saarbrücken), Landau (Rhineland NW of Karlsruhe) and so on.|$|E
25|$|See also East Germany and <b>Saarland</b> for {{the results}} of these {{separate}} German teams, and Austria for the team that was merged into the German team from 1938 to 1945.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Germany was {{occupied}} in three states. The DFB and its team continued {{in what was}} called West Germany, while the <b>Saarland</b> and East Germany fielded separate teams for some years.|$|E
25|$|In April 1945 the Fifteenth Army {{crossed the}} Rhine, 2–3 weeks {{behind the other}} Allied Field Armies. It took over {{responsibility}} for the Hesse, <b>Saarland,</b> Pfalz, and Rhine provinces, where it processed many German POW's and Displaced Persons.|$|E
25|$|Reunification placed Kohl in a {{momentarily}} unassailable position. In the 1990 elections– {{the first}} free, fair and democratic all-German elections since the Weimar Republic era– Kohl {{won by a}} landslide over opposition candidate and Minister-President of <b>Saarland,</b> Oskar Lafontaine. He then formed his fourth cabinet.|$|E
25|$|After the Second World War, Germany {{was banned}} from {{competition}} in most sports until about 1950, {{with none of}} the three new German states, West Germany, East Germany and <b>Saarland,</b> entering the 1950 World Cup qualifiers, since the DFB was only reinstated as full FIFA member after this World Cup.|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania German {{reflects}} {{the origins of}} the early speakers from the regions along the upper Rhine River in the Rhineland, Württemberg, Baden, <b>Saarland,</b> Switzerland and the Elsass/Alsace. Pennsylvania German sounds much like the Swabian and Alemannic dialects of these regions. Alemannic (German Alemannisch) is very much alive in the Swiss form of German.|$|E
25|$|Post-war Czech built E.114Ms were {{exported}} to France, Finland, Italy, Switzerland, Romania and the <b>Saarland.</b> Used as tourers and trainers, they also acted as glider tugs. Five Hillsons survived the war {{but only two}} flew again. One crashed in Turkey in 1946 and the other, G-AEUT (photo) crashed in Italy in 1957.|$|E
25|$|Today the German (CV) and Austrian (ÖCV) Cartellverband {{together}} unite {{more than}} 177 active and 12 inactive German student fraternities in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Poland, Slovakia and Syria. Today they represent 42,000 academics throughout the world. For example of member fraternities, see K.A.V. Lovania Leuven or Catholic German student corporation <b>Saarland</b> (Saarbrücken) Jena.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1935, {{with the}} re-admittance of the <b>Saarland</b> into Germany, {{the country and}} the leagues began to expand. With the {{aggressive}} expansion politics, and later, through the Second World War, Germany grew considerably in size. New or regained territories were incorporated into the Third Reich. In those regions incorporated into Germany, new Gauligen were formed.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{a public}} holiday in parts of Germany (Bavaria and <b>Saarland)</b> and Switzerland (in 14 of the 26 cantons). In Guatemala, it is {{observed}} in Guatemala City and {{in the town of}} Santa Maria Nebaj, both of which claim her as their patron saint. Also, this day is combined with Mother's Day in Costa Rica and parts of Belgium.|$|E
25|$|Fancy Bear is {{suspected}} {{to be behind}} a spearphishing attack in August 2016 on members of the Bundestag and multiple political parties such as Linken-faction leader Sahra Wagenknecht, Junge Union and the CDU of <b>Saarland.</b> Authorities fear that sensitive information could be gathered by hackers to later manipulate the public ahead of elections such as Germany's next federal election due in September 2017.|$|E
25|$|There were {{numerous}} potteries manufacturing terra sigillata in East Gaul, which included Alsace, the <b>Saarland,</b> and the Rhine and Mosel regions, {{but while the}} samian pottery from Luxeuil, La Madeleine, Chémery-Faulquemont, Lavoye, Remagen, Sinzig, Blickweiler and other sites is of interest and importance mainly to specialists, two sources stand out because their wares are often found outside their own immediate areas, namely Rheinzabern, near Speyer, and Trier.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} of Poland on 1 September 1939 was a resounding success for German forces. France declared war to Germany on 3 September 1939 and invaded its western territory, <b>Saarland,</b> with the Saar Offensive led by general Louis Faury. This attempt {{was led by}} France's military obligation to help Poland per the Franco-Polish Military Alliance, and was the following of the French Military Mission to Poland headed by the same commanding officer.|$|E
25|$|In August 1944, Papen had {{his last}} meeting with Hitler after {{arriving}} back in Germany from Turkey. Here, Hitler awarded Papen the Knight's Cross of the War Merit Cross. In September 1944, Papen settled at his estate at Wallerfangen in the <b>Saarland</b> {{that had been}} given to him by his father-in-law. On 29 November 1944, Papen could hear in the distance the guns of the advancing U.S Third Army, which caused him and his family to flee deeper into Germany.|$|E
25|$|Both Germany (still {{occupied}} and partitioned) and Japan (still occupied) {{were not}} permitted to participate in qualification. The French-occupied <b>Saarland</b> had been accepted by FIFA {{two weeks before the}} World Cup, several months before the German Football Association (DFB) was reinstated, while Soviet-occupied East Germany had not yet founded a football association. Italy, Austria, and other countries that had been involved in the World War as allies of Germany, were not subject to international sanctions, and Italy qualified automatically as defending champions of 1938.|$|E
25|$|Luxembourg was {{the first}} city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture {{was to be a}} {{cross-border}} area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and <b>Saarland</b> in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, Hitler {{became the}} leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of {{building}} Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the <b>Saarland</b> and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria {{became a part of}} Germany following the Anschluss. Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, controlled by Germany, and the Slovak Republic. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of appeasement.|$|E
25|$|Prince Louis de Condé, {{along with}} his sons Daniel and Osias, {{arranged}} with Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbrücken to establish a Huguenot community in present-day <b>Saarland</b> in 1604. The Count supported mercantilism and welcomed technically skilled immigrants into his lands, regardless of their religion. The Condés established a thriving glass-making works, which provided wealth to the principality for many years. Other founding families created enterprises based on textiles and such traditional Huguenot occupations in France. The community and its congregation remain active to this day, with descendants {{of many of the}} founding families still living in the region. Some members of this community emigrated to the United States in the 1890s.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the French Revolution and First Empire, France {{expanded}} temporarily on the left bank of the Rhine. The frontier in the north east lost its definition. On the whole, it remained stable from 1697 to 1789 when it became vague, following no particular line. It was re-established, more or less on its old line in 1815, by the Congress of Vienna. France did lose some places such as Landau and Saarlouis. These strategic losses and the construction of a powerful German state may be seen as giving rise to later diplomatic and military events. But even after the Armistice of 1918, France was unable to make new territorial gains towards the north-east, into the <b>Saarland.</b>|$|E
25|$|Strecker's new {{division}} was a reserve unit and {{was assigned to}} the border with France during the invasion of Poland. Although the division's posting opposite the Maginot Line in <b>Saarland</b> was not as heavily active as other fronts, Strecker distinguished himself there as a capable combat commander during assaults on the Maginot's fortifications and the subsequent offensive toward Paris. He was noted for universal praise by his superiors, including Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, who called Strecker one of his best division commanders and recommended him as a corps commander. He was then promoted to Generalleutnant in June 1940. He remained in France until early 1941 when his {{division was}} transferred Austria and then to the Eastern Front to participate in Operation Barbarossa as part of the 6th Army in Army Group South.|$|E
25|$|Learning {{a foreign}} {{language}} is compulsory throughout Germany in secondary schools and English {{is one of the}} more popular choices. Students at certain Gymnasium are required to learn Latin as their first foreign language and choose a second foreign language. The list of available foreign languages as well as the hours of compulsory foreign language lessons differ from state to state, but the more common choices, besides Latin, are English, French, Spanish, ancient Greek. Many schools also offer voluntary study groups for the purpose of learning other languages. At which stage students begin learning {{a foreign language}} differs from state to state and is tailored according to the cultural and socio-economical dynamics of each state. In some states, foreign language education starts in the Grundschule (primary school). For example, in North Rhine-Westphalia, English starts in the third year of elementary school. Baden-Württemberg starts with English or French in the first year. The <b>Saarland,</b> which borders France, begins with French in the third year of primary school and French is taught in high school as the main foreign language.|$|E
