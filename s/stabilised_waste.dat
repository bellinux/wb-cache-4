After each step of SCE, scanning electronic microscope with energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM/EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) {{were used to assess}} the microstructural and chemical changes of the waste materials. The results showed that the leaching of Zn from the cement based <b>stabilised</b> <b>waste</b> mainly took place at the second and the third extraction steps at pH 5. 0 and 2. 0, respectively. The addition of pulverised fly ash (PFA) increased the teachability of Zn at the second extraction step. The SCE results also indicated the hydration of cement was greatly retarded by the incorporation of zinc waste. The SEM and XRD analysis of the samples after each extraction step demonstrated that zinc leached at the second step extraction was partially due to the dissolution of the new crystalline phase (ZnO) in the waste materials. Since large amounts of zinc were leached out only at the third extraction step at pH 2. 0, these stablised waste materials may be relatively stable under a normal disposal environment.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) under mesophilic conditions can be enhanced by exchanging leachate between fresh waste and <b>stabilised</b> <b>waste.</b> The optimum point in time when leachate from an anaerobically digesting waste bed {{can be used to}} initiate {{degradation of}} another waste bed might occur when the leachate of the digesting waste bed is highly active with cellulolytic and methanogenic bacteria. In this study, the cellulolytic activity of the leachate was measured using the cellulose-azure assay. As products of hydrolysis are soluble compounds, the rate of generation of these compounds was estimated based on a soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) balance around the fresh waste bed. It was found that once the readily soluble material present in MSW was washed out there was very little generation of SCOD without the production of methane, indicating that flushing leachate from a <b>stabilised</b> <b>waste</b> bed resulted in a balanced inoculation of the fresh waste bed. With the onset of sustained methanogenesis, the rate of SCOD generation equalled the SCOD released from the digester as methane. The experimental findings also showed that cellulolytic activities of the leachate samples closely followed the trend of SCOD generation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Landfilling ofmunicipal {{solid waste}} (MSW) causes {{significant}} problems from {{the production of}} landfill gas (LFG) and highly polluted leachate {{over long periods of}} time. These emissions have to be controlled, treated and sustainable reduced during the aftercare phase, incurring significant costs. Therefore, the overall waste management strategy in Europe is towards reducing landfilling and promoting energy recovery fromMSW. However, as thermal treatment capacities are currently limited and incineration plants rely on largewaste input quantities (> 150, 000 t · a‑ 1),mechanical‑ biological pre‑treatment (MBP) of waste was implemented as an alternative in different EU countries. By means of a combination ofmechanical pre‑treatment and subsequent biological treatment, the emissions potential of the residual MSW can be significantly reduced under controlled conditions. As a result, MBP can be seen {{as an integral part of}} modern waste management concepts, including the mandatory separation of the high caloric fraction to be used as a fuel and for the production of biologically <b>stabilised</b> <b>waste</b> for landfilling. In order to improve the overall energy balance, modern MBP plants often include anaerobic treatment as the biological process component, hence increasing the efficiency of energy recovery from MSW.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{leaching}} tests {{are one of}} the criteria used to evaluate the performance of cementitious materials for stabilisation/solidification of hazardous wastes. The action of water is of special importance due to its effect on the integrity of the cement solid phases. Likewise, the degraded material originated by the water action may facilitate the transport of toxic components from the material to the environment. Therefore, there is an interest in determining the material behaviour under the long-term action of water in representative conditions of a real storage scenario, in particular where radioactive waste storage times of 300 years or more are needed. During this time, the <b>stabilised</b> <b>waste</b> should maintain its properties.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Worldwide {{increases}} in environmental awareness {{have led to}} the development of new innovative technologies aimed at site remediation and hazardous waste treatment. Solidification/Stabilisation (S/S) is one of such technologies and it has emerged as an environmentally acceptable treatment option for hazardous waste. Initially applied to inorganic wastes, S/S is now being investigated for the treatment of organic wastes and sludges. Challenges facing this venture into the SIS of organic wastes include the lack of technical information on waste-binder interactions, the uncertainty regarding an appropriate method to evaluate the performance of CPS systems, as well as evaluation of the long-term stability of stabilised material. This paper attempts to expand the understanding of chemical and micro-structural waste-binder interactions. Also addressed is the weathering behaviour of stabilised/ solidified organic waste when exposed to two different leaching media, distilled water and the US EPA's Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) solution. Addressed to a minor extent is the effect of stabilised/solidified organic waste on biomass production of sweetcorn maize. The focus in this study was the stabilisation of the synthol sludge (synthol gunk) using a pozzolan system. This was done by preparing <b>stabilised</b> <b>waste</b> forms from synthol gunk and fine ash (ash obtained from the slimes dams, hence has hydrated to some extent). A particle size fraction less than 2 mm of these waste forms were leached with the two leaching solutions. Some of the material was pressed into pellets, which were subsequently leached in the same leaching solutions. The pellets were analysed under SEM-EDS for micro-structural analysis. In a separate set of experiments fine ash, synthol gunk and the <b>stabilised</b> <b>waste</b> forms were mixed with soil in the range 0 % to 30 % waste addition, after which sweetcorn maize was planted to study the effects on biomass production. Other instrumental techniques used in this study include WDXRF, ICP-MS, FTIR, IC as well as the analysis of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The study showed that the trace metal speciation of the pozzolanic binder is affected by the presence of the organic waste, with a possible threat of turning the binder into a hazardous material. Elements that were leachable by TCLP on the stabilised product include B, Mn, Ni, Fe, and Br. The addition of lime in the system appears to lower the leachability of B, Mn, and Br while worsening the leachability of Fe, Ba, and Zn. However, addition of lime increases the leachability of B, Cr, Mn, Fe and Br in distilled water. The most likely source of B, Fe, Br and Ba is fine ash. Plant growth studies showed that the toxicity threshold of synthol gunk in the stabilised material on biomass production appears to be lowered from about 2. 5 % in unstabilised synthol gunk to about 1. 2 % either due to synergy or the additive effect of ash and synthol gunk. Furthermore, it is likely that some of the toxicity of synthol gunk is due to the hydrophobic coating of roots resulting in inadequate water intake by the plant...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and movement of water within a waste landfill {{are important for}} two main reasons. First, water represents a major potential pathway for pollution of the surrounding environment. As liquid passes through the waste to emerge as leachate, it dissolves or carries in suspension substances that could cause contamination through interaction with the natural groundwater. Artificial and natural barriers help to prevent this, but it is usually also necessary to control leachate pressures (levels) – usually by pumping from wells or drainage blankets – so as to minimise head differences acting on a sealing layer or a natural barrier boundary. Leachate movement through the waste mass in response to pumping {{is controlled by the}} hydraulic conductivity or permeability of the waste. The distribution of permeability within the waste, which will vary as a result of anisotropy, heterogeneity, partial saturation and changes in waste density or effective stress, is also of vital importance. The total and drainable porosity of waste will control the rate of build up of leachate levels in response to infiltration or other water inputs, and the rate of decline when dewatering a site. It is also necessary to understand and control the impact of pore pressures on mechanical stability. Secondly, water and water flow are essential to achieving landfill completion, i. e. bringing it to a stable, non-polluting state in a controlled way. Municipal solid wastes (MSW) have for the past 50 years contained a high proportion of biodegradable components: water is essential to the biochemical decomposition of organic substances (Pohland 1975; Leckie and Pacey 1979; Klink and Ham 1982).

Hatcheries disposing wastewater into lagoons could establish a series of ponds where algae, zooplankton and fish utilise the nutrients using integrated aquaculture which cleans the water making it more suitable for irrigation. The ideal system to establish in a hatchery would be to incorporate separation and handling equipment to separate waste into its various components for further treatment. This would save disposal costs, produce biogas to reduce power costs at plants and produce a range of value added products. However the scale of operations at many hatcheries is too small and development of treatment systems may not be viable...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa, the {{ferrochromium}} industry produces approximately 100, 000 t {{bag house}} filter dust and slurry, while {{the stainless steel}} industry produces 24, 000 t of dust annually [17, 39]. The toxic substances in these wastes potentially {{pose a threat to}} the environment and human health, especially Cr (VI) due to its toxic, carcinogenic, highly soluble and strongly oxidizing properties. Therefore, the existence and treatment of wastes from stainless steel and ferrochrome production remain a challenge and an issue of concern. The increase of environmental legislation globally and the trend towards sustainable development are drives for alternatives to landfill. In the present thesis, the characteristics, formation mechanisms, leachability and stabilisation of the Cr (VI) -containing electric furnace dust and filter cake were investigated using various techniques such as XRD, XRF, TG/DTA, XPS, SEM-EDS, FT-IR, Raman spectrometer and UV/Vis spectrometer. The electric furnace dust and filter cake are very fine particles. Stainless steel dust forms by the entrainment of charge materials, evaporation or volatilisation of elements and ejection of slag and metal by spitting or the bursting of gas bubbles. It was found that ferrochrome dust is formed by the ejection of slag and metals droplets from the electrode hole, the entrainment of charge materials, vaporisation as well as the formation and precipitation of compounds from vaporised species in the off-gas duct. Filter cake contains crystal phases (CaF 2 and CaSO 4) and metal rich amorphous phases. It is formed due to super saturation and precipitation. Leaching experiments on the wastes showed that Cr (VI) rapidly leaches out by distilled water. Bricks were produced by mixing wastes (stainless steel plant dust, ferrochrome dust and filter cake) and clay. The optimum sinter parameter was found to be 1100 oC and 5 hours for a 50 wt% SPD- 50 wt% AS mixture in the brick. The leachability of Cr(VI) is strongly influenced by the mass%CaO/mass%SiO 2 ratio and alkali metal oxides content in the wastes. The emission factors from the <b>stabilised</b> <b>wastes</b> (SPD, FCD 1, FCD 2 and FC) are similar to those reported for the cement industry.

As our population grows, so does the volume of waste generated and hence the threat to our environment. One method of reducing harmful emissions in landfills is the mechanical-biological pretreatment of waste prior to landfilling. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the degree of stabilization of waste in shallow landfills (simulated by test cells) with particular focus on biogas production and quality. Municipal waste was composted in aerobic, open windrows for periods of eight and sixteen weeks. Five test cells, designed and operated according to the PAF model (Pretreatment, Aeration and Flushing) were constructed at the Bisasar Road landfill site. These cells were used to simulate large scale municipal landfill sites. They were filled with fresh and pretreated waste and were used to monitor the dynamics of prolonged aeration and degradation of waste {{over a period of}} six months. The cells were monitored on a weekly basis while being aerated. Two flushing events were conducted {{at the beginning of the}} passive aeration. Gas emissions were also monitored by recording the methane, carbon dioxide and oxygen volumes per volume of air in probes strategically placed in each cell. These results were then analysed to assess the effect of mechanical-biological pretreatment of municipal solid waste on the emission quality of sanitary landfills and the appropriateness of prolonging the aeration in shallow landfills, as often used in sub-tropical countries. It was found that the design of the test cells was appropriate for the landfilling and stabilization of waste that was aerobically treated. After six months in the test cells, analysis of the waste from each cell showed that the waste was completely degraded. The PAF model, when applied to shallow landfills, is very effective in <b>stabilising</b> <b>waste</b> and would be appropriate for a sub-tropical climate. Waste that is pretreated, placed in shallow landfills, initially flushed and then aerated over a six month period was fully stabilized. The requirement for such treatment would be relatively small amounts of waste, a wet climate and the availability of open space for shallow landfills. This method, therefore, would be very appropriate in a South African context. The major problem with this method may be the generation of large quantities of leachate which will have to be treated and disposed of in an environmentally safe manner...|$|R

50|$|Biodrying is {{the process}} by which {{biodegradable}} waste is rapidly heated through initial stages of composting to remove moisture from a waste stream and hence reduce its overall weight. In biodrying processes, the drying rates are augmented by biological heat in addition to forced aeration. The major portion of biological heat, naturally available through the aerobic degradation of organic matter, is utilized to evaporate surface and bound water associated with the mixed sludge. This heat generation assists in reducing the moisture content of the biomass without the need for supplementary fossil fuels, and with minimal electricity consumption. It can take as little as 8 days to dry waste in this manner. This enables reduced costs of disposal if landfill is charged on a cost per tonne basis. Biodrying may be used as part of the production process for refuse-derived fuels. Biodrying does not however greatly affect the biodegradability of the waste and hence is not <b>stabilised.</b> Biodried <b>waste</b> will still break down in a landfill to produce landfill gas and hence potentially contribute to climate change.

However, the use of zero-valent iron nanoparticles or iron(II) salt revealed treatment can be improved by adding extra iron into the system.

However, the attempt to meet this target was unsuccessful. Almost all countries exceeded the established rate by 75 - 100 %.

40|$|Landfilling {{represents}} the most economical method for {{the disposal of}} municipal solid waste (MSW). After depletion of the limited volume of air available in void spaces of a waste bed, decomposition in a landfill takes place under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic digestion requires moisture {{and a lack of}} water is generally responsible for retarding degradation of MSW in conventional landfills. Furthermore, the moisture that may be present is seldom uniformly distributed. Bioreactor landfills are being researched as a means to provide a rapid and predictable stabilisation of waste and landfill gas production. This is achieved primarily by control and management of the liquid flow within the landfill. The moisture content of waste and moisture movement through a waste bed are two distinct factors that affect MSW decomposition. A moist environment is critical for microbial activity; and flow of moisture is essential to mobilize nutrients and evenly distribute microorganisms through a waste bed. The movement of moisture through a waste bed also provides improved mass transfer and prevents the development of stagnant zones. Experiments were carried out to understand how the amount of recirculated leachate effects waste degradation in coupled pairs of <b>stabilised</b> and fresh <b>waste</b> reactors.

40|$|The waste {{management}} issues {{that arise from}} the increasing waste loads on the environment through tourism are an issue of concern considering an expanding industry, and the increasing popularity of ecotourism. Medium to large scale tourism operators are ideally suited {{to the implementation of}} decentralised {{waste management}} initiatives, designed not only to <b>stabilise</b> the <b>waste</b> but also allow for recovery of resources for reuse locally. Anaerobic digestion is rarely contemplated in small scale applications such as remote tourist destinations. This is due to a perception that such systems are difficult to control and are susceptible to the flow disturbances characteristically experienced by small scale systems, including occasional high loads and seasonal variations, experienced in tourist applications. However, anaerobic digestion has the potential to provide green energy in the form of methane, a sanitised effluent suitable for reuse and a solid residue suitable as a soil amendment. Anaerobic digestion is most suitable for high strength wastes. Source separated blackwater can be effectively treated by anaerobic digestion, however a blackwater stream is relatively dilute as a feedstock for anaerobic digestion even after isolating it from the diluting effect of greywater. This thesis proposes that supplementing blackwater with food waste increases the viability of an anaerobic system by increasing methane yield and by providing a carbon source for biological nutrient removal, with minimal impact {{on the quality of the}} treated effluent. This thesis examines how a two-stage, anaerobic co-digestion system for treating a combined blackwater and food waste stream performs under varying organic loads and how well such a system inactivates human pathogens. To perform this investigation, a laboratory scale, two-stage anaerobic co-digestion system was constructed and operated semi-continuously over a 608 day period under low (0 %w/w food waste), medium (5 %w/w food waste) and high (25 %w/w food waste) organic loading rates (OLRs) (1, 1. 5 and 3 kgCOD. m- 3. d- 1 respectively). Throughout these experiments, the system exhibited susceptibility to feed OLR as whilst methane yield increased to 78 % with the addition of 5 %w/w food waste with no decrease in effluent quality, under the highest OLR, methane yield decreased to 42 % and the soluble COD in the final effluent increased by 425 % to 25 g. L- 1. Simulation of the system using the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM 1) to investigate system dynamics, kinetics and substrate characteristics indicated that the co-digestion of food waste with blackwater reduces the system hydrolysis rate whilst at the same time increasing the ultimate methane yield of the system. Analysis of the methanogenic kinetics revealed a good system/model correlation and that hydrogen utilising parameters can be estimated with relatively high confidence using methane data. The maximum uptake rate for hydrogen (km_H 2) determined for the system of 120 (± 15) kgS kgX- 1. d- 1 and the half saturation rate constant for hydrogen (Ks_H 2) of 7 x 10 - 5 (± 7 x 10 - 5) kgS. m- 3 are similar to the values for these parameters set into the ADM 1, even though hydrogen utilising parameters have not previously been estimated in mixed culture systems. Intensive analysis of indicator pathogen organism inactivation (E. coli, Cl. perfringens and somatic bacteriophage) in the system over a three month period indicated that whilst the thermophilic acidogenic reactor displayed some impact on pathogen counts (average E. coli removal of 105. 7 cfu per mL and average somatic bacteriophage removal of 103 pfu per 100 mL), the mesophilic methanogenic reactor had minimal impact on Cl. perfringens and somatic bacteriophage and in the case of E. coli encouraged regrowth. Final membrane filtration as tested by off-line membrane filtration analysis was able to fully remove pathogens and produced effluent that met the microbiological criteria for Queensland Water Recycling Guidelines for Class A+ recycled water. Variations in the OLR had no significant impact on the overall pathogen removal rates from the system. The effluent of the acidogenic reactor was assessed as a carbon source for denitrification as compared to more conventional external carbon sources. The specific denitrification rate of 0. 1 gNO 3 -N. gVS- 1. d- 1 achieved with acidogenic effluent matched that achieved with acetate and was superior to the rate achieved with methanol and butyrate. Overall, the outcomes from this thesis indicate that anaerobic digestion has strong potential for treatment of tourist wastewater in terms of robustness, process stability, energy generation, human pathogen inactivation and provision of an internal carbon source for BNR that lend itself well to a remote or decentralised application...|$|R
