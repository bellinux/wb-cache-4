50|$|One of {{the most}} unusual {{features}} of this military engine is the single stage fan; most trainer and combat engines have multi-staged fans, single stage fans normally being the preserve of civil and military transport turbofans. Ivchenko Lotarev chose a very low specific thrust (net thrust/airflow) cycle for the DV-2, so a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fan</b> is sufficient to develop the desired fan pressure ratio. Even so, the pressure ratio produced is somewhat higher than that normally developed by a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fan.</b> Owing to the low specific thrust, the bypass ratio for the engine is higher than normal for a military turbofan.|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} jet fan {{which has a}} <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> rotor was proposed. The {{geometry}} of the rotor blade is symmetry, that is, there is no camber and the position of maximum thickness is at middle of chord, because {{the characteristics of the}} jet fan have to become same in the case of positive and reverse rotations. It was clarified experimentally that the noise performance of the <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> jet <b>fan</b> was improved compared to that of the ordinary two <b>stage</b> jet <b>fan</b> and the aerodynamic characteristics were almost the same between the <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> and the two <b>stage</b> jet <b>fan.</b> It is theoretically clarified that the noise due to the inlet flow disturbances is higher than that due to the vortex shedding from the trailing edge of the rotor...|$|R
40|$|<b>Single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fans</b> {{designed}} for {{two levels of}} pressure ratio or blade loading (rotor tip D-factor of 0. 43 and 0. 54) were subjected to screen-induced circumferential distortions of 90 -degree extent. Both fan rotors were {{designed for}} a blade tip speed of 425 m/sec, blade solidity of 1. 3 and a hub-to-tip radius ratio of 0. 5. Circumferential measurements of total pressure, temperature, static pressure, and flow angle were obtained at the hub, mean and tip radii at five axial stations (three between the screen and rotor and behind rotor and stator blade rows). Rotor loading level {{did not appear to}} have a significant influence on rotor response to distorted flow. Losses in overall pressure ratio due to distortion were most severe in the stator hub region of the more highly loaded stage. At the near stall operating condition tip and hub regions of (either) rotor demonstrated different response characteristics to the distorted flow. No effect of loading was apparent on interactions between rotor and upstream distorted flow fields...|$|R

The engine has an overall pressure ratio of 35:1, which is extremely high for an engine with a centrifugal compressor. Other cycle parameters are a bypass ratio 5.3 and airflow of 240 lb/s. The take-off thrust is 5,600 lbf, flat-rated to ISA+15C.|$|E
50|$|The General Electric TF34 is a {{military}} turbofan engine used on the A-10 Thunderbolt II and S-3 Viking. Developed by GE Aircraft Engines during the late 1960s, the original engine comprises a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fan,</b> driven by a 4-stage low pressure (LP) turbine, supercharging a 14-stage high pressure (HP) compressor, driven by a 2-stage HP turbine. An annular combustor is featured. The TF34-GE-400A is rated at 9,275 lbf (41.26 kN) static thrust.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the basic}} {{configuration}} of both engines was almost identical, the -07 variant had a larger fan diameter. The -06 version HP compressor {{was based on}} the eight-stage version of the RC34B research compressor, unscaled, whereas the -07 was a scaled-up unit. A <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fan,</b> driven by a two-stage LP turbine, supercharged the HP compressor which was driven by the single stage transonic HP turbine. The combustor was annular and the co-annular exhaust featured a lightweight target type thrust reverser.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{transonic}} swept rotors in <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fans</b> {{have demonstrated the}} potential of significant improvements in both efficiency and stall margin with forward swept blading. This paper extends {{the assessment of the}} payoff derived from forward sweep to multistage configurations. The experimental investigation compare two builds of an advanced two-stage fan configuration tested alternately with a radial and a forward swept stage 1 blade. In the two-stage evaluations, the testing was extended to include the effect on inlet flow distortion. While the common second stage among the two builds prevented the overall fan from showing clean inlet performance and stability benefits with the forward swept rotor 1, this configuration did demonstrate superior front stage efficiency and tolerance to inlet distortion. Having obtained already low distortion sensitivity with the radial rotor 1 configuration relative to current production military fan standards, the sensitivity to inlet distortion was halved with the forward swept rotor 1 configuration. In the case of the 180 -degree one-per-rev distortion pattern, the two-stage configuration was evaluated both with and without inlet guide vanes (IGVs). The presence of the inlet guide vanes had a profound impact in lowering the two-stage fan's sensitivity with inlet distortion...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{experience}} using ANOPP {{to predict}} turbofan engine flyover noise {{suggests that it}} over-predicts overall EPNL by a significant amount. An improvement in this prediction method is desired for system optimization and assessment studies of advanced UHB engines. An assessment of the ANOPP fan inlet, fan exhaust, jet, combustor, and turbine noise prediction methods is made using static engine component noise data from the CF 6 - 8 OC 2, E(3), and QCSEE turbofan engines. It is shown that the ANOPP prediction results are generally higher than the measured GE data, and that the inlet noise prediction method (Heidmann method) {{is the most significant}} source of this overprediction. Fan noise spectral comparisons show that improvements to the fan tone, broadband, and combination tone noise models are required to yield results that more closely simulate the GE data. Suggested changes that yield improved fan noise predictions but preserve the Heidmann model structure are identified and described. These changes are based on the sets of engine data mentioned, as well as some CFM 56 engine data that was used to expand the combination tone noise database. It {{should be noted that the}} recommended changes are based on an analysis of engines that are limited to <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fans</b> with design tip relative Mach numbers greater than one...|$|R
50|$|A <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fan,</b> {{driven by}} a three stage LP turbine, {{supercharged}} the 9 stage HP compressor, which was driven by 2 stage air-cooled HP turbine. The combustor was annular and the exhaust separate jets. The HP compressor {{was based on a}} scale-up of the Rolls-Royce RB401 HP compressor, with a ninth stage added at the rear. Fan diameter was restricted to 60in, because of the relatively short undercarriage of the 737. Even then, the engine nacelle required an oblate shape so as to improve ground clearance.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} engines {{comprise a}} <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fan,</b> {{driven by a}} 4-stage low pressure (LP) turbine, supercharging a 14-stage HP compressor, driven by a 2-stage high pressure (HP) turbine, with an annular combustor. Later higher thrust versions of the CF34 feature an advanced technology core, with only 10 HP compressor stages. Latest variants, the -10A and -10E, were derived from the CFM56 engine family, and have a radically different HP spool, comprising a 9-stage compressor driven by a single stage turbine. The LP spool has 3 core booster stages behind the fan. Static thrust is 18500 lbf kN for the -10E variant.|$|E
50|$|The {{velocity}} of the air entering the nozzle is low, about Mach 0.4, a prerequisite for minimizing pressure losses in the duct leading to the nozzle. The temperature entering the nozzle may be as low as sea level ambient for a fan nozzle in the cold air at cruise altitudes. It may {{be as high as}} the 1000K exhaust gas temperature for a supersonic afterburning engine or 2200K with afterburner lit. The pressure entering the nozzle may vary from 1.5 times the pressure outside the nozzle, for a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fan,</b> to 30 times for the fastest manned aircraft at mach 3+.|$|E
40|$|A {{study program}} for {{conceptual}} design studies of remote lift and lift/cruise fan systems {{to meet the}} requirements of military V/STOL aircraft was conducted. Parametric performance and design data are presented for fans covering a range of pressure ratios, including both <b>single</b> and two <b>stage</b> <b>fan</b> concepts.

This mechanical design report describes the fan rotor design and the design of various structures of the vehicle; eg, stators, casings, splitters, seals, adapters, etc...|$|R
5000|$|Thus civil turbofans {{today have}} a low exhaust speed (low {{specific}} thrust [...] - [...] net thrust divided by airflow) to keep jet noise to a minimum and to improve fuel efficiency. Consequently, the bypass ratio (bypass flow divided by core flow) is relatively high (ratios from 4:1 up to 8:1 are common), with the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB approaching 10:1. Only a <b>single</b> <b>fan</b> <b>stage</b> is required, because a low specific thrust implies a low fan pressure ratio.|$|R
50|$|With a 14.5 inch (36.83 cm) {{diameter}} fan, the PW610F {{is one of}} {{the smallest}} turbofans to enter production. Little is known about the engine cycle, although the bypass ratio is believed to be about 1.83. Driven by a single-stage low pressure (LP) turbine, the <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fan</b> is an advanced snubberless design, with wide chord blades integral with the rotor hub. The layout of the high pressure (HP) compressor is shown in U.S. patent 6,488,469: it has 2 stages, a mixed-flow or diagonal and a centrifugal, and is driven by a single-stage turbine. A reverse-flow combustor and forced mixer/common exhaust are also featured in the design. Dual lane Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), for smoother, more reliable, operation, is included in the specification. Hispano-Suiza Canada is currently designing and manufacturing the FADEC for this engine.|$|E
5000|$|The unique {{feature of}} the -23 was the {{transonic}} <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fan.</b> [...] NACA had {{done a lot of}} research on multistage transonic compressors during the 50's. Using this data, GE decided to design and test a high pressure ratio single stage transonic fan. Much to their amazement the unit more than met the design target, including that of high efficiency. A modified version of this research unit was subsequently incorporated into the CJ805-23 aft fan. With no experience of transonic fan design and little time available, Pratt & Whitney had to resort to using 2 fan stages to produce a similar pressure ratio for their JT-3D turbofan. Although not an overhung design, the -23 transonic fan did not require any inlet guide vanes. There was, however, a series of structural vanes to help support the fan casing.|$|E
50|$|One SST VCE {{concept is}} the Tandem Fan engine. The engine has two fans, both {{mounted on the}} {{low-pressure}} shaft, with a significant axial gap between the units. In normal flight, the engine is in the series mode, with the flow leaving the front fan passing directly into the second fan, the engine behaving much like a normal turbofan. However, for take-off, climb-out, final-descent and approach, the front fan is allowed to discharge directly through an auxiliary nozzle {{on the underside of}} the powerplant nacelle. Auxiliary intakes are opened on each side of the powerplant, allowing air to enter the rear fan and progress through the rest of the engine. Operating the fans in this parallel mode substantially increases the total airflow of the engine at a thrust, resulting in a lower jet velocity and a quieter engine. Back in the 1970s, Boeing modified a Pratt & Whitney JT8D to a Tandem Fan configuration and successfully demonstrated the switch from series to parallel operation (and vice versa) with the engine running, albeit at part power. In the Mid Tandem Fan concept, a high specific flow <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>fan</b> is located between the high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) compressors of a turbojet core. Only bypass air is allowed to pass through the fan, the LP compressor exit flow passing through special passages within the fan disc, directly underneath the fan rotor blades. Some of the bypass air enters the engine via an auxiliary intake. During take-off and approach the engine behaves much like a normal civil turbofan, with an acceptable jet noise level (i.e., low specific thrust). However, for supersonic cruise, the fan variable inlet guide vanes and auxiliary intake close-off to minimize bypass flow and increase specific thrust. In this mode the engine acts more like a 'leaky' turbojet (e.g. the F404).|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} an aspirated <b>fan</b> <b>stage</b> designed {{to achieve a}} pressure ratio of 3. 4 : 1 at 1500 ft/sec is presented in this paper. The low-energy viscous flow is aspirated from diffusion-limiting locations on the blades and flowpath surfaces of the stage, enabling a very high pressure ratio to be achieved in a <b>single</b> <b>stage.</b> The <b>fan</b> <b>stage</b> performance was mapped at various operating speeds from choke to stall in a compressor facility at fully simulated engine conditions. The experimentally determined stage performance, in terms of pressure ratio and corresponding inlet mass flow rate, {{was found to be}} in good agreement with the three-dimensional viscous computational prediction, and in turn close to the design intent. Stage pressure ratios exceeding 3 : 1 were achieved at design speed, with an aspiration flow fraction of 3. 5 percent of the stage inlet mass flow. The experimental performance of the stage at various operating conditions, including detailed flowfield measurements, are presented and discussed {{in the context of the}} computational analyses. The sensitivity of the stage performance and operability to reduced aspiration flow rates at design and off design conditions are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{study was}} conducted to understand the influence of aircraft inlet distortion flow on the unsteady aerodynamic loading of a gas turbine <b>fan</b> <b>stage.</b> A <b>single</b> <b>stage,</b> transonic <b>fan</b> design with no inlet guide vanes was modeled with a commercial, computational fluid dynamics solver, STAR-CCM+, using the harmonic balance technique. The baseline inlet boundary condition applied to the model is consistent with that of a homeomorphic variant of the M 2129 S-duct, and exhibited stagnation pressure distortion and a swirl pattern. The baseline inlet flow was decomposed and parameterized into a set of inlet boundary conditions which were individually applied in a series of computational runs. The parametric effect of the swirl velocity on the unsteady aerodynamic loading of the fan blade was studied. The flow structure at 90 % span was investigated and revealed localized flow patterns in the blade row. A Fourier analysis revealed that the inlet distortion did not simply convect with the flow, but changed strength along the streamline, redistributing the spectral energy of the pressure and velocity components, and was dependent on the swirl parameter value. The inlet distortion also caused the passage shock to move up to 12 % of the blade chord. Finally, the first six harmonics of the inlet distortion contributed significantly to the aerodynamic loading of the transonic fan...|$|R

5000|$|Because modern civil turbofans {{operate at}} low {{specific}} thrust, they require only a <b>single</b> <b>fan</b> <b>stage</b> {{to develop the}} required fan pressure ratio.

Even so, there are usually a few IP axial stages mounted on the LP shaft, behind the fan, to further supercharge the core compression system.
