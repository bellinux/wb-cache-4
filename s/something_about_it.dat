5|$|Toby {{had been}} {{discussing}} {{the details of}} the Scranton Strangler case with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for some time. Having grown weary of the subject, she snaps at him that he should do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> or stop talking. Toby accordingly goes to the local prison to talk to the person convicted of being the notorious local murderer and tell him he believes he is innocent. Offscreen, the convict begins strangling Toby for his part in the conviction. However, Toby does have his spirits lifted after Nellie gives him a lift from the hospital and commends him for his bravery.|$|E
5|$|Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer {{discuss the}} {{situation}} and Kramer urges Jerry to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, {{pretending to be a}} cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when it hits the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E
5|$|Sol and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E

25|$|After finally {{stabilizing}} in late summer, Babyshambles' lineup underwent another {{change in}} January 2005. On 27 January 2005, drummer Gemma Clarke quit the band after disagreeing with their management. The ongoing heavy drug {{abuse of the}} band members, especially of frontman Doherty, and James Mullord's inability to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> made her eventually leave the band. She was immediately replaced by Adam Ficek, who was once a band member of the White Sport alongside Patrick Walden.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, {{three of}} Presley's bodyguards were fired {{and decided to}} write a tell-all book about their life in his inner circle. Worried about the impact such details might have on his career, Presley, through his father, asked Parker to stop the {{publication}} of the book. Parker made attempts to have it stopped, but failed to do so. According to Presley's friend, Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would open Presley's eyes to how bad he had gotten and persuade him to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The book would eventually be published in August 1977, two weeks before Presley's death.|$|E
25|$|In 1846 {{the potato}} crop failed {{and there was}} a bad harvest, {{resulting}} in the price of bread going up steeply and causing 'a great distress among the poor', especially in Ireland where famine followed. But while affluent Torquinians collected over £4,000 for the relief of the Irish, many Devonians were less than happy about their own situation and decided to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Rumours of disturbances had spread around the town but no heed had been taken, so when at 7.30 p.m. on 17 May a crowd assembled in Lower Union Street the authorities were caught off guard as attacks were made on bakers' shops and women carried off the spoils in their aprons. As night drew on the rioters took advantage of the dark.|$|E

25|$|Cabinet Ministers held {{a conference}} at 10 Downing Street on 5pm {{on the day}} of the assassination. They {{suspected}} Anti-Treaty forces (who had recently seized the Four Courts in Dublin) might be responsible – this was in fact not the case – and thought the Irish Provisional Government “should be pressed to deal with the matter”. Macready was summoned to London, where he found the Cabinet worried about their personal safety but also keen for a dramatic gesture of retaliation, and was asked whether it was possible for British troops to seize the Four Courts – he said that it was but cautioned against precipitate action which might reunite the two Irish factions, and on his return to Dublin deliberately delayed taking such action. Nonetheless, suspicion of Anti-Treaty complicity in Wilson’s murder, and perceived British pressure to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> was one of several triggers of the Irish Civil War.|$|E
25|$|On July 19, 1810, the {{precursors}} {{of the independence}} - Camilo Torres Tenorio, José Acevedo Gómez, José Miguel Pey and Jorge Tadeo Lozano, among others - held a secret meeting in the Astronomic Observatory of Bogotá, the office of Francisco José de Caldas. They had been informed of a plan by the Spaniards to arrest prominent criollos who had ideas of independence; {{the precursors}} were determined to win their independence and they, that night, planned the revolution. They were also convinced that the upcoming visit of the Regency Commissioners, Antonio Villavicencio and Carlos Montúfar, would bring the same results it had in Cartagena de Indias. Camilo Torres proposed that the first strike had {{to come from the}} Spaniards, to incite the people for an uprising and to prevent their supporters from doing <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Camacho would go to the house of the viceroy and ask him to allow a Junta to take place: they knew {{that he was going to}} oppose this, but would use it as the Spaniards' way of undermining the American people. Meanwhile, Luis de Rubio and Antonio Morales would go to the house of José Gonzales Llorente and start a mob uprising with the excuse of borrowing a flower vase, something they knew he would refuse giving Llorente's reputation.|$|E
500|$|Bill Nighy as General of Infantry Friedrich Olbricht: Nighy {{was cast}} {{to give a}} {{sympathetic}} quality, so Olbricht {{would not be the}} [...] "fall guy". Nighy wanted to convey Olbricht as divided between complaining about Hitler's regime and actually doing <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The actor described his portrayal, [...] "One of the most disconcerting things imaginable is to put on a Nazi uniform. It's so associated with evil that it took me several days to get used to being in costume." ...|$|E

500|$|Gillian Anderson {{considered}} the episode an emotionally difficult one, saying [...] "Piper Maru was challenging.

[...] Director Kim Manners complimented Anderson's performance, stating [...] "you look at season one and look at season three and that girl exploded as an actress in terms of talent and capability." [...] The 2004 film Alien vs. Predator featured an icebreaker named the Piper Maru, the naming of the ship being a nod to this episode.|$|E
500|$|I don't think it's {{important}} to take it too literally.

500|$|Apple filed {{a patent}} {{infringement}} suit against High Tech Computer Corp. (HTC) in March 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware {{in the two}} companies' ongoing battle with each other, and a complaint against HTC under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington, D.C. Apple's suit alleged 20 separate patent infringements relating to the iPhone's user interface, underlying architecture and hardware. Steve Jobs exclaimed [...] "We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we can do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> We've decided to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> ... think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours". The ITC rejected {{all but one of}} Apple's claims, however, ruling for Apple on a single claim relating to data tapping. HTC motioned the Delaware court for a change of venue to the Northern District of California, arguing against Apple's desire to consolidate the case with the similar cases brought by Nokia against Apple, alleging insubstantial overlap between those cases and Apple's complaint, but Judge Gregory M. Sleet denied HTC's motion for a venue change, ruling that Apple's choice of forum would prevail. HTC countersued Apple in September 2011 in the same court claiming infringement of four patents HTC obtained from Google, also filing a counter-complaint with the ITC, with HTC's general counsel saying [...] "HTC will continue to protect its patented inventions against infringement from Apple until such infringement stops." [...] In May 2012 the Delaware court ordered mediation between the companies. In November 2012, HTC and Apple ended the patent dispute by settling the case, but did not disclose the terms of the settlement. The companies reported the settlement included a 10-year agreement for licensing both companies' current and future patents to each other." ...|$|E

[...] The A.V. Clubs Scott Tobias {{believed}} that the episode was not up to [...] "30 Rocks high standards" [...] and commented that a [...] "big problem" [...] was Jack and Elisa's storyline. [...] "The concept of rich, superficial, commitment-phobic workaholic Jack falling for his exact opposite isn't a bad one, but Hayek's run has been {{more or less a}} wash."

Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused [...] "giggling fits" [...] between takes. Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes. She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. [...] "It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman", she stated. [...] "It is just weird. It is a woman.

Just three months after their wedding, producers decided to throw temptation at the couple to keep their relationship interesting. Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, quipped that [...] "a happy soap couple is considered the kiss of death". Scott {{was the first to}} cheat when he kissed Jane Harris (Annie Jones), while she helped him study for his HSC. After Jane confessed to Charlene, she threw Scott out and refused to talk to him. In a bid to reunite the couple, Jane told Charlene that she would steal Scott away from her unless she did <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The couple soon reunited. The following year, Charlene had a brief affair with her driving instructor Steve Fisher (Michael Pope).|$|E
