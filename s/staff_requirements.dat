To reduce costs, they also co-ordinate many aspects of their operation together with larger affiliate AirAsia (Asia's largest low-cost carrier), such as <b>staff</b> <b>requirements,</b> fuel hedging, marketing and computer systems, which allows them to take advantage of economies of scale that would not be normally available to an airline of their size.|$|E

40|$|This {{review is}} the second of two reviews to inform the safe {{staffing}} guideline. The first review investigated three broad questions 1) which patient safety outcomes are associated with nurse and healthcare assistant staffing levels and skill mix 2) how the ward environment, including physical layout and diversity of clinical disciplines, affect safe <b>staffing</b> <b>requirements</b> and 3) what patient factors affect nurse and healthcare assistant <b>staffing</b> <b>requirements</b> at different times during the day. The second review aims to explore evidence to inform guidance related to the following two sets of questions, {{as set out in}} the scope (NICE, 2013). 1. What management approaches affect nurse and healthcare assistant <b>staffing</b> <b>requirements?</b> a. What nursing staff supervisory approaches and/or team management approaches are required?
