40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive aid. The aid budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced: the donor agency observes the performance of the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> imperfectly; the donor agency and the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> are subject to inefficiency; the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> experiences corruption; and adjustment of <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> performance is costly. Incentives between the aid donor and the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> are intentionally aligned - to explore the best-case for the policy intervention. Immediate implications are then that optimal level of effort and governance in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> increase under performance intensity of aid. Moreover, performance intensity of aid has fundraising effects. While the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> also has an incentive to increase the measurement noise in governance, this incentive is weaker than that to raise true underlying governance, is weakest for the poorest <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> and provided that the donor agency is sufficiently efficient, measurement error itself will serve to raise optimal effort in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient.</b> The importance of aid agency self-monitoring is thereby identified. Three important qualifications on the anticipated success of the policy emerge, however. Despite the elimination of incentive misalignment, aid donors may come to rely on performance intensity precisely where such a reliance is likely to be least successful in <b>aid</b> <b>recipients.</b> Second, performance intensity of aid maximizes its impact under conditions where it is supplemented by technical assistance to improve the effectiveness of own effort by the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient.</b> Finally, under convex adjustment costs the general class of optimal time paths in governance in <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> will be non-monotone, such that governance may get worse before they get better - optimally so. Performance intensive policy may thus appear to fail - immediately after imposition. ...|$|R

The aid budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced. The donor agency observes the true performance of the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> with error.

E¤ort in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> is subject to variable e¢ciency. Finally, adjustment of performance in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> is costly both in the level of e¤ort, and in the time rate of change in the performance measure. The three core results to emerge from the model are that allocative e¢ciency improves under performance intensity of aid, in the sense that more aid comes to be allocated to <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> with good governance. Second, performance intensity of aid generates incentive e¤ects, such that the optimal level of governance in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> will increase under strengthening performance intensity of aid. Thirdly, improving governance in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> in turn was shown to lead to increased budgetary allocations to aid in the legislature that allocates aid resources. Performance intensity of aid thus has fundraising e¤ects. Policy slippage also carries impacts, however.

40|$|Depending on the {{regulatory}} regime they are subject to, governments {{may or may}} not be allowed to hand out <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> to private firms. The economic justification for <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> can address several issues present in the competition for capital and the competition for transfers from the state. First, there are principal-agent problems involved at several stages. Self-interested politicians might enter <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> deals that are the result of extensive rent-seeking activities of organized interest groups. Thus the institutional design of political systems will have an effect on the propensity of a jurisdiction to award <b>state</b> <b>aid.</b> Secondly, fierce competition for firm locations can lead to over-spending. This effect is stronger if the politicians do not take into account the entirety of the costs created by their participation in the firm location race. Thirdly, <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> deals can be incomplete and not in the interest of the citizens. This applies if there are no sanctions if firms do not meet their obligations from receiving aid, such as creating a certain number of jobs or not relocating again for a certain amount of time. The separation of ownership and control in modern corporations leads to principal-agent problems on the side of the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> as well. Managers might receive personal benefits from subsidies, the use of which is sometimes less monitored than private finance. This can eventually be to the detriment of the shareholders. Overall, it can be concluded that <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control should also serve the purpose of regulating the contracting between governments and firms. An extended mandate for supervision by the European Commission could include requirements to disincentive the misuse of <b>state</b> <b>aid.</b> The Commission should also focus on the corporate governance regime in place in the jurisdiction that awards the aid as well as in the recipient firm...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Purpose This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the influence that awards of financial aid have on the educational decisions and academic achievement of applicants for freshman year financial <b>aid</b> at Oregon <b>State</b> University. The study was primarily concerned with the effectiveness of financial aid in assisting students to enroll and become established in college. Thus, students were followed only {{to the point where they}} returned or failed to return for the sophomore year. Design The design of the study was twofold. First, the 2801 applicants for freshman year financial aid at OSU for the 1969 - 1970 and 1970 - 1971 academic years were classified as <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients</b> (N= 1354) and Non-Recipients (N= 1447), and were compared with a systematic sample of Non-Applicants (N= 742) in terms of 1) matriculation rates, 2) withdrawal rates, 3) suspension rates, 4) freshman year GPA, 5) number of credit hours completed, and 6) return rates for the sophomore year. For the second part of the study, the <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipient</b> group was sub-grouped according to the type and amount of aid awarded and these sub-groups were compared in terms of the six variables above. Data for each of the years under study were analyzed separately to permit comparisons between years. By controlling the variables of sex, age and scholastic aptitude and achievement, conclusions regarding the effects of aid awards were drawn. Scholastic aptitude and achievement were controlled in the study by using multiple regression equations which were generated to predict freshman year GPA's for each student. The resulting predicted GPA was used as a covariate in testing the hypotheses concerned with academic achievement. Several statistical models were employed to test the hypotheses regarding differences among the groups studied. <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients,</b> Non-Recipients and Non-Applicants were compared using chi-square analysis and analysis of variance. Multi-variate discriminant analysis and least-squares analysis of covariance were conducted to compare <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients</b> who were classified by the type and amount of aid awarded. Conclusions When the students who applied for financial aid were grouped into the categories of <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients</b> and Non-Recipients, and compared to a sample of Non-Applicants, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. Awards of aid are effective in increasing the matriculation rates of applicants for freshman year financial <b>aid</b> at Oregon <b>State</b> University. 2. <b>Aid</b> Applicants have higher predicted GPA's and have higher levels of academic achievement at OSU during the freshman year than do Non-Applicants. 3. Awards of aid do not affect the withdrawal rates, suspension rates, freshman year GPA, number of credit hours completed, or return rates for the sophomore year of applicants for freshman year financial aid. When the students in the <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipient</b> category were subgrouped according to the type and amount of aid awarded, and these sub-groups were compared, the following conclusions were drawn: 4. The type of aid awarded to <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients</b> does not affect their matriculation rates, withdrawal rates, suspension rates, freshman year GPA, number of credit hours completed, or return rates for the sophomore year. 5.

A key issue in this literature concerns the power relations and the ‘making of the subject of aid’ by labelling practices of aid agencies (Wood 1985; Moncrieffe and Eyben 2007). Categorizing people is a key aspect of humanitarian aid, as programmes have to make constant decisions about inclusion and exclusion and eligibility and non-eligibility of services.

This study focused on the academic persistence of OCC transfer financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> by comparing their mean academic year grade point average, mean academic year credit hours earned, withdrawal rates, academic probation rates, academic suspension rates, fail term return rates, and graduation rates with OCC transfer students who did not apply for or receive student financial aid.

Design: The study had two major segments. The first segment compared 150 Basic Educational Opportunity Grant recipients with 150 non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients.</b> These two groups were pair-matched to control for predicted freshman year grade point average. The two groups were compared over a five year period with respect to the following variables related to persistence or non-persistence: 1) academic year grade point average, 2) academic year mean completed credit hours, 3) withdrawal rates, 4) suspension rates, 5) return rates for the next fall term, and 6) graduation rates. The second part of the study investigated the possible differences between the various Basic Grant award levels when Basic Grant recipients were compared on the six variables. The six variables were also studied in relation to the various type(s) of financial aid received in addition to the Basic Grant. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study the following conclusions were drawn: 1. There was no significant difference between the number of credit hours earned by Basic Educational Opportunity Grant <b>recipients</b> and non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients.</b> 2. Basic Educational Opportunity Grant <b>recipients</b> and non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> did not have significantly different grade point averages. 3. There were no significant differences between Basic Educational Opportunity Grant <b>recipients</b> and non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> with respect to withdrawal and suspension rates. 4. There was no significant difference in the combined fourth and fifth year graduation rate between Basic Educational Opportunity Grant <b>recipients</b> and non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients.</b> 5. There were no significant differences in the return rates in the second through fifth years of study between Basic Educational Opportunity Grant <b>recipients</b> and non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients.</b> The return rate for the sixth year, fall term, 1980, was significantly higher for Basic Educational Opportunity Grant recipients. 6. There were no significant differences in the persistence of Basic Educational Opportunity Grant recipients when the various Basic Grant awards were compared. 7.
