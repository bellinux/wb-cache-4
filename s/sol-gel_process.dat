25|$|Sonication is an {{efficient}} {{tool for the}} synthesis of polymers. The cavitational shear forces, which stretch out and break the chain in a non-random process, result in a lowering of the molecular weight and poly-dispersity. Furthermore, multi-phase systems are very efficient dispersed and emulsified, so that very fine mixtures are provided. This means that ultrasound increases the rate of polymerisation over conventional stirring and results in higher molecular weights with lower polydispersities.

2500|$|There {{are over}} 200 {{synthetic}} zeolites {{that have been}} synthesized by a process of slow crystallization of a silica-alumina gel {{in the presence of}} alkalis and organic templates.

Some examples of the so-called heteroatoms that have been incorporated include germanium, iron, gallium, boron, zinc, tin, and titanium. [...] One of the important processes used to carry out zeolite synthesis is sol-gel processing.

2500|$|Silica aerogels are {{typically}} synthesized {{by using a}} <b>sol-gel</b> <b>process.</b> The first step {{is the creation of}} a colloidal suspension of solid particles known as a [...] "sol". The precursors are a liquid alcohol such as ethanol which is mixed with a silicon alkoxide, such as tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), and polyethoxydisiloxane (PEDS) (earlier work used sodium silicates). The solution of silica is mixed with a catalyst and allowed to gel during a hydrolysis reaction which forms particles of silicon dioxide. The oxide suspension begins to undergo condensation reactions which result in the creation of metal oxide bridges (either M–O–M, [...] "oxo" [...] bridges or M–OH–M, [...] "ol" [...] bridges) linking the dispersed colloidal particles. [...] These reactions generally have moderately slow reaction rates, and as a result either acidic or basic catalysts are used to improve the processing speed. Basic catalysts tend to produce more transparent aerogels and minimize the shrinkage during the drying process and also strengthen it to prevent pore collapse during drying.|$|E
