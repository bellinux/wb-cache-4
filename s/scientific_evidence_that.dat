5|$|Despite {{considerable}} research, {{there is}} little <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> yoga is beneficial for physical health, and it may cause muscular or spinal injuries, although it may improve mental health both for healthy people and for those with illnesses. Clinical studies on {{the health effects of}} yoga generally are of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{suggests that there}} is an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} discoveries of major {{scientific}} importance. These included the snow-free Dry Valleys {{in the western}} mountains, the emperor penguin colony at Cape Crozier, <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the Ice Barrier was a floating ice shelf, and a leaf fossil discovered by Ferrar which helped to establish Antarctica's relation to the Gondwana super-continent. Thousands of geological and biological specimens had been collected and new marine species identified. The location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated with reasonable accuracy. On the medical side, Wilson discovered the anti-scorbutic effects of fresh seal meat, which resolved the lethal threat of scurvy to this and subsequent expeditions.|$|E
5000|$|Alongside a {{focus on}} the {{influential}} opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a popular base of support among our natural constituency, namely, Christians. We will do this primarily through apologetics seminars. We intend these to encourage and equip believers with new <b>scientific</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> support the faith, as well as to popularize our ideas in the broader culture.|$|R
5000|$|Level A: Good <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> {{the benefits}} of the clinical service substantially outweigh the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.|$|R
5000|$|Level B: At least fair <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> {{the benefits}} of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.|$|R

25|$|A 2007 {{systematic}} review found some <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> behavioral interventions may be effective, {{but that the}} results should be viewed with caution due to poor quality of the data.|$|E
5000|$|Level D: At least fair <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> {{the risks}} of the clinical service outweighs potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients.|$|R
5000|$|Increased drought. <b>Scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> rising {{temperatures in}} the southwestern United States will reduce river flows and contribute to an increased severity, frequency, and duration of droughts.|$|R
50|$|Because a chimpanzee's {{muscles are}} much denser than a human's, Detective Chimp {{is unable to}} swim. Recent <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> chimpanzee can swim, and this represents a continuity error.|$|R
25|$|The {{attitudes of}} {{government}} officials shifted substantially over time, a result of increasing <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Chinese people were becoming infected, the dramatic devastation caused by HIV/AIDS in other countries, and research in China that showed that HIV transmission could be reduced with targeted interventions.|$|E
25|$|When fidget spinners rose in {{popularity}} in 2017, many publications {{in the popular}} press discussed the marketing claims made about them for people with ADHD, autism, or anxiety. However, there is no <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> fidget spinners are effective {{as a treatment for}} children with autism or ADHD.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationists {{disagree}} with the methodological naturalism {{that is part of}} the scientific method. Instead, they assert the actions of God as described in the Bible occurred as written and therefore only <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> points to the Bible being correct can be accepted. See Creation-evolution controversy for a more complete discussion.|$|E
25|$|There is no <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> {{to prove}} <b>that</b> {{any kind of}} Brassiere can cause cancer.|$|R
50|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} is an informal account {{of evidence in}} the form of an anecdote. The term is often used in contrast to <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence,</b> as <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> cannot be investigated using the scientific method. The problem with arguing based on anecdotal <b>evidence</b> is <b>that</b> anecdotal <b>evidence</b> is not necessarily typical; only statistical evidence can determine how typical something is. Misuse of anecdotal {{evidence is}} an informal fallacy.|$|R
50|$|A senior nurse for Cancer Research UK {{stated that}} they did not support {{alternative}} therapies that were not backed by <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence,</b> and <b>that</b> following a restricted diet such as Breuss's could cause malnutrition.|$|R
25|$|Two days later, Rumsfeld {{directed}} Haynes {{to establish}} a Working Group {{to develop a new}} set of guidelines for interrogation techniques, headed by Mary L. Walker, General Counsel of the Air Force. Mora worked actively to establish interrogation guidelines prohibiting coercive interrogation techniques, citing <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> they were ineffective, as well as legal arguments that they were unlawful.|$|E
25|$|Auriculotherapy, {{commonly}} known as ear acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, or auriculoacupuncture, is considered to date back to ancient China. It involves inserting needles to stimulate points on the outer ear. The modern approach was developed in France during the early 1950s. There is no <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> it can cure disease; the evidence of effectiveness is negligible.|$|E
25|$|Spinal {{adjustments}} {{were among}} many chiropractic techniques invented in the 19th century by Daniel David Palmer, {{the founder of}} Chiropractic. Claims made for the benefits of spinal adjustments range from temporary, palliative (pain relieving) effects to long term wellness and preventive care. Despite anecdotal success, there is not yet <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> spinal adjustment is effective against disease.|$|E
50|$|Calanus finmarchicus {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} {{different forms of}} phytoplankton. This includes diatoms, dinoflagellates, ciliates, and other photosynthetic marine organisms. Some <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests <b>that</b> copepods like C. finmarchicus are feeding on microzooplankton as well.|$|R
50|$|It {{is similar}} to the closely related species B. carambolae and B. occipitalis, and recent <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> showed <b>that</b> B. papayae, B. invadens and B. philippinensis belong to the same {{biological}} species as B. dorsalis.|$|R
25|$|The {{weight of}} {{existing}} <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> indicates <b>that</b> aspartame is safe at {{current levels of}} consumption as a non-nutritive sweetener. Reviews conducted by regulatory agencies decades after aspartame was first approved have supported its continued availability.|$|R
25|$|Vaccine {{overload}} is {{the notion}} that giving many vaccines at once may overwhelm or weaken a child's immature immune system and lead to adverse effects. Despite <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> strongly contradicts this idea, some parents of autistic children believe that vaccine overload causes autism. The resulting controversy has caused many parents to delay or avoid immunizing their children. Such parental misperceptions are major obstacles towards immunization of children.|$|E
25|$|The Petitioners {{argued that}} the {{definition}} in the CAA is so broad that carbon dioxide must be counted as an air pollutant. They claimed that the question was controlled by {{the words of the}} statute, so that factual debate was immaterial. Furthermore, the Petitioners filed substantial <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the toxicity of carbon dioxide results from high concentrations and that causation of global warming transforms the gas into a pollutant.|$|E
25|$|The toy {{has been}} {{promoted}} as helping people who have trouble focusing or those who fidget by relieving nervous energy or psychological stress. There are claims that a fidget spinner can help calm people down who suffer from anxiety and other neurological disorders like ADHD and autism. However, as of May 2017, there is no <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> they are effective {{as a treatment for}} autism or ADHD.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> is <b>that</b> {{switching}} from regular to light or low-tar cigarettes does not reduce {{the health risks}} of smoking or lower the smokerâ€™s exposure to the nicotine, tar, and carcinogens present in cigarette smoke.|$|R
5|$|Global warming, also {{referred}} to as climate change, is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> show <b>that</b> the climate system is warming.|$|R

25|$|The young Earth creationist {{belief that}} {{the age of the}} Earth is 6,000 to 10,000 years old {{conflicts}} with the age of 4.54 billion years measured using independently cross-validated geochronological methods including radiometric dating. Creationists dispute these and all other methods which demonstrate the timescale of geologic history in spite of the lack of <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> there are any inconsistencies or errors in the measurement of the Earth's age.|$|E
25|$|Those moai {{that are}} less eroded {{typically}} have designs carved on their backs and posteriors. The Routledge expedition of 1914 established a cultural link between these designs and the island's traditional tattooing, which had been repressed by missionaries a half-century earlier. Until modern DNA analysis of the islanders and their ancestors, this was key <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the moai had been carved by the Rapa Nui and not by a separate group from South America.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the {{thiomersal}} {{in child}} vaccines has been alleged {{to contribute to}} autism, and thousands of parents in the United States have pursued legal compensation from a federal fund. A 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee favored rejecting any causal relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and autism. Autism incidence rates increased steadily even after thiomersal was removed from childhood vaccines. Currently there is no accepted <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> exposure to thiomersal {{is a factor in}} causing autism.|$|E
