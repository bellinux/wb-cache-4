The Soviet Union sold 17 ships to the Indonesian Navy, the largest of which was a Sverdlov class cruiser. The size was 16,640 tons, very big compared to the current Indonesian Sigma class corvette at only 1,600 tons. Indonesia procured 12 Whiskey class submarines plus 2 supporting ships. Indonesia had more than a hundred military aircraft, 20 supersonic MiG-21s, 10 supersonic Mig-19, 49 Mig-17 and 30 MiG-15.

Also, compared to the Israeli Air Force's preparation for airstrikes against Egyptians (the Israeli pilots had flown against replicas {{of the most important}} Arab airfields) and the use of specific armaments, the PAF had been limited by <b>servicability</b> before the USA supplied spare parts in March of the year and training was limited if any. Constraints of the fledgling Pakistani economy also meant the development of its military could not be supported. The Pakistani Air Force thus lacked ammunition for effective runway denial. East Pakistani personnel of the PAF who defected may have revealed some of the plans, and it appears that IAF was expecting a pre-emptive strike against its forward airfields. A large-scale offensive was therefore doomed to fail, likely to cause heavy losses and bring the PAF in a position where it could never seriously challenge IAF operations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Increasingly, it {{is being}} {{realized}} that success in manufacturing requires integration between the various phases of the product life cycle. One of the key aspects of this integration is that, during the design of an artifact, due consideration {{should be given to}} facilitating the down-stream phases of the life-cycle. This is frequently known as &quot;Design for X &quot; (or DFX), where the X ranges over such issues as manufacturability, <b>servicability</b> and so on. Vendors of leading CAD software have started to incorporate DFX features into their packages. In addition, vendors have discovered from customer feedback that engineering companies require flexibility as well as functionality: companies which use CAD packages want to specify their own DFX guidelines as well as, or even instead of, relying on standard DFX guidelines supplied by the CAD vendors. If engineers from user companies are to augment CAD packages with company-specific guidelines, it is important that a language be provided which simplifies this task as much as possible. We are developing a language for this purpose, based on the computational paradigm of constraints. The language, called Galileo 6, is intended to be generic in two senses: {{it can be used to}} encode guidelines from any product domain and guidelines expressed in it can be applied to designs encoded in a variety of CAD formats...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs) {{consist of}} a steel tube with {{concrete}} infill. CFST columns offer an effcient and economical alternative to conventional reinforced concrete bridge columns, in that CFST columns can offer larger strength and stiffness and facilitate rapid construction. The first phase of this research project uses numerical and experimental methods to develop design procedures for various CFST column-to-cap beam connections. Three connections were studied, namely: (1) an embedded ange connection in which the CFST {{is embedded in the}} cap beam, (2) a welded dowel connection in which a series of headed dowels is welded inside the tube and embedded into the cap beam (both fully bonded and partially deboned conditions were studied), and (3) a dowel connection in which an independent cage of headed dowels and transverse reinforcing is developed into the CFST and embedded into the cap beam. All specimens were constructed using precast cap-beam components to demonstrate the feasibility of using these connections for accelerated bridge construction (ABC). The experimental program included specimens that simulated either the transverse or longitudinal direction of the bridge. Results showed that the three connection types provide excellent ductility under reversed-cyclic loading while all super-structure elements remained essentially elastic. The document provides design expressions, design examples and proposed codified language to facilitate immediate implementation of the research results into practice. In the second phase, performance based earthquake engineering (PBEE) tools were used to evaluate and compare the response of a reinforced concrete (RC) bridge with a CFST bridge designed using the design expressions developed in phase 1. The PBEE tool set included fragility functions that express the likelihood of damage and reparability, nonlinear analysis methods that capture the full cyclic response of the structural system, and incremental dynamic analyses (IDAs) to evaluate collapse potential. The analysis process was as follows: (1) the selected bridge was designed using RC and CFST components, with the objective of having the same strength and stiffness, (2) the structures were subjected to a suite of ground motions scaled to represent <b>servicability</b> (10 % probability of exceedance in 50 years), design (7 % probability of exceedance in 75 years), and maximum considered (2 % probability of exceedance in 50 years) seismic hazard levels, (3) fragility curves were used to compare the performance of the bridge including damage state as well as maximum and residual drift, and (4) IDAs were conducted to compare the collapse probability. Results indicate that the CFST structure is more resilient than the RC structure by all measures...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{composite}} {{steel frame}} structures possess {{a high degree}} of redundancy. This allows them to survive extreme fires without collapse as there are many alternative loadpaths which can be used to transfer load away from the fire affected part of the structure as demonstrated in the Broadgate fire. Subsequent tests carried out on the Cardington frame showed that it was not necessary to apply fire protection to all steel beams. It was possible to leave selected secondary beams without fire protection. In the event of a fire this results in large deflections due to thermal expansion and material degradation, however, in a fire where <b>servicability</b> requirements {{do not need to be}} met this is acceptable so long as life safety is ensured. The weakening beams and large deflections result in a change in the load transfer mechanism with load being carried through tensile membrane action in the slab. This thesis presents a method for calculating the membrane load capacity of composite floor slabs in fire. Extensive numerical modelling at the University of Edinburgh has shown that the temperature distribution through a structural member greatly effects the deflection and pattern of internal stresses and strains. Theoretical solutions were produced to calculate the structural response of laterally restrained beams and plates subject to thermal loads. The theoretical deflections and internal forces were shown to compare well with those from numerical models. To determine the membrane load capacity of concrete floor slabs in fire a three-stage design method was developed. Initially the temperature distribution through the slab was calculated for the design fire. From this the deflection of the slab and resulting stress and strain distributions in the steel reinforcement due to the thermal loads were calculated for the design fire. From this the deflection of the slab and resulting stress and strain distributions in the steel reinforcement due to thermal loads were calculated using equations from the theory developed previously. Failure of the slab was defined based on a limiting value of mechanical strain in the reinforcement, this strain corresponded to a limiting deflection. The load capacity of the slab at the limiting deflection was calculated using an energy method. When compared against results from numerical models the ultimate load capacity was shown to be accurately predicted. None of the fire test carried out on the Cardington structure reached failure. Although demonstrating the inherent strength of such buildings this was also a major short coming as it was not possible to define the point of failure. the design method developed was used to calculate the membrane laod capacity of four of the six Cardington tests. All four tests were shown to have had a significant reserve capacity with none being close to failure. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
