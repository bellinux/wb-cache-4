50|$|Since {{the partial}} {{derivative}} is a linear operator, the momentum operator is also linear, and because any wave function {{can be expressed}} as a superposition of other states, when this momentum operator acts on the entire superimposed wave, it yields the momentum eigenvalues for each plane wave component.

This effect opens another possibility for characterizing the electric {{properties of the}} surfaces in porous bodies. A similar effect can be observed at a non-porous surface, when sound is bounced off at an oblique angle.

50|$|Interference is {{the process}} by which two waves <b>superimpose</b> <b>to</b> form a {{resultant}} wave of greater or less amplitude. Interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other. In constructive interference, the two waves are of the same phase interfere in a way such that the resultant amplitude will be equal to the sum of the individual amplitudes. As the light in an optical ring resonator completes multiple circuits around the ring component, it will interfere with the other light still in the loop. As such, assuming there are no losses in the system such as those due to absorption, evanescence, or imperfect coupling and the resonance condition is met, the intensity of the light emitted from a ring resonator will be equal to the intensity of the light fed into the system.|$|E

We justify the asymptotic expansions given by the weakly non-linear geometric optics: the oscillating part of the perturbed solution is approximated by an almost periodic function (a profile) which is solution to a non-linear integro-differential mixed problem. We give {{at the same time}} an asymptotics to the shock front...|$|E

As indicated in earlier publications, the forest-fire model does not show conventional critical scaling, but has two qualitatively different types of fires that <b>superimpose</b> <b>to</b> give the effective exponents typically measured in simulations. We show that this explains not only why the exponent characterizing the fire-size distribution changes with increasing correlation length, but allows also to predict its asymptotic value. We support our arguments by computer simulations of a coarse-grained model, by scaling arguments and by analyzing states that are created artificially by superimposing {{the two types of}} fires.

At least two stumbling blocks in this regard are as follows: (1) sorting out haplotypes from a random series in order to assign them to their proper common ancestors, and (2) an estimation of a “calibrated ” time span from a common ancestor.

40|$|The {{non-linear}} {{evolution of}} the energy density of the radiation is shown to induce spectral distortions of {{the cosmic microwave background}} both at recombination and during the reionization era. This distortion has the same spectral signature as the one produced by the re-scattering of photons by non-relativistic hot electrons, the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, whose amplitude is quantified by a Compton y parameter. A diffuse y-sky is then expected to emerge from mode couplings in the non-linear {{evolution of the}} cosmological perturbations and to <b>superimpose</b> <b>to</b> the point source contributions of galaxy clusters. The equations describing the evolution of the y field and a hierarchy governing its angular multipoles are derived from the second order Boltzmann equation.

40|$|Some {{proteins}} are homologous {{to others}} after their sequence is circularly permuted. A few such proteins have been recognized, mainly by sequence comparison, {{but also by}} comparing their three-dimensional structures. Here we report {{the result of a}} systematic search for all protein pairs in the SCOP 90 % id domain database that become structurally superimposable when the sequence of one of the pairs is circularly permuted. Using a reasonable set of criteria, we find that 47 % of all protein domains are superimposable to at least one other protein domain in the database after their sequence is circularly permuted. Many of these are symmetric proteins, which <b>superimpose</b> <b>to</b> another protein both with and without a circular permutation of the sequence. However, 412 of the total 3035 domains are nonsymmetric, and these become structurally superimposable to another protein only after a circular permutation of the sequence.

40|$|On the {{one hand}} any {{effective}} action of the QCD, S[π, ρ, ω, [...] .,N, N, ∆ 3 / 2, [...] . ], would involve, at least in principle, a tower of hadronic fields of all spins; {{on the other hand}} the front form of the field theory has emerged as an appropriate framework to investigate the high energy behaviour of many systems. Motivated by these simple considerations we present a systematic formalism which explicitly provides the front form fields appropriate for constructing a S[π, ρ, ω, [...] .,N, N, ∆ 3 / 2, [...] . ]. Further, a transformation matrix Ω(j) is constructed which determines how the front form hadronic fields <b>superimpose</b> <b>to</b> yield the more familiar instant form fields. Explicit results for the front form hadronic fields up to spin two are catalogued in appendixes. For spin one half, the Ω(1 / 2) coincides with the celebrated “Melosh transformation. ” The formalism, without explicitly invoking any wave equations, reproduces spin one half front-form results of Lepage and Brodsky, and Dziembowski...|$|E

The deposit of pheromones while they search for food and their chemotactical {{response}} to them has been proposed as a crucial element in the mechanism for finding minimal paths. We investigate both individual and collective behavior of ants in some simple networks representing basic mazes. The character of the graphs considered is such that it allows a fully rigorous mathematical treatment via analysis of some markovian processes in terms of which the evolution can be represented. Our analytical and com-putational results show that in order for the ants to follow shortest paths between nest and food, it is necessary to <b>superimpose</b> <b>to</b> the ants ’ random walk the chemotactic reinforcement. It is also needed a certain degree of persistence so that ants tend to move preferably without changing their di-rection much. It is also important the number of ants, since we will show that the speed for finding minimal paths increases very fast with it...|$|E

On the basis of numerous measurements of cross-sectional center-to-center distances for adjacent fibers in pairs or arrays, fiber diameters (mean +/- SD) of 205 +/- 5 A in embedded cells and 212 +/- 8 A in embedded hemolysates were obtained. This is an agreement with values obtained by conventional embedding procedures [Crepeau, R. H., Dykes, G., Garrell, R. L. & Edelstein, S. J. (1978) Nature (London) 274, 616 [...] 617]. The use of tannic acid has resulted in improved resolution of fiber cross sections, revealing individual strands of Hb S molecules. Because the section thickness corresponds to approximately one-fifth of the fiber helical repeat distance, the strands in projection <b>superimpose</b> <b>to</b> form characteristic image patterns.

The server employs a hybrid of the scoring functions of CPHmodels- 2. 0 and a novel remote homology-modeling algorithm. A query sequence is first attempted modeled using the fast CPHmodels- 2. 0 profile–profile scoring function suitable for close homology modeling. The new computational costly remote homology-modeling algorithm is only engaged provided that no suitable PDB template is identified in the initial search. CPHmodels- 3. 0 was benchmarked in the CASP 8 competition and produced models for 94 % of the targets (117 out of 128), 74 % were predicted as high reliability models (87 out of 117).
