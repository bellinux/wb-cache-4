40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Sex {{differentiation}} in fish is a labile {{process that}} allows <b>sex</b> <b>inversion</b> in several species. The inherent capacity of fish germ cells to differentiate into oocytes or spermatocytes constitutes {{a key factor}} allowing for functional <b>sex</b> <b>inversion.</b> This thesis set out to determine the mechanism involved in steroid-induced sex differentiation of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, by searching for differential expression of unique genes during the process. In addition, the studies documented the persistence of methyltestosterone (MT) in the environment after oral administration, and investigated the capabilities of short-term immersions in steroids for masculinizing tilapia fry as an alternative method. A significant leakage of MT to the rearing water and its subsequent accumulation in the sediments was detected after oral administration of the steroid. In addition, evidence was found for a significant effect of environmental conditions on the masculinizing efficacy of oral administration of steroids. Low levels of masculinization were obtained when MT was allowed {{to remain in the}} system. Results from short-term immersions in steroids indicated that the labile period for masculinization by immersion of Nile tilapia fry reared at 28 °C occurs between 11 and 16 days post fertilization (dpf). Two three-hour immersions in trenbolone acetate at 11 and 13 dpf yielded the highest number of males. Time of immersion, length of the treatment, dosage, density, solvent vehicle, and number of immersions significantly affected the outcome of immersion trials. Heterogeneity of developmental stages, developmental rate, and sensitivity of progeny to steroids may play important roles in the efficacy of immersion treatments. The expression of unique mRNAs during the process of <b>sex</b> <b>inversion</b> was identified through the use of suppression subtractive hybridization. This technique allowed for the sequencing of 165 clones from which 61 proteins have been identified. A significant number of these genes seem related to the anabolic effects of trenbolone acetate.

Four developmental phases were identified by histological observation: female, early transitional (ETr), late transitional (LTr), and male phases. At female phase, a few nests of spermatogonia were observed at the posterior-ventral part of the gonad mainly in females out of the breeding season. At ETr phase, spermatogonial proliferation occurred while perinucleolar oocytes showed signs of degeneration. At LTr phase, seminiferous lobules were formed and spermatogonial proliferation expanded along the ovary which degenerated. All types of male germ cells could be found. At male phase, functional testis underwent active spermatogenesis while small ovarian remnants associated to fat tissue could be detected. Both 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) and estrone (E 1) blood levels were significantly lower in fish at transitional and male phases in comparison to breeding females, while levels of 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) and testosterone (T) gradually increased in the transitional and male phases.

After sex maturity and ovulation is achieved, the ova and ovarian gradually degenerate. At the same time, spermatogonia begin to multiple on the germinal fold and form spermatocysts. This is the intersex development stage, and the male individual then develops from the female. The male development of M. albus can also be divided into different stages.

The testis-determining gene lies on the Y chromosome, and has been delimited in human to a 35 -kilobase region near the pseudoautosomal boundary (2). SRY is a gene located in this region and both conserved during evolution and Y chromosome specific in a number of mammals (3). The predicted amino acid sequence of SRY contains a domain characterized by a homology with hUBF (4), the Me protein of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (5), the high-mobility-group protein HMG] (6) and the lymphoid-specific enhancer binding factor LEF- 1 (7). This domain of 70 -residues termed HMG box is characteristic of DNA-binding proteins. This conserved motif represents a functional protein domain necessary for DNA-binding activity of SRY. Until now, all mutations in the SRY gene associated with <b>sex</b> <b>inversion</b> have been located within the HMG box (8, 9). Using oligonucleotide primers (5 ' end: 5 '-TGAAGCGACCC...|$|E
40|$|Pilot scale {{commercial}} production of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in Tasmania encountered a {{high incidence of}} early sexual maturation particularly in males. Attempts by commercial growers to produce all-female populations (by neomale–female crosses) using standard industry techniques were unsuccessful. As maturation has a deleterious effect upon flesh quality, growth and immunocompetency, {{commercial production}} was aborted until this issue could be resolved. This study firstly aimed to describe early gonadal development, sex differentiation, developmental and endocrine changes during puberty and throughout the annual reproductive cycle to establish baseline information pertinent to the species reproductive strategies under Tasmanian environmental conditions. Once determined, the results from that study facilitated an experiment investigating the most appropriate timing and approach for the production of neomales. Photoperiod manipulation in mixed populations of brook trout was likewise investigated as a further means of reducing the incidence of early maturation. Sex differentiation and gonadal development in brook trout was studied from 8 degree days post-hatch (ºdph) until the age of 27 months. Gonadal development was histologically studied while plasma profiles of testosterone, estradiol- 17 β and 11 -KT were measured by RIA and ELISA. Gonadal development began during pre-hatch period and undifferentiated gonads directly developed into testes and ovaries at 3354 ºdph. Males had attained puberty by the age of 14 months. However, females did not achieve maturation during their first year. During the second year, maturation was observed during March and May for males and females respectively. This study determined that pre-hatch period might be the appropriate time for <b>sex</b> <b>inversion</b> treatment as development of undifferentiated gonads commenced during this time period. Moreover, variations in gonadal development and profiles of sex steroids were controlled by seasonal changes in photoperiod during second year thus suggesting the possible inhibition of maturation under manipulated photoperiod conditions. Neomale production was undertaken by immersion and in-feed treatment (and a combination of both) with 17 α-methyltestosterone (MT). <b>Sex</b> <b>inversion</b> treatment targeted the pre-hatch, hatch and post-hatch period to determine the most sensitive window of time. Treatment given during 4 to 6 days pre-hatch (at 400 μg/L MT for 4 hours) was found to be the most successful producing a population containing 75...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{demonstrated}} {{the ability of}} Fadrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, to induce <b>sex</b> <b>inversion</b> of genetically female common carp fry during the critical sex differentiation period. Thirty-day-old female fingerlings with a mean initial weight of 4. 0 g (experiment I) and 3. 5 g (experiment II) were fed a diet containing Fadrozole for 36 or 50 days, respectively. Not a single male {{was found in the}} control groups of both experiments. In experiment I, Fadrozole at 200 mg/kg feed resulted in 58. 6 % males, while fish receiving 17 α-methyltestosterone at 50 or 100 mg/kg feed resulted in only 5 - 10 % males. In experiment II, the efficiency of Fadrozole was dose- dependent; the lower dose of 100 mg/kg caused masculinization in 86 % of the treated fry while the higher doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg feed increased the percentage of males to 97 %. These results confirm the importance of aromatization during the labile period in common carp since low aromatase activity during this period, regardless of genotype, resulted in masculinization...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} natural spawning of {{the greasy}} grouper Epinephelus tauvina in captivity in recirculating sea water system under controlled conditions. The broodstock {{was developed in}} the culture system by rearing the wild fingerlings (lengh range: 90 to 200 mm). Females matured within two years. E. tauvina being a protogynous hermaphrodite, male spawners were developed through hormonal <b>sex</b> <b>inversion</b> of females. Natural spawning occurred in almost all the months of the year; 9 times during October 1998 to July 1999 and 9 times during the period from October 1999 to December 2000. On all occasions, spawning occurred between 1500 and 2000 hrs and continued for 3 days. The same pair of male and female spawned continuously 4 - 6 times in a year. Single female released, on an average, 50, 000 eggs/kg body weight on each day of spawning. Spawning was mostly related to lunar cycle, coinciding with the last or first quarter of lunar cycle. Fertilization rate obtained in the present study varied from 60 to 99...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports on}} {{broodstock}} development and spawning of the greasy grouper Epinephelus tauvina in indoor 5 ton capacity FRP tanks in recirculating sea water system, under controlled conditions. The broodstock {{was developed in}} the culture system by rearing the wild fingerlings, caught in the size range 90 to 200 mm. After attaining maturity, the fishes were fed with supplementary diet for developing them into mature females. Simultaneously, a few were administered the male hormone methyltestosterone (MT) for <b>sex</b> <b>inversion</b> to males. Mature spermiating males were developed by this technique. A mature female fish weighing 3. 85 kg and a single spermiating male weighing 3. 25 kg have spawned spontaneously in the same indoor tank consecutively for two days from 29 - 10 - 1998 to 30 - 10 - 1998 and also from 20 - 12 -’ 98 to 23 - 12 -’ 98, producing approximately 2, 50, 000 eggs in each spawning. On both the occasions, the same hormonally sex inverted male has spermiated. Fertilization rate was over 90...|$|E
