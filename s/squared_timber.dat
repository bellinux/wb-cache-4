5|$|The mosque's {{interior}} {{is supported by}} 45 columns, 33 of which are white marble and 12 of stone. The column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted. The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> enclosed in a wooden casing.|$|E
2500|$|The Ranger Residence is a {{one and a}} half-story T-shaped {{building}} on a concrete foundation with an exposed fieldstone veneer. [...] It is a wood-frame structure with horizontal clapboard exterior to eave line and vertical boards above the eave line on the gable ends. [...] The building has a high gable roof with large gable on east end and projecting center porch gable on south façade. [...] The original wood-shingles roof {{has been replaced by}} textured sheet metal. [...] The front porch is supported by two heavy <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> posts with curved brackets at the top. [...] Stone steps lead to an open porch with a flagstone surface. The rear entry is {{on the north side of}} the building. [...] The covered back porch is supported by a single heavy <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> post with top bracket matching the posts on the front porch. [...] There is an exterior stone chimney on north gable end of the building. [...] The exterior has simple six-over-six double-hung sash windows. Inside the residence the walls are covered in fluted knotty-pine paneling with plain pine baseboard with wood floors. [...] A stone fireplace is a central feature of the home. [...] The ceiling has exposed boxed beams separated by fiberboard paneling.|$|E
2500|$|In July, Pomone and Warren's {{squadron}} intercepted {{a convoy}} in Hodierne Bay consisting of 14 cargo vessels with a frigate, a ship, a corvette, and a brig as escorts. The British drove the French 36-gun frigate Calliope onshore and holed her hull with gunfire, Sylph being particularly aggressive. The brig they sank with gunfire also. They burnt Freedom, a large British-built ship armed en flute and laden with <b>squared</b> <b>timber.</b> The French had run her onshore and the crew, with the wounded, had gotten away in their boats. The British also captured eight vessels: ...|$|E
30|$|In the {{disposal}} process, {{it is not}} realistic to reuse the <b>squared</b> <b>timbers</b> used for the dam as a fuel after their disposal because the <b>squared</b> <b>timbers</b> are actually left in the forest without being disposed of or removed. Therefore, {{this study did not}} set up scenarios in which the energy from wood after disposal was used.|$|R
30|$|Sagioka et al. [9] {{compared}} the boxed-heart <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> of tateyama-sugi with dimensions of 50, 70, and 100  mm {{and showed that}} the bow and twist decreased with the dimensions, while the number and total length of the surface checks increased. Saito et al. [10] {{compared the}} boxed-heart <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> of boka-sugi with dimensions of 45 and 70  mm and showed that the bow and twist decreased with the dimensions, {{while the number of}} surface checks increased. Takeda et al. [3] compared the boxed-heart <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> of tateyama-sugi and boka-sugi with dimensions of 70 and 90  mm and showed that the bow and twist were larger for the smaller dimension timber, while the total length of the end checks and the surface checks were longer for the larger dimension timber. Nakano and Saito [11] examined the boxed-heart <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> with dimensions 30 – 105  mm and showed that the percentage of timber ranked in the high grade for bow and twist increased with the dimensions, while that for surface checking decreased. These studies showed the common trend that the smaller dimension timber had larger bow and twist and less prominent surface checking. This study showed the same results for bow and surface checking with boxed-heart <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> dimensions of 80 and 140 / 120  mm. Twist was not observed, which might be because the dimensions were larger than those in the previous studies.|$|R
30|$|In the {{maintenance}} process, the previous study [8] assumed {{that some of}} the <b>squared</b> <b>timbers</b> are changed to new timbers after construction. However, the interval of the repair work and replaced areas were set hypothetically because there have been no prior studies available. The hypothetically set conditions {{have a significant impact on}} the outcome when evaluating changes in the carbon stock of the <b>squared</b> <b>timbers,</b> and they also complicate the evaluation process. Therefore, this study did not take this maintenance process into consideration.|$|R
6000|$|She {{came into}} the Cove (as {{that part of the}} harbour is called), of course very slowly, and at some hundred feet or so short of the quay she lost her way. That quay was then a wooden one, a fine {{structure}} of mighty piles and stringers bearing a roadway--a thing of great strength. The ship, as I have said before, stopped moving when some hundred feet from it. Then her engines were rung on slow ahead, and immediately rung off again. The propeller made just about five turns, I should say. She began to move, stealing on, so to speak, without a ripple; coming alongside with the utmost gentleness. I went on looking her over, very much interested, but the man with me, the pilot, muttered under his breath: [...] "Too much, too much." [...] His exercised judgment had warned him of what I did not even suspect. But I believe that neither of us was exactly prepared for what happened. There was a faint concussion of the ground under our feet, a groaning of piles, a snapping of great iron bolts, and with a sound of ripping and splintering, as when a tree is blown down by the wind, a great strong piece of wood, a baulk of <b>squared</b> <b>timber,</b> was displaced several feet as if by enchantment. I looked at my companion in amazement. [...] "I could not have believed it," [...] I declared. [...] "No," [...] he said. [...] "You would not have thought she would have cracked an egg--eh?" ...|$|E

50|$|The Ottawa River {{timber trade}} {{resulted}} from Napoleon's 1806 Continental Blockade in Europe. The United Kingdom required {{a new source}} of timber for its navy and shipbuilding. Later the U.K.'s application of gradually increasing preferential tariffs increased Canadian imports. The trade in <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> lasted until the 1850s. The transportation of raw timber by means of floating down the Ottawa River was proved possible in 1806 by Philemon Wright. <b>Squared</b> <b>timber</b> would be assembled into large rafts which held living quarters for men on their six-week journey to Quebec City, which had large exporting facilities and easy access to the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The {{ground floor}} verandahs are {{supported}} on squat brick piers, with <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> verandah posts with cap moulds and brackets but no balustrade. A deep frieze below the upper floor has exposed timber cross-bracing with vertically jointed boards behind. The upper floor verandahs {{have the same}} <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> verandah posts as the ground floor, supporting skillion verandah roofs of galvanized iron separate to the main roof. The upper verandahs have a cast iron balustrade. The rear verandah has been enclosed with timber boards.|$|R
30|$|Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) {{is a major}} {{plantation}} {{species in}} Japan, of which thinned trees are sawn into boxed-heart <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> and used as posts or beams for house construction. Recently, kiln-dried timber has been required to shorten the construction period and prevent dimensional changes from significant shrinkage after completion. However, drying of boxed-heart <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> is not easy, because it is susceptible to drying checks due to shrinkage anisotropy between the tangential and radial directions, and contains the heartwood which is slow in drying.|$|R

50|$|The Greek Septuagint (3rd - 1st centuries BC) {{translated}} it as xylon tetragonon, <b>squared</b> <b>timber.</b> Similarly, the Latin Vulgate (5th century AD) rendered it as lignis levigatis (lævigatis, in the Clementine Vulgate), smoothed (possibly planed) wood.|$|E
50|$|The {{industry}} {{came about}} following Napoleon's 1806 Continental Blockade in Europe causing the United Kingdom {{to require a}} new source for timber especially for its navy and shipbuilding. Later the U.K.'s application of gradually increasing preferential tariffs increased Canadian imports. The {{first part of the}} industry, the trade in <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> lasted until about the 1850s. The transportation for the raw timber was first by means of floating down the Ottawa River, proved possible in 1806 by Philemon Wright. <b>Squared</b> <b>timber</b> would be assembled into large rafts which held living quarters for men on their six week journey to Quebec City, which had large exporting facilities and easy access to the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1869, about a {{third of}} the lumber {{manufactured}} at Ottawa was shipped to foreign countries, and the area employed 6000 men in cutting and rafting logs, about 5,500 in the preparation of <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> for European markets, and about 5,000 at the mills in Ottawa.|$|E
50|$|The main timber floor {{frame is}} {{supported}} on sturdy hardwood columns with timber headstocks. Each bearer is jointed over the headstock with a scarfed joint and <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> key.|$|R
50|$|The convex roofed verandahs {{across the}} front and back have <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> posts and stick balusters. The {{exterior}} walls exhibit fine brickwork and decorative features such as a string course below the eaves in diagonally laid bricks.|$|R
50|$|Portions of the {{verandah}} survive at the front, southern {{side and}} at the rear, and were either conserved or reconstructed in 1987. Dowel balustrading, <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> posts and fretwork brackets of an unusual thistle pattern supply the exterior decoration to this section.|$|R
5000|$|McLaren’s Settlement (...) {{originated}} in the 1840s {{when members of the}} McLaren family came to the area from Scotland. It was located a short distance upstream from the present OPG Cheneaux Generating Station. The McLarens arrived during the peak of the lumbering industry in the Ottawa Valley and one of their number constructed a timber slide in the Ottawa River to facilitate the movement of <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> rafts past the Cheneaux Rapids. These slides could be described as a sluice about 50 feet wide and about 200 feet long and steeply sloped through which some river water was diverted. Floating bundles of about 25 pieces of <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> would be steered toward {{the upper end of the}} slide. Once into the sluice, the bundle of timber would descend at a great speed, emerging undamaged into the river below the rapids.|$|E
5000|$|Upper and Lower Canada's major {{industry}} {{in terms of}} employment and value of the product was the timber trade. Bytown (later called Ottawa), was a major lumber and sawmill centre of Canada. When the Ottawa River first began {{to be used for}} floating timber en route to markets, <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> was the preference. This required the logs to be skillfully shaped with broadaxes giving the whole log a squared appearance. It was wasteful but squared pine was preferred by the British for resawing. The timber was bound with other sticks into two related configurations, cribs, and rafts. (See the following section for a detailed explanation.) <b>Squared</b> <b>timber</b> [...] "became the main export" [...] and was easy to ship overseas and could be moved by [...] "pegged cribs". The rafts were floated on the Ottawa River to markets in Quebec.|$|E
5000|$|Broad axe: Used {{with the}} grain of the wood in {{precision}} splitting or [...] "hewing" [...] (i.e. the squaring-off of round timbers usually for use in construction). Broad axe bits are most commonly chisel-shaped (i.e. one flat and one beveled edge) facilitating more controlled work as the flat cheek passes across the <b>squared</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|E
30|$|Moreover, for {{the reason}} {{mentioned}} in “Scope of the carbon balance evaluation”, {{this study did not}} take the replacement of <b>squared</b> <b>timbers</b> in the maintenance process into consideration, and the subsequent changes in the wood stock were evaluated at the time of dam construction.|$|R
3000|$|The larger {{dimension}} boxed-heart <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> of sugi exhibited smaller bow, {{more prominent}} surface checking, and less dimensional shrinkage; however, the dimension effect was different for the cultivars {{and the source}} heights of the logs.

30|$|In this study, the surface-check {{variation}} of sugi boxed-heart <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> was evaluated using conventional kiln-dried timber taken at different heights along the stem for five cultivars with different wood properties [6 – 8]. The relationships between surface checks and moisture gradient, shrinkage, and bow were investigated.|$|R
5000|$|When the Ottawa River {{first began}} {{to be used for}} {{floating}} timber en route to markets, <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> was the preference by the British for resawing, and it [...] "became the main export". Britain imported 15,000 loads of timber from Canada in 1805, and from the colonies, 30,000 in 1807, and nearly 300,000 in 1820.|$|E

Nearby lies a fallen, partially burnt bush telephone pole and associated ceramic insulators and fixings (some now dislodged and lying separate).|$|E
50|$|The Timber trade {{spurred the}} growth of Bytown, and it saw an influx of immigrants, and later {{entrepreneurs}} hoping {{to profit from the}} <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> that would be floated down the Ottawa River to Quebec. Bytown had seen some trouble in the early days, first with the Shiners' War in 1835 to 1845, and the Stony Monday Riot in 1849.|$|E
50|$|The {{butcher shop}} {{appears to be}} located {{to the west of}} the former Telegraph Office. It is a single-storey, <b>square,</b> <b>timber</b> {{structure}} consisting of a corrugated iron-clad hipped roof supported on thick timber posts. It features an enclosed room in the centre and a concrete slab floor.|$|R
50|$|Always painted white, {{the normal}} {{construction}} is of <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> rails, with three horizontal metal rods, {{and a single}} diagonal bracing rod. The design of the gate also includes an angled upright or stile, with the post on which the gates are parked, angled in the same way.|$|R
60|$|Half {{the town}} was {{gathered}} round the hotel crazy with excitement. But not a word would the proprietor say. Great dray loads of <b>square</b> <b>timber,</b> and two-by-eight pine joists kept arriving from the planing mill. There was a pile of matched spruce sixteen feet high lying by the sidewalk.|$|R
50|$|Other local adaptations are evident. Ironwood and Ironbark trees, used as {{telephone}} poles, with ceramic insulators {{affixed to}} <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> cross-arms {{bolted to the}} trees, still survive. An Ironwood tree (as telephone pole) adjacent to the Doover is a particularly fine example, with fine bush carpentry still evident. Also in evidence is the negligible regrowth (callousing) over the cut since its creation.|$|E

50|$|Weisse Wiese was {{originally}} a municipal ball court with running tracks and jumping pit. The goalposts and crossbar were initially only made of <b>squared</b> <b>timber</b> and were always removed after the games, preventing {{the risk that}} they could be stolen. The name of the place, Weisse Wiese, was supposedly originated from the white flowers dropping from adjacent poplars in spring, which turned the pitch into a white field (German: Weisse Wiese).|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} wing contains substantially larger rooms {{accessed by}} an east-west corridor {{which also has}} delicate decorative plaster detailing. The doorways to the corridors are framed in rendered masonry with cement scrolls. The rooms to the north retain their fine plaster decoration and metal ceiling roses, and are well lit with rectangular casement windows with <b>square</b> fixed-light <b>timber</b> windows above them. The southern rooms retain none of these features. The south and northern rooms are linked by a small entry hall with timber French doors opening onto a balconette, and <b>square</b> <b>timber</b> windows above.|$|R
