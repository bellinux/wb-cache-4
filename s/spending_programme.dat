40|$|Although VAT {{concessions}} {{have long}} been viewed as sources of revenue loss, economic distortions and increased compliance and administrative costs, they have proved stubbornly resistant to removal or modification. This article suggests a new mode of analysis {{that could be used}} as a reform tool. It first applies tax expenditure analysis to VAT concessions, recognising the cost of these concessions not as “lost revenue”, but rather as notionally received and then applied revenue. Under tax expenditure analysis, concessions are treated as the equivalent of, and a substitute for, direct <b>spending</b> <b>programmes.</b> Intended to achieve a variety of equity, social and economic outcomes, VAT concessions in practice more often than not operate as unfair and inefficient <b>spending</b> <b>programmes,</b> generating significant legal and economic distortions in the tax system. The article then shows how the measurement of the cost of concessions as a proportion of potential VAT revenue can better reveal their budget impact. Ideally, VAT concessions should be replaced with fairer and more efficiently targeted alternative instruments. Improved policy and legislative design techniques can be used to target concessions more effectively where their removal is politically unattainable...|$|R

The detailed composition of a public <b>spending</b> <b>programme</b> on goods and services is as relevant as its overall size. Financial policy (the financing of a given <b>spending</b> <b>programme</b> on goods and services) matters because of capital market imperfections (including the non-existence of many contingent forward markets).

40|$|Monetary {{policy is}} {{the process by which}} the central bank of a country {{controls}} the supply of money, the availability of money, and the cost of money or rate of interest, in order to attain a set of objectives oriented towards the growth and stability of the economy. Fiscal policy induced â€œdemand managementâ€ approach as propagated by Keynes, which was popular in the post-Great Depression period, later made way to monetary policy led â€œstabilisationâ€ approach in the period of high inflation of 1970 s. While traditional fiscal policy solutions were useful in confronting unemployment by increasing spending and cutting taxes, counter-acting inflation entailed reducing spending or raising taxes. The growing importance of monetary policy and the diminishing role played by fiscal policy in economic stabilisation efforts may reflect both political and economic realities. Monetary and fiscal policies differ in the speed with which each takes effect as the time lags are variable. Monetary policy is flexible (rates can be changed each month) and emergency rate changes can be made, whereas changes in taxation take longer to organize and implement. Also, considerable time may pass between the decision to adopt a government <b>spending</b> <b>programme</b> and its implementation. monetary policy, Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} effective federalism {{in relation}} to the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT), now a AU 2. 5 billion environmental policy initiative, and Australia's largest ever single environmental <b>spending</b> <b>programme.</b> In the absence of any other policy reviews or critiques, this paper is a descriptive and analytical piece, outlining and evaluating the NHT's administration, accountability measures and ecological outcomes against the goals of effective federalism. Effective federalism involves the national government seeking more efficient and effective delivery of environmental outcomes while revitalizing its partnerships with state and local governments to protect the environment. Both this term and the NHT are initiatives of the conservative national coalition government (which has been in office now since 1996) and have been implemented by its Environment Minister, Senator Hill. For the benefit of international readers, this paper places effective federalism in its historical context, and in the context of very familiar tensionsfor and against the devolution of environmental governance. It finds effective federalism to be an ambitious aim, indeed more so than the NHT's legislative goals of generating environmental investment and raising community awareness about the need for ecological sustainability...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we analyse the Czech {{social and}} tax systems {{and their impact}} on income distribution. We use regular {{household}} surveys, organized and published by the Czech Statistical Office (CSO), for years 1999 - 2002. This longer time span allows us to identify some trends in the Czech social security system {{and their impact on}} well-being of various income groups. We find that while the total cost of the Czech social security system were not escalating in the period of 1999 - 2002, the illness benefit - already the largest <b>spending</b> <b>programme</b> - rose by enormous 72 % in these four years. This largesse failed, however, to improve income of the poorest households as the benefit is very inefficient in increasing income of the poorest households. We also find that spending on more focused programmes (social supplement and parental allowance) increased least. Last but not least, we analysed the impact of tax deductions on the income distribution in the Czech Republic. These deductions represent a massive transfer, comparable to all social benefits combined. Our analysis shows, that the impact of tax deductions on income of the poorest decile fell significantly over the period of 1999 - 2002. social policy, public budgets, income distribution...|$|E
40|$|As {{state and}} local governments have devoted a rising share of their {{resources}} to crime-related programmes, concerns have arisen that <b>spending</b> on other <b>programmes</b> such as education will fall. Coupled with growing public concerns over performance of the public education system, and expectations that prison populations will rise as states pass and enforce more stringent sentencing laws, {{it is not surprising that}} some view the expansion of crime-related programmes as troublesome. One hypothesis is that education and crime-related programmes directly compete for government expenditures so that what one programme gains the other must lose as in a fixed-pie situation. A competing hypothesis is that spending on these two public programmes are unrelated and therefore higher crime-related spending may also lead to higher taxes or public debt issuance, or to reduction in <b>spending</b> on <b>programmes</b> other than education. We estimate a three equation model of <b>spending</b> on crime-related <b>programmes,</b> <b>spending</b> on education, and the crime rate from which we directly test whether spending on crime and education influence each other. ...|$|R

The relationship between spending, income and deprivation is examined overall and for particular <b>spending</b> <b>programmes,</b> using a number of approaches including regression-based expenditure models. The conclusions suggest that spending is indeed targetted on poorer areas but raise questions about both the strength of this relationship and how best to measure deprivation and the need to spend. ...|$|R

40|$|Tax earmarking, or hypothecation, {{refers to}} the {{assigning}} of receipts either from a single tax base, or as a proportion from a wider pool of revenue, to a specific end use; it contrasts with general fund financing of expenditure from consolidated receipts. The idea has been seized on both by {{those who want to}} defend the public sector who think it would make taxation popular and by those who want to cut public spending who expect the opposite effect. Earmarking may be applied in a strong or substantive sense, or in a weak or nominal sense. In the strong case, revenue determines expenditure, or at least revenue must match expenditure, and there may be associated referendums on the amount of spending and the tax rate. In the weak case, earmarking is purely formal — undertaken to make the system more transparent and to inform the taxpayer of the cost of a service. Earmarking may also be wide, covering a whole <b>spending</b> <b>programme,</b> or narrow, for a specific project within a programme. The principal example of earmarking (nominal) in the UK today is National Insurance contributions (NICs) which go to the National Insurance Fund out of which contributory benefits are paid. This paper considers the range of support for earmarked taxes, examines the issues, and asks if there is a role for such taxes in the British system. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effectiveness}} of systematic and targeted investment in infrastructure, particularly transport, has divided {{opinion about the}} {{effectiveness of}} such spending as a tool for driving economies out of recession by creating jobs and economic growth. Ireland responded to a clamor for greatly increased investment in its infrastructure during its prolonged economic boom from the late 1990 's through to 2008 / 9. Empirical evidence is now available on which to assess the efficacy of that prolonged programme of infrastructure investment that was brought to an abrupt halt {{in the last few years}} following the onset of the worldwide financial and economic crisis in 2009. In the US, the idea of spending on public works projects like road-building as economic stimulus has been a mainstay of jobs proposals from both Congressional Democrats and the White House in recent years. The evidence from Ireland provides arguably a unique opportunity to evaluate the economic and related impacts of a massive <b>spending</b> <b>programme</b> that was the equivalent to the US investing more than $ 275 billion per annum for 10 years on transport infrastructure. The arguments for infrastructure spending among interest groups, lobbyists and many economists and the evidence for it stem from a variety of analytical tools and empirical evidence. This paper evaluates the Irish experience over the last decade on the basis of regional and census data as well as other secondary evidence and relevant literature. It also reviews the approaches and methods employed in and outcomes reported from the US, based largely on secondary evidence...|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} the ratio of its public debt and public deficit to GDP the United States lies {{in the middle of}} the pack of {{industrial}} countries. The period since 1980 is the only peacetime period outside the Great Depression to see a sustained increase in the debt-GDP ratio. The budgetary retrenchment planned by the Clinton administration is likely to prove insufficient to achieve a sustainable path, although the remaining permanent primary (non-interest) gap is small: between 0. 1 % and 1. 0 % of GDP. The maximal amount of seigniorage revenue that can be extracted at a constant rate of inflation is not far from the recent historical value of less that 0. 5 % of GDP. Subtracting net public sector investment from the conventional budget deficit is likely to overstate the government revenue producing potential of public sector investment. Public debt matters when markets are incomplete and/or lump-sum taxes are restricted. Future interest payments associated with the public debt are not equivalent to currently expected future transfer payments. Even ignoring the distortionary character of most real-world taxes and transfers, and holding constant the government's exhaustive <b>spending</b> <b>programme,</b> the `generational accounts' do not therefore constitute sufficient statistic for estimating the effect on aggregate consumption of the government's tax-transfer programme. Solving the immediate budgetary problems would still leave the much more serious macroeconomic problems of an undersized US Federal government sector and an inadequate US national saving rate.
