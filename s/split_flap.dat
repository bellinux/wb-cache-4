25|$|The Welkin {{required}} a sophisticated electrical system. This was to minimise {{the number of}} seals and points of entry in the cockpit for the controls and instrumentation. It took an electrician experienced in {{the features of the}} Welkin four hours to undertake a pre-flight check of this system. The wings were so large that the high lift Fowler flaps of the Whirlwind were not needed, and were replaced by a simple <b>split</b> <b>flap.</b> The extra wing area also required more stability, so the tail was lengthened to provide a longer moment arm. The armament − four Hispano 20 mm cannon − was the same as the Whirlwind's, but the Welkin carried the guns in a tray in its belly, which facilitated loading. In that position, muzzle flash was also less likely to dazzle the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|The wing {{radiators}} were shallower and set {{farther back}} on the wing. A new cooling system was introduced; this system was automatically regulated by a thermostat with interconnected variable position inlet and outlet flaps that would balance the lowest drag possible with the most efficient cooling. A new radiator, shallower but wider than that fitted to the E was developed. A boundary layer duct allowed continual airflow {{to pass through the}} airfoil above the radiator ducting and exit from the trailing edge of the upper <b>split</b> <b>flap.</b> The lower <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> was mechanically linked to the central [...] "main" [...] flap, while the upper <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> and forward bath lip position were regulated via a thermostatic valve which automatically positioned the flaps for maximum cooling effectiveness. In 1941 [...] "cutoff" [...] valves were introduced which allowed the pilot to shut down either wing radiator in the event of one being damaged; this allowed the remaining coolant to be preserved and the damaged aircraft returned to base. However, these valves were delivered to frontline units as kits, the number of which, for unknown reasons, was limited. These cutoff valves were later factory standard fitting for Bf 109 G and K series.|$|E
2500|$|The Sb.1 was {{designed}} by two engineering students from the Technische Universität München (Technical University of Munich), Ernst von Lößl/Loessl, (cousin of Eugen von Loessl killed at the Wasserkuppe on 9 August 1920) and Albert Finsterwalder. It was built by them {{with the assistance of}} the Munich branch of the Bayern Gliding Club during the winter of 1920-21. They were aware of the high-wing monoplane gliders that had been under development by Friedrich Harth, assisted by the teenage Willy Messerschmitt, since before 1915. By about 1920 Harth was convinced that long glider flights depended on energy capture from gusts (ridge and thermal lift was undiscovered) and the Harth-Messerschmitt designs were controlled in pitch by a variable angle of incidence wing and roll by wing warping. Its pilot had two levers, one for roll and the other for pitch. The tailplane was fixed. Lößl and Finsterwalder took these ideas a stage further by making the wings separately rotatable and controlled with a conventional column, which when moved sideways rotated the wings in opposite directions. [...] The fixed tailplane was retained but the conventional fin and rudder of the Harth-Messerschmitt was entirely removed; instead, yaw was controlled by the opening above and below the wing of little wing tip trailing edge double <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> airbrakes. This last feature did not work well so the brakes were replaced by a conventional, rectangular rudder; this was further modified later by adding a triangular tip, forming a balanced rudder. At the same time a fixed fin was added.|$|E
40|$|Aerodynamic {{characteristics}} of a tapered NACA 23012 airfoil with single and double perforated <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> have been determined in the NACA 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel. Dynamic pressure surveys were made behind the airfoil at the approximate location of the tail {{in order to determine}} the extent and location of the wake for several of the flap arrangements. In addition, computations have been made of an application of perforated double <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> for use as fighter brakes. The results indicated that single or double perforated <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> may be used to obtain satisfactory dive control without undue buffeting effects and that single or double perforated <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> may also be used as fighter brakes. The perforated <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> had approximately the same effects on the aerodynamic and wake {{characteristics of}} the tapered airfoil as on a comparable rectangular airfoil...|$|R
40|$|A {{low speed}} survey was {{conducted}} on a 3. 44 aspect ratio wing having a 65 ° swept-back leading edge and double wedge symmetrical airfoil section to obtain information as {{to the effectiveness of}} various high-lift devices. These devices included trailing edge split and extended <b>split</b> <b>flaps,</b> leading edge <b>split</b> <b>flaps,</b> slats and combined configurations. Tests were carried out on the wing with and without the fuselage and horizontal tail surface. The <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> increased the lift over the lower ranges of angle of attack only. The extended <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> increased the lift over the whole angle of attack range. Hose flaps showed practically no gain over any of the range when used by themselves. However, when combined with the trailing edge <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> in the wing-fuselage configuration, the optimum maximum lift conditions were obtained. Addition of the fuselage and horizontal tail surfaces each produced considerable increments of lift. In all configurations except leading edge flaps in the inboard position undesirably large negative pitching moments resulted. However, they had stabilizing tendencies except where there were irregularities in the lift curves...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{described in}} this report was made to determine the change in aerodynamic forces and moments produced by <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> in a steady spin. The test were made with the spinning balance in the NACA 5 -foot vertical wind tunnel. A low-wing monoplane model was tested with and without the <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> in 12 spinning attitudes chosen to cover the probable spinning range. The changes in coefficients produced by adding the <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> are given for longitudinal force, normal force, and rolling and yawing moments about body axes. The results obtained indicate {{that the use of}} <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> on an airplane is unlikely, in any case, to have much beneficial effect on a spin, and it might make the spin dangerous. The change in the spin will depend upon the aerodynamic and inertia characteristics of the particular airplane. A dangerous condition is most likely to be attained with airplanes which are statically stable in yaw in the spinning attitude and which have large weights distributed along wings...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> that slides backwards, before hinging downward, thereby {{increasing}} first chord, then camber.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the effects of full-span and of partial-span <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> on the aerodynamic characteristics of a tapered wing. Aerodynamic force tests were made in the N. A. C.

The investigation showed that with full-span <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> the lift and drag characteristics of the tapered wing up to the stall are similar to those of a rectangular wing with flaps of comparable size, but that the stall of the tapered wing with full-span flaps occurs at progressively lower angles of attack with increasing flap deflection up to that for maximum lift. For partial-span tapered <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> on a tapered wing it was found that the maximum lift is greater, and the lift-drag ratio at maximum lift is less, when the partial-span flap is located at the center of the wing than when it is located at the tip portion...|$|R
50|$|Many vintage digital clocks with <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> {{displays}} {{cannot be}} wound back, as the flip mechanism operates only in one direction.

50|$|A {{gap between}} the flap and the wing forces high {{pressure}} air from below the wing over the flap helping the airflow remain attached to the flap, increasing lift compared to a <b>split</b> <b>flap.</b> Additionally, lift across the entire chord of the primary airfoil is greatly increased as the velocity of air leaving its trailing edge is raised, from the typical non-flap 80% of freestream, {{to that of the}} higher-speed, lower-pressure air flowing around {{the leading edge of the}} slotted flap. Any flap that allows air to pass between the wing and the flap is considered a slotted flap. The slotted flap was a result of research at Handley-Page, a variant of the slot that dates from the 1920s, but wasn't widely used until much later. Some flaps use multiple slots to further boost the effect.|$|E

At full deflection, a <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> acts much like a spoiler, adding significantly to drag coefficient. It also adds a little to lift coefficient. It was invented by Orville Wright and James M. H. Jacobs in 1920, but only became common in the 1930s and was then quickly superseded.
