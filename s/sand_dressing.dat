25|$|Goddard {{was forced}} to become Gloucestershire's chief bowler when the {{seemingly}} ageless Parker finally declined for good in 1932. Except in 1934 and 1938 when injuries handicapped him, and in 1948 when he lost form, Goddard took over 150 wickets in every season between 1932 and 1949, heading the first-class bowling averages in 1947 and 1949. In 1937 and 1947 (aided {{in the latter case}} by a <b>sand</b> <b>dressing</b> on the Bristol pitch that made the ball turn prodigiously), Goddard took 222 wickets for Gloucestershire, and fell two short of 250 wickets in all first-class matches in 1937 when {{he was one of the}} Wisden Cricketers of the Year.|$|E
50|$|Born in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, Cook was a {{small and}} stocky slow left-arm spinner, who emerged {{unexpectedly}} after World War II when Gloucestershire had lost Tom Goddard’s former partner Reg Sinfield. Wally Hammond {{saw him in the}} nets during the spring, and took Cook on immediately with great expectations that were amply fulfilled. Cook, who was never known by his given name, took a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket, and 133 wickets in the 1946 season, when he played in the Test Trial. No great spinner of the ball, Cook relied on accuracy and flight: if he lacked penetration as a bowler, he was also very rarely mastered. In the following year with the Bristol pitch - which had caused little satisfaction for its tendency to be either a spinners’ (as in 1939) or a batsman's (as in 1946) paradise - being reconditioned with a <b>sand</b> <b>dressing,</b> Cook offered superb support to Goddard to form to most difficult bowling attack in the country. Cook was called into the England team to play the South Africans on the batsman's pitch at Trent Bridge in 1947, after taking six South African wickets in the second innings of the MCC match in May. However, in the Test match, he took no wickets for 127 runs, scored 0 and 4, and was never picked again. The Kent fast bowler Jack Martin, who had done equally well in the MCC match, was also picked for the Trent Bridge Test, also fared badly, and was likewise discarded, never to appear in Test cricket again. In 1948, with the Bristol pitch dressed with loam instead of sand, Cook declined considerably and never threatened the superbly-skilled Australian batsmen, and in 1949 he took until August to recapture any sort of form.|$|E

25|$|Sand's {{reputation}} {{came into}} question {{when she began}} sporting men's clothing in public, which she justified by the clothes being far sturdier and less expensive than the typical dress of a noblewoman at the time. In addition to being comfortable, <b>Sand's</b> male <b>dress</b> enabled her to circulate more freely in Paris than most of her female contemporaries, and gave her increased access to venues from which women were often barred, even women of her social standing. Also scandalous was Sand's smoking tobacco in public; neither peerage nor gentry had yet sanctioned the free indulgence of women in such a habit, especially in public (though Franz Liszt's paramour Marie d'Agoult affected this as well, smoking large cigars).|$|R

50|$|The pounamu {{used to make}} a mere was {{carefully}} chosen to be flawless and to have a good colour. A block of greenstone was first rough cut using pieces of quartzite combined with <b>sand</b> and water. <b>Dressing</b> of the surface was done with fine sandstone and pieces of very hard smooth stone. Due to the toughness of greenstone, mere pounamu were able to be made thinner than other similar patu made from stone, however this made the process of manufacture slow and arduous. The creation and finishing of a mere pounamu is claimed to have sometimes taken more than one generation to complete.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As {{the poultry}} {{industry}} has grown and expanded and as alternative uses of wood by-products have expanded, {{the availability of}} wood shavings and sawdust for litter materials has been challenged. Litter type utilized is largely dependent upon local availability of the material and location of the farm. Unfortunately, the availability of pine shavings has steadily decreased due to competition for its use from other industries and use as an energy source. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate conventional litter sources to sand as a substitute litter. For the experiment Pine Wood Shavings (PWS), Rice Hulls (RH), River Bed Sand (S) and river bed <b>sand</b> top <b>dressed</b> with pine wood shavings (SP) were the four litter source treatments implemented. Chicks were identified and randomly allocated in a randomized complete block design. Litter temperatures were recorded prior to bird placement. Body weight, cumulative feed consumption, feed conversion (feed: body weight) and litter moisture were determined on a weekly basis through 42 days of age. Mortality was recorded daily. At processing carcass weight, percentage carcass yield without giblets and gizzard yield were determined on a prechilled basis. Litter surface temperatures were significantly (p< 0. 001) higher for PWS, RH and SP compared to just S alone. Broilers raised on S had significantly (p< 0. 001) higher body weights and consumed more feed than those raised on PWS or RH throughout the 42 days.

60|$|In {{the cabinet}} of the Essex Historical Society, old portraits.--Governor Leverett; a dark mustachioed face, the figure two-thirds length, clothed {{in a sort}} of frock-coat, buttoned, and a broad {{sword-belt}} girded round the waist, and fastened with a large steel buckle; the hilt of the sword steel,--altogether very striking. Sir William Pepperell, in English regimentals, coat, waistcoat, and breeches, all of red broadcloth, richly gold-embroidered; he holds a general's truncheon in his right hand, and extends the left towards the batteries erected against Louisbourg, in the country near which he is standing. Endicott, Pyncheon, and others, in scarlet robes, bands, etc. Half a dozen or more family portraits of the Olivers, some in plain dresses brown, crimson, or claret; others with gorgeous gold-embroidered waistcoats, descending almost to the knees, so as to form the most conspicuous article of dress. Ladies, with lace ruffles, the painting of which, in one of the pictures, cost five guineas. Peter Oliver, who was crazy, used to fight with these family pictures in the old Mansion House; and the face and breast of one lady bear cuts and stabs inflicted by him. Miniatures in oil, with the paint peeling off, of stern, old, yellow faces. Oliver Cromwell, apparently an old picture, half length, or one third, in an oval frame, probably painted for some New England partisan. Some pictures that had been partly obliterated by scrubbing with <b>sand.</b> The <b>dresses,</b> embroidery, laces of the Oliver family are generally better done than the faces. Governor Leverett's gloves,--the glove part of coarse leather, but round the wrist a deep, three or four inch border of spangles and silver embroidery. Old drinking-glasses, with tall stalks. A black glass bottle, stamped with the name of Philip English, with a broad bottom. The baby-linen, etc., of Governor Bradford of Plymouth County. Old manuscript sermons, some written in short-hand, others in a hand that seems learnt from print.|$|R
40|$|Approximately 127 {{million tonnes}} of waste and {{comparable}} by-products were generated in Finland in 2000. Of this total amount, the largest quantities are surplus soil from construction (34 million tones), wall rock, ore <b>dressing</b> <b>sand</b> and other soil material from {{mining and quarrying}} (26 million tones in all), straw and manure from agriculture (25 million tonnes) and wood felling waste from forestry (20 million tonnes). Altogether nearly 17 million tones of waste were generated in manufacturing in 2000, of which the largest quantities were waste wood and bark, slag from the basic metal industry, especially gypsum, and liquid wastes from the food industry. The annual volume of solid municipal waste amounted to 2. 6 million tones. Smaller amounts than those listed above were generated as ash and slag from energy production, construction materials from new building and demolition and as sludge from waste water treatment. On average, 40 per cent of all the generated waste are recovered by the national economy as a whole. In thems of volume this represents approximately 50 million tones. Wastes like surplus soils from construction, as well as manure and straw, were recovered in large volumes. Manufacturing recovered 67 per cent of its waste, either as energy or as raw material. goo...|$|R
