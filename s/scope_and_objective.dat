At 11:00 PM the IDF entered Ein Zahalta and were caught in a battle against a Syrian division, which halted its advance. Sharon used this as his principal argument for launching Mole Cricket 19. Yekutiel Adam, former Deputy Chief of Staff and designated Head of the Mossad, voiced his concern that the Cabinet was not fully aware of the war's <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>objective.</b> Nevertheless, Sharon gave North Command chief, Amir Drori, a go-ahead to drive on the Beqaa valley, and Deputy Chief of Staff Moshe Levi flew to Ein Zahalta to tell the commander, Menachem Einan, that the IAF would attack the Syrian missiles that day. Meanwhile, Ivry learned that unmanned aerial vehicles had spotted an additional five SA-6s moving from the Golan Heights into the Beqaa Valley. The IAF interpreted that move as a signal that Syria had no intention of becoming involved in a major war— otherwise the SAMs would have been positioned to defend the approach to Damascus. The redeployment suggested to Ivry that they could strike the SAM sites without risking an all-out war with Syria.|$|E

The SCF serves as an overarching fund to support targeted programs with dedicated funding to pilot new approaches with potential for scaled-up, transformational action aimed at a specific climate change challenge or sectoral response. One of SCF target programs is the Program for Scaling-Up Renewable Energy in Low Income Countries (SREP), approved in May 2009, and is aimed at demonstrating the economic, social and environmental viability of low carbon development pathways in the energy sector by creating new economic opportunities and increasing energy access through the use of renewable energy." ...|$|E

We desire no clashes with the Syrian army, if we reach the line 40 km from our northern border the work will have been done, all fighting will end. I am directing my words to the ears of the President of Syria. He knows how to keep an agreement. He signed a cease-fire with us and kept it. He did not allow the terrorists to act. If he behaves in this manner now in Lebanon, no Syrian soldier will be harmed by our soldiers".That night, while the Battle of Jezzine was raging in central Lebanon, Sharon said at a meeting in the Northern Command headquarters [...] "We know today {{that there will be a}} direct confrontation with the Syrians" [...] and argued that it would be best to move deeper into Lebanon.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> of four EU regions’ European policies and programmes. It evaluates {{the extent to which}} regions’ European engagement is targeted to achieving regional economic development {{on the one hand and}} European social integration and identity construction on the other hand. The analysis starts with a comparative evaluation of the four case study regions’ European policies and is substantiated by the findings of over 60 interviews with regional political elites and civil servants in the four case study regions: Germany’s Brandenburg; Belgium’s Wallonia; France’s Nord – Pas de Calais; and the South West of England. This thesis advances a more comprehensive understanding of regional governments as European actors, whether political elites and civil servants aim to promote European identity-building through their policies, as well as which regional characteristics further impact the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> of their European policies. This thesis provides evidence-based answers to the research question posed: What are the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> of regions’ European policies and what role does European identity play in them? The thesis research has grown out of the context of regions’ EU integration; the multi-level governance approach; the increase of regions’ political authority vis-à-vis European politics; and the uncertainty on whether regional political actors (political elites and civil servants) aim to foster a European identity. Research has not yet observed, compared <b>and</b> analysed the <b>objectives</b> of regions’ European policies in terms of European identity-building.

The characteristics of different risk assessment methods were compared focusing on systemic challenges of analysis including complexity and uncertainty. Different alternatives of modeling systems are proposed, compared and discussed according to their operational appropriateness with the focus on systemic challenges of analysis including complexity and uncertainty.

40|$|Metamodels {{have proven}} {{be very useful}} {{when it comes to}} {{reducing}} the computational requirements of Evolutionary Algorithm-based optimization by acting as quick-solving surrogates for slow-solving fitness functions. The relationship between metamodel <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> function varies between applications, that is, in some cases the metamodel acts as a surrogate for the whole fitness function, whereas in other cases it replaces only a component of the fitness function. This paper presents a formalized qualitative process to evaluate a fitness function to determine the most suitable metamodel scope so as to increase the likelihood of calibrating a high-fidelity metamodel and hence obtain good optimization results in a reasonable amount of time. The process is applied to the risk-based optimization of water distribution systems; a very computationally-intensive problem for real-world systems. The process is validated with a simple case study (modified New York Tunnels) and the power of metamodelling is demonstrated on a real-world case study (Pacific City) with a computational speed-up of several orders of magnitude...|$|E
