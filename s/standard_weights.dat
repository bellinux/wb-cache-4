(For background information, see History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification.) The libbra (pound) generally consisted of the standard twelve ounces, however.|$|E

The Australian Poultry Standard and British Poultry Standard call for Silkie bantams much smaller; in the Australian, the <b>standard</b> <b>weights</b> are 680 g (25oz) for males and 570 g (20oz) for females. The British standard weight for bantam Silkies is 600 g (22oz) for males, and 500 g for females (18oz).|$|E
5|$|The Jewel Tower {{was taken}} over by the newly formed <b>Standard</b> <b>Weights</b> and Measures Department in 1869, who used it for storing and testing {{official}} weights and measures. The rising levels of London traffic made the tower increasingly unsuitable for this work, and by 1938 the department had abandoned it in favour of other facilities. In 1948, the building was placed into the care of the Ministry of Works, who repaired the damage inflicted to the tower during the Second World War, and extensively restored the building, clearing the surrounding area and opening the tower for tourists. In the 21st century, the Jewel Tower is managed by English Heritage, receiving around 30,000 visitors each year.|$|E

For example, Anderson and Neumann report different <b>standard</b> <b>weight</b> equations for {{male and female}} paddlefish. Some researchers have also reported separate <b>standard</b> <b>weight</b> equations when a species has lentic (living in still water) and lotic (living in flowing water) populations.

25|$|The avoirdupois pound, {{also known}} as the wool pound, first came into general use c. 1300. It was {{initially}} equal to 6992 troy grains. The pound avoirdupois was divided into 16 ounces. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the avoirdupois pound was redefined as 7,000 troy grains. Since then, the grain has often been {{an integral part of the}} avoirdupois system. By 1758, two Elizabethan Exchequer <b>standard</b> <b>weights</b> for the avoirdupois pound existed, and when measured in troy grains they were found to be of 7,002 grains and 6,999 grains.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} assumed, on {{the authority of}} ancient commentators that Solon also reformed the Athenian coinage. However, recent numismatic studies now lead {{to the conclusion that}} Athens probably had no coinage until around 560 BC, well after Solon's reforms. Nevertheless, there are now reasons to suggest that monetization had already begun before Solon's reforms. By early sixth century the Athenians were using silver {{in the form of a}} variety of bullion silver pieces for monetary payments. Drachma and obol as a term of bullion value had already been adopted, although the corresponding <b>standard</b> <b>weights</b> were probably unstable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>weight</b> curves {{are often}} based on the 75th {{percentile}} weight data rather than the average of all the data available. Murphy et al. (1991) suggested that it is preferable that <b>standard</b> <b>weight</b> equations represent the entire geographical range of a species, and that they be used for comparison purposes rather than management targets. Practically, weight-length equations are often developed for sub-populations from specific geographic areas, but these are different from <b>standard</b> <b>weight</b> relationships.|$|R

25|$|The {{history of}} {{measurement}} systems in India begins in early Indus Valley Civilisation with the earliest surviving samples dated to the 5th millennium BCE. Since early times {{the adoption of}} <b>standard</b> <b>weights</b> and measures has reflected in the country's architectural, folk, and metallurgical artifacts. A complex system of weights and measures {{was adopted by the}} Maurya empire (322185 BCE), which also formulated regulations for the usage of this system. Later, the Mughal empire (15261857) used standard measures to determine land holdings and collect land tax as a part of Mughal land reforms. The formal metrication in India is dated to 1 April 1957 when the Indian Government adopted the International System of Units (SI).|$|E

50|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>weight</b> {{is used as}} a {{basis for}} {{comparison}} to assess the health of an individual or group of fish. Generally, fish that are heavier than the <b>standard</b> <b>weight</b> for their length are considered healthier, having more energy reserves for normal activities, growth and reproduction.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{equation}} is for <b>standard</b> <b>weight,</b> the <b>standard</b> <b>weight</b> {{for a given}} length is written as Ws. The exponent b is close to 3.0 for most species. The coefficient a varies between species. If the exponent b is greater than three for a certain fish species, that species tends to become relatively fatter or have more girth as it grows longer. For largemouth bass, the value of b is 3.273. If the exponent b is less than three for a certain fish species, that species {{tends to be more}} streamlined. For burbot, the value of b is 2.898. While the <b>standard</b> <b>weight</b> for a largemouth bass that is 500 mm long is about 2 kg, the <b>standard</b> <b>weight</b> for a burbot that is 500 mm long is only about 0.9 kg.|$|R
500|$|Darius {{organized}} the empire by dividing it into provinces and placing satraps to govern it. He organized a new uniform monetary system, along with making Aramaic {{the official language}} of the empire. He also put the empire in better standing by building roads and introducing <b>standard</b> <b>weights</b> and measures. Through these changes the empire was centralized and unified. Darius also worked on construction projects throughout the empire, focusing on Susa, Pasargadae, Persepolis, Babylon and Egypt. [...] He had the cliff-face Behistun Inscription carved to record his conquests, an important testimony of the Old Persian language.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>weights</b> and {{measures}} {{were developed by}} the Indus Valley Civilisation. The centralised weight and measure system served the commercial interest of Indus merchants as smaller weight measures were used to measure luxury goods while larger weights were employed for buying bulkier items, such as food grains etc. Weights existed in multiples of a standard weight and in categories. [...] Technical standardisation enabled gauging devices to be effectively used in angular measurement and measurement for construction. Uniform units of length {{were used in the}} planning of towns such as Lothal, Surkotada, Kalibangan, Dolavira, Harappa, and Mohenjo-daro. The weights {{and measures}} of the Indus civilisation also reached Persia and Central Asia, where they were further modified. Shigeo Iwata describes the excavated weights unearthed from the Indus civilisation: ...|$|E
2500|$|Hoshaiah {{was called}} the [...] "father of the Mishnah," [...] {{not so much because}} of his {{collection}} and edition of the mishnayot, as because of the ability with which he explained and interpreted them (see Yer. Ḳid. i. 60a; Yer. B. Ḳ. iv. 4c). Hoshaiah's most important halakic decision is directed against the <b>standard</b> <b>weights</b> and measures, held by R. Johanan to be traditional from the Sinaitic period. Hoshaiah's radical point of view can be traced to his theory of the development of the Mishnah. He even {{goes so far as to}} overrule both Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel with reference to offerings brought on visiting the Temple in Jerusalem three times every year (Ḥag. i. 2). The custom of greeting mourners on the Sabbath was permitted in southern Galilee, including Cæsarea, and prohibited in other places. Hoshaiah happened to be in a certain town on the Sabbath, and, meeting mourners, greeted them, saying, [...] "I do not know your custom, but I greet you according to our custom" [...] (Yer. M. Ḳ. iii. 82d).|$|E
