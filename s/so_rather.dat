5|$|Central Independent Television had {{confidence}} in the project, <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> than the show being shot at their studios in Nottingham as planned, they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on 16 mm film, rather than the regular, less expensive videotape, and on location, making it very expensive compared with most children's television. These high production costs almost led to its cancellation {{at the end of}} the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{elaborate}} carved stone battle-axes found in East Lothian, Aberdenshire and Lanarkshire. These show little sign of use or wear, and <b>so,</b> <b>rather</b> than being practical objects, may be symbolic representations of power. Similarly, the site at Forteviot, in Perthshire, produced a unique warrior burial under a giant sandstone slab. The slab is engraved with a spiral {{and has an}} axehead pecked into the underside, and underneath there are grave goods of a copper dagger with leather scabbard and a carved wooden bowl.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, {{fourteen}} standard stock {{motor cars}} were withdrawn from passenger service, and {{were converted to}} ballast motor cars, with the final one completed in early 1955. All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923, four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co. At least {{three of them were}} chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage. They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> than repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 motor car. The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 motor car was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a new number, becoming L77. During the 1970s, the ballast motor cars were gradually withdrawn. The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.|$|E
5|$|Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based {{systematics}} {{have usually}} given the Hexapoda {{the rank of}} superclass, and identified four groups within it: insects (Ectognatha), springtails (Collembola), Protura, and Diplura, the latter three being grouped together as the Entognatha {{on the basis of}} internalized mouth parts. Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data. A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic (where the last common ancestor was {{not a member of the}} group), with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta. Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic, <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> than using ranks like subclass, superorder, and infraorder, it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings (in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group). The following represents the best-supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta.|$|E
5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution was {{developed}} over eight months {{by a team}} of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for Ridge Racer Revolution. The biggest difficulties were the link-up mode, rear-view mirror, and running the game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth game than the original, <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> than develop a port of Ridge Racer 2, as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. The rear-view mirror was added primarily with the two player link-up mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from Ridge Racer 2, and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition involved four musicians, who composed for Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, and Rave Racer. The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course was a challenge, and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's link-up instead.|$|E

25|$|The Vikings {{had been}} {{defeated}} by the West Saxon King Æthelwulf in 851, <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> than land in Wessex they decided to go further north to East Anglia. Legend {{has it that the}} united army was led by the three sons of Ragnar Lodbrok: Halfdan Ragnarsson, Ivar the Boneless (Hingwar), and Ubba. Norse sagas consider the invasion by the three brothers {{as a response to the}} death of their father at the hands of Ælla of Northumbria in 865, but the historicity of this claim is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Ichthyoconodon, a eutriconodont {{from the}} Berriasian of Morocco, is {{currently}} known from molariforms found in marine deposits. These teeth are sharp-cusped and similar in shape {{to those of}} piscivorous mammals, and unlike the teeth of contemporary mammals they do not show degradation, <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> than being carried down by river deposits the animal died in situ or close. This has been taken to mean {{that it was a}} marine mammal, likely one of the few examples known from the Mesozoic. Alternatively, its close relations to Volaticotherium and Argentoconodon might suggest that it was a flying mammal.|$|E

25|$|The {{exhibition}} {{closed in}} the late 1990s {{and almost all of}} the exhibits were taken away. The locomotive The Queen was too expensive to remove, <b>so,</b> <b>rather</b> than being cut up, it was incorporated as a feature of a restaurant on the concourse. It is still there today, but looking a little tired. The tender– the only original (and historic) part of the replica engine– was sold to a scrap dealer and cut up, although the springs and axleboxes were salvaged for use in the replica LB Atlantic project at the Bluebell Railway, and part of one side was rescued by the Slough and Windsor Railway Society, where it is now on display.|$|E
25|$|Silica {{is rather}} inert chemically. It is not {{attacked}} by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid. However, it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis, and does <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates to give metal silicates. Among the elements, it is attacked only by fluorine {{at room temperature}} to form silicon tetrafluoride: hydrogen and carbon also react, but require temperatures over 1000°C to do so. Silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and metalloid oxides to form {{a wide variety of}} compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all, but also have many other uses: for example, sodium silicate is often used in detergents due to its buffering, saponifying, and emulsifying properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} {{determined}} by two factors: first, the Crown wanted to protect the settlement from being destroyed by rebels like the Munster plantation. <b>So</b> <b>rather</b> than settling the planters in isolated pockets of land confiscated from convicted rebels, they confiscated all {{of the land and}} redistributed it, creating concentrations of British settlers around new towns and garrisons. The new landowners were explicitly banned from taking on Irish tenants, and had to import their tenant farmers from England and Scotland. The remaining Irish landowners were granted one quarter of the land in Ulster. The common Irish residents were to be relocated to live near garrisons and Protestant churches, the more ready for Protestant control. The Planters were barred from selling their lands to any Irishman.|$|E

25|$|The Bene Gesserit {{choose to}} use {{indirect}} methodologies to further their goals, rather than wield overt power themselves. They have noted the Taoist principle that whatever rises must fall; and <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> than taking direct control of the human race, they instead manipulate {{the social and political}} order with subtlety and insinuation, often using extraordinarily long-term stratagems spanning generations. The Bene Gesserit avoid appearing too rich or powerful, or revealing the extent of their powers, to prevent being seen as overtly responsible for {{the rise and fall of}} governments and empires, and to avoid any organized backlash. To this end, the Bene Gesserit provide some of their trained initiates as wives and concubines, and will train the daughters of noble families for a fee.|$|E
25|$|As Piaget {{believed}} {{development was}} a universal process, his initial sample sizes were inadequate, {{particularly in the}} formulation of his theory of infant development. Piaget’s theories of infant development were based on his observations of his own three children. While this clearly presents problems with the sample size, Piaget also probably introduced confounding variables and social desirability into his observations and his conclusions based on his observations. It is entirely possible Piaget conditioned his children to respond in a desirable manner, <b>so,</b> <b>rather</b> than having an understanding of object permanence, his children might have learned to behave in a manner that indicated they understood object permanence. The sample was also very homogenous, as all three children had a similar genetic heritage and environment. Piaget did, however, have larger sample sizes during his later years.|$|E

25|$|<b>So</b> <b>rather</b> than {{treat the}} issue as a rich text problem of glyph alternates, Unicode added the concept of {{variation}} selectors, first introduced in version 3.2 and supplemented in version 4.0. While variation selectors are treated as combining characters, they have no associated diacritic or mark. Instead, by combining with a base character, they signal the two character sequence selects a variation (typically in terms of grapheme, but {{also in terms of}} underlying meaning {{as in the case of}} a location name or other proper noun) of the base character. This then is not a selection of an alternate glyph, but the selection of a grapheme variation or a variation of the base abstract character. Such a two-character sequence however can be easily mapped to a separate single glyph in modern fonts. Since Unicode has assigned 256 separate variation selectors, it is capable of assigning 256 variations for any Han ideograph. Such variations can be specific to one language or another and enable the encoding of plain text that includes such grapheme variations.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the battle Sulla erected a trophy which he dedicated to the Roman gods Mars, for delivering victory to Rome, and also to Venus, in the spirit of fortune for the luck granted to the Romans. Further, he held victory games at Thebes, during which he may have been made aware of the approach of Valerius Flaccus who had recently landed in Epirus. Flaccus and Sulla met in Thessaly, though neither army made a move, both armies set up camp and waited for the other to attack. No attack came, and after some time Flaccus' soldiers began to desert in favour of Sulla, at first slowly but with time in increasing numbers, eventually Flaccus had to break camp or lose his entire army. During this time, Archelaus, who had wintered on the Island of Euboea, was reinforced by a large army of Mithridates at Chalcis and decided to move back into Boeotia. Both Sulla and Flaccus were aware of these developments, <b>so,</b> <b>rather</b> than waste Roman troops to fight each other, Flaccus took his soldiers and headed for Asia Minor while Sulla turned back to face Archelaus once again. Sulla moved his army a few miles to the east of Chaeronea and into position near Orchomenos, a place he chose for its natural entrenchment. Here, Sulla once more, and once again outnumbered, faced off against Archelaus at the Battle of Orchomenus.|$|E
500|$|In 1943, in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association, Kenneth Edgeworth {{hypothesized}} that, in {{the region}} beyond Neptune, the material within the primordial solar nebula was too widely spaced to condense into planets, and <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> condensed into a myriad of smaller bodies. From this he concluded that [...] "the outer region of the solar system, beyond the orbits of the planets, is occupied by {{a very large number}} of comparatively small bodies" [...] and that, from time to time, one of their number [...] "wanders from its own sphere and appears as an occasional visitor to the inner solar system", becoming a comet.|$|E
