5|$|In August 2013, Dina Eastwood {{announced}} that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> been living separately {{for an undisclosed}} length of time. On October 23, 2013, Dina filed for divorce after she withdrew her request for legal separation, citing irreconcilable differences. She asked for full custody of their 16-year-old daughter, Morgan, as well as spousal support. The divorce was finalized on December 22, 2014. Eastwood has since been linked publicly with photographer Erica Tomlinson-Fisher (no relation to Frances), 41 years his junior, and restaurant hostess Christina Sandera, 33 years his junior. He and Sandera went public with their relationship at the 87th Academy Awards in February 2015.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter was {{the uncle}} of Mrs Henry Williams of Moor Park House, Beckwithshaw, North Yorkshire. In 1897 he consecrated St Michaels and All Angels Church at Beckwithshaw, after <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> funded its construction.|$|E
25|$|Carmen Barahona, Jorge's wife, told {{investigators}} when questioned that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> been separated for six months, {{when in fact}} they had never been apart. The couple's other two children were taken from the home and placed with Carmen's parents, then placed in foster care.|$|E

50|$|In 1966, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> {{were both}} awarded Freedom of the City of Aberdeen. An Aberdeen street was named in <b>her</b> honour. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> are commemorated by a plaque at 38 Albyn Place.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> are divorced.|$|R
25|$|Free {{women might}} marry slaves {{and still be}} dowered for the marriage. The {{children}} were free, and at the slave's death, the wife took her dowry and half of what <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> acquired in wedlock for self and children; the master taking the other half, as his slave's heir.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} manner, {{converts}} {{were made in}} Norway and Chile. A letter published in The Midnight Cry of October 12, 1843, from a Mrs O. S. Burnham of Kaloa, The Sandwich Islands, (now Hawaii) stated that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> accepted the Millerite message and were worshipping with a small company of believers.|$|E
25|$|She {{moved into}} her husband's {{apartment}} in Cambridge and {{gave birth to}} their daughter Zahara in late 2010. At times, {{she worked as a}} home health aide. From September 2011 to November 2012, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> their income supplemented by public assistance and food stamps. When Tsarnaev was in Russia for six months, she and their daughter stayed in Cambridge.|$|E

25|$|During Kennedy's presidency, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> come {{to respect}} him and {{understood}} his reluctance {{at times to}} get involved openly with civil rights. In April 1962, Coretta served as delegate for the Women's Strike for Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Martin drove {{her to the hospital}} on March 28, 1963, where King gave birth to their fourth child Bernice. After King and her daughter were due to come home, Martin rushed back to drive them himself.|$|E
25|$|In September 1981, a {{short while}} {{after the death of}} his father, he {{accompanied}} his mother on a voyage to Spain, after she had been granted a request to visit the sites where <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> fought as young people. Unlike Hermina Tismăneanu, he opted not to return, and soon after left for Venezuela, before ultimately settling in the United States in 1982. During his time in Caracas, he was the recipient of a scholarship at the Contemporary Art Museum.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s were {{a decade}} of loss for Parks in her {{personal}} life. Her family was plagued with illness; <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> suffered stomach ulcers for years and both required hospitalization. In spite of her fame and constant speaking engagements, Parks was not a wealthy woman. She donated {{most of the money}} from speaking to civil rights causes, and lived on her staff salary and her husband's pension. Medical bills and time missed from work caused financial strain that required her to accept assistance from church groups and admirers.|$|E

25|$|Her {{colon cancer}} recurred in 1955. Despite her limited {{schedule}} of eight golfing events that season, Zaharias won her last two tournaments in competitive golf. On September 27, 1956, Zaharias died of her illness {{at the age}} of forty-five at the John Sealy Hospital in Galveston, Texas. At the time of her death, she was still a top-ranked female golfer. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> earlier established the Babe Zaharias Fund to support cancer clinics. She is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in her hometown of Beaumont, Texas.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of Rita and Charlie, Lofty was left to run the ED and began to {{struggle}} when disruptive patients were admitted. Since there was a staff shortage, Lofty hired agency nurse Diane Stuart (Catherine Skinner). When Lofty caught Diane sleeping on the job, she revealed <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> recently separated, which Lofty sympathised with and so, gives her a second chance. Later, Lofty, Dylan and Diane are with a patient in a lift when the lift breaks down and the patient flatlines. As Lofty prepares to resuscitate, Diane fails to remove her hand from the patient and is electrocuted, killing herself.|$|E
25|$|Caroline Owens, Anna Marie West, {{and several}} other {{survivors}} of sexual assaults at the Wests' hands each testified at Rose's trial {{that she had been}} by far the more calculating, aggressive and controlling of the two, with Owens also stating that, at one stage in her ordeal, Fred had confided that Owens had been abducted primarily for Rose's gratification. It is possible Rose's increasing family size, plus the fact <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had,</b> by the mid-1970s, begun seeking avenues to exploit girls from care homes in addition to acquiring contacts—willing or unwilling—to submit to their fetishes, may have led Fred and Rose to decide that these avenues of control and domination were sufficient for their satisfaction.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, November 24, 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy {{requested}} {{an eternal}} flame for her husband's grave. According to several published accounts, she {{drew inspiration from}} a number of sources. One was the eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, which <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> seen during a visit to France in 1961. She also took inspiration from the novel The Candle in the Wind (the fourth book from the collection The Once and Future King by T. H. White), which was part of the inspiration for the 1960 stage musical Camelot (the cast recording was a favorite of the Kennedys). Her brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, counseled against an eternal flame, worried that it might appear ostentatious or that it would compete with other such memorials at Arlington National Cemetery. But Mrs. Kennedy was adamant.|$|E
25|$|Since casting Harley, however, Lloyd Webber {{had also}} begun to regret his artistic choices. As {{production}} continued on the show, {{the bulk of the}} score was revealing itself to be far more classical and operatic, entirely unsuited to Harley's rough, contemporary voice. Wanting instead a performer with a more classic, melodic voice, as described in the original book, he began yet another search for the perfect actor to play his Phantom. Crawford's landing of the role was due largely in part to the coincidence that Sarah Brightman, had taken lessons with the same vocal coach as Crawford. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> arrived early for her lesson, and it was while waiting that they chanced to hear him practising a piece from Handel's Atalanta, namely the aria Care Selve. Intrigued, Lloyd Webber inquired of Mr. Adam as to the identity of his student. Soon after, Crawford was called in for an audition and was hired nearly on the spot.|$|E
25|$|In early 1963, Jacqueline {{was again}} pregnant, leading her to curtail her {{official}} duties. She {{spent most of}} the summer at a home <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> rented on Squaw Island, near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On August 7, five weeks ahead of her scheduled Caesarean section, she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base. His lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to Boston Children's Hospital where he died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth. Jacqueline had remained at Otis Air Force Base to recuperate after the Caesarean delivery; her husband went to Boston to be with their infant son, and was present at his death. He returned to Otis on August 14 to take her home, giving an impromptu speech to thank nurses and airmen that had gathered in her suite, and she presented hospital staff with framed and signed lithographs of the White House.|$|E

25|$|Blanchett {{is married}} to playwright and screenwriter Andrew Upton. They met in 1996 {{on the set of}} a TV show and were married on 29 December 1997. Blanchett and Upton have four children: {{biological}} sons Dashiell John (b. December 2001), Roman Robert (b. April 2004), and Ignatius Martin (b. April 2008), and adopted daughter Edith Vivian Patricia, whose adoption was confirmed in March 2015. Blanchett said that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> been wanting to adopt ever since the birth of their first child. After making Brighton, England their main family home for nearly 10 years, she and her husband returned to their native Australia in 2006. In November 2006, Blanchett attributed this move to desires to select a permanent home for her children, to be closer to her family, and {{to have a sense of}} belonging to the Australian theatrical community. She and her family lived in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill. Their Hunters Hill residence underwent extensive renovations in 2007 to be made more eco-friendly. Following the sale of their property there in late 2015, Blanchett and Upton purchased a house in East Sussex, England in early 2016.|$|E
25|$|Home, however, was {{not easily}} reached. Louis and Eleanor, on {{separate}} ships {{due to their}} disagreements, were first attacked in May 1149 by Byzantine ships attempting to capture both on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor. Although they escaped this attempt unharmed, stormy weather drove Eleanor's ship far to the south to the Barbary Coast and caused her to lose track of her husband. Neither was heard of for over two months. In mid-July, Eleanor's ship finally reached Palermo in Sicily, where she discovered that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> both been given up for dead. She was given shelter and food by servants of King Roger II of Sicily, until the king eventually reached Calabria, and she set out to meet him there. Later, at King Roger's court in Potenza, she learned {{of the death of}} her uncle Raymond, who had been beheaded by Muslim forces in the Holy Land. This news appears to have forced a change of plans, for instead of returning to France from Marseilles, they went to see Pope Eugene III in Tusculum, where he had been driven five months before by a revolt of the Commune of Rome.|$|E
