6000|$|At {{first sight}} the mammalia of North America {{do not seem}} to differ much from those of Europe or Northern Asia. There are cats, lynxes, wolves and foxes, weasels, bears, elk and deer, voles, beavers, squirrels, marmots, and {49} hares, all very {{similar to those of the}} Eastern Hemisphere, and several hardly distinguishable. Even the bison or [...] "buffalo" [...] of the prairies, once so {{abundant}} and characteristic, is a close ally of the now almost extinct [...] "aurochs" [...] of Lithuania. Here, then, we undoubtedly find a very close resemblance between the two regions, and if this were all, we should have great difficulty in separating them. But along with these, we find another set of mammals, not quite so conspicuous but nevertheless very important. We have first, three peculiar genera of moles, one of which, the <b>star-nosed</b> <b>mole,</b> is a most extraordinary creature, quite unlike anything else. Then there are three genera of the weasel family, including the well-known skunk (Mephitis), all quite different from Eastern forms. Then we come to a peculiar family of carnivora, the racoons, very distinct from anything in Europe or Asia; and in the Rocky Mountains we find the prong-horn antelope (Antilocapra) and the mountain goat of the trappers (Aplocerus), both peculiar genera. Coming to the rodents we find that the mice of America differ in some dental peculiarities from those of the rest of the world, and thus form several distinct genera; the jumping mouse (Xapus) is a peculiar form of the jerboa family, and then we come to the pouched rats (Geomyidæ), a very curious family consisting of four genera and nineteen species, peculiar to North America, though not confined to the Nearctic region. The prairie dogs (Cynomys), the tree porcupine (Erethizon), the curious sewellel (Haploodon), and the opossum (Didelphys) complete the list of peculiar mammalia which distinguish the northern region of the new world from that of the old. We must add to these peculiarities some remarkable deficiencies. The Nearctic region has no hedgehogs, nor wild pigs, nor dormice, and only one wild sheep in the Rocky Mountains as against twenty species of sheep and goats in the Palæarctic region.|$|E

40|$|Metabolic {{and body}} {{temperature}} (Tb) responses of <b>star-nosed</b> <b>moles</b> (Condylura cristata) {{exposed to air}} temperatures ranging from 0 to 33 °C were investigated. The thermoneutral zone of this semi-aquatic mole extended from 24. 5 to 33 °C, over which its basal rate of metabolism averaged 2. 25 ml O 2 g 1 h 1 (45. 16 J g 1 h 1). This rate of metabolism is higher than predicted for terrestrial forms, and substantially higher than for other moles examined to date. Minimum thermal conductance was nearly identical to that predicted for similar-sized eutherians and may represent a compromise between the need to dissipate heat while digging and foraging in subterranean burrows, {{and the need to}} conserve heat and avoid hypothermia during exposure to cold. C. cristata precisely regulated Tb (mean 9 SE 37. 790. 05 °C) over the entire range of test temperatures. Over three separate 24 -h periods, Tb of a radio-implanted mole varied from 36. 6 to 38. 8 °C, and generally tracked level of activity. No obvious circadian variation in Tb and activity was apparent, although cyclic 2 – 4 h intervals of activity punctuated by periods of inactivity lasting 3 – 5 h were routinely observed. We suggest that the elevated basal metabolic rate and relatively high Tb of <b>star-nosed</b> <b>moles</b> may reflect the semi-aquatic habits of this unique talpid. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|The {{tunneling}} {{damage caused}} by eastern moles (Scalopus aquaticus) and <b>star-nosed</b> <b>moles</b> (Condvlura cristata) is well known to professionals in lawn care, golf course maintenance, and turf grass production, {{as well as many}} private landowners. Present damage control methods, including trapping, gas and smoke fumigants, and insecticide applications have a wide variety of limitations and prove impractical in some situations. An easily applied mole damage control method is needed that professional and nonprofessional applicators can use in a variety of environmental and physical conditions. This study tested the effectiveness of Oreo Mole Bait, a chlorophacinone pellet placed in active tunnel systems. The bait was tested on both mole species, three soil types (sand, loam and muck), and two watering regimes (irrigated and not irrigated). Oreo Mole Bait was equally effective in controlling the {{damage caused by}} both eastern and <b>star-nosed</b> <b>moles.</b> Captive moles readily accepted the dry, hard bait pellets. The average time to control in field trials was 303 days following first application (21. 5 days on dry soils, 38. 7 days on irrigated soils). The bait was effective on all three soil types, but irrigation appeared to lessen effectiveness. On untreated control sites there was no correlation between precipitation, evaporation, or average maximum and minimum temperature and mole activity. Multiple occupancy and/or rapid reinvasion of abandoned tunnel systems and the use of tunnels by other fossorial species occurred on several study sites. Human alterations to the environment encourage mole activity. Several individuals utilized the areas beneath patios, wood piles and mulched areas for activity centers, and frequented artificial feeding sites such as birdfeeders.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{question in the}} neurosciences is how central nervous system (CNS) space is allocated to different sensory inputs. Yet {{it is difficult to}} measure innervation density and corresponding representational areas in the CNS of most species. These measurements can be made in <b>star-nosed</b> <b>moles</b> (Condylura cristata) because the cortical representation of nasal rays is visible in flattened sections and afferents from each ray can be counted. Here we used electrophysiological recordings combined with sections of the brainstem to identify a large, visible star representation in the principal sensory nucleus (PrV). PrV was greatly expanded and bulged out of the brainstem rostrally to partially invade the trigeminal nerve. The star representation was a distinct PrV subnucleus containing 11 modules, each representing one of the nasal rays. The 11 PrV ray representations were reconstructed to obtain volumes and the largest module corresponded to ray 11, the mole’s tactile fovea. These measures were compared to fiber counts and primary cortical areas from a previous investigation. PrV ray volumes were closely correlated with the number of afferents from each ray, but afferents from the behaviorally most important, 11 th ray were preferentially over-represented. This over-representation at the brainstem level was much less than at the cortical level.

40|$|Most eutherian mammals possess sexually dimorphic {{external}} genitalia. Males have a penis that is traversed to {{near the}} tip by a urethra, a scrotum that encloses the testes, {{and a long}} anogenital distance. In females anogenital distance is short, and the typical clitoris is usually markedly smaller than the penis, and is frequently "internally" situated with the urethra exiting independent of the clitoris. In addition, the clitoris is associated with an externally visible vaginal opening (at least during the breeding season). This sexual dimorphism is usually associated with the presence (males) or absence (females) of androgens during development of the external genitalia. Females with naturally "masculinized" external genitalia challenge the typical mammalian androgen-dependent masculinization theory and {{are the focus of}} this dissertation. Research as to how they "do," or "do-not" fit the current widely accepted theory of sexual differentiation may reveal novel mechanisms of sexual differentiation. Since adult external genitalia are the endpoints of sexual differentiation, developmental processes can be inferred from examination of adult morphology, providing that anatomy of external genitalia has been (is) accurately described and interpreted. The first revelation incurred in my study was that all previous reports on mole external genitalia were in error in regard to the following terms: penis, clitoris, penile clitoris, phallus, prepuce and urethra. Accordingly, by way of correcting errors of previous literature, my first task was a detailed anatomic and morphometric analysis of external genitalia in four species of moles. For an even broader perspective I also reviewed morphology of external genitalia of mouse, human and spotted hyena. Accurate morphological descriptions of external genitalia are the essential pre-requisite to a full understanding of the comparative anatomy of mole external genitalia and the potential role of hormones in development of the external genitalia in these species. This dissertation is focused on four species of moles. All are members of the family Talpidae, in the order Insectivora. Three of these species defy the conventionally obvious visual distinctions between males and females in so far as the perineal appendage described previously as "penis" and "penile clitoris" is of similar size in males and females. Unfortunately, the visible perineal appendage in these male and female moles is prepuce. A major question is why the prepuce is similar in size in males and females. One theory is that the ovarian interstitial gland is capable of producing androgen. Of the three mole species with "masculinized" female external genitalia, broad-footed moles (Scapanus latimanus) do not possess an ovarian interstitial gland, <b>star-nosed</b> <b>moles</b> (Condylura cristata) have an ovarian interstitial gland, and in hairy-tailed moles (Parascalops breweri) ovarian structure has never been investigated. For these three mole species, it is difficult for the casual observer to distinguish between males and females during the non-breeding season, when the vaginal opening of female moles is "closed. " The fourth species examined in the present investigation is the Japanese shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides), which does not possess an ovarian interstitial gland. In Japanese shrew moles, the distinction between males and females is obvious, since the male prepuce is much larger than the female prepuce, and the latter does not have a urethra exiting its tip. Thus, sexual dimorphism of the external genitalia in Japanese shrew moles appears to follow the typical mammalian pattern. Intriguing work has been done on mole species concerning the ovarian interstitial gland, its resemblance to testicular tissue, and its ability to produce androgens in relation to the corresponding presence of a "penile clitoris" in some mole species. However, other mole species that do not possess this ovarian interstitial gland also display a "penile clitoris" that is similar in size and shape to male external genitalia. Of course, this erroneous discussion of "penile clitoris" from the literature actually deals with the female prepuce. Discussion {{of the role of the}} ovarian interstitial gland in masculinization of mole external genitalia, first and foremost requires a detailed accurate anatomic analysis of the structure of the so-called "penile clitoris". Unfortunately no comparative work has adequately addressed the role of androgens derived from the ovarian interstitial gland in development of external genitalia in the different mole species. For the first time, my accurate detailed description of mole genital morphology provides the opportunity to address this question. The penis and clitoris of typical mammals are strikingly different, anatomically complex organs composed of epithelial tissue, connective tissue, vascular tissue, nerves, cartilage, and bone that are organized into specific and precise morphological patterns. The common developmental history, architecture, and composition of the penis and clitoris across most mammalian species allow for multiple features to be used to assess sexual dimorphism of the various components that constitute male and female external genitalia. The size and location of several key anatomic features were noted with the aid of three-dimensional reconstructions for a more detailed comparison between the different mole species. In addition to these internal anatomical measurements, anogenital distance, a trait that is modulated by androgen action in utero, was used as another measure of "genital masculinization". Measures of prepuce length, termed "phallus" length in previous publications, were used to investigate the degree of sexual dimorphism in the external genitalia in my study. Ovarian tissue was examined histologically for the presence or absence of an interstitial gland (a potential source of androgen). I discovered in the breeding season, Japanese shrew moles display a large glandular tissue structure attached to the ovary that has never before been reported. The Japanese shrew mole penis is much larger than the clitoris, is vastly anatomically different from the clitoris, and males have a longer anogenital distance than females presenting a typical mammalian pattern of sexual dimorphism, presumably based upon the presence versus absence of adequate androgen levels. Broad-footed, <b>star-nosed,</b> and hairy-tailed <b>moles</b> have notable morphological variation in the penis and clitoris between these species as well as between the sexes. However, similar to <b>star-nosed</b> <b>moles</b> (that possess an ovarian interstitial gland), female broad-footed moles displayed several masculine morphological characteristics and an anogenital distance equal to the males' despite lacking an ovarian interstitial gland. This suggests that either development of the external genitalia is partially androgen-independent in these species or in females androgen production may be coming from another source. Lastly, I compared different patterns of external genitalia in human, mouse, 4 species of mole, and spotted hyena in relation to known endocrine profiles, and mechanisms of morphogenesis/differentiation noting gaps in the data. In summary, my research provides the first accurate descriptions of the gross and histologic anatomy of male and female mole external genitalia. Also, comparative mouse-mole studies reported here have validated the remarkable similarity in external genitalia anatomy between these two species and have led to the conclusion that all previous literature on mole external genitalia suffers from consistent anatomical error. Being able to set the record straight allows for the first time an accurate definition of mole external genitalia anatomy and its relation to endocrine parameters...|$|R

50|$|The second theory, that of prey profitability, {{explains}} the foraging {{speed of the}} <b>star-nosed</b> <b>mole.</b> Prey profitability, (i.e. energy gained divided by prey handling time), is an essential variable for estimating the optimal diet.
