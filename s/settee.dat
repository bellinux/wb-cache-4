25|$|In {{the month}} between 19 July and 20 August, Mermaid {{captured}} ten vessels, five {{of which she}} burnt or scuttled. Four were the French <b>settee</b> Bien Venue, which had been sailing from Fréjus to Marseilles with deals (long wooden planks), the French <b>settee</b> San Antonio, which was sailing from Oneglia to La Silva with a cargo of snuff, the French <b>settee</b> Saint Pierre, which was sailing from Bandol to Marseilles with firewood, and an unnamed Spanish <b>settee</b> carrying barilla. Mermaid ran one French <b>settee,</b> which was carrying wheat, ashore and scuttled her too. The three vessels Mermaid kept were the Spanish sloop Saint Juan Baptiste, which was sailing from Cette to Genoa with wine, an unnamed Spanish <b>settee</b> carrying barilla, the French <b>settee</b> Sainte Barbe, which was sailing from Marseilles with wheat, the French ketch Notre dame de la Providence, which was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa with wine and flour, and the Genoese <b>settee</b> Conception, which was sailing from Bandol to Genoa with wine.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May, Mermaid {{captured}} the <b>settee</b> St Joseph, which was selling from Sardinia to Marseilles in ballast. Four days later Mermaid {{captured the}} Genoese <b>settee</b> Nostra Dame de Rosario, which was carrying wheat from Marseilles to Genoa. Four {{days after that}} Mermaid captured a <b>settee,</b> in ballast.|$|E
25|$|On 4 June 1811, near Saint Lucar, Columbines boats {{captured}} a French naval <b>settee,</b> armed with two howitzers and six swivel guns, carrying {{a crew of}} 42 men. The <b>settee</b> was Guadalquiver.|$|E
60|$|There were no chairs at the tables. The seats {{consisted}} of handsomely cushioned <b>settees,</b> with substantial backs to them. It was upon {{one of these}} <b>settees,</b> and {{near the end of}} it, that Rollo and Jane were seated.|$|R
2500|$|In June, Centaur was {{involved}} in a brief action off Toulon before elements of Admiral Keith's fleet joined her. Centaur and [...] fired at a brig-corvette and several <b>settees</b> off Toulon. They were then able to capture and destroy four of the <b>settees.</b>|$|R

25|$|Then on 16 February , Argo and Leviathan {{attacked}} {{the town of}} Cambrelles. Once the defenders had abandoned their battery, the boats went in. The British dismounted the guns, burnt five <b>settees</b> and brought out another five <b>settees</b> or tartans laden with wine and wheat. One tartan, the Velon Maria, was a letter of marque, armed with one brass and two iron 12-pounders and two 3-pounders. She had a crew of 14 men.|$|R
2500|$|In 1803 Phoebe was sailing out of [...] Malta. At some point, perhaps {{during the}} summer, her boats {{participated in a}} {{disastrous}} attack on two French privateers off Civitavecchia. The privateers repulsed the British, who lost eight men killed and wounded. On 1 August, Phoebe captured two <b>settées,</b> which a French squadron recaptured. In recapturing the <b>settees,</b> the French squadron involved lost an opportunity to capture Phoebe, though they did capture the schooner [...] and a transport.|$|R
50|$|A year later, on 16 February 1799 Centaur, Argo and Leviathan {{attacked}} {{the town of}} Cambrils. Once the defenders had abandoned their battery, the boats went in. The British dismounted the guns, burnt five <b>settees</b> and brought out another five <b>settees</b> or tartans laden with wine and wheat. One tartan, the Velon Maria, was a letter of marque, armed with one brass and two iron 12-pounders and two 3-pounders. She had a crew of 14 men.|$|R
25|$|The next year, on 2 February 1798, Centaur pursued two Spanish xebecs and a <b>settee,</b> all privateers in royal Spanish service. She {{captured}} the privateer La Vierga del Rosario, which carried fourteen brass 12-pounder guns {{and had a}} crew of 90 men. The other two vessels escaped.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May Scout {{captured}} a Spanish <b>settee,</b> the St. Antonio Abad, of nine men and 20 tons burthen (bm). She was sailing from Marabella to Ceuta with a cargo of bricks, leather and the like. Two days later, Scout {{captured a}} Spanish brig carrying bale goods and loaf sugar.|$|E
25|$|One 29 August, Cameleons boats {{attempted}} {{to cut out}} five vessels sheltering {{under the protection of}} batteries at Rimasol. Cameleon had ten men wounded; she {{does not seem to have}} succeeded in capturing anything. On another occasion, Cameleons boats, with those of , succeeded in bringing out a <b>settee</b> from Alassio. This time too there were British casualties.|$|E

60|$|Rollo turned {{round and}} saw Hilbert. He was {{clinging}} {{to the side of}} the doorway. Rollo himself was upon one of the <b>settees.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 21 and 22 October 1806, Lieutenant Sir William Parker again led Renomees {{boats in}} cutting-out expeditions. The first {{occurred}} at Colon, on Majorca, {{where in the}} face of enemy fire the British captured one tartane of four guns, and two <b>settees,</b> one of which mounted three guns. The <b>settees</b> were carrying grain and the British were able to bring them out. The tartan ran aground so the raiding party set her on fire, which led to her blowing up. One British seaman was wounded in the action.|$|R
25|$|Moving aft {{into the}} saloon, {{there is a}} {{straight}} <b>settee</b> to port, the aft end of which provides seating for the aft facing nav station. A removable seat back slips in to give the navigator a comfortable back rest. The nav station has drawer storage beneath it and a large chart table with ample room to spread out on it. The electronics and electrical panels are arrayed in a convenient console style.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant John Gibson {{commissioned}} Speedwell in July 1780, for the Mediterranean. She {{arrived at}} Gibraltar, which was undergoing the Great Siege, on 20 December, carrying dispatches. While Speedwell {{was on her}} way she encountered a small vessel that launched an attack that Speedwell repulsed, though Gibson sustained some wounds. On 1 January 1781 the British took possession of an abandoned <b>settee</b> on which there were letters, with one mentioning that the vessel that had attacked Speedwell had suffered several men killed and wounded.|$|E
25|$|Bullen {{continued}} {{to support the}} Spanish in operations along the Catalan coast. On 14 April boats from Cambrian cut out a <b>settee</b> carrying grain from Port Vendee to Barcelona that had sheltered {{under the protection of}} batteries on the Medes Islands. More importantly, on 12 and 14 April, Cambrian and Volontaire took possession of St. Philion and Palamós. There they destroyed the batteries and took out their guns. This, together with the Spanish capture of Figueras, gave the Spanish control of almost all Catalonia, save Barcelona.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are two <b>settees</b> in the cabin. We {{can do on}} {{them very}} well. I think we can't do better than go down there at once, for {{we have had a}} long and tiring journey." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Settees</b> (or saëtia) {{then were}} a sharp-prowed, single-decked {{merchant}} sailing vessel {{found in the}} Mediterranean (more in the Levant than in the Western Mediterranean), in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Spaniards also used them in the New World.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Chauncy had 66, I believe." [...] Then {{calling out}} aloud to Mr. Chauncy, {{who had come}} up on the deck after luncheon, and was now sitting {{on one of the}} <b>settees</b> that stood around the skylight, he added,-- ...|$|R
25|$|Portions of the {{property}} {{date back to the}} 16th-century but it was in 1750, on the occasion of his marriage to Maria Antonietta Vagnoli, that the nobleman Sallustio Terrosi started building the villa. The villa's decoration includes Empire pieces and Chinese wooden figurines which once adorned the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and Empire <b>settee</b> that belonged to Princess Mathilde, Napoleon’s niece, 2,100 rare books that Giammetti miraculously returned to the villa, missing since the 1960s. The design of the spare all-white kitchen was given to one of Giammetti's friends, architect Tommaso Ziffer, a young decorator at the time.|$|E
25|$|During the John F. Kennedy administration, the Entrance Hall (like {{most of the}} White House) {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} historic redecoration. The redecoration of the State Floor rooms, including the Entrance Hall, was overseen by American antiques autodidact Henry Francis du Pont and French interior designer Stéphane Boudin. Du Pont wanted a more historic approach to the White House, while Boudin preferred a French design aesthetic. Du Pont originally redecorated the Entrance Hall with two French pier tables, a <b>settee,</b> a card table, and two tables by Charles-Honoré Lannuier. Boudin had all but the pier tables removed, and his style is the one which remained {{over the next several}} decades.|$|E
500|$|Bradfield has {{described}} the recording of the album as preventing him from having a social life and Alex Silva attributes the break-up {{of his relationship with}} his girlfriend at the time to the long hours involved in the recording. Guitarist Richey Edwards attended recording sessions but would, according to Wire, [...] "collapse on the <b>settee</b> and have a snooze" [...] while the other band members did all the recording. He was drinking heavily and frequently crying. [...] "Inevitably", says Bradfield, [...] "the day would start with a 'schhht!'; the sound of a can opening." ...|$|E
60|$|So Rollo and Jane {{went to see}} if {{they could}} find their way up on deck alone. Rollo went before, and Jane followed. They ascended the steep stairs where they had gone up at first, and then walked aft upon the deck until they came to the <b>settees</b> where they had been sitting before the luncheon. They sat down upon one of these <b>settees,</b> where they had a fine view, not only of the wide expanse of sea on every hand, but also of the whole extent of the decks of the ship. They {{remained}} here nearly two hours, observing what was going on around them, and they saw a great many things that interested them very much indeed.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Chauncy, being now {{tired of}} walking, went {{to sit down}} upon one of the <b>settees</b> next to where Hilbert and Rollo had just gone to take a seat. Mr. Chauncy was next to Hilbert. He {{immediately}} began to talk with Hilbert about the lottery.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George and Rollo {{fell into}} the line of people that were {{pressing}} forward over the plank {{which led to the}} boat that the orange woman had directed them to embark in; and they soon found themselves on board. The boat was small and quite narrow. There was no saloon or enclosed apartment of any kind for the passengers, nor even an awning to shelter them from the sun or rain. There were, however, substantial <b>settees</b> placed around the deck, some forward and others aft. Some of these <b>settees</b> were {{on the sides of the}} steamer, by the railing, and there were others placed back to back in the middle. There were not seats enough for all the passengers; and thus many were obliged to stand.|$|R
500|$|In 1965, Mézières {{arranged}} a working visa through {{a friend of}} Jijé's who had a factory in Houston, Texas. In the end, however, he never took up the job in Houston. After staying in New York for a few months, {{the call of the}} West proved too strong and eventually he ended up hitchhiking across the country, first to Seattle and then to Montana (where he worked on a ranch driving tractors, laying posts and cleaning stables) before ending up in San Francisco. His initial plan was to find work in an advertising agency in San Francisco but he ran foul of the Immigration Service who told him that his visa was good for working in the factory in Houston and nowhere else. He quickly left San Francisco in search of an authentic [...] "Wild West" [...] cowboy experience. Arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah with no money, he sought out Pierre Christin, who was living there while teaching at the University of Utah, and turned up on his doorstep asking him if he could sleep on his <b>settee.</b> To make ends meet, Mézières produced some illustrations for a small advertising agency in Salt Lake City and for a Mormon children's magazine called Children's Friend as well as selling some photographs he had taken while working on the ranch in Montana. After a few months, he found work on a ranch in Utah: this time succeeding in his aspiration of living the life of a cowboy, an experience he described as [...] "better than in my dreams".|$|E

2500|$|... <b>settee</b> Sto. Christo (16 July), {{in company}} with [...] and the {{privateer}} Bee; and, ...|$|E
60|$|A moment {{afterwards}} {{they came}} to a very pleasant landing, at a place where the road lay pretty near the water. Between the road and the water, however, there was a space of green grass, with large trees overshadowing it, and several wooden <b>settees,</b> painted green, under the trees.|$|R
50|$|Ford Johnson {{established}} {{themselves as}} a high quality manufacturer of Mission Style furniture that was sold across the United States. Ford Johnson was best known for their chairs and <b>settees.</b> They created their own unique designs as well as creating generic versions of admired designs of Gustav Stickley and others.|$|R
60|$|So Rollo {{brought the}} boat {{up to the}} shore, and they all got out. Mr. and Mrs. Holiday walked up and took their seats {{on one of the}} <b>settees,</b> while Rollo and Lucia began to run about and play along the parapet wall which {{separated}} the promenade from the water.|$|R
