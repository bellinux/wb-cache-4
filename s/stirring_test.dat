40|$|PhD (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{freshwater}} dinoflagellate species, Ceratium hirundinella (C. hirundinella) possesses unique characteristics, {{such as a}} thecal-plate cell {{covering of}} cellulose, spines and flagella. Unlike most other algae and cyanobacteria, C. hirundinella cells are relatively large in size (up to 450 μm in length and 50 μm in width). These unique characteristics (e. g. cell covering and flagella) and adaptations (e. g. spines) give the dinoflagellate cells the ability to reduce their sinking rate from the euphotic zone and to migrate easily through the water column. When source water contains high concentrations of C. hirundinella cells, water treatment problems and poor aesthetic water quality can be expected. These water treatment problems may include 1) the disruption of coagulation and flocculation, 2) clogging of sand filters and 3) taste and odour problems when cells penetrate into the final water. In Chapter 9 of this study, a list of operational guidelines (including alert levels) and recommendations to assist managers and operators of plants when C. hirundinella cells are causing water treatment problems. During events of high C. hirundinella concentrations in source water, managers and operators of conventional water treatment plants need strategies to optimize coagulants and unit processes. Thus when source water contains motile nuisance algae, such as C. hirundinella, in moderate or abundant quantities, it is advisable to conduct jar <b>stirring</b> <b>test</b> experiments using both turbidity and total photosynthetic pigment (or chlorophyll-a) analyses as indicators of appropriate coagulant choice and dosages. The aims {{of this study are}} summarized as follows:  To optimize coagulants and conventional water treatment processes by implementing relevant algal removal strategies and indicators during jar <b>stirring</b> <b>test</b> experiments,  To investigate the changes in surface charge (known as zeta potential) on C. hirundinella cells before and after adding coagulants as part of the treatment processes,  To investigate the physical and chemical impacts on the morphology of C. hirundinella cells after coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation,  To identify organic compounds that may be responsible for taste and odour problems associated with C. hirundinella,  To investigate the efficiency of pre-chlorination on the removal C. hirundinella cells when dosing various coagulants, and  Give recommendations and operational guidelines relevant for a conventional water treatment plant to improve C. hirundinella removal A combined water treatment system (Phipps and Bird Model), consisting of a six paddle jar test apparatus and six sand filter columns, was used to simulate conventional processes (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and rapid sand filtration). Source water samples containing relatively high C. hirundinella concentrations (> 500 cell/mℓ) were collected from Benoni Lake (26 º 10 ’ 50. 40 ’’S; 28 º 17 ’ 50. 11 ’’ E) in plastic containers and stored as a homogenous sample in a 200 litre container under laboratory conditions (± 22 °C). Samples were collected from the source water as well as after sedimentation (from the supernatant or sludge) to determine turbidity, total photosynthetic pigment analyses (chlorophyll) and for phytoplankton analyses. Flocs (containing C. hirundinella cells) were collected from the sludge or sediment for scanning electron microscopy investigations and to perform zeta potential analyses. Concentrated C. hirundinella samples were frozen at - 80 °C according to the proposed sampling protocol for organic compound analyses. Results obtained from this study proved that using the relevant indicators to determine the appropriate coagulant dosages during jar stirring tests may generally improve the removal of problem-causing algae, such as C. hirundinella cells. Improved algal removal efficiencies will subsequently ensure final water with good aesthetic quality. The surface charge (zeta potential) on C. hirundinella cells can be used to evaluate the best coagulation conditions within an operating window of - 10 mV to + 3 mV when dosing various coagulants. Scanning electron microscopy investigations revealed major damaging effects to C. hirundinella cells when dosing high Ca(OH) 2 concentrations. However, when dosing lower Ca(OH) 2 concentrations, in combination with organic polymer, better C. hirundinella cell removal efficiencies with less damaging effects to cells was observed. This study also indicated that the pre-chlorination, without causing cell lyses, can be applied to render the highly motile cells immobile which will subsequently assist the coagulation unit process. The aesthetic quality (e. g. tastes and odours) of drinking water may be influenced when C. hirundinella cells release organic material into the water as a result of cell lyses. Organic compounds, such as fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids can lead to taste and odour problems which associate with the presence of C. hirundinella. Organic compounds also serve as precursors for the formation of harmful chlorine by-products formed during chlorination. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the synchronous micromotor concept and presents new investigations on its application as an integrated driving mechanism in microfluidic systems. A spiral channel viscous micropump and a microstirrer are considered and tested as examples {{to verify the}} concept. The fabrication technology of such integrated systems is based on UV depth lithography, electroplating and soft lithography. The synchronous micromotor consists of a stator including double layer coils, and a rotor disk containing alternate permanent magnets. The coils are distributed evenly around the stator and arranged in three phases. The phases are excited by sinusoidal currents with a corresponding phase shift resulting in a rotating magnetic field. Regarding the spiral channel viscous micropump, a spiral disk was fixed onto the rotor disk and run at different rotational speeds. Tests showed very promising results, with a flow rate up to 1023 µL·min− 1 at a motor rotational speed of 4500 rpm. Furthermore, {{for the application of}} a microstirred-tank bioreactor, the rotor disk design was modified to work as a stirrer. The performance of the developed microbioreactor was tested over a time period of approximately 10 h under constant <b>stirring.</b> <b>Tests</b> demonstrated the successful cultivation of S. cerevisiae through the integration of the microstirrer in a microbioreactor system.

We investigated the soil aggregate stability characteristics {{in the framework of}} the ‘Grain for Green’ vegetation rehabilitation project at the Loess Plateau (China) by using the Le Bissonnais (1996) and the modified Yoder (1936) methods. Both non-grazed grassland and afforestation revegetations were considered. The size distribution mode was always > 2 mm for the fast wetting test (FW) in the non-grazed grassland communities. This fraction accounted for approximately 40 % to 80 % of the total soil weight. The wet <b>stirring</b> (WS) <b>test</b> showed a distribution similar to that determined by the FW test. For the slow wetting (SW) test, 80 % or more of the non-grazed grassland soil fragments was > 2 mm. The mean weighted diameter (MWD) that was determined by the Le Bissonnais' method was different among the tests and land uses. For the FW test, all the plant communities were significantly {{different from that of the}} recently abandoned grazing on grassland at the 0 – 20 and 20 – 40 cm depths. In the Artemisia sacrorum community, the maximum MWD was approximately 3 mm for the 0 – 20 cm depth. There were no significant differences among the plant communities after 3 years of afforestation and 7 years of non-grazing of the grassland. The MWDs were lower in the afforestation area than in the non-grazed grassland area. The maximum MWD value from the FW test was approximately 1. 8 mm and was significantly lower (< 0. 5 mm) for cropland. The MWD of the modified Yoder method was positively related to the slow wetting and wet <b>stirring</b> (WS) <b>tests</b> of the Le Bissonnais' method (n= 20 and r= 0. 83 and 0. 87, respectively). In the Loess Plateau, revegetations by non-grazed grassland and afforestation are efficient means of increasing aggregate stability and decreasing soil erodibility. The aggregate stability under non-grazed grasslands is higher than that under afforestation. The effect of revegetation is persistent, which makes it a suitable long-term management practice. Compared with the modified Yoder's method, the FW test of the Le Bissonnais' method is better at determining aggregate stability differences among land uses and is recommended for future studies...|$|R

40|$|A {{composite}} {{is made up}} of {{two distinct}} materials and the resulted properties are different from the individual precursors. Composite combines a huge or bulkier element called matrix and reinforcement called filler or fiber. Fiber is added in the matrix to increase the stiffness of the matrix and enhance or alter its physical properties. Since silk has high levels of toughness, strength and multifunctional nature, we decided to use bombyx mori as a matrix. Because of the superior mechanical properties, i. e., high tensile moduli, and strength of carbon nanotube, we chose carbon nanotube as a reinforcement fiber to enhance the mechanical properties of resulting composite. The main issue encountered while preparing composite was to fully disperse individual nanotubes in the matrices, because nanotubes tend to form clusters and bundles. Hence, we used ionic liquids to dissolve the cocoon, and processed homogenization of FCNT with silk by sonication, <b>stirring.</b> For <b>testing,</b> different weight percentages of functionalized carbon nanotube were used as a filler to make the silk composite, and nanoindentation and tensile tester tested the samples.

While in situ exposures are routine for caged organisms or macrophytes, they are extremely difficult to perform for microorganisms, mainly due to difficulties in designinganexposure device that isolates the cells while allowing rapid equilibration with the external media. In this paper, a stirredunderwaterbiouptakesystem(SUBS) basedonthediffusion of chemicals across a semipermeable membrane housing a controlled population of microorganisms is reported. Cd diffusion through the semipermeable membrane was evaluated by voltammetry using a microelectrode.

40|$|Autografts {{represent}} {{the gold standard}} for peripheral nerve reconstruction but their limited availability, the discrepancy of nerve caliber, and long surgical times are drawbacks. Allografts have therefore become a valid alternative option. In particular, acellular nerve allografts (ANAs) rather than fresh allografts do not need immunosuppression and appear to be safe and effective based on recent studies. An innovative method was conceived to obtain ANAs, so as to speed up nerve decellularization, without compromising nerve architecture, and without breaking the asepsis chain. Several detergent-based techniques, integrated with sonication and mechanical <b>stirring,</b> were <b>tested</b> in vitro on rabbit nerves, to identify, by microscopy and immunohistochemistry, the most effective protocol in terms of cell lysis and cellular debris clearance, while maintaining nerve architecture. Furthermore, a pilot in vivo study was performed: ANAs were implanted into tibial nerve defects of three rabbits, and autografts, representing the gold standard, in other three animals. Twelve weeks postoperatively, rabbits were clinically evaluated and euthanasized; grafts were harvested and microscopically and histomorphometrically analyzed. The method proved to be effective in vitro: the treatment removed axons, myelin and cells, without altering nerve architecture. The in vivo study did not reveal any adverse effect: animals maintained normal weight and function of posterior limb during the entire experimental time. A mild fibrotic reaction was observed, macrophages and leukocytes were rare or absent; ANAs regenerated fascicles and bundles were comparable versus autografts. Based on these results, this decellularization protocol is encouraging and deserves deeper investigations with further preclinical and clinical studies...|$|R

Some of the Pu in HALW is attached to undissolved residues. However, constraints at the IAEA on-site laboratory do not allow use of common destructive methods to measure Pu in the residues.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the aquatic eddy {{correlation}} (EC) technique {{has proven to}} be a powerful approach for non-invasive measurements of oxygen fluxes across the sediment water interface. Fundamental to the EC approach is the correlation of turbulent velocity and oxygen concentration fluctuations measured with high frequencies in the same sampling volume. Oxygen concentrations are commonly measured with fast responding electrochemical microsensors. However, due to their own oxygen consumption, electrochemical microsensors are sensitive to changes of the diffusive boundary layer surrounding the probe and thus to changes in the ambient flow velocity. The so-called stirring sensitivity of microsensors constitutes an inherent correlation of flow velocity and oxygen sensing and thus an artificial flux which can confound the benthic flux determination. To assess the artificial flux we measured the correlation between the turbulent flow velocity and the signal of oxygen microsensors in a sealed annular flume without any oxygen sinks and sources. Experiments revealed significant correlations, even for sensors designed to have low stirring sensitivities of ~ 0. 7 %. The artificial fluxes depended on ambient flow conditions and, counter intuitively, increased at higher velocities because of the nonlinear contribution of turbulent velocity fluctuations. The measured artificial fluxes ranged from 2 - 70 mmol m- 2 d- 1 for weak and very strong turbulent flow, respectively. Further, the stirring sensitivity depended on the sensor orientation towards the flow. For a sensor orientation typically used in field studies, the artificial flux could be predicted using a simplified mathematical model. Optical microsensors (optodes) that should not exhibit a <b>stirring</b> sensitivity were <b>tested</b> in parallel and did not show any significant correlation between O 2 signals and turbulent flow.

This work aims to determine variable hydrodynamic parameter such as the liquid holdup fraction and dispersibility factor in two immiscible liquid-liquid flow system (namely palm oil and ethanol employed during biodiesel synthesis). A hindrance, which is the mass transfer limitation coexisted within the liquid-liquid flow system. The formation of emulsion layer which occurred when the organic phase expanded and the polar phase inversion occurs under vigorous stirring, resisted the upwards flow of ethanol to the decanter top and subsequently, inhibits the formation of FAEE. An agitated column with 6 -bladed impellers was employed under a counter-current flow condition where the heavier palm oil phase was filled in the bottom decanter whereas the lighter ethanol was filled from the top decanter. Different feed flow rate and <b>stirring</b> speed were <b>tested</b> to identify the hydrodynamic variables. The ratio of feed flow (ethanol to palm oil) includes 1 : 1, 1 : 3, 3 : 1, 1 : 5 and also 5 : 1 whereas the stirring speed experimented were 300 and 500 RPM. It was observed that the lighter phase liquid holdup decreased along the number of stages for palm oil-to-ethanol flow ratio of 1 : 1, 1 : 3, 3 : 1, 1 : 5 and 5 : 1 with stirring speed 300 RPM. Similar trend can be observed with stirring speed 500 RPM.

40|$|Despite {{its long}} {{documented}} history, Hypochondriasis remains a ubiquitous enigma to virtually all health care disciplines and providers. Because such highly health anxious patients are not commonly open to psychological (i. e., non-medical) interpretations of their physiological symptoms, sufferers ironically often become fixed on a pathological quest for physical and/or medical explanations for their problems. This pervasive worry and worry-based behavioral pattern perpetuates and reifies {{the belief that}} one has- or will develop- a serious medical condition, and, due to its inappropriate fixity on perceived organic (versus psychic) etiology, leaves such excessive doubt largely untreated. Therefore, continual high medical utilization and costs persist, and profound human suffering goes largely unchecked and unmanaged. Collectively, this sad, but very real condition and circumstance is unacceptable. Fortunately, this oft recalcitrant and thorny phenomenon has recently been construed as perhaps being similar to another such condition, namely Generalized Anxiety Disorder. If this resemblance {{is more than a}} surface relationship, and the two phenomena are indeed related on a process level (i. e., the two share a common pathological core), then Hypochondriasis should be treatable via a specifically tailored treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Since Generalized Anxiety Disorder has been far more responsive to intervention than Hypochondriasis, as its central mechanism of pathology is now well understood (i. e., intolerance for uncertainty), it would be conceivable that Hypochondriasis is in actuality far more treatable than its current riddle-status would otherwise suggest. Indeed, if the two prove to be quite similar, if not outright forms of one another, then there would be far more hope that patients who suffer with this can be helped. This <b>stirring</b> hypothesis was <b>tested</b> by treating a particularly refractory, chronic and severe case of Hypochondriasis with a specialized Generalized Anxiety Disorder treatment package. “Joe” responded quite favorably to treatment, and obtained meaningful change according to Jacobson and Truax’s (1991) method for determining clinically significant- and reliable- change. In fact, according to their most restrictive standard, Joe could be labeled “Recovered” at the end of treatment, and at all 18 -month follow-up points. His response, caveated around single case generalizability limitations, suggested that perhaps Hypochondriasis does indeed share a common etiological source, namely intolerance for uncertainty, with Generalized Anxiety Disorder; if so, then that would be highly explanative of the strong results. Recommendations are given for conceptualizing pathological forms of health-related fears as just that, a concrete form of an anxiety disorder rather than a Somatoform condition.

40|$|In {{the work}} at hand a novel method to detect and {{quantify}} single oligonucleotide molecules in liquids is introduced. The aim consists of rapid specific quantification of mRNA molecules in solutions at room temperature by applying free-floating fluorescent molecular switches as integral part of an optical biosensor. The implementation of molecular switches enables the sensor to specifically detect unlabelled oligonucleotide sequences. In the thesis the crucial components consisting of the detection algorithm, the optical setup and the molecular switches (molecular beacons) are elaborated. In {{order to be able}} to detect single fluorescent bursts in solutions the necessary software has to be developed. Herefore a method for the unambiguous detection of transient burst-like signals in presence of significant stationary noise is described. In order to discriminate a transient signal from the background noise an optimum threshold is determined using an iterative algorithm that isolates the probability distribution of the background noise. Knowledge of the probability distribution of the noise allows excluding the detection of false positive events with a defined probability. The method can be applied to the detection of transient single-molecule fluorescence events in presence of a strong background. Using this peak detection method the sensing of single oligo-FRET molecules in buffer solution through a cleaved single mode optical fiber is demonstrated. Both the excitation light and the fluorescence signal are coupled through the same fiber thus implementing a remote detection scheme. The background luminescence created in the glass fiber by the strong excitation light is largely suppressed by the use of a wavelength-shifting concept. Fluorescence bursts are observed by proper <b>stirring</b> of the <b>test</b> solution. In addition, a discussion of the detection efficiency of the cleaved fiber by means of dipole radiation patterns near the glass/water interface is offered. In a next step the optimal operation conditions of the setup are described and investigated by varying the relevant parameters over a wide range. This indicates the optimum values for the stirring velocity, the excitation intensity, the bin width and the experiment duration. In the next step single molecule detection of oligonucleotide FRET constructs in liquids through a single-mode fiber is applied using the optimal detection conditions, which only then allows for quantification of ultra-low concentrations. A linear dependence of the number of detected fluorescence bursts on the concentration of the test solution over a wide dynamic range is demonstrated, starting at pM down to 1 aM concentrations. This qualifies the algorithm and the apparatus to be applied in quantitative sensing applications and establishes the software and hardware elements as a functional unity. Finally the molecular switches are implicated into the system. The application of molecular beacons to specific detection and quantification of characteristic mRNA sequences in a test solution is demonstrated. In bulk experiments, the performance of the molecular beacons is checked. It is found that single base pair mismatches between beacon and target sequence can be detected through the analysis of melting curves. Single-molecule experiments performed using the optical setup with molecular beacons in absence of targets show that only a negligible fraction of beacons is open at room temperature and produce fluorescence bursts. Upon addition of perfect targets the number of detected bursts increases dramatically. A linear dependence of the number of fluorescence bursts as a function of the concentration of molecular beacon-target sequence duplexes is observed. Furthermore, for a fixed concentration of molecular beacons, a linear increase of the number of bursts as a function of the target sequence concentration can be observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} work, {{which was}} part of {{collaborative}} research centre 442 was the synthesis of two lubricants with special focus on optimized application requirement and batch comparability in a 25 -l-batch production. On one hand a low viscosity lubricant based on technical grade oleic acid methyl ester with the main component HISM, on the other hand a high viscosity one based on glycerintrioleate with the main component HIGTS was synthesized. Both lubricants were synthesized in a two-step reaction via epoxidation of the double bond and ring opening via alcoholysis afterwards. With this modification the fatty acid esters were stabilized against air-aging and their viscosity was raised. Further on many side reactions were minimized and the main components HISM and HIGTS were abuzz in each lubricant system. For lubricant characterization analytical methods as e. g. GC were developed and used to determine conversions, selectivity and kinetic values (chapter 3. 4). With developing an alkaline decomposition reaction according to the DGF-Einheitsmethoden [47] the HIGTS lubricant (high temperature GC) was converted into the lower boiling HISM-system and both systems were directly comparable. Further more inline ATR IR spectroscopy was used to monitor the reaction progress. With a small failure in measurement between 1 and 5 % the method delivered a high data density at each point of reaction progress. As a lubricant specification and quality control typical oil-values as e. g. viscosity, neutralization-, saponification- and iodine numbers were determined. In lab scale different reaction setups (order of reactants, <b>stirring</b> speed…) were <b>tested</b> to study the influence of mass transport limitation during the epoxidation. The variation of hydrogen peroxide concentration led to heavy losses in conversion. However the major reaction influence was monitored with temperature variation for both epoxidation and alcoholysis (rising temperature > 60 °C caused DHSM production). For the alcoholysis reaction the influence of catalyst mass as well as different catalyst systems were tested in conversion and selectivity. Best results were obtained with Amberlyst 15 and the similar Dowex Marathon C catalyst. With the collected expertises in lab scale the 25 -l-pilot plant was optimized. An automated and computer controlled reaction procedure minimized unwanted side reactions (over-night stand still times) and also raised batch reproducibility. With a special catalyst cleaning process using scCO 2 and vacuum drying afterwards the catalyst could be recycled at least three times in reaction without any remarkable losses in selectivity and conversion. But with recycling the catalyst it starts to leach H 2 SO 4 and aryl-sulphuric acid groups in the lubricant that decreased biodegradability and even caused toxicity against algae. This problem was fixed with integrating a steam stripping unit into the pilot plant. Finally optimizing the pilot plant not only led to a successful batch reproducibility and comparability but also a biodegradable production rout with e. g. small solvent amounts could be developed. Further more the optimized production process with methyl esters based on animal waste could be assigned on methyl esters based on rape seed (inapplicable for application requirement because of high unsaturated fatty acid grades, a weak anti air-aging behavior and contents of antioxidants; compare chapter 3. 5. 6). The high grade of synthesis optimization and batch reproducibility in this work was not only reached by process optimization. Further more multidisciplinary feedback of other CRC 442 Project partners with their research topics (e. g. changing biodegradability during synthesis optimization; TP A 4; TP A 6) led to the high grade of reproducibility in synthesis and characterizing the lubricants...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the aquatic eddy {{correlation}} (EC) technique {{has proven to}} be a powerful approach for non-invasive measurements of oxygen fluxes across the sediment water interface. Fundamental to the EC approach is the correlation of turbulent velocity and oxygen concentration fluctuations measured with high frequencies in the same sampling volume. Oxygen concentrations are commonly measured with fast responding electrochemical microsensors. However, due to their own oxygen consumption, electrochemical microsensors are sensitive to changes of the diffusive boundary layer surrounding the probe and thus to changes in the ambient flow velocity. The so-called stirring sensitivity of microsensors constitutes an inherent correlation of flow velocity and oxygen sensing and thus an artificial flux which can confound the benthic flux determination. To assess the artificial flux we measured the correlation between the turbulent flow velocity and the signal of oxygen microsensors in a sealed annular flume without any oxygen sinks and sources. Experiments revealed significant correlations, even for sensors designed to have low stirring sensitivities of ~ 0. 7 %. The artificial fluxes depended on ambient flow conditions and, counter intuitively, increased at higher velocities because of the nonlinear contribution of turbulent velocity fluctuations. The measured artificial fluxes ranged from 2 - 70 mmol m**- 2 d**- 1 for weak and very strong turbulent flow, respectively. Further, the stirring sensitivity depended on the sensor orientation towards the flow. Optical microsensors (optodes) that should not exhibit a <b>stirring</b> sensitivity were <b>tested</b> in parallel and did not show any significant correlation between O 2 signals and turbulent flow. In conclusion, EC data obtained with electrochemical sensors can be affected by artificial flux and we recommend using optical microsensors in future EC-studies. Flume experiments were conducted in February 2013 at the Institute for Environmental Sciences, University of Koblenz-Landau Landau. Experiments were performed in a closed oval-shaped acrylic glass flume with cross-sectional width of 4 cm and height of 10 cm and total length of 54 cm. The fluid flow was induced by a propeller driven by a motor and mean flow velocities of up to 20 cm s- 1 were generated by applying voltages between 0 V and 4 V DC. The flume was completely sealed with an acrylic glass cover. Oxygen sensors were inserted through rubber seal fittings and allowed positioning the sensors with inclinations to the main flow direction of ~ 60 °, ~ 95 ° and ~ 135 °. A Clark type electrochemical O 2 microsensor with a low stirring sensitivity (0. 7 %) was tested and a fast-responding needle-type O 2 optode (PyroScience GmbH, Germany) was used as reference as optodes should not be stirring sensitive. Instantaneous three-dimensional flow velocities were measured at 7. 4 Hz using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV). The velocity at the sensor tip was extracted. The correlation of the fluctuating O 2 sensor signals and the fluctuating velocities was quantified with a cross-correlation analysis. A significant cross-correlation is equivalent to a significant artificial flux. For a total of 18 experiments the flow velocity was adjusted between 1. 7 and 19. 2 cm s**- 1, and 3 different orientations of the electrochemical sensor were tested with inclination angles of ~ 60 °, ~ 95 ° and ~ 135 ° with respect to the main flow direction. In experiments 16 - 18, wavelike flow was induced, whereas in all other experiments the motor was driven by constant voltages. In 7 experiments, O 2 was additionally measured by optodes. Although performed simultaneously with the electrochemical sensor, optode measurements are listed as separate experiments (denoted by the attached 'op' in the filename), because the velocity time series was extracted at the optode tip, located at a different position in the flume...|$|R
