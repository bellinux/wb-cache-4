30|$|Oil {{swelling}} has {{two main}} benefits for oil recovery (Jha 1986; Mangalsingh and Jagai 1996; Jarrell et al. 2002). First, oil swelling can mobilize {{some of the}} residual oil {{so that it can}} be recovered. Second, oil swelling increases oil saturation and consequently the relative permeability of oil. In previous studies, the swelling factor, defined as the ratio of the oil volume at a given CO 2 partial pressure to its initial volume at atmospheric condition, was measured directly using <b>see-through</b> <b>windowed</b> high-pressure cells that had vertical cylindrical body (Holm and Josendal 1982; Monger 1987; Hand and Plnczewshl 1990; Tsau et al. 2010). In their studies, CO 2 had been injected from upper side into the cells that had been filled with less than half–full of oil. On the other hand, the dynamic pendant drop volume analysis method was also used for measuring the swelling factor (Yang and Gu 2005, 2006). Oil sample was introduced to form a pendant oil drop inside a <b>see-through</b> <b>windowed</b> high-pressure cell that was filled with CO 2 and the oil drop volumes were measured by the image analysis in their studies.|$|R
30|$|Oil {{swelling}} {{was measured}} with different pressure, temperature, and oil composition in those studies because the degree of oil swelling depended on those factors (Simon and Graue 1965). Those factors are different according to not only oil reservoirs but also location in an oil reservoir; therefore, it must be significant to consider the effects of those factors on oil swelling. We expect that other factors, such as oil saturation, capillary pressure, rock wettability, and representative elementary volume (REV) involving grain size of reservoir rock must be also considered in understanding oil swelling in oil reservoir because they may influence the interfacial area between oil and CO 2, which affects the dissolubility of CO 2 in oil. Tsau et al. (2010) performed the swelling tests with different initial volumes of oil. Small differences of the swelling factor {{were found between the}} different initial oil volumes in their results although there was no description about this phenomenon. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to make clear the effect of interfacial area between oil and CO 2 on oil swelling through experiments using our original small <b>see-through</b> <b>windowed</b> high-pressure cell.|$|R
5000|$|On May 15, 2009, polymer ten {{and twenty}} córdoba notes were issued to with their paper counterparts. A new polymer {{two hundred and}} a paper one hundred córdoba {{banknote}} was first issued on June 1, 2009. A new polymer 50 córdoba was issued on December 3, 2009. The new designed paper 500 córdoba banknote was introduced on January 12, 2010. A commemorative design of the 50 córdobas was introduced on September 15, 2010 to commemorate the Banco Central de Nicaragua's 50th anniversary of its establishment. In 2012, the Banco Central de Nicaragua (Central Bank of Nicaragua) began issuing {{a new series of}} córdoba banknotes with revised security features, beginning with the 10, 20 and 200 córdoba polymer banknotes, which is similar to their first issue, but the notable change is the embossed [...] "10", [...] "20", and [...] "200" [...] on the <b>see-through</b> <b>window</b> now being of an opaque white.|$|E
5000|$|The tour {{of season}} six's mansion was {{released}} for public viewing on December 15, 2010, while Oxygen changed their website's homepage {{for the upcoming}} season of the Bad Girls Club. The tour {{of the house was}} hosted by Steve Leonhardt, the Bad Girls Club production designer, and several days prior to the arrival of the cast of season six, in September 2010. Located in Sherman Oaks, California, season 6's mansion was nearly six miles away from city streets whereas the mansion was nearly three and a half miles away from Pier 39. The girls are welcomed with a medium bachelor pad-styled house with centric add-ons in front of the doorway, signifying a Hollywood mansion. The two-divided country western doors have only one small star-shaped <b>see-through</b> <b>window</b> that are located adjacent to the door knob. The girls are then welcomed with eco-friendly potted plants and dark purple walls that are populated with comments and ratings from major media coverage. Down across the same hallway is a hang-out room that has a circular hot pink couch, which the girls can encounter. Facing towards the hang out room the girls can spot a replica of the Hollywood sign reading [...] "Bad Girls Club". Also located near the hang out room is a bigger size living room which features more bright colors and modern matching furniture that faces bright stars at a dark-colored wall. Above the staircase, the girls can spot a stripperposing adjacent to the Bad Girls Club logo. Scattered across the wall, near the staircase, are pictures of the ladies from Bad Girls Club: Miami, which was the previous season. The production designer decided to upgrade the mansion from previous house styles and gave the girls the Hollywood scene look, stating that the girls of Bad Girls Club are celebrities.|$|E
40|$|There are two {{alternative}} display {{metaphors for}} Augmented Reality (AR) screens: a <b>see-through</b> <b>window</b> or a magic mirror. Commonly used by task-support AR applications, the see-through display {{has not been}} compared with the mirror display in terms of user’s task performance, even though the “mirror ” hardware is more accessible to general users. We conducted a novel experiment to compare participants ’ performance when following object rotation cues with the two display metaphors. Results show that participants ’ overall performance under the mirror view was comparable to the see-through view, which indicates that the augmented mirror display may be a promising alternative to the window display for AR applications which guide moderately complex three-dimensional manipulations with physical objects...|$|E
30|$|Oil {{swelling}} is {{an important}} phenomenon in CO 2 -EOR. According to various studies in the past, the degree of oil swelling depends on the partial pressure of CO 2, temperature, and oil composition. However, we expect that other factors, such as oil saturation, capillary pressure, and grain size of reservoir rock must be also considered in evaluating oil swelling because they may influence the interfacial area between oil and CO 2, which affects the dissolubility of CO 2 in oil. Therefore, we had made clear {{the effect of the}} interfacial area on oil swelling in this study. Oil and CO 2 were injected into a small <b>see-through</b> <b>windowed</b> high-pressure cell and oil swelling was observed under a microscope. The swelling factor increased with the increase of the specific interfacial area between oil and CO 2. Moreover, oil swelling in porous media was observed using micro-models which had been made of two different diameter glass beads. Swelling factor in fine beads micro-model became larger than that in coarse beads micro-model whose interfacial area between oil and CO 2 was smaller than that of fine beads micro-model. Therefore, the swelling factor is expected to be larger with an increase in the interfacial area in porous media. These results suggest that the oil swelling should be expressed as a function of oil saturation, capillary pressure, and grain size of reservoir rock which are related to the interfacial area as well as the partial pressure of CO 2, temperature, and oil composition.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{well known}} {{resonant}} or extraordinary transmission through an undulated metallic thin film {{embedded in a}} dielectric layer using the Plasmon modes excitation under normal incidence is industrially exploited for document protection applications. While the effect is very spectrally sensitive to the incidence angle in collinear incidence since it leads to a transmission peak separation in two peaks, it is very tolerant in conical incidence (incidence angle in the plan normal to the grating direction). This property is used to create color transmission effects by playing with the sample rotation in the two directions to enhance the contrast of such effect. Theoretical approach, modeling and experimental demonstration in the visible range on a flexible plastic foil are presented for a <b>see-through</b> <b>window</b> implemented in document security...|$|E
