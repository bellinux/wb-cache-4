5000|$|The first {{definition}} {{is rooted in}} the fact that pursuant to Article 17 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation aircraft have the nationality of the state in which they are registered.U.S. law (14 CFR § 121.153 (a) (1)) requires American air carriers to operate aircraft registered in the United States and most countries have similar laws.Thus when an airline operates an international route, between two countries, having been designated pursuant to a Bilateral Air Transport Agreement any crime that would be committed on board would be prosecuted under the laws of the airline's state. Article 3 (1) of Tokyo Convention declares that [...] "The <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> the aircraft is competent to exercise jurisdiction over [...] "offenses and acts committed on board." [...] " [...] Therefore the aircraft is truly carrying the flag of its country. [...] The American definition of [...] "U.S.-flag air carrier service" [...] contained in 48 CFR 47.403-1. is based on this first definition. The U.S. requirements under the Fly America Act, are consistent with requiring that Title 18 of the United States Code (U.S. Criminal Law) would protect U.S. government employees on flights to foreign countries.The second and more broadly used definition of [...] "flag carrier" [...] is a legacy of the time when countries established state-owned airline companies. Governments then took the lead due to the high capital costs of establishing and running airlines. However, not all such airlines were government-owned; Pan Am, TWA, Cathay Pacific, Union de Transports Aériens, Canadian Pacific Air Lines and Olympic Airlines were all privately owned. Most of these were considered to be flag carriers as they were the [...] "main national airline" [...] and often a sign of their country's presence abroad.|$|E

40|$|Centuries-old {{maritime}} jurisprudence {{continues to}} guide {{the law of the}} sea today. These baseline understandings are necessary to maintain order of the largest international commons, the sea. The seas’ central role in globalization, though, strains some of this established law. In particular, the question of jurisdiction has become increasingly complex as ships regularly ply every ocean and visit ports in dozens of countries. Many of these ships are actually subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of States with which they have no connection and which have limited incentives to regulate. This paper explores how this jurisdictional non sequitur arose, and when international law permits concurrent jurisdiction. Specifically, this paper emphasizes when U. S. courts can reach activities on the seas. The limits on regulating the maritime commons inherent in a Westphalian system of nation-States has long been resolved by assigning regulatory, criminal, and civil jurisdiction to a vessel’s <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Registration.</b> In other words, the laws of the nation that charter the vessel – which corresponds to the flag the ship flies – govern most aspects of the ship’s operations as well as personal conduct onboard.

Reporting rates were related to crash severity, with fatal or injury/transported involvements most likely to be reported, and tow/disabled crashes less likely. Reporting rates also varied by the type of vehicle, with small buses (8 - 15 passenger) less likely to be reported than trucks or large buses; by <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration,</b> with in-state vehicles less likely to be reported than out-of-state; and by the type of investigation agency (state police, county, or city police).

We have identified those branches of industry, for which the doses were close to 5 mSv/year. Examples of reducing the radiation doses by reducing the time spent by workers in workplaces with high levels of radiation are given. The problems of insufficient representativeness of the sample data are due to the lack of interaction of the management of industrial enterprises with the bodies of the Rospotrebnadzor. The obtained data allow speaking about the problem of assessing the quality of radiation control in the organizations where additional exposure of workers from natural radiation sources is expected.

Iako je riječ o pokretninama, na prijevozna sredstva u pravilu se ne primjenjuje lex situs, već se to pitanje uređuje posebnom kolizijskom normom stvarnog statuta. Koji se pravni problemi pri tome pojavljuju i kako se pojedina prijevozna sredstva kolizijskopravno uređuju, objašnjava autor u ovom radu. This article {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the special conflict of law rule for the means of transport contained in Art. 18 (3) of the Croatian Private International Law Act (Cro-PIL-A) which, within the frame of a real statute, determines applicable law. This provision, created in the 1970 s, needs new and modern de lege lata and de lege ferenda interpretations as well. By providing a teleological interpretation of Art. 18 (3) of the Cro-PIL-A and by analysing modern comparative private international law provisions in German, Austrian, Hungarian, Swiss, Belgian, Spanish, Korean and some other legal systems, the author concludes that “the means of transport” as a legal concept and object of connection of the conflict of law rule should be interpreted more extensively. It should include not only watercraft (vessels) and aircraft, but also railway vehicles. On the other hand, motor vehicles, as is usually the case in the comparative PIL, should be submitted under the general provision of the lex situs rule, contained in Art. 18 (1) Cro-PIL-A. With respect to the modern comparative PIL provision, especially in the German and Spanish legal systems, modern trends in European law (Directive 2004 / 49 EC of 29 April 2004 on the Railway Safety), and modern traffic conventions, i. e. Arts. 3 and 4 ATMF Appendix G to the COTIF Convention of 9 May 1980 in the Version of the Protocol of Modification of 3 June 1999, the author draws the conclusion that “the means of transport” in Article 18 (3) of the Cro-PIL-A, which includes railway vehicles, should be governed by the law of the state of admission or the law of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration...</b>|$|E
40|$|Jurisdiction for the {{prosecution}} and investigation of crimes at sea The criminal jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, States and Territories in the maritime areas surrounding Australia is often a cause of uncertainty. This summary describes how the Commonwealth and the States have defined their jurisdiction and law enforcement responsibilities for the criminal laws that apply around Australia’s coastline. The primary legislation governing general maritime crime is the Crimes at Sea Act 2000 (Cth) (‘CASA’). CASA performs two important functions: • it gives effect to a Cooperative Scheme between the Commonwealth and the States, which defines {{the application of the}} criminal law in the areas adjacent to the coast of Australia (generally within 200 nautical miles (nm)) and • it sets out situations where Australian criminal laws can apply to criminal acts on Australian and foreign vessels outside of those adjacent areas. CASA recognises that additional considerations apply to conduct on or from foreign flagged ships. Under international law, ships are normally subject to the criminal jurisdiction of their <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> (flag state). Because of this principle, even where particular conduct is subject to Australian law (for example because a foreign vessel is located close to the Australian coastline), the flag state of the foreign vessel may also have jurisdiction over that conduct. The Attorney General’s consent is required before commencing a prosecution for conduct occurring on a foreign vessel. The Cooperative Scheme The preamble to CASA describes how the Act and the Scheme function: • each State is allocated an ‘adjacent area ’ alongside its coastline • the ‘substantive criminal law of a State ’ applies in each adjacent area, by the force of the law of the State, up to a distance of 12 nm • from 12 nm to 200 nm (or {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf if it is further than 200 nm from a State) the criminal laws of the State are applied in the adjacent area by the Commonwealth (through CASA).

40|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), {{motor vehicle}} {{incidents}} {{has been reported}} to be the leading cause of the accidental deaths in the United States accounting for more than 42, 000 deaths every year. Distracted driving and Driving under influence (DUI) are the major contributors to these roadway crashes. Moreover, drivers fatigue and drowsiness behind the wheel is another important factor contributing to the high fatality rate. These factors results in significant decline in the driver 2 ̆ 7 s abilities of perception, recognition and vehicle control. It has also been reported by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimated that about 292, 471 lives of passenger vehicle occupants age 5 and older were saved because of proper seat-belt use in such crashes from 1975 through 2011. Out of these about 11, 949 lives were saved in 2011. According to an estimate provided by NHTSA, if all passenger vehicle occupants wore seat-belts an additional 3, 384 would have been saved in 2011. Thus it is important to spread awareness about such accidents in the field of active safety research. This thesis looks at the driver 2 ̆ 7 s seat-belt usage in Nevada for 2012 and also studies driver 2 ̆ 7 s performance behind the wheel under various distractions and impairments on the driver. This has been primarily done to focus on the driver 2 ̆ 7 s attitude towards road safety. By conducting a seat-belt usage survey across Nevada in the year 2012, we have captured seat-belt usage across gender, age groups, ethnicity, vehicle types, <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration,</b> road types and in different counties. This data was further provided to NHTSA to focus primarily on the areas with low seat-belt usage during the Click it or Ticket (CIOT) mobilization campaign. Another aspect of the research work was to study driver 2 ̆ 7 s performance behind the wheel under various impairments and distractions induced on the driver. This study has been conducted in a laboratory environment to avoid any potential dangers to anyone associated with the study. A driver was provided with a cell phone to text and talk while driving on a driving simulator located at Transportation research Center (TRC).

However, in addition to the natural elements that {{stand in the way of}} stabilizing the situation in the field of agriculture, we also have a chronic presence of numerous "man-made" problems that remain unsettled for years. One of the most significant and painful of them is the <b>state</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the right to lease land. Long-term disorder, corporate wars between state authorities for the right to land relations, negligent attitude to information on land rights and their encumbrances, the shifting of competence among registrars of land tenure rights continue to cause complaints from agricultural producers. But the peculiarities of the legal regulation <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the right to lease land for agricultural purposes did not become the subject of a separate scientific study. Consequently, the purpose of this work is to study and analyze the problems of legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the right to lease land and to find an acceptable option for their further solution. Since the reform of the agrarian sector of Ukraine, the most common form of land use in agricultural production is the use of land by agricultural producers on a lease. The advantage of leasing relations in agricultural production is enshrined in the Concept <b>of</b> the <b>State</b> Target Program for Land Relations Development in Ukraine for the period up to 2020, which was approved by the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated June 17, 2009 No. 743 -p.

Thus, the fact <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the lease contract for agricultural land is a necessary condition for determining the legality of land use of agricultural producers. The <b>state</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the right to lease a land plot of agricultural land is preceded by a <b>state</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> a land plot that is the subject of a lease and a <b>state</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the ownership of such a land plot. The right to lease a land plot used for agricultural production arises from the moment <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> this right. The intended purpose and type of use within the purpose of the leased land should be identical both in the lease agreement of the land plot and in the State Land Cadastre. <b>State</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> land lease agreements for agricultural purposes provides legal guarantees regarding the actual use of land in agricultural production activities...|$|R
