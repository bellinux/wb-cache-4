25|$|As in the 2005 {{election}}s, the Red-Green Coalition won {{the election}} with less votes (this time 47.9%) than the opposition parties (49.5%). Peter N. Myhre of the Progress Party complained that this meant eight years with a government that had not truly won an election, and called for an overhaul of an electoral system that, he claimed, disproportionately favours the Norwegian periphery. Hanne Marthe Narud, {{a political scientist at}} the University of Oslo, identified the result as a consequence of deliberate political planning, and in particular of a 2001 compromise in the Storting that balanced proportionality against an intent to over-represent rural areas. <b>She</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> Dagbladet that this trend could be dated as far back as 1917, when it was argued that Oslo's status as the national capital inherently gave it greater influence, so that it should have less representation in parliament compared with rural areas. Electoral researcher Bernt Aardal stated that he had calculated the results of the election without the rural skewness. His results showed that the Labour Party and Progress Party would both lose a representative, while Red and the Liberal Party would each gain one, still giving a majority to the Red-Green Coalition.|$|E

Gaga recorded the chorus a number of times, channeling the vocals of bands like Duran Duran, and singers Cher and Billy Idol. Inspired by 1980s music, the track incorporates a spoken word section, which Gaga wanted to sound like The B-52's song [...] "Rock Lobster" [...] (1978). <b>She</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone that when she [...] "say 'electric chapel,' something needs to occur...

[...] Badu worked with audio engineers Chris Bell, Tom Soares, and Chavarria, who had spent numerous hours with Badu listening to her previous albums, including her 1997 debut Baduizm and its 2000 follow-up Mama's Gun, and older albums such as The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) by progressive rock band Pink Floyd and Innervisions (1973) by Stevie Wonder. They worked with the producers' emailed music and embellished their own 2-tracks by using Pro Tools to incorporate live instrumentation such as bass, guitar, flutes, percussion, and keyboards.

500|$|According to Gaga, {{playing at}} the Roseland Ballroom was always a dream of hers. <b>She</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> John Seabrook of The New Yorker that [...] "It's {{basically}} the only room in the city I haven't played." [...] As a young girl, she could not afford tickets, but she did manage to win free tickets to a Franz Ferdinand show during her {{senior year of high}} school.

After the singer's career took off with the release of debut album, The Fame (2008), she bypassed {{playing at the}} venue until its closure. Gaga revealed the official poster for the residency on March 18, 2014. The poster features an image of Gaga that was taken by a stranger in 2008 at the Lower East Side of New York City.

500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Music began in January 2000 at Sarm West Studios, Notting Hill, London. The first song that Madonna and Ahmadzaï worked on was [...] "Impressive Instant", {{since it was}} the most complete among all the demos that he had sent to the singer. The song was an instrumental and was not supposed to be included in Ahmadzaï's own album, Production. But Madonna had different ideas for the track and its lyrics, which <b>she</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> the producer. Feeling that Madonna's vision about the song's composition would be difficult to create in Sarm West, Ahmadzaï wanted to return to Paris and work there on his own computer. [...] "There are a lot of chopped vocal tracks on 'Impressive Instant'...That was impossible to do in the studio. It doesn't make sense to rent a place like Sarm just to have me work on ten seconds of music all day, using only the one computer," [...] he added. Within the first ten days, they had recorded the backing vocals, acoustic guitars etc. on a Sony 48-track and transferred it to Logic Audio workstation, using the converters of the TC Electronic Finalizer; Ahmadzaï then went back to Paris with the recordings.|$|E
500|$|In 1839, History of a Six Weeks' Tour was {{revised and}} republished as [...] "Journal of a Six Weeks’ Tour" [...] and [...] "Letters from Geneva" [...] in Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments, by Percy Bysshe Shelley, Edited by Mrs. Shelley (1840). Although these works were not by her husband, {{she decided to}} include them because they were [...] "part of his life", as <b>she</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> her friend Leigh Hunt. She {{appended}} her initials to the works to indicate her authorship. As Moskal explains, [...] "the unity of the 1817 volume as a volume was dissolved" [...] {{to make way for}} a biography of Percy Shelley. After Percy Shelley drowned in 1822, his father forbade Mary Shelley from writing a memoir or biography of the poet. She therefore added significant biographical notices to the edited collections of his works. The 1840 version of History of a Six Weeks' Tour has four major types of changes according to Moskal: [...] "(i) modernization and correction of spelling, punctuation and French (ii) self-distancing from the familial relationship with Claire Clairmont (iii) a heightened sensitivity to national identity (iv) presentation of the travelers as a writing, as well as reading, circle". As a result of these changes, more of Percy Shelley’s writing was included in the 1840 version than in the 1817 version. In 1845, Mary Shelley published a one-volume edition with additional minor changes, based on the 1840 version.|$|E

She was accompanied by a string of male dancers, wearing black monk-like garments, by her side. The song was performed as a dance-filled number, with Gaga singing the lines while wearing a blue latex ensemble. According to James Dinh from MTV, the [...] "choreography [...] seemingly more difficult than in her usual performances, the singer showcased her best high-energy moves." [...] As the music came to a close, she struck a pose before planting a kiss on the cheek of DeGeneres, who playfully replicated her stance. At the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, Gaga sang the song for French television show Le Grand Journal. Wearing a gold-embellished ensemble, a red hood and a black-and-white hairstyle, Gaga performed an energetic version of the song accompanied by her male dancers, on a stage in front of the Mediterranean Sea. <b>She</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> host Michel Denisot that the inspiration behind her look was the religious imagery and fashion portrayed in the [...] "Judas" [...] music video.

500|$|Following her {{comeback}} {{with lead}} single [...] "Applause" [...] from the album, Gaga performed few {{songs from the}} record at the iTunes Festival in London in September 2013. One of the songs, known as [...] "I Wanna Be with You", was performed as an acoustic version on the festival; Gaga called it an ode to her fans and about how much she had missed them while recuperating from the surgery. The song, later renamed to [...] "Dope", was written by Gaga, Paul [...] "DJ White Shadow" [...] Blair, Dino Zisis and Nick Monson and produced by Gaga and Rick Rubin. Described by Gaga as an electronic ballad, [...] "Dope" [...] was revealed to be [...] "the evolution of a fan song that became a deep confession in me." [...] In an interview with Kiss FM (UK) Gaga said that [...] "Dope" [...] was the most personal song she had ever created. Feeling that the album needed something more autobiographical and confessional and a song which would show her vulnerable side, Gaga worked with Rubin who let her do the song {{in the way she}} wanted and just assisted in recording it.

500|$|Crane and Kauffman {{strongly}} envisioned Friends as {{an ensemble}} comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed {{the show as}} such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms {{at the time to}} be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show's main characters are [...] "of equal importance." [...] As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because [...] "utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines." [...] Kauffman echoed [...] "that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage." [...] The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten– approximately $25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the [...] "Rachel" [...] and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress' popularity to boost the show's ratings, notably her character's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston had been telling the press that the show's ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season. <b>She</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> NBC's Matt Lauer, [...] "I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high. And then I was also feeling like, ‘How much more of Rachel do I have in me?’” However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston's busy film schedule.|$|E
