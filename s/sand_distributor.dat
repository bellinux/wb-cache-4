5000|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were later}} {{fitted with a}} Westinghouse compressed-air brake, a steam heating system, washout equipment, <b>sand</b> <b>distributor</b> and adjustable blastpipe.|$|E
50|$|Because of this {{imbalance}} {{the use of}} the <b>sand</b> <b>distributor</b> {{was very}} important. Each drive wheel could be fed with sand, in either direction of travel, by compressed air.|$|E
5000|$|LTG began investing, {{operating}} and marketing in the frac sand space in 2013. The company purchased several sites in Texas and Minnesota {{and has since}} become a significant frac <b>sand</b> <b>distributor</b> in North America.|$|E
50|$|Utica Shale {{then became}} {{the new life}} blood of the {{railroad}} as oil and gas wells, using the latest technology in directional drilling and fracking methods, began producing massive amounts of {{oil and natural gas}} liquids in the counties the railroad served. From pipe suppliers and frac <b>sand</b> <b>distributors,</b> to oil and gas liquids themselves, the railroad’s business opportunities grew.|$|R
40|$|Fluidized bed {{gasification}} {{can be used}} {{to convert}} the solar energy stored as carboneous compounds in bio-mass into a carbon neutral fuel with reduced emissions. Canada produces 20. 57 million tonnes of wheat straw annually which could be used for green energy production. Wheat straw residue gasification has the capability of replacing 7. 5 % (0. 62 EJ) of Canadaâs annual fossil fuel consumption. To achieve efficient gasification in a fluidized bed proper fuel mixing and residence time must be achieved. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of <b>sand</b> particle size, <b>distributor</b> plate shape and angle, bed height and fluidizing velocity on particle mixing and residence time in the fluidized bed reactor. Greater values of the residence time were obtained with course sand whereas lower values were obtained with fine sand. An in-crease in the angle of convex or a decrease in the angle of a concave of the distributor plate resulted in an increase in the residence time. Both the concave and convex distributor plates achieved vertical upward and downward movements of the bed material resulting in continuous bed material turnover and, thus, good mixing. However, the concave plate achieved longer residence time which will result in better conversion efficiency. To improve the mixing properties of the binary mixture, which has great tendency for segregation due to density differences, an angled distributor plate (concave or convex) should be used. Considerable increases in the residence time were recorded with increases in the bed height. Increasing the fluidizing velocity decreased the residence time due to the increase in the bubble velocity. However, since the conversion efficiency is affected by the degree of mixing, it will also be improved by increasing the fluidization velocity. A velocity above 1. 50 U mf is recommended for better fluidization and improved mixing...|$|R
50|$|After the <b>sand</b> <b>distributor</b> that {{accounted}} for {{the overwhelming majority of}} traffic on the line lost its key rail supplied customer, the line was found to no longer be economically viable. The last train operated over the line in 2000. On May 1, 2002, PBRR filed a Notice of Exemption with the Surface Transportation Board for abandonment of the line. Though the Macon County Commission was granted a public use condition by the STB to explore acquisition of the right of way for public use, the line officially abandoned on June 1, 2003. The ties and rails were removed though the roadbed remains.|$|E
50|$|Ohi-Rail moved quickly, {{and when}} a major frac <b>sand</b> <b>distributor</b> located on the {{railroad}} in Minerva, the railroad completely rebuilt the Minerva Yard to accommodate the projected increase in traffic. At that time, they also brought General Manager, Denny Varian, on board to handle operations with the added value of his background in the rail industry. The main line is being completely rehabilitated from Minerva south {{to tap into the}} vast industrial property reserves along the line. Along with the sand cars in the railyard, tank cars are being filled with natural gas liquids via trans-loading from truck.|$|E
