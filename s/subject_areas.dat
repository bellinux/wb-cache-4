40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This study {{explored}} the Academic reading requirements and text features of first-year, first-term <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> instructors in English-medium departments at Anadolu University. The {{study was conducted}} with 20 <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> instructors in English-medium departments at Anadolu University in the 2004 - 2005 fall term. Three sets of data were used for this study. First, interviews were conducted with 20 <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> instructors, and questionnaires were distributed in the interviews. Thirteen of the questionnaires from twenty participants were returned and used in this study. In addition, fifteen samples of required textbooks were collected from the same first-year, first-term content course teachers as well as four reading samples from the textbook in the Preparatory School. The purpose of the questionnaire administered to first-year, first-term <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> instructors was to determine instructors’ academic reading and text type requirements of first-year students. The questionnaire consisted of Likert scale items. The follow-up interviews provided insight into teachers’ perceptions, experiences and practices related to their academic reading requirements of first-year students. Reading samples from the first-year <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> courses were collected to specify the precise reading requirements of the <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> instructors and to analyze the text features in terms of knowledge structures, readability levels and vocabulary frequencies. To analyze the data, mean scores, percentages and frequencies were used in the questionnaire; a coding system was used in the interviews; Flesch-Kincaid readability test and Vocabulary Profiler (Nation & Heatley, 1994) were used for analyzing the reading samples. The results reveal that all <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> instructors agree on the necessity of being a proficient reader in order to be successful in <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> courses. <b>Subject</b> <b>area</b> instructors also agree that academic reading abilities and vocabulary knowledge of students should be supported at Preparatory School. Based on this result adjusting the current curriculum in accordance with the expectations of <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> instructors is recommended. Şahbaz, Zehra HerkmenM. S...|$|R

5|$|Sam & Max Hit the Road is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game where}} the player controls {{the actions of}} Sam from a third-person perspective. The player uses Sam to explore the pre-rendered cartoon environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Players can set the game's cursor in a particular mode to designate how Sam interacts with the environment: Sam can walk around an area, talk to other characters, look at objects, pick them up or otherwise try to use them. The cursor's graphic changes when it is hovered over an in-game entity that Sam can interact with. When talking to another character, the player is given a choice of <b>subject</b> <b>areas</b> to discuss, depicted in a conversation tree as icons {{at the base of the}} screen. In addition to specific topics involving the game's plot, Sam can inject unconnected exclamations, questions and non sequiturs into a conversation.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other <b>subject</b> <b>areas.</b> Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event.

Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
