50|$|Several {{synthetic}} compounds bind to, {{but do not}} activate, TP {{and thereby}} inhibit its activation by activating ligands. These receptor antagonists include I-SAP, SQ-29548, S-145, domitroban, and vapiprost, {{all of which have}} affinities for binding TP similar to that of I-BOP. Other notable TP receptor antagonists are Seratrodast (AA-2414), Terutroban (S18886), PTA2, 13-APA, GR-32191, <b>Sulotroban</b> (BM-13177), SQ-29,548, SQ-28,668, ONO-3708, Bay U3405, EP-045, BMS-180,291, and S-145. Many of these TP receptor antagonists have been evaluated as potential therapeutic agents for asthma, thrombosis and hypertension. These evaluations indicate that TP receptor antagonists can be more effective than drugs which selectively block the production of TXA2 thromboxane synthase inhibitors. This seemingly paradoxical result may reflect the ability of PGH2, whose production is not blocked by the inhibitors, to substitute for TXA2 in activating TP. Novel TP receptor antagonists that also have activity in reducing TXA2 production by inhibiting cyclooxygenases have been discovered and are in development for testing in animal models.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that either the cyclooxygenase inhibitor aspirin or the thromboxane A 2 receptor antagonist <b>sulotroban</b> exerts a direct myocardial effect that enhances myocardial salvage worded by reperfusion. Accordingly, 21 anesthetized dogs underwent suture occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. At 2. 5 h after occlusion, all dogs received intravenous streptokinase (20, 000 U/kg y weight over 30 min) and were randomized to the following groups: group I (n = 7) received no additional treatment, group II (n = 7) received aspirin (5 mg/kg intravenously) and group III (n = 7) received <b>sulotroban</b> (10 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg per h intravenously). At 3 h after occlusion, the dogs underwent coronary reperfusion for the next 3 h. Myocardial infarct size as a percent of the hypoperfused zone was similar among dogs in group I (42 ± 8 %), group II (41 ± 10 %) and group III (45 ± 11 %). The incidence and the extent of myocardial hemorrhage were similar in all three study groups. Infarct size as a percent of the hypoperfused zone was significantly smaller in dogs without hemorrhage irrespective of treatment (35 ± 9 %m versus 63 ± 5 %, p< 0. 01). In conclusion, 1) in the presence of 3 h coronary occlusion and reperfusion, neither a cyclooxygenase inhibitor nor a specific thromboxane A 2 receptor antagonist enhanced myocardial salvage by means of a direct myocardial effect as comp with reperfusion alone; 2) any potential benefits of combined thrombolytic and antiplatelet therapy are likely to be limited to their vascular effects (for example, reperfusion efficacy and prevention of reocclusion); and 3) myocardial hemorrhage may limit myocardial salvage afforded by coronary reperfusion...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of platelet-vessel wall interactions on leukocyte rolling {{was investigated in}} rabbit mesenteric venules (diameter, 21 - 40 gm) using intravital videomicroscopy. Puncture of the wall with glass micropipettes (tip, 6 - 8,um) evoked {{the formation of a}} thrombus in all venules. In most vessels, emboli were produced as well. The rolling of leukocytes (i. e., their movement along the vessel wall at a velocity clearly lower than that of the other blood cells) was quantitated simultaneously in vessel segments upstream and downstream from a thrombus up to 10 minutes after puncture. During embolization the number of rolling leukocytes decreased significantly from the upstream to the downstream vessel segment (median decrease, 45 %; p<O. 001). It was still decreased by- 50 % after embolization had stopped, indicating that the decrease in leukocyte rolling was not caused by inclusion of leukocytes in the emboli. In venules without embolization, leukocyte rolling did not change systematically, indicating that fluid dynamic changes induced by the thrombus do not influence leukocyte rolling. Inhibition of prostaglandin formation with aspirin (100 mg/kg) almost completely abolished the {{influence of}} the thromboembolic reaction on leukocyte rolling, but blockade of thromboxane A 2 receptors with <b>sulotroban</b> (30 mg/kg) had no effect. In conclusion, this is the first report on a functiona...|$|E
40|$|BM- 531 (N-tert-butyl-N'-[(2 -cyclohexylamino- 5 -nitrobenzene) sulfonyl]urea), a {{torasemide}} derivative, {{is a novel}} noncarboxylic thromboxane receptor antagonist and thromboxane synthase inhibitor. Indeed, its {{affinity for}} human washed platelet TXA 2 receptors labeled with [3 H]SQ- 29548 (IC 50 = 0. 0078 microM) is higher than <b>sulotroban</b> (IC 50 = 0. 93 microM) and SQ- 29548 (IC 50 = 0. 021 microM). Moreover, BM- 531 {{is characterized by a}} potent antiaggregatory property. Indeed, on one hand, in human citrated platelet-rich plasma BM- 531 prevents platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (600 microM) (ED 100 = 0. 125 microM), U- 46619, a stable TXA 2 agonist (1 microM) (ED 50 = 0. 482 microM) or collagen (1 microgram/mL) (percentage of inhibition: 42. 9 % at 10 microM) and inhibits the second wave of ADP (2 microM) -induced aggregation. On the other hand, when BM- 531 is incubated in whole blood from healthy donors, the closure time measured by the recently developed platelet function analyser (PFA- 100) is significantly prolonged. In addition, at the concentrations of 10 and 1 microM, BM- 531 totally prevents the production of TXB 2 by human platelets activated by arachidonic acid. Finally, at 10 microM, BM- 531 significantly prevents rat fundus contractions induced by U- 46619 but not by prostacyclin. These results suggest that BM- 531, which is devoid of the diuretic property of torasemide, can be regarded as a promising antiplatelet agent. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{and chronic}} effects of {{thromboxane}} A 2 inhibition on the renal hemodynamics in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. We examined acute and chronic effects of thromboxane (TX) A 2 inhibition on the renal hemodynamics at {{early and late}} stage of untreated streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats. Two weeks and 28 weeks after the induction of diabetes, renal blood flow (RBF) under anesthesia was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter before and after TXA 2 inhibition. In two-week-old diabetic rats, a specific TXA 2 synthetase inhibitor, OKY- 046, or a specific TXA 2 receptor antagonist, <b>Sulotroban,</b> increased renal vascular resistance (RVR) and ameliorated the hyperperfusion. The renal vasoconstrictive effect of OKY- 046 was blunted by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, MK 422, or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, Saralasin. On the contrary, OKY- 046 ameliorated the renal hypoperfusion by decreasing RVR in 28 -week-old diabetic rats. Chronic oral administration of OKY- 046 ameliorated not only the renal hyperperfusion but increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) at two weeks, but also the renal hypoperfusion, filtration fraction and UAE at 24 weeks. It is suggested that TXA 2 might, at least in part, play important roles in the hyperperfusion by modulating activity of the renin-angiotensin system {{at an early stage}} of untreated diabetic rats and in the hypoperfusion at the late stage of untreated diabetic rats, and that TXA 2 is also involved in the increase of UAE. These results support roles for TXA 2 in the progression of renal injury in STZ-induced diabetic rats...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of BM- 567 (N-pentyl-N'-[(2 -cyclohexylamino- 5 -nitrobenzene) sulfonyl]urea), a torasemide derivative. on both thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) receptors (TP) and thromboxane synthase of human platelets. The drug affinity for TP receptors of human washed platelets has been determined. In this test BM- 567 showed a high affinity (IC 50 : 1. 1 +/- 0. 1 nM) for the TP receptors in comparison with BM- 531 (IC 50 : 7. 8 +/- 0. 7 nM) and <b>sulotroban</b> (IC 50 : 931 +/- 85 nM), two TXA(2) antagonists. We also demonstrated that BM- 567 prevented platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (AA) (600 muM) (ED 100 : 0. 20 +/- 0. 10 muM), U- 46619, a stable TXA(2) agonist (1 muM) (ED 50 : 0. 30 +/- 0. 04 muM) and collagen (1 mug ml(- 1)) (% of inhibition: 44. 3 +/- 4. 3 % at 10 muM) and inhibited the second wave of ADP (2 muM). Moreover, when BM- 567 was incubated in whole blood from healthy donors, the closure time measured by the Platelet Function analyzer (PFA- 100) was significantly prolonged (closure time: 215 +/- 21 s) by using collagen/epinephrine cartridges. Finally, at the concentration of 1 muM, BM- 567 completely reduced the TXB 2 production from human platelets stimulated with AA (600 muM). These results indicate that BM- 567 is a novel combined TXA(2) receptor antagonist and thromboxane synthase inhibitor characterized by a powerful antiplatelet potency. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|BM- 573 (N-terbutyl-N'-[2 -(4 '-methylphenylamino) - 5 -nitro-benzenesulfonyl]urea), a torsemide derivative, {{is a novel}} non-carboxylic dual TXA 2 synthase {{inhibitor}} and receptor antagonist. The pharmacological {{profile of}} the drug {{is characterized by a}} higher affinity for the thromboxane receptor than that of SQ- 29548, {{one of the most powerful}} antagonists described to date, by a complete prevention of human platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid at a lower dose than either torsemide or <b>sulotroban,</b> and by a significantly prolonged closure time measured by the platelet function analyser (PFA- 100). Moreover, at the concentrations of 1 and 10 microM, BM- 573 completely prevented production of TXB 2 by human platelets activated by 0. 6 mM of arachidonic acid. BM- 573 prevents rat fundus contraction induced by U- 46619 but not by prostacyclin or other prostaglandins. Despite possessing a chemical structure very similar to that of a diuretic torsemide, BM- 573 has no diuretic activity. BM- 573 does not prolong bleeding time and, unlike some of the other sulfonylureas, has no effect on blood glucose levels. In vivo, BM- 573 appears to have antiplatelet and antithrombotic activities since it reduced thrombus weight and prolonged the time to abdominal aorta occlusion induced by ferric chloride. BM- 573 also relaxed rat aorta and guinea pig trachea precontracted with U- 46619. In pigs, BM- 573 completely antagonized pulmonary hypertensive effects of U- 46619 and reduced the early phase of pulmonary hypertension in models of endotoxic shock and pulmonary embolism. Finally, BM- 573 protected pigs from myocardial infarction induced by coronary thrombosis. These results suggest that BM- 573 should be viewed as a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and syndromes associated with platelet activation.
