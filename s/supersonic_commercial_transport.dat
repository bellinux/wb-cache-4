CISAP reads "Cruise speed impact on Supersonic Aircraft planform" {{and the project}} addresses mainly two topics: first the development, set-up and verification of several mixed fidelity multiple-discipline optimization (MDO) processes and secondly the application of these processes to optimize wing planforms of <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Transports</b> (SCT) for maximum range at different supersonic cruise Mach-numbers.

The configurations transporting 250 passengers are designed for a target range of 5500 nautical miles and a fixed maximum take-off weight. Applying different MDO methods within CISAP to maximize the range of the datum configurations leads to significant planform changes of all aircraft.

Background research was performed on historic supersonic operations in the National Airspace System, including both flight deck procedures and air traffic controller procedures.

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{development of}} a second-generation <b>supersonic</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>transport</b> has resulted in increased research efforts to provide an environmentally acceptable aircraft. One of the environmental issues {{is the impact of}} sonic booms on people. Aircraft designers are attempting to design the transport to produce sonic boom signatures that will have minimum impact on the public. Current supersonic commercial aircraft produce an 'N-wave' sonic boom pressure signature that is considered unacceptable by the public. This has resulted in first-generation supersonic transports being banned from flying supersonically over land in the United States, a severe economic constraint. By tailoring aircraft volume and lift distributions, designers hope to produce sonic boom signatures having specific shapes other than 'N-wave' that may be more acceptable to the public and could possibly permit overland supersonic flight. As part of the effort to develop a second-generation <b>supersonic</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>transport,</b> Langley Research Center is conducting research to study people's subjective response to sonic booms. As part of that research, a system was developed for performing studies of the subjective response of people to the occurrence of simulated sonic booms in their homes. The In-Home Noise Generation/Response System (IHONORS) provides a degree of situational realism not available in the laboratory and a degree of control over the noise exposure not found in community surveys. The computer-controlled audio system generates the simulated sonic booms, measures the noise levels, and records the subjects' rating and can be placed and operated in individuals' homes for extended periods of time. The system was used to conduct an in-home study of subjective response to simulated sonic booms. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} determine the effect on annoyance of the number of sonic boom occurrences in a realistic environment...|$|E

In an effort to provide guidance to aircraft designers and {{to aid in the}} establishment of sonic boom impact criteria, a program to study human response to sonic booms was formulated. It consists of three components: (a) laboratory studies using a sonic boom simulator to assess response to individual sonic booms having a range of pressure-time signatures, (b) an in-home simulation system to investigate response to daily combinations of individual boom amplitudes and their frequency of occurrence, and (c) response to sonic booms in communities that are routinely exposed to supersonic aircraft operations.

40|$|NASA and {{industry}} partners desire to reintroduce <b>commercial</b> <b>supersonic</b> airliners {{to the air}} transportation system. There {{are a number of}} technical challenges that must be overcome by future <b>commercial</b> <b>supersonic</b> airliners to make them viable solutions in society.
