40|$|A {{unit was}} {{constructed}} {{for the study}} of film heat transfer coefficients of a heavy fuel oil in viscous or streamline flow. The heat exchanger was of the shell and tube type, having extended longitudinal steel fins welded to the tube. Auxiliary equipment consisted of an oil pump, oil storage reservoirs, piping, and means for measurement of temperatures and oil flow rates. The unit was operated both as a fin type heat exchanger with the oil in contact with the finned surfaces, and as a straight tube and <b>shell</b> <b>exchanger</b> with the oil on the tube side. Oil flow rates and temperatures were varied over a wide range. The data obtained was calculated by the means of existing empirical equations, and the results were compared with those of previous investigators and with the proposed correlations by plotting. The experimentally determined film coefficients obtained on the exchanger when operated as a fin type were found to be in agreement with the best existing correlation. Coefficients determined on the straight tube and <b>shell</b> <b>exchanger</b> were found to be forty per cent higher than the values predicted by this correlation. A comparison was drawn between the exchanger as a fin type and as a shell and tube type. The fin type was found to transfer approximately four hundred per cent as much heat per unit length of exchanger as did the straight shell and tube type. It is believed that a considerable saving would be effected by the use of a fin type exchanger in any application of heat transfer in which one fluid film definitely controlled the rate of heat transfer...|$|E

40|$|Aluminium {{reduction}} {{cells are}} operated traditionally with an energy input as constant as possible. This {{is to reduce}} the variability of the process and simplify process monitoring and detection of abnormal situations. Recent advances in control systems have decreased the number and magnitude of process excursions keeping a vast majority of reduction cells within optimum performance. Reorientation in energy generation towards volatile renewable sources and changes in marketing mechanisms in Germany have led to an elevated and volatile electricity price resulting in an incentive to overcome the concept of constant energy input. This thesis postulates theoretical aspects and boundaries of both possibility and magnitude of power modulation. These theories are compared with results found in experiments simulating aspects of power modulation undertaken on industrial reduction cells as well as during practical operation of a whole smelter with continuous power modulation. Key results of these investigations are: 1. Theoretical boundaries of 0. 728 MWh were verified. 2. Side ledge shows a distinctly different behaviour if in contact with molten bath or molten metal. Previous considerations always assumed equilibrium when discussing side ledge. Experimental results show that there are significant dynamics influencing the shape of side ledge. 3. Cells show a significant capability of shedding additional heat in less than a day, stabilizing operation shortly after increased energy inputs. 4. Top cell cover contributes to 50 % to physical changes in the cell induced by energy imbalances. Basic approaches for modelling and incorporating effects of power modulation into process control algorithms are derived from experimental results. Changes in process efficiency found during continuous modulation are evaluated with regards to the economical impact on smelter operation showing that power modulation is a valid approach for reducing production costs. Other scenarios for generating revenue based on flexible smelter operation are highlighted. To extend the capabilities for power modulation, engineering solutions available today, such as <b>shell</b> heat <b>exchangers</b> and dampers to control off-gas volume are discussed with respects to their ability to vary and control heat loss from a cell.

40|$|Abstract ― The epileptic {{supply of}} power from the {{national}} grid in Nigeria has made many industries to engage Internal Combustion Engine generators as alternative to providing energy required for production. The excessive use of these machines has mostly altered their effective performance, thereby necessitating more frequent maintenance or repair than recommended by the manufacturers.

A known engineering enterprise in Kano; North West region of Nigeria due to the same factor stated above, subjected her 30 kva generator to run almost throughout the working hours of the week. Initially, the generator run perfectly within the manufacturer recommended 100 hours of operation before conducting maintenance works.

40|$|On {{a typical}} {{oil and gas}} platform, {{mechanical}} equipment units are integral parts of the topside processing system. Heat exchangers, separators, scrubbers, compressors and other equipment units are critical for the proper operation of the processing plant. The hydrocarbon stream received at the first production separator is a mixed stream comprising oil, water and gas phase. This mixed stream is processed in order to separate the oil dominated, water dominated and gas phase. The processing systems for hydrocarbon separation consists of individual equipment units which are mapped {{together to form a}} network along with all the necessary process and operational parameters like inlet and outlet pressure and temperature, flow rates, compositional data and vapour fraction details. Modifying the process parameters on an individual equipment unit, impacts the process and operational parameters of subsequent downstream equipment units. Changing heat exchanger parameters has visible impacts on the operation of downstream equipments and also on the product specifications. Insufficient cooling of the gas stream reduces compressor efficiency, insufficient heating results in lesser quantities of gas bubbling out in the 3 phase separators and also insufficient cooling causes lesser condensate extraction from scrubber units, upstream of the compressor units. For the varied heating and cooling applications on an oil and gas topside system, <b>shell</b> and tube <b>exchangers,</b> plate frame heat exchangers and printed circuit heat exchangers are the common configurations used in the industry. <b>Shell</b> and tube <b>exchangers</b> have a robust design and can handle most kinds of process fluids across a large pressure and temperature range. Plate frame exchangers are the preferred choice for topside applications compared to <b>shell</b> and tube <b>exchangers</b> considering the cost benefit owing to weight the footprint savings. However, the operating pressure and temperature are a limiting factor for plate frame exchanger applications. Process fluids only within the range of 35 barg and 200 oC can be processed in this type of exchanger. Printed circuit heat exchangers are specially designed compact heat exchangers that have a very high heat transfer effective surface area which allows this type of exchanger to handle large heating duty demands. The compact design of printed circuit exchangers gives them a low weight and footprint factor. While doing thermal design calculations for shell and tube heat exchangers, factors like L/D ratio, RhoV 2 factor, vibration factor, shell side and tube side fluid velocity, effective surface area per shell, allowable and actual pressure drop values, heat duty and LMTD need to be analyzed in order to achieve an optimum design of the heat exchanger. </p...|$|R

The use of microwave energy has been suggested as an alternative distillation method that would: reduce water usage, dependence on non-renewable energy sources, and the carbon footprint. A byproduct of this technique was first discovered in 2009; the creation of an aerosol, which are extremely difficult to condense with the traditional tube and <b>shell</b> heat <b>exchangers</b> used by mint farmers.

The improvement techniques of the heat exchanger are divided into two types: active and passive techniques. The thermal performance improvement with the passive method is widely used more than the active mode due to it does not require the additional power into the heating system. The passive method is to use the turbulator or vortex generator such as fin, rib, baffle, wing, winglet, and roughness surface to generate the vortex flow or swirling flow in the heat exchanger that helps to increase the heat transfer rate and performance. The selection of the turbulator depends on the application of the heat exchanger.
