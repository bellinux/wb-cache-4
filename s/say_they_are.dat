5|$|A legal {{claim of}} {{discrimination}} rests upon a group agreeing {{that a particular}} term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage who <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not offended. This raised the difficulty of Native American identity in the United States, also an evolving controversy.|$|E
5|$|Sea turtles are {{protected}} by law in Costa Rica, but poaching remains common. Locals take eggs, which {{are believed to be}} an aphrodisiac, and sell them on the black market. The egg trade has been linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. Environmentalists working in Limón <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often threatened for trying to protect turtle eggs. Jairo Mora was one such environmentalist working in the area.|$|E

50|$|Planted in 1901 by Stationmaster Wilson's wife, the lilacs {{have become}} a {{signature}} of the depot. Some say the lilacs were planted there because Wilson’s wife was congratulating him on the job of station agent, some <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> there to cover {{the smell of the}} outhouses outside of the train station, some <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> given as a gift, others <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> planted to remind her of her native Britain.

5|$|Dorset's {{population}} {{has a high}} proportion of older people and a lower than average proportion of young people: According to 2013 mid-year estimates, 23.6% are over 65 years of age, higher than the England and Wales average of 17.4%, and 18.6% are less than 17 years old, lower than the England and Wales average of 21.3%.

5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, who <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, {{but it appears that}} Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E

International proponents of amber rear signals <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more easily discernible as turn signals, and U.S. studies in the early 1990s demonstrated improvements in the speed and accuracy of following drivers' reaction to stop lamps when the turn signals were amber rather than red.|$|E
