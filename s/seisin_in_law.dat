5000|$|By {{physically}} entering {{onto the}} land the transferee converts or [...] "delivers" [...] his <b>seisin</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> into seisin in deed. Instead {{of a physical}} entry on to the land, sometimes a token of the land (e.g., a turf, or similar) would be handed over ceremoniously, (see [...] "turf and twig"; cf. the handover of [...] "earth and water" [...] by political entities subjecting themselves to the Persian Empire, which thereafter considered their rulers its vassals). A tenant seised in deed {{as well as in}} law thus had obtained the best legal title to his tenure available.|$|E
50|$|Mr Nicolson claimed {{possession}} of the island, and other lands, these having originally been 'acquired from the family of Mowat Keith' and by right of <b>seisin</b> <b>in</b> 1739. The root of the issue {{appears to be the}} renunciation of the lands by Sir George's father, John Mowat Keith, as a result of debts to John Scott.|$|R
5000|$|A {{jointure}} is of two kinds, {{legal and}} equitable. A legal jointure was first {{authorized by the}} Statute of Uses. Before this statute a husband had no legal <b>seisin</b> <b>in</b> such lands as were vested in another to his [...] "use", but merely an equitable estate. Consequently, it was usual to make settlements on marriage, the most general form being the settlement by deed of an estate {{to the use of}} the husband and wife for their lives in joint tenancy (or [...] "jointure") so that the whole would go to the survivor. Although, strictly speaking, a jointure is a joint estate limited to both husband and wife, in common acceptation the word extends also to a sole estate limited to the wife only.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Seisin</b> used <b>in</b> {{the normal}} course of events is of two kinds, [...] "in law" [...] and [...] "in deed". Each carries with it a differing {{strength}} of tenure.It came to be said that later that in the conveyance of a fee by deed of feofment there must be livery of seisin.|$|R
50|$|With {{his brother}} Ralph, William was a joint donor in {{numerous}} charters issued {{by his parents}} and was a witness to his father's charter, all to Longueville Priory near Rouen, Normandy (between 1130 and 1138). He was also a donor with his brother and both parents to the priory of Bellencombre (also near Rouen) in 1135. William was also the primary donor {{in a number of}} charters after his father died, between 1138 and 1147.One of particular instance occurred during a livery of <b>seisin</b> <b>in</b> 1147. At that event, William gave a large gift to the Lewes Priory which was secured with a lock of hair from his own and from his brother Ralph's head cut by Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester, before the altar of the priory church. Lewes Priory had been founded by William's grandparents, William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, and his wife Gundrada, probably in 1081.|$|R

5000|$|The lease {{and release}} was:"developed as another {{strategy}} to avoid public transfer of <b>seisin,</b> <b>in</b> response to the limitations imposed by the Statute of Enrolments. Since uses (future leases in land) had been limited by the Statute of Uses (and remain subject to disincentives in many jurisdictions), another instrument had to be found. That instrument was the lease for a year (lease for possession) followed {{on the following day}} by a release of the property, thus avoiding livery of seisin. The instrument thus consists of two parts: (i) a lease for one year on one day; (ii) a release on the following day. In the lease for a year, the consideration was nominal (usually 5s.) and the term of the lease one year. The release was executed the day after the lease, releasing the property to the 'lessee' in perpetuity; the full purchase price (consideration) is recited in the release; the release recites mentions the lease of the previous day; the release is executed 'according to the statute for converting uses into possession' (the Statute of Uses)." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was granted}} by Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare, Lord of Leinster and Earl of Pembroke, {{also known as}} Strongbow, to Robert St. Michael before 1176. In 1220 Peter de Norrach, {{probably}} a descendant of St. Michael, was baron of Norragh. In 1241 Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke granted Geoffrey son of Peter two-thirds of the barony of Norragh. An inquisition of 1313 states that the barony of Norragh was held from John Hastings, 2nd Baron Hastings by Wliilam de Norragh and his heirs (Hastings was Marshal's heir in the female line). About 1320 Geoffrey de Norragh granted the manors of Norragh and Skethness (Skerries) to Sir Michael le Veele. Walter le Veele was Baron of Norragh in 1332 and he died in 1334. His son John Calf had seisin of these lands in 1344. He died in 1356 and his second son Robert had <b>seisin</b> <b>in</b> 1363. After 1363 the barony was held of the Earl of Kildare. Robert died in 1374 and his daughter Elizabeth married Sir John Staunton of Clane. Staunton was a tenant of 2/3 of Norragh and died c.1390. His widow Elizabeth Calf married Art MacMurrough-Kavanagh in 1390.|$|R
50|$|Marshall {{addressed}} the arguments raised by Peck's lawyers and Johnson's dissent {{at the very}} end of his majority opinion:It was doubted whether a state can be seised in fee of lands, subject to the Indian title, and whether a decision that they were seised in fee, might not be construed to amount to a decision that their grantee might maintain an ejectment for them, notwithstanding that title.The majority of the court is of opinion that the nature of the Indian title, which is certainly to be respected by all courts, until it be legitimately extinguished, is not such as to be absolutely repugnant to <b>seisin</b> <b>in</b> fee on the part of the state.Marshall's formulation is actually a compromise: responding to Johnson's concern that Georgian land owners with such grants could evict Indians, while still trying to preserve the validity of the dominant form of land grant in the United States at the time. In doing so, Marshall in effect adopted the newer view of Indian title promulgated in state courts for two decades that the Indians did not own fee simple to their lands. Marshall's opinion did not spell out which methods could legitimately extinguish Indian title, or even whether the power resided with the state or federal government.|$|R
