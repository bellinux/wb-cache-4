40|$|Despite some {{understanding}} within the development literature about innovation in extreme contexts marked by challenges of institutional voids and resource scarcity, there exists little knowledge within organization theory and strategic management. To extend this understanding, I connect innovation in extreme contexts with research {{on social and}} purposeful innovation. But while the literature attributes social innovation to <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs,</b> we know little about how <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> themselves view innovation. Questions that arise: How do <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> conceptualize innovation broadly and specifically under extreme contexts marked by institutional voids and resource scarcity? I explore these questions using qualitative, descriptive and analytical methods by studying two communities of globally networked and formally recognized <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs.</b> Analysis is at meso level of innovation and value chains but observations are at micro level through document analysis, interviews, and observations. I reveal perceptions by <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> on conceptual drivers, determinants and key features of innovation. The findings help organizational theorists to frame models of innovation to understand innovation among <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> broadly and in extreme contexts. In contrast to social innovation presented in current literature, I find innovation among <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> {{is viewed as a}} disparate range of understandings that stem from varied motivations, means and outcomes related to social concerns as well as user, efficiency, and challenge concerns. I further find that <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> turn to a mix of technology, social, and institutional innovations to deal with, make use of, or overcome constraints. The varied concerns and approaches to innovation can be condensed using the construct of 'frugal innovation' which helps provide some cohesion to the seemingly disparate notions of innovation among <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs.</b> I build propositions from the findings and suggest models of innovation that help develop a theory of frugal innovation with implications and lessons relevant for theory, practice, policy and future research.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} review of 50 empirical {{studies on the}} social entrepreneurial personality. We aim to answer ‘who <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> are’ to help understand why certain individuals but not others create social ventures and persist in their choice. The review findings reveal a focus on four distinct aspects of personality: motivations, traits, identities, and skills; and are based on three approaches: describing the personality of <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs,</b> comparing them to another group, and relating personality aspects to outcomes such as strategic choices or performance. The findings offer a multi-dimensional and refined account of who <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> are. <b>Social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> are simultaneously driven by a range of motivations and values which include {{but are not limited}} to prosocial concerns. Certain extrinsic and intrinsic motivations are shared by commercial and <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs.</b> <b>Social</b> and commercial <b>entrepreneurs</b> also seem to exhibit similar ‘entrepreneurial’ personality traits and benefit equally from transformational leadership skills. Emerging research points to further distinct ‘social traits’ and identities. Important avenues for future research include paying attention to heterogeneity among types of <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs,</b> encouraging more theory-based research, research relating personality to personal and venture-level outcomes, research that considers more dynamic and contextualized perspectives, as well as research on a potential dark side of the social entrepreneurial personality...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} a {{theoretical}} framework for evaluating the logic behind social entrepreneurship through linking its possible causal, motivational, behavioral and directive dimensions in Zimbabwe. The paper develops various theoretical and empirical motivations for <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> when {{the state and the}} businesses fail to address human needs. The paper addresses the following questions; Why do we need <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs?.</b> What areas are addressed by <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs?</b> How do <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> create value?. <b>Social</b> entrepreneurship may be considered as a response to either business failure, state failure, or both. The role of <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> is salient not only when such failures occur in the developing world but also the developed world. Whereas traditional entrepreneurs occasionally formulate needs to which they proffer solutions, <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> address existing societal needs to which they provide workable solutions. The point of dispute is whether being a non profit entity violates Schumpeter's assumptions about the designated role of an entrepreneur, who is depicted primarily as an economic actor (Schumpeter, 1947). I refer to Boschee and McClurg (2003) they emphatically state that the ultimate goal of independence for <b>social</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> requires generating enough revenue to cover operations. One would argue that the social entrepreneurs' focus on improving society is also a form of creative destruction. Since they aim for social betterment, they use their creativity to help destroy barriers to well being such as disillusionment, disenfranchisement and disorganization among those in grim social situations...|$|R
