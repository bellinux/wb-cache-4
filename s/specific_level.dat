5|$|The game {{supports}} {{up to six}} {{human or}} artificial intelligence players in local and online multiplayer, except on the PlayStation 4, which has a human player limit of four per console. Videoball has team and ranked matchmaking multiplayer modes. There is no set practice game mode, but players can train against computer-controlled opponents in exhibition matches and the scenario-based Arcade mode, in which the player faces two computer-controlled opponents in <b>specific</b> <b>level</b> configurations. The Arcade mode artificial intelligence personalities each have fitting names, such as Homer (who stays near its endzone) and Punchy (who bullies players with projectiles). Some work in pairs to establish gameplay concepts, such as Tippy, who passes the ball to Toppy, who maintains {{the top of the}} field.|$|E
5|$|With dive tables, it is {{generally}} assumed that the dive profile is a square dive, meaning that the diver descends to maximum depth immediately and stays at the same depth until resurfacing (approximating a rectangular outline when drawn in a coordinate system where one axis is depth {{and the other is}} duration). Some dive tables also assume physical condition or acceptance of a <b>specific</b> <b>level</b> of risk from the diver. Some recreational tables only provide for no-stop dives at sea level sites, but the more complete tables can take into account staged decompression dives and dives performed at altitude.|$|E

25|$|An {{employer}} cannot dismiss, lay off, demote or transfer a {{staff member}} on the sole account of his being exclusively French-speaking or of possessing insufficient knowledge of a non-official language, or because that member demanded the respect of his right to work in French. As a job requirement, knowledge or a <b>specific</b> <b>level</b> of knowledge of a language other than French is prohibited, unless {{the nature of the}} duties require it.|$|E
25|$|Prepayment/reinvestment/early amortization: The {{majority}} of revolving ABS {{are subject to}} some degree of early amortization risk. The risk stems from specific early amortization events or payout events that cause the security to be paid off prematurely. Typically, payout events include insufficient payments from the underlying borrowers, insufficient excess spread, {{a rise in the}} default rate on the underlying loans above a specified level, a decrease in credit enhancements below a <b>specific</b> <b>level,</b> and bankruptcy {{on the part of the}} sponsor or servicer.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} of strong reciprocity is in allocating {{property rights and}} ownership structure. Joint ownership of property can be {{very similar to the}} public goods game, where owners can independently contribute to the common pool, which then returns on the investment and is evenly distributed to all parties. This ownership structure is subject to the tragedy of the commons, in which if all the parties are self-interested, no one will invest. Alternatively, property could be allocated in an owner and employee relationship, in which an employee is hired by the owner and paid a specific wage for a <b>specific</b> <b>level</b> of investment. Experimental studies show that participants generally prefer joint ownership, and do better under joint ownership than in the owner employee organization.|$|E

25|$|There {{are eight}} clades of Symbiodinium phylotypes. Most {{research}} has been completed on the Symbiodinium clades A–D. Each {{one of the eight}} contributes their own benefits as well as less compatible attributes to the survival of their coral hosts. Each photosynthetic organism has a <b>specific</b> <b>level</b> of sensitivity to photodamage of compounds needed for survival, such as proteins. Rates of regeneration and replication determine the organism's ability to survive. Phylotype A is found more in the shallow regions of marine waters. It is able to produce mycosporine-like amino acids that are UV resistant, using a derivative of glycerin to absorb the UV radiation and allowing them to become more receptive to warmer water temperatures. In the event of UV or thermal damage, if and when repair occurs, it will increase the likelihood of survival of the host and symbiont. This leads to the idea that, evolutionarily, clade A is more UV resistant and thermally resistant than the other clades.|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} in Mega Man Legends 2 is {{very similar}} to that of its predecessor and has a few changes. The player controls the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt in his explorations through ruins and fights against Reaverbots. The ruins, however, are from various islands in contrast to the prequel in which most ruins belonged to Kattelox Island. The player is able to travel to other islands with Roll's ship, the Flutter, although he can only enter certain islands by completing different missions. Unlike Mega Man Legends in which the player could enter to different ruins by having the approval of Kattelox's mayor, here the player must pass different tests in order to win Digger licenses from a <b>specific</b> <b>level.</b> The license allows Mega Man to enter into ruins which are forbidden to lower-class Diggers. Additionally, when winning a license, the Reaverbots' health is higher, but once they are destroyed, they drop more refractors' shards which are used in shops to buy items. Mega Man's interactions with other characters can also affect the character's state depending whether he is good with other people or makes them angry. Mega Man is also able to grab objects or people which help the player to complete missions. Mega Man can also suffer from special damage when fighting Reaverbots or touching fields that damage him such as lava. If the player equips Mega Man specific body part, he will become invulnerable to such states. Another addition is the underwater dungeon, in where the objects' weight is reduced and Mega Man can jump higher. The energy of the special weapons, which are developed by Roll using unusable items, are now shown in two energy bars, one green and one blue. The blue bar indicates how much energy the weapon has, while the green bar shows how much energy is consumed when the weapon is used.|$|E
500|$|Scales do {{not play}} an {{important}} role in distinguishing between the families but are important at generic and <b>specific</b> <b>level.</b> There is an elaborate scheme of nomenclature of scales. Scales patterns, by way of scale surface or texture, pattern and colouration [...] and the division of the anal plate, in combination with other morphological characteristics, [...] are the principal means of classifying snakes down to species level.|$|E

500|$|Several craft {{are also}} {{available}} when unlocked. Both the Millennium Falcon and a TIE interceptor are initially present in the craft selection screen. However, neither may be selected until the player enters the correct passcodes or achieves all bronze or silver medals, respectively, on the bonus levels. Two other craft can be unlocked, but each is confined to a <b>specific</b> <b>level.</b> One is the T-16 Skyhopper in [...] "Beggar's Canyon", and an AT-ST is playable in a basic demonstration level unlocked only via passcode. A playable model of a 1969 Buick Electra 225 based on a car owned by the game's sound designer, Rudolph Stember, is {{also included in the}} game as an Easter egg.|$|E

2500|$|Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is more {{specific}} for the diagnosis. Normal plicae circularis are variable in appearance and often not seen on normal VCUGs. [...] PUV on voiding cystourethrogram {{is characterized by}} an abrupt tapering of urethral caliber near the verumontanum, with the <b>specific</b> <b>level</b> depending on the developmental variant. Vesicoureteral reflux is also seen in over 50% of cases.|$|E
2500|$|Development of Bloodborne {{began as}} {{development}} was being completed on the Prepare to Die edition of Dark Souls, released in August 2012. Sony Computer Entertainment approached FromSoftware concerning cooperative development on a title, and director Hidetaka Miyazaki {{asked about the}} possibility of developing a game for eighth-generation consoles. The concept of Bloodborne developed from there. There were no connections to FromSoftware's previous titles, even though Miyazaki conceded that it [...] "carries the DNA of Demon's Souls and its very <b>specific</b> <b>level</b> design". Development ran parallel to that of Dark Souls II.|$|E
2500|$|Markov {{chains are}} {{generally}} used in describing path-dependent arguments, where current structural configurations condition future outcomes. An {{example is the}} reformulation of the idea, originally due to Karl Marx's Das Kapital, tying economic development {{to the rise of}} capitalism. In current research, it is common to use a Markov chain [...] to model how once a country reaches a <b>specific</b> <b>level</b> of economic development, the configuration of structural factors, such as size of the middle class, the ratio of urban to rural residence, the rate of political mobilization, etc., will generate a higher probability of transitioning from authoritarian to democratic regime.|$|E
50|$|Related to {{this notion}} {{is the term}} program engagement, which {{is the extent to}} which {{consumers}} recall specific content after exposure to a program and advertising.

40|$|A model {{framework}} is developed to solve capacity planning {{problems that are}} faced by many perinatal networks in the UK. We propose a loss network model with overflow based on a continuous time Markov chain for a perinatal network with specific application to a network in London. We derive the steady state expressions for overflow and rejection probabilities for each neonatal unit of the network {{on the basis of}} a decomposition approach. Results obtained from the model are very close to observed values. Using the model, decisions on numbers of cots can be made for <b>specific</b> <b>levels</b> of admission acceptance probabilities for each level of care at each neonatal unit of the network and <b>specific</b> <b>levels</b> of overflow to temporary care...|$|R
2500|$|Fig. 4 is a [...] "space-filling" [...] {{representation}} of formic acid, where atoms are drawn as solid spheres {{to suggest the}} space they occupy. This and all space-filling models are necessarily icons or abstractions: [...] atoms are nuclei with electron [...] "clouds" [...] of varying density surrounding them, and as such have no actual surfaces. For many years the size of atoms has been approximated by physical models (CPK) in which the volumes of plastic balls describe {{where much of the}} electron density is to be found (often sized to van der Waals radii). That is, the surface of these models is meant to represent a <b>specific</b> <b>level</b> of density of the electron cloud, not any putative physical surface of the atom.|$|E
2500|$|The {{parameter}} [...] {{represents the}} item location which, {{in the case}} of attainment testing, {{is referred to as the}} item difficulty. It is the point on [...] where the IRF has its maximum slope, and where the value is half-way between the minimum value of [...] and the maximum value of 1. The example item is of medium difficulty since =0.0, which is near the center of the distribution. Note that this model scales the item's difficulty and the person's trait onto the same continuum. Thus, it is valid to talk about an item being about as hard as Person A's trait level or of a person's trait level being about the same as Item Y's difficulty, in the sense that successful performance of the task involved with an item reflects a <b>specific</b> <b>level</b> of ability.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Nintendo {{released}} an enhanced Super Nintendo Entertainment System compilation titled Super Mario All-Stars. It includes the Super Mario Bros. games released for the Famicom/NES. The version of Super Mario Bros. 2 {{included in the}} compilation has improved graphics and sound to match the Super NES's 16-bit capabilities, as well as minor alterations in some collision mechanics. It is possible to change the character after losing a single life, while the original version allows changing it only after completing a level or when the player loses all their lives and chooses [...] "Continue", making the game more forgiving when choosing a character not adept at some <b>specific</b> <b>level.</b> The player begins with five lives instead of three, and the slot game gains an additional bonus: if the player obtains three sevens, the player wins 10 lives. The player will also win three additional coins if they obtain a seven {{in the second and}} third reels, although they only have this opportunity once per level.|$|E
40|$|Facing {{the general}} {{election}} in 2013, {{the level of the}} income tax is a major issue of the economic policy debate in Germany. The paper presents data on the income tax burden in the period 1958 - 2012. The data refer to <b>specific</b> <b>levels</b> of real income as well as to <b>specific</b> <b>levels</b> of income in relation to the income on average. It turns out that the discretionary changes of the income tax rates since 1958 did not suffice to avoid an increase of the marginal tax rates for typical taxpayers. As to the average tax rates, the picture is a bit different; low income earners realized a small decrease of their tax rates if their real income did not rise...|$|R
50|$|TUMIKI Fighters {{was first}} {{released}} in 2004. It {{is written in}} the D programming language, with graphics drawn with OpenGL.
