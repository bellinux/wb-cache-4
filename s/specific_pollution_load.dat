The difficulties and chances to reduce <b>pollution</b> <b>loads</b> of combined municipal sewage and urban stormwater discharges are discussed. Major obstacles behind a poor sewage infrastructure in Palestine were identified as the followings: insensitive Israeli environmental policy now and during the past period of occupation, lack of financial and technical human resources, and insufficient maintenance of sewage facilities, poor environmental awareness, and commitment. The result is a severe negative environmental impact on the aquatic environment and public health. Through personal contacts, actual data on the sewage infrastructure facilities of three representative large cities in the West Bank (Jenin, Albireh, and Hebron) are presented and discussed. By 2005, about 255, 000 inhabitants will be living in the three selected Palestinian large cities (Jenin, Albireh, and Hebron).

40|$|The {{estimation}} of non-point source <b>pollution</b> <b>loads</b> into the Danjiangkou Reservoir is highly significant to environmental {{protection in the}} watershed. In order to overcome the drawbacks of traditional watershed numerical models, a base flow separation method was established coupled with a digital filtering method and a flux method. The digital filtering method {{has been used to}} separate the base flows of the Hanjiang, Tianhe, Duhe, Danjiang, Laoguan, and Qihe rivers. Based on daily discharge, base flow, and pollutant concentration data, the flux method was used to calculate the point source <b>pollution</b> <b>load</b> and non-point source <b>pollution</b> <b>load.</b> The results show that: (1) In the year 2013, the total inflow of the six rivers mentioned above accounted for 95. 9 % of the total inflow to the Danjiangkou Reservoir. The total <b>pollution</b> <b>loads</b> of chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and total phosphorus (TP) from the six rivers were 58. 20  ×  103  t and 1. 863  ×  103  t, respectively, and the non-point source <b>pollution</b> <b>loads</b> were 39. 82  ×  103  t and 1. 544  ×  103  t, respectively, indicating that the non-point source pollution is a major factor (with a contribution rate of 68. 4 % for CODMn and 82. 9 % for TP).
