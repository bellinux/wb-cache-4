40|$|Two {{recently}} published case-control studies have highlighted {{the possibility of}} an association between the development of cutaneous malignant melanoma and exposure to <b>sunlamps</b> and sunbeds. Little is known about the behaviour patterns with regard to exposure to <b>sunlamps</b> and sunbeds in Western Europe. This descriptive study compares usage patterns of <b>sunlamps</b> and sunbeds of melanoma patients with the general population in Belgium. Evidence is given that melanoma patients are greater users of artificial ultraviolet sources than the general population, and that the incidence of melanoma in different geographical areas increases proportional to the percentage of people using tanning devices. Although this descriptive study may well be biased or refuted, it does advocate the need for further epidemiological research addressing specifically the issue of melanoma and exposure to artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation.

40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} suppresses certain immunologic responses, such as {{contact hypersensitivity}} (CH). Some previous studies, using <b>sunlamps</b> emitting nonsolar-spectrum UV or excessive UV doses, {{have questioned the}} ability of sunscreens to prevent UV-induced immune suppression. Our study evaluated the immune protection capacities of commercial sunscreen lotions {{in relation to the}} effects of UV spectrum and dose. C 3 H mice were exposed to a fixed UV dose from Kodacel-filtered FS <b>sunlamps</b> that caused maximum Langerhans cell depletion and suppression of CH. Kodacel film blocks UV energy below 290 nm, thus eliminating immune-suppressive effects of UVC (200 - 290 nm) not present in sunlight. CH was equally suppressed in unprotected and placebo-lotion-treated, UV-exposed mice. Mice protected with sun protection factor (SPF) - 15 and SPF- 30 sunscreens mounted normal CH responses. SPF- 4 and SPF- 8 sunscreen-protected mice had CH responses significantly greater than those of unprotected mice. Direct effects of UV spectral differences on the immune protection value of an SPF- 15 sunscreen were determined by exposing mice to UV radiation from unfiltered and Kodacel-filtered <b>sunlamps</b> and a 1000 -W xenon lamp solar simulator (UV spectrum nearly equivalent to sunlight). The sunscreen immune protection value was 30 times the minimum immune suppression dose for the solar simulator, while being 7. 5 times this dose for Kodacel-filtered and 2 times the dose for unfiltered <b>sunlamps.</b> These results demonstrate that commercial sunscreen lotions prevent UV-induced immune suppression at a level exceeding the labeled SPF when tested with an environmentally relevant UV source...|$|R

50|$|The Dread Council became {{concerned}} {{at the lack}} of contact from Servitor Zom and contacted Vek to ask about Zoms whereabouts. Vek admitted he had killed Zom to protect the human race and that the judgement that humanity deserved to die was wrong. The Dread Council vowed that Vek would die for his crimes and they sent a trio of assassins, the Deathlords, to kill Vek. Their combined energiser rings proved too strong for his ring and it was destroyed and he was injured in the process but managed to escape {{in the form of a}} dog. However, as his condition worsened he was trapped in dog form, only managing to warp his head back to Noxian form. However, with the help of Mrs West and her son Nick, he was healed with a <b>sunlamp.</b> The Deathlords had set up a shield around Bradfield to stop Vek escaping and decided to use his love of humanity to lure him out. They sent hypnotic waves all over the town to force the people to walk into the shield which killed them. Vek went to the centre point of the shield and found the energiser ring which was producing it. A deathlord was waiting for him but Vek managed to reach the ring first by throwing bricks from a chimney at the deathlord, knocking him over and giving Vek enough time to use the ring to kill the deathlord and deactivate the shield. He then disappeared for a few months giving the deathlords no idea of how to find him (although there is no explanation as to why they couldnt track him through the energiser). However at a New Year party Vek was unable to maintain the human form he was in and the deathlords began the chase once again. This was the first time that teleportation was revealed as possible. The deathlords found him but Vek also managed to teleport and escape. Eventually they grew tired of the chase and decided to lure him out. They killed 104 humans on a motorway and then sent a message to Vek that the next day they would kill 10000 if he did not surrender. Vek realised that if they continued they would eventually destroy humanity by killing an ever increasing number of people, so he decided that he must face them. However he cleverly chose the battleground as Stonehenge. He was able to send an energy bolt ricochetting round the ancient stones which eventually struck a deathlord and killed him. The remaining deathlord attacked with an energiser beam that was stronger than the shield produced by Veks energiser. Realising he was doomed unless he acted, Vek teleported to hide behind a stone and immediately sent another bolt through the stone which killed the last remaining deathlord. He kept the deathlords ring as extra weaponry, fully aware that other assassins would be sent.Vek appeared on global television and explained the Noxian ethical code and the Deathlords, pointing out that now he was all that stood between humanity and execution, and how he had rebelled against Nox to protect them. This marked a turning-point in human attitude towards Doomlord; as he repeatedly protected Earth from various external threats, Vek became an ally of the British government through Cabinet minister Douglas Reeve, and even a respected and admired hero.|$|E
40|$|Exposure to {{ultraviolet}} radiation has consistently {{been linked to}} {{an increased risk of}} melanoma. Epidemiologic studies are susceptible to measurement error, which can distort the magnitude of observed effects. Although the reliability of self-report of many sun exposure factors has been previously described in several studies, self-report of use of artificial tanning devices and self-tanning creams has been less well characterized. A mailed survey was re-administered 2 – 4 weeks after completion of the initial survey to 76 randomly selected participants in a case-control study of melanoma. Cases and controls were individuals diagnosed in 1999 and 2000 who were ascertained from the Iowa Cancer Registry in 2002. We assessed the consistency of self-reported use of <b>sunlamps</b> and self-tanning creams, sun sensitivity, andhistory of sunburns. There was substantial reliability in reporting the use of <b>sunlamps</b> or self-tanning creams (cases: Kappa (κ) = 1. 0 for both exposures; controls: κ = 0. 71 and 0. 87, respectively). κ estimates of 0. 62 – 0. 78 were found for overall reliability of several sun sensitivity factors. Overall, the survey instrument demonstrated substantial reproducibility for factors related to the use of <b>sunlamps</b> or tanning beds, self-tanning creams, and sun sensitivity factors...|$|R
40|$|The study {{objective}} was to assess whether exposure to <b>sunlamps</b> and sunbeds represents {{a risk factor for}} cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). A 1 ‐to‐ 1 unmatched case‐control study was conducted among subjects 20 years old or more with naturally non‐pigmented skin in Germany, France and Belgium. A total of 420 consecutive patients with CMM diagnosed from I January 1991 onward were derived from hospital registers; 447 controls with no history of skin cancer were chosen at random in the same municipality as the cases. Exposure to <b>sunlamps</b> or sunbeds starting before 1960 is associated with a crude estimated risk of CMM of 2. 71 (95 % CI: 1. 06 ‐ 7. 78) for at least 10 hr of accumulated exposure. This risk is of 2. 12 (95 % CI: 0. 84 ‐ 5. 37) after adjustment for age, sex, hair colour and average number of holiday weeks each year in sunny resorts. Subjects who experienced skin‐burn due to <b>sunlamps</b> or sunbeds, and who had accumulated at least 10 hr of exposure, displayed a crude estimated CMM risk of 4. 47 (95 % CI: 1. 45 ‐ 13. 7), which rose to 8. 97 (95 % CI: 2. 10 ‐ 38. 6) for those who exposed their skin for tanning purposes. The risk associated with skin‐bum is only marginally modified after multiple adjustments for host characteristics and recreational exposure to sunlight. Apparently, <b>sunlamps</b> and sunbeds share the increased risk of CMM, which seems to concentrate in subjects exhibiting hazardous behaviour towards ultraviolet radiation sources. However, although it is reasonable to believe that high doses of pure ultraviolet A radiation can be dangerous, this is not firmly established by this study. Most exposures to ultraviolet A tanning devices began after 1980; therefore, epidemiologic studies have difficulty in revealing any increase in risk of CMM starting after 1980 because of the latent period between exposure and occurrence of melanoma. Public health authorities should have a cautious approach towards the rapidly developing fashion of tanning under <b>sunlamps</b> or sunbeds. Copyright © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
