5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that suggests that a few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a <b>supergene</b> {{for the development of}} butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics. The Batesian mimicry in Papilio polytes is controlled by the doublesex gene.|$|E

5000|$|Classically, <b>supergenes</b> were {{hypothesized}} to have evolved from less tightly-linked genes coming together via chromosomal rearrangement or reduced crossing over, due to selection for particular multilocus phenotypes.

50|$|The {{book reviews}} the {{background}} and key elements of Hamilton's inclusive fitness theory from the 1960s onwards, setting out its significant conceptual and heuristic value. Holland notes that Hamilton acknowledged that his earliest and most widely known account (1964) contained technical inaccuracies. He also notes Hamilton's early speculations about possible proximate mechanisms of the expression of social behavior (<b>supergenes</b> as a possible alternative to behaviour-evoking-situations) contained errors that have nevertheless remained very influential in popular accounts. Specifically, the <b>supergenes</b> notion (sometimes called the Green-beard effect) - that organisms may evolve genes {{that are able to}} identify identical copies in others and preferentially direct social behaviours towards them - was theoretically clarified and withdrawn by Hamilton in 1987. However, in the intervening years, the notion that <b>supergenes</b> (or more often, simply individual organisms) have evolved to identify genetic relatives and preferentially cooperate with them took hold, and became the way many biologists came to understand the theory. This persisted, despite Hamilton's 1987 correction. In Holland's view it is the pervasiveness of this longstanding but erroneous perspective, and the suppression of the alternative 'behaviour-evoking-situations' perspective regarding social expression mechanisms, that is largely responsible for the ongoing clash between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship.|$|R
25|$|However, today {{many believe}} {{it more likely}} that the genes start on the same chromosome. They argue that <b>supergenes</b> arose in situ. This is known as Turner's sieve hypothesis. John Maynard Smith agreed with this view in his {{authoritative}} textbook, but the question is still not definitively settled.|$|R
25|$|Whereas a {{gene family}} (several tightly linked genes {{performing}} similar or identical functions) arises by duplication {{of a single}} original gene, this is usually {{not the case with}} supergenes. In a <b>supergene</b> some of the constituent genes have quite distinct functions, so they must have come together under selection. This process might involve suppression of crossing-over, translocation of chromosome fragments and possibly occasional cistron duplication. That crossing-over can be suppressed by selection has been known for many years.|$|E
25|$|Epistasis {{occurs when}} the {{expression}} of one gene is modified by another gene. For example, gene A only shows its effect when allele B1 (at another Locus) is present, but not if it is absent. This {{is one of the}} ways in which two or more genes may combine to produce a coordinated change in more than one characteristic (for instance, in mimicry). Unlike the <b>supergene,</b> epistatic genes do not need to be closely linked or even on the same chromosome.|$|E

25|$|Although a {{polymorphism}} can {{be controlled}} by alleles at a single locus (e.g. human ABO blood groups), the more complex forms are controlled by <b>supergenes</b> consisting of several tightly linked genes on a single chromosome.

There is a long-standing debate as to how this situation could have arisen, {{and the question is}} not yet resolved.|$|R
40|$|DNA microarrays {{have contributed}} to the {{exponential}} growth of genomic and experimental data in the last decade. This large amount of gene expression data has been used by researchers seeking diagnosis of diseases like cancer using machine learning methods. In turn, explicit biological knowledge about gene functions has also grown tremendously over the last decade. This work integrates explicit biological knowledge, provided as gene sets, into the classication process by means of Variable Precision Rough Set Theory (VPRS). The proposed model is able to highlight which part of the provided biological knowledge has been important for classification. This paper presents a novel model for microarray data classification which is able to incorporate prior biological knowledge in the form of gene sets. Based on this knowledge, we transform the input microarray data into <b>supergenes,</b> and then we apply rough set theory to select the most promising <b>supergenes</b> and to derive a set of easy interpretable classification rules. The proposed model is evaluated over three breast cancer microarrays datasets obtaining successful results compared to classical classification techniques. The experimental results shows that there are not significant differences between our model and classical techniques but it is able to provide a biological-interpretable explanation of how it classifies new samples...|$|R
5000|$|Most people, {{following}} J.R.G. Turner, therefore {{argue that}} <b>supergenes</b> arose in situ due to selection for correlated and epistatic traits, which {{just happened to}} have been possible to select via the existence of suitable loci {{closely linked to the}} original variant. [...] Turner calls this a [...] "sieve" [...] explanation, and the Turner explanation might be called the [...] "Turner sieve" [...] hypothesis. Maynard Smith agreed with this view in his authoritative textbook. Nevertheless, the question is not definitively settled. The problem is connected to an even larger question, the evolution of evolvability.|$|R

Vector control tools that target indoor-resting mosquitoes, such as bednets and insecticides, are currently the cornerstone of malaria control in Africa.

The 2 La inversion is a major and previously unappreciated component of the natural malaria transmission system in Africa, influencing both malaria susceptibility and vector behavior...|$|R
50|$|The {{case for}} the {{accumulative}} origin for <b>supergenes</b> was originally {{based on the work}} of Nabours on polymorphism for colour and pattern in Grouse Locusts (Tetrigidae). In Acridium arenosum the colour-patterns are controlled by thirteen genes on the same chromosome, which reassort (recombine) fairly easily. They also occur in Apotettix eurycephalus where they form two tightly linked groups, between which there is 7% crossing-over. Furthermore, in Paratettix texanus there appears to be complete suppression of crossing-over among 24 out of 25 of the colour-pattern genes, which can be distinguished by comparing their effects with those found in other species. Analysis of Nabour's data by Darlington & Mather concluded that the genes responsible for the morphs of Paratettix texanus have been gradually aggregated into a group which acts as a single switch-mechanism. This explanation was accepted by E.B. Ford and incorporated into his accounts of ecological genetics.|$|R

40|$|The iconic {{gastropod}} genus Cyphoma {{is commonly}} {{observed in the}} Caribbean, where it lives in association with various octocorallian hosts. Each species in the genus Cyphoma has a unique, characteristic mantle pattern and colouration, which separates the valid taxa. Because of its abundance and recognisability Cyphoma gibbosum {{has been used as}} a model organism in several studies concerning allelochemicals, reef degradation, and physical defence mechanisms. Molecular analyses based on four molecular markers (COI, 16 S, H 3 and 28 S) for three Cyphoma species (C. gibbosum, C. mcgintyi, C.  signatum) and an unidentified black morph, collected from three localities in the Caribbean, show that they represent morphological varieties of a single, genetically homogeneous species. This outcome is in agreement with previous anatomical studies. As a result C. mcgintyi and C. signatum are synonymised with C. gibbosum, which is a key result for future work using C. gibbosum as a model organism. The striking morphological differences in mantle pattern and colouration are hypothesised to be the result of one of three possible scenarios: rapid divergence, <b>supergenes</b> (including balanced polymorphism), or incipient speciation...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the large}} {{variability}} in survival times between cancer patients and the plethora of genes on microarrays unrelated to outcome, building accurate prediction models {{that are easy to}} interpret remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a general strategy for improving performance and interpretability of prediction models by integrating gene expression data with prior biological knowledge. First, we link gene identifiers in expression dataset with gene annotation databases such as Gene Ontology (GO). Then we construct “supergenes ” for each gene category by summarizing information from genes related to outcome using a modified principal component analysis (PCA) method. Finally, instead of using genes as predictors, we use these <b>supergenes</b> representing information from each gene category as predictors to predict survival outcome. In addition to identifying gene categories associated with outcome, the proposed approach also carries out additional within-category selection to select important genes within each gene set. We show, using two real breast cancer microarray datasets, that the prediction models constructed based on gene sets (or pathway) information outperform the prediction models based on expression values of single genes, with improved prediction accuracy and interpretability...|$|R
40|$|F(1) hybrid {{sterility}} and ``hybrid breakdown'' of F(2) and later generations in rice (Oryza sativa L.) are common and genetically complicated. We used a {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} linkage map and F(4) progeny testing to investigate {{hybrid sterility}} and hybrid breakdown in {{a cross between}} ``widely compatible'' O. sativa ssp. japonica cultivar Lemont from the Southern U. S. and ssp. indica cultivar Teqing from China. Our results implicate different genetic mechanisms in hybrid sterility and hybrid breakdown, respectively. Hybrid sterility appeared to be due to recombination within a number of putative differentiated ``supergenes'' in the rice genome, which may reflect cryptic structural rearrangements. The cytoplasmic genome had a large effect on fertility of both male and female gametes in the F(1) hybrids. There appeared to be a pair of complementary genes that behaved like ``wide compatibility'' genes. This pair of genes and the ``gamete eliminator'' (S(1)) or ``egg killer'' (S- 5) may influence the phenotypic effects of presumed <b>supergenes</b> in hybrids. Hybrid breakdown appeared to be largely due to incompatibilities between indica and japonica alleles at many unlinked epistatic loci in the genome. These proposed mechanisms may partly account for the complicated nature of postreproductive barriers in rice...|$|R

40|$|Intraspecific {{variation}} in social organization is common, yet {{the underlying causes}} are rarely known. An exception is the fire ant Solenopsis invicta in which the existence of two distinct forms of social colony organization is {{under the control of}} the two variants of a pair of social chromosomes, SB and Sb. Colonies containing exclusively SB/SB workers accept only one single queen and she must be SB/SB. By contrast, when colonies contain more than 10 % of SB/Sb workers, they accept several queens but only SB/Sb queens. The variants of the social chromosome are associated with several additional important phenotypic differences, including the size, fecundity and dispersal strategies of queens, aggressiveness of workers, and sperm count in males. However, little is known about whether social chromosome variants affect fitness in other life stages. Here, we perform experiments to determine whether differential selection occurs during development and in adult workers. We find evidence that the Sb variant of the social chromosome increases the likelihood of female brood to develop into queens and that adult SB/Sb workers, the workers that cull SB/SB queens, are overrepresented in comparison to SB/SB workers. This demonstrates that <b>supergenes</b> such as the social chromosome can have complex effects on phenotypes at various stages of development...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} discussed if evolutionary novelties {{are caused by}} novel genes or by cooption of existing genes and pathways. This thesis highlights de novo acquisition of novelty via endosymbiosis as well as novelty by combination of existing material through co-option of genes and by homologous recombination of the genome. Chapter 1 summarizes {{the present state of}} the art in the study of evolutionary novelty. The chapter introduces into the holobiont concept and the potential of endosymbiotic bacteria for host evolution. Moreover it gives an overview of sex determination systems in insects and an introduction into the conserved sex determination gene doublesex, which is investigated in Chapter 3 in detail. Furthermore, an overview of meiotic recombination and genetic linkage mapping is given, thereby providing an introduction for Chapter 4. The Chapter concludes with the introduction into the model organism Cardiocondyla obscurior and the ergatoid male morph, an evolutionary novelty of the genus Cardiocondyla. In Chapter 2 a novel endosymbiotic bacterium, "Candidatus Westeberhardia cardiocondylae", and its interaction with the host C. obscurior is described. Severe genome reduction and the localization in bacteriomes during the pupal stage strongly suggest a mutualistic nature of the symbiosis. Metabolic pathway analysis of the streamlined Westeberhardia genome together with increasing Westeberhardia titers in pupae suggest that Westeberhardia provides the host with the tyrosine-precursor 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which may be important for cuticle buildup during development. Thus, Westeberhardia putatively provides novel traits to the host, thereby facilitating adaptation of C. obscurior to novel, arboreal and nutrient-poor habitats. The detection of a Westeberhardia-free host population will allow for elucidating the symbiosis further in the future. The study presented in Chapter 3 introduces the concept of co-option to explain the mechanistic basis of polyphenism in social insects. We show that doublesex and other sex-specifically expressed genes are co-opted into female caste and male morph differentiation of C. obscurior. We hypothesize that this principle is a general patternof caste-differentiation in eusocial insects and thus of one of the major transitions in evolution. Chapter 4 addresses homologous recombination in C. obscurior. Recombination of existing loci is able to generate new genotypes and thus new selectable phenotypes much more rapidly than mutations, due to Hill-Robertson-Interference. During this study {{it became clear that the}} interaction between homologous recombination and transposable elements could have led to chromosomal rearrangements within the two studied C. obscurior populations. While rekombination is impeded in regions with high abundance of TEs, regions of high local recombination rates show high levels of genetic divergence between the Brazilian and the Japanese C. obscurior population. Thus recombination is an important player in shaping the C. obscurior genome and likely drives divergence between the two C. obscurior populations. In Chapter 5 the analysis of the C. obscurior holobiont is pursued and discussed in detail. In addition to Westeberhardia, the host C. obscurior also harbors Wolbachia. An overview of the current knowledge about Wolbachia in C. obscurior is given, the potential for possible symbiont-symbiont interaction in the host is discussed und the importance of C. obscurior endosymbionts in the study of the host species is pointed out. Furthermore, an overview of C. obscurior sex determination and the evolution of sex determination systems is given, with a special emphasis on social insects and C. obscurior. Lastly, the evolutionary significance of recombination in this species is discussed in the light of recent findings of <b>supergenes</b> (linked loci with low recombination) in other species. Finally, an outlook on future research on C. obscurior is provided...|$|R
5000|$|This unique puzzle led to {{proposal}} {{of a possible}} <b>supergene.</b> A <b>supergene</b> is a tight cluster of loci that facilitate the co-segregation of adaptive variation, providing integrated control of complex adaptive phenotypes.
