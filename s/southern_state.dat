5|$|According to {{annual average}} daily traffic counts {{compiled}} by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in 2011, the most-traveled part of the parkway is the section north of the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> Parkway. This portion carries an average of 106,800 vehicles daily, with the segment between Zeckendorf Boulevard and Old Country Road serving the most at 139,500 vehicles per day. South of the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> Parkway, the Meadowbrook Parkway sees only {{an average of about}} 54,000 vehicles daily. The busiest part in this stretch lies between the Babylon Turnpike and the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> Parkway, which handles 95,600 vehicles on an average day. The section between the Ocean and Loop parkways is the least-traveled part of the Meadowbrook Parkway, as only 15,400 vehicles use the segment per day on average, although as the gateway to Jones Beach, it is busily traveled during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|According to {{annual average}} daily traffic counts {{compiled}} in 2011 by NYSDOT, the most-traveled stretch of the Sagtikos State Parkway was the portion between the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> Parkway and the Long Island Expressway. The part between the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> and Pine Aire Drive handled an average of 87,250 vehicles per day; slightly lower numbers were recorded along the segment between Pine Aire Drive and the Long Island Expressway, with roughly 85,300 vehicles using the section on a daily basis. The portion between the Long Island Expressway and the Northern State Parkway carries an average of 67,600 vehicles per day. All three segments saw a rise in traffic {{over the course of}} the previous decade, with the Pine Aire Drive–Long Island Expressway segment gaining 14,000 vehicles per day during that time.|$|E

5|$|The Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, a {{study of}} how to handle Long Island traffic issues in 2020, was started in 1997 by {{engineers}} from NYSDOT. The preferred alternative in the study would widen several parkways on the island, inserting high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) for buses and carpools. The Meadowbrook would receive a new HOV lane between the Southern and Northern state parkways, while everything south of the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> Parkway would remain the same. The Northern State Parkway would get lanes from the Long Island Expressway to the Meadowbrook, and the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> would get lanes from the Meadowbrook to the Sunrise Highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{right-of-way}} {{on which}} the parkway was built had originally {{been part of a}} private road leading to Sagtikos Manor. The parkway was designed to have connections with the Sunken Meadow Spur (the future Sunken Meadow State Parkway) and the Captree State Parkway (now known as the Robert Moses Causeway) proposed by New York City highway engineer Robert Moses. On November13, 1949, a new interchange between the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> Parkway and Bay Shore Road was opened to traffic. This interchange would eventually serve as the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> Parkway's junction with the Sagtikos, Heckscher and Captree state parkways. Proposals conceived at this time called for grading on the new Sagtikos State Parkway to begin in early 1950.|$|E
5|$|At the {{northern}} edge of the park, the Meadowbrook enters exitM6, a partial cloverleaf interchange with several flyover ramps connecting to the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> Parkway. After the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> interchange, the Meadowbrook continues north through a narrow park known as Barnum Woods, which separates the heavily developed neighborhoods of Uniondale to the west and East Meadow to the east. The highway passes over NY102 (Front Street) with no connection before leaving Barnum Woods and bending northward near exitM5 and the northbound half of exitM4, which serve NY24 (Hempstead Turnpike) and several other local streets by way of a series of service roads in the vicinity of Eisenhower Park, Nassau Coliseum, and Mitchel Field. After another mile (1.6km), the Meadowbrook makes a turn to the west and enters exitM4 southbound and exitM3, which connect to Stewart Avenue (unsigned CR177) via Merchants Concourse. ExitM3 also serves Nassau Community College, located just southwest of the Meadowbrook Parkway.|$|E

A new interchange would also be constructed on the parkway between Pine Aire Drive and Campus Road, creating a junction with CR100. The project would cost $4billion (2011USD) and be built in phases for 15–20 years.|$|E

5|$|Moses {{announced}} {{during the}} opening of the Bethpage State Parkway in November 1936 that the land for extending the Meadowbrook from the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> Parkway to the Northern State Parkway had been acquired by Nassau County and plans for the road were being designed by the State Division of Highways. Moses stated that the funds would be requested at the next session of the New York State Legislature, with a completion date of 1939 to coincide with {{the opening of the}} 1939 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens. This would make it plausible for motorists to go from Flushing to Jones Beach State Park directly. The new extension would also alleviate congestion along several north–south highways in Nassau County and provide quicker access to Jones Beach. However, construction on the $10million (1956USD) highway was delayed until December 1953.|$|E
5|$|On October27, 1934, the Meadowbrook and Lido Beach Loop causeways {{were opened}} to {{vehicular}} traffic by LISPC.

The event {{was preceded by}} parades in Freeport and Rockville Centre. During a speech Moses cited praises to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for donating the money and letting the LISPC and Jones Beach State Parkway Authority do the work without interference. Other speakers that afternoon praised Moses and the LISPC, and New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia showed up late to give his congratulations. Despite the opening ceremony, two-way traffic was not permitted on the Meadowbrook between the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> and Merrick Road until June1, 1935. Prior to that time, motorists {{had to use the}} renamed Wantagh Causeway to access Jones Beach.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the <b>southern</b> <b>state</b> of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification {{mandated}} the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran {{for more than five years}} at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. By some accounts, Sholay was the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation.|$|E

5|$|The parkway was {{proposed}} to help bridge {{a gap in}} the eastern part of the Long Island Parkway system. Construction began in 1949 with the opening of an interchange between Bay Shore Road and the <b>Southern</b> <b>State</b> Parkway. Work on the parkway itself began the following year, with plans calling for connections to three spurs: the Captree State Parkway (now Robert Moses Causeway), the Sunken Meadow Spur (Sunken Meadow State Parkway), and the Heckscher Spur (Heckscher State Parkway). The parkway was completed in 1952, closing the highway loop on Long Island. In 2001, a study by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) called for the Sagtikos State Parkway to be widened to include new bus and carpool lanes from end to end.|$|E
5|$|While the war {{was still}} being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician, {{bringing}} together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the <b>Southern</b> <b>state</b> of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party.|$|E

5|$|Women shamans {{played an}} {{important}} role in this tradition, which was particularly strong in the <b>southern</b> <b>state</b> of Chu. Early Taoist movements developed their own institution in contrast to shamanism, but absorbed basic shamanic elements. Shamans revealed basic texts of Taoism from early times down to at least the 20th century. Institutional orders of Taoism evolved in various strains that in more recent times are conventionally grouped into two main branches: Quanzhen Taoism and Zhengyi Taoism. After Laozi and Zhuangzi, the literature of Taoism grew steadily and was compiled in form of a canon—the Daozang—which was published at the behest of the emperor. Throughout Chinese history, Taoism was nominated several times as a state religion. After the 17th century, however, it fell from favor.|$|E
5|$|After the {{foundation}} and success of the American School for the Deaf, many other institutions for the deaf were founded throughout the country. Since schools, particularly in the South, were segregated, many Southern states created separate schools or departments for Black deaf children. The first school established for Black deaf children below the Mason–Dixon line opened in the District of Columbia in 1857; it remained segregated until 1958. The last <b>Southern</b> <b>state</b> to create an institution for Black deaf children was Louisiana in 1938. Black deaf children became a language community isolated from White deaf children, with different means of language socialization, allowing for different dialects to develop. Because the education of White children was privileged over that of Black children, oralism—the prominent pedagogical method of the time—was not as strictly applied to the Black deaf students. Oralist methods often forbade the use of sign language, so Black deaf students had more opportunities to use ASL than did their White peers. Despite the decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, integration was slow to come. Schools for the deaf were no exception: the last desegregated in 1978, 24 years after the decision.|$|E

Ma'dika Bombing, a leader from a <b>southern</b> <b>state,</b> approached Tiku for his assistance. A month after the messengers had dispersed, the leaders gathered at Gowa to make a plan of action. The result was that the local lords were to stop warring amongst themselves and focus on the Dutch, who had superior strength; these internal conflicts, however, did not completely abate. By the time the meeting adjourned, the Dutch had already begun making advances on Luwu. Tiku, tasked with diverting the Dutch from the indefensible town of Rantepo, began to build his army and work on his defences.|$|E
