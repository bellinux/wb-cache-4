40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{is one of}} the {{variant of}} active remote sensing whereby it transmits energy and {{measures}} the return signal to obtain ground information. SAR is typically mounted on a moving platform such as an aircraft or a spacecraft. In this work, the SAR system is mounted on a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). One of the main obstacles faced by the UAV SAR is its instability during flight mission which causes motion errors. Theoretically, a SAR system modelling assumes that all flight path parameters (such as velocity, altitude and heading angle) are constants in generating SAR images. This would mean that ideally, the ground <b>sampling</b> <b>length</b> in between each transmission is also constant. However, this is never true in real case. These motion errors are mainly caused by wind turbulence, drag or limitations of the aircraft itself. Of all motion errors, one of the most unavoidable motion errors is the variance in velocity of the aircraft during flight which subsequently causes uneven <b>sampling</b> <b>length.</b> Velocity error causes defocussing of SAR imaging.

40|$|Roughness {{parameters}} as {{the elements}} of surface condition and deformation assessment {{based on the results}} of TLS scanning. Roughness is the attribute of a surface that can be defined as a collection of small surface unevennesses that can be identified optically or detected mechanically which do not result from the surface’s shape and their size depends on a material type as well as on undergone processing. The most often utilised roughness parameters are: Ra - mean distance value of the points on the observed profile from the average line on the <b>sampling</b> <b>length,</b> and Rz - difference between arithmetic mean height of the five highest peaks and arithmetic mean depth of the five deepest valleys regarding to the average line on the length of the measured fragment. In practice, roughness parameters are most often defined for surface elements that require relevant manufacturing or processing through grinding, founding or polishing in order to provide the expected surface roughness. To measure those parameters for the produced elements profilometers are used. In this paper the authors present an alternative approach of determining and utilising such parameters. Instead of the utilising methods based on <b>sampling</b> <b>length</b> measurement, roughness parameters are determined on the basis of point clouds, that represent a surface of rough concrete, obtained through terrestrial laser scanning. The authors suggest using the surface roughness parameter data acquired in this way as a supplementary data in the condition assessment (erosion rate) of surfaces being a part of engineering constructions made of concrete...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{combustion}} behavior of {{materials in the}} elevated oxygen environments of habitable spacecraft is of utmost importance to crew safety and mission success. Currently, certification for unrestricted flight usage of a material with respect to flammability involves passing the Upward Flame Propagation Test of NASA-STD- 6001 B (Test 1). This test evaluates materials in a standardized test configuration for two failure criteria: self-extinguishment within 15 cm (6 in.) and the propensity of flame propagation by means of flaming material transfer. By the NASA standard, full-length samples are 30 cm (12 in.) in length; however, factors independent of the test method such as limited material availability or various nonstandard test configurations limit the full pretest <b>sample</b> <b>lengths</b> available for test. This paper characterizes the dependence, if any, of pretest <b>sample</b> <b>length</b> on NASA-STD- 6001 B Test 1 results. Testing was performed using the Maximum Oxygen Concentration (MOC) Threshold Method to obtain a data set for each <b>sample</b> <b>length</b> tested.

30|$|In {{the process}} of sampling, an exact length of {{waveform}} in time domain, namely time window, is selected. When the window width is not enough, information of fault signal cannot be fully achieved, leading to inadequate learning process, and resulting in errors in diagnostic system. On the other hand, when the window width is too large, although diagnostic accuracy is able to be guaranteed, the burden of learning process is increased and efficiency is low due to the lengthy learning time. Considering of applying to real-time online process, to keep balance between the cost of time and diagnostic accuracy is important. Therefore, to select appropriate time window width for fault diagnosis is an important task in testing process. In this study, diagnostic time window selection is equivalent to finding the appropriate <b>sampling</b> <b>length</b> of training data.|$|E

A smoothed version of this interaction effect is developed and used to predict the contact resistance when the statistical size and spatial distribution of contact spots is known. To illustrate the use of the method, an idealized fractal rough surface is defined using the random midpoint displacement algorithm, and the size distribution of contact spots is assumed to be given by the intersection of this surface with a constant height plane. With these assumptions, it is shown that including finer scale detail in the fractal surface, equivalent to reducing the <b>sampling</b> <b>length</b> in the measurement of the surface, causes the predicted resistance to approach the perfect contact limit. © 2003 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

Our results show significantly higher ratings of pleasantness and attractiveness, and lower ratings of intensity and masculinity, for the 12 -h sampling condition. Further analysis of the data distribution suggests higher skew and a potential floor effect in hedonic ratings derived from the 24 -h condition.

The original gear design {{with a number of}} peculiarities and precision accuracy in manufacturing its essential details, first of all, thread ones allow us to have high operating parameters of RS. Errors of manufacturing special thread of such details greatly affect the load carrying capacity, precision, reliability, and endurance of RS.

Major errors include deviations of real pitch of thread from nominal ones and deviations of real thread profiles from nominal ones. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine abovementioned errors, which were measured by high-precision computerized devices, namely: MITUTOYO CV- 2000 contour measurement instrument; Form Talysurf PGI 420 contour measurement instrument. Both have a measurement range of 100 mm and resolution of 0. 2 μm.
