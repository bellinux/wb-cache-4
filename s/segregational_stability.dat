5|$|The biotechnological {{applications}} of toxin-antitoxin systems {{have begun to}} be realised by several biotechnology organisations. A primary usage is in maintaining plasmids in a large bacterial cell culture. In an experiment examining {{the effectiveness of the}} hok/sok locus, it was found that <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> of an inserted plasmid expressing beta-galactosidase was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin-antitoxin system. In large-scale microorganism processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms. A toxin-antitoxin system maintains the plasmid thereby maintaining the efficiency of the industrial process.|$|E

Plasmid loss entails degradation and/or dilution of the methylase during cell growth and appearance of unmethylated sites in the chromosome. Double-strand breaks, introduced at these sites by the endonuclease, eventually cause the death of the plasmid-free cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Segregation of {{expression}} plasmids leads to loss of recombinant DNA from transformed bacterial cells {{due to the}} irregular distribution of plasmids between the daughter cells during cell division. Under non-selective conditions this segregational instability results in a heterogeneous population of cells, where the non-productive plasmid-free cells overgrow the plasmid-bearing cells thus decreasing the yield of recombinant protein. Amongst the factors affecting segregational plasmid instability are: the plasmid design, plasmid copy-number, host cell genotype, fermentation conditions etc. This study aims to investigate the influence of transcription and translation on the segregation of recombinant plasmids designed for constitutive gene expression in Escherichia coli LE 392 at glucose-limited continuous cultivation. To this end a series of pBR 322 -based plasmids carrying a synthetic human interferon-gamma (hIFNγ) gene placed {{under the control of}} different regulatory elements (promoter and ribosome-binding sites) were used as a model. Results Bacterial growth and product formation kinetics of transformed E. coli LE 392 cells cultivated continuously were described by a structured kinetic model proposed by Lee et al. (1985). The obtained results demonstrated that both transcription and translation efficiency strongly affected plasmid segregation. The segregation of plasmid having a deleted promoter did not exceed 5 % after 190 h of cultivation. The observed high plasmid stability was not related with an increase in the plasmid copy-number.

Accordingly, the phytase-encoding gene was cloned in the pMSP 3535 vector, and then, {{for the first time}} for a plasmid carrying the pAMβ 1 replication origin, multimers of the resulting pAF 3 plasmid were used to transform Bacillus. The stability of the maintenance of pAF 3 in the recombinant Bacillus strain even under nonselective growth conditions was proved.

40|$|The orf 245 gene {{is located}} {{immediately}} upstream of, and divergently transcribed from, the replication initiation gene, rep, of the Staphylococcus aureus multiresistance plasmid pSK 1, and related genes {{have been found}} in association with a range of evolutionarily distinct replication genes on plasmids from various gram-positive genera. orf 245 has been shown previously to extend the <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> of a pSK 1 minireplicon. Here we describe an investigation into the basis of orf 245 -mediated stabilization. orf 245 was not found to influence transcription of pSK 1 rep, indicating that it is not directly involved in plasmid replication. This was confirmed by demonstrating that orf 245 is able to enhance the <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> of heterologous theta- and rolling-circle-replicating replicons, suggesting that it encodes a plasmid maintenance function. Evidence inconsistent with postsegregational killing and multimer resolution mechanisms was obtained; however, the intergenic region upstream of orf 245 was found to mediate orf 245 -dependent incompatibility, as would be expected if it encodes a cis-acting centromere-like site. Taken together, these findings implicate active partitioning as the probable basis of the activity of orf 245, which is therefore redesignated par. Since it is unrelated to any gene known {{to play a role in}} plasmid segregation, it seems likely that pSK 1 par potentially represents the prototype of a novel class of active partitioning systems that are distinguished by their capacity to enhance plasmid <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> via a single protein-encoding gene...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the hoklsok plasmid stability locus and mechanism of cloned-gene loss was evaluated in shake-flask cultures. Addition of the hoklsok locus dra-matically increased apparent plasmid segregational sta-bility relative to the hoklsok- control. In {{terms of the number}} of generations before 10 % of the population be-came plasmid-free, <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> was increased by 11 - to 20 -fold in different media in the absence of induction of the cloned-gene (hoklsok+ plasmid stable for over 200 generations in all media tested). With con-stant expression of p-galactosidase in the absence of an-tibiotic, the <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> of the plasmid con-taining hoklsok was increased more than 17 - to 30 -fold when p-galactosidase was expressed at 7 - 15 wt YO of total cell protein. Although the hoklsok system stabilized the plasmid well in four different media (Luria-Bertani (LB), LB glucose, M 9 C Trp, and a representative fed-batch medium), the ability of hoklsok to maintain the plasmid with induction of the cloned gene decreased as the complexity of the media increased. This result is bet-ter interpreted in terms of the influence of cloned-gene expression on plasmid maintenance; plasmid segrega-tional stability decreased linearly as specific p-galactosi-dase activity increased. 0 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In this work, pSP 02, a cryptic plasmid from Bifidobacterium longum M 62, was cloned, sequenced and characterized. pSP 02 was found to consist of 4896. bp with four ORFs coding for proteins over 50 amino acids long. Among the deduced protein sequences only a replicase (RepA) and a mobilization-like protein (MobA) showed known functional domains. Similar to previously described bifidobacterial plasmids, the organization of the putative ori region of pSP 02 resembles that of the theta-replicating plasmids of Gram-positives. In spite of this, hybridization experiments detected single stranded (ss) -DNA as an intermediate product in the pSP 02 replication, demonstrating it follows the rolling-circle (RC) replication mode. The ori region of pSP 02 was used to construct a series of first generation cloning vectors able to replicate in many bifidobacterial species.

40|$|Based on {{structural}} and functional properties, {{three groups of}} large staphylococcal multiresistance plasmids have been recognized, viz., the pSK 1 family, pSK 41 -like conjugative plasmids, and β-lactamase–heavy-metal resistance plasmids. Here we describe {{an analysis of the}} replication functions of a representative of each of these plasmid groups. The replication initiation genes from the Staphylococcus aureus plasmids pSK 1, pSK 41, and pI 9789 ::Tn 552 were found to be related {{to each other and to}} the Staphylococcus xylosus plasmid pSX 267 and are also related to rep genes of several plasmids from other gram-positive genera. Nucleotide sequence similarity between pSK 1 and pI 9789 ::Tn 552 extended beyond their rep genes, encompassing upstream divergently transcribed genes, orf 245 and orf 256, respectively. Our analyses revealed that genes encoding proteins related to the deduced orf 245 product are variously represented, in several types of organization, on plasmids possessing six seemingly evolutionarily distinct types of replication initiation genes and including both theta-mode and rolling-circle replicons. Construction of minireplicons and subsequent functional analysis demonstrated that orf 245 is required for the <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> of the pSK 1 replicon. In contrast, no gene equivalent to orf 245 is evident on the conjugative plasmid pSK 41, and a minireplicon encoding only the pSK 41 rep gene was found to exhibit a <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> approaching that of the parent plasmid.

3000|$|Although most of {{the commercially}} {{available}} phytases are fungal histidine acid phytases derived from Aspergillus species, bacterial phytases from the genus Bacillus are an alternative because of their high natural thermal stability, neutral pH optima, high specificity for phytate and proteolysis resistance (Fu et al. 2008). Some previous reports {{have suggested that the}} use of both Bacillus and fungal phytases together would be a promising alternative owing to their synergistic activities throughout the animal gastrointestinal tract (Elkhalil et al. 2007). The enormous potential of Bacillus phytases has motivated researchers to attempt their overproduction in microbial systems. Because the original strains produce low level of phytases, phytase gene heterologous expression was widely used to improve their production yield. For instance, Pichia pastoris has been successfully used as host for heterologous expression of some phytase genes from Bacillus (Guerrero-Olazaran et al. 2010). In prokaryotes, except for the expression system used by Tran et al. (2010), which allowed the production of the Bacillus sp. MD 2 phytase at 327 U ml- 1 by fed-batch cultivation, the majority of earlier attempts with expression of Bacillus phytases in Escherichia coli have resulted in production of inclusion bodies which entails additional steps for recovery of the active enzymes (Rao et al. 2008). As alternative, few expression systems have been developed in Bacillus subtilis, a microorganism generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and extensively used to produce in large scale, food-grade enzymes at cost-effective prices thanks to its high ability to secrete soluble and active proteins (Chen et al. 2010). Another advantage of B. subtilis, is that domesticated laboratory strains like [...] " 168 " [...] are naturally competent and even for environmental isolates, competence can be genetically established (Nijland et al. 2010). In general, vectors replicating in a theta (θ) mode known for their <b>segregational</b> and structural <b>stability</b> were used for expression (Chiang et al. 2010) and multimeric plasmid DNA forms were used for transformation (de Vos and Venema 1981). The literature comprises several studies dealing with the production of Bacillus-derived phytases in B. subtilis. For instance, B. amyloliquefaciens DS 11 phytase was produced with an activity of 2 U ml- 1 (Kim et al. 1999), the PhyC phytase originating from B. subtilis VTTE- 68013 was overexpressed at 28.7 and 47.7 U ml- 1 by Kerovuo et al. (2000) and Vuolanto et al. (2001) respectively, and the 168 phyA and phyL encoded phytases were overexpressed at activity levels of 35 and 28 U ml- 1 respectively (Tye et al. 2002).|$|R

Adding two antisense killer loci (hok 1 /sok 1 pnd 1) decreased the specific growth rate by 50 % though they were more effective at reducing segregational instability than hok 1 /sok 1 alone. With the ptac promoter induced fully (2. 0 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and no antibiotic selection pressure, the combination of a proteic killer locus (parDE 1) with antisense killer loci (hok 1 /sok 1) had a negligible impact on specific growth rate, maintained high b-galactosidase expression, and led to a 30 and 190 % increase in <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> (based on stable generations) as compared to plasmids containing either hok 1 /sok 1 or parDE 1 alone, respectively.

Methods Plasmid profiling was performed by S 1 -nuclease PFGE, PCR-based replicon typing and Southern blot-hybridization. The complete sequence of the CTX-M- 15 -encoding plasmid was obtained by 454 sequencing. Plasmid self-transferability was investigated by brothand filter mating, <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> was explored by serial passage, and plasmidconferred fitness costs were examined in pairwise head-to-head competitions and by growth rate comparisons. Results CTX-M- 15 was encoded by a ~ 180 kb IncFIIK plasmid in K. pneumoniae ST 17. S 1 -nuclease PFGE profiles of the first and the last CTX-M- 15 -producing K. pneumoniae isolates, recovered from the four children colonized the longest, suggested that the plasmid was stably maintained during intestinal carriage of up to two years. The DNA sequence of the pKPN 3 - like plasmid, pKp 848 CTX, uncovered a Tn 3 -like antibiotic resistance region and multiple heavy metal- and thermoresistance determinants. Plasmid pKp 848 CTX could not be transferred to Escherichia coli in vitro and we found no evidence to support horizontal plasmid transfer in vivo.

Mutations which altered the rate of synthesis of this protein in E. coli affected the copy number and <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> of pEP 2 in the two hosts. RepA contains 483 amino acid residues and has the calculated molecular weight of 53, 925. It shows 45 % amino acid residue identity with open reading frame ORF 2 of pSR 1, a plasmid isolated from Corynebacterium glutamicum (J. A. C. Archer and A. J. Sinskey, J. Gen. Microbiol. 139 : 1753 - 1759, 1993). Plasmid pEP 2 was shown to accumulate single-stranded DNA corresponding to the RepA coding strand during its replication in E. coli and C. pseudotuberculosis, suggesting that it may replicate by a rolling circle mechanism. However, RepA has no significant sequence homology with the replication initiator proteins of plasmids known to use this mode of replication...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResveratrol is a plant {{secondary}} metabolite {{commonly found in}} peanuts and grapevines with significant health benefits. Recombinant organisms can produce large amounts of resveratrol and, in this work, Escherichia coli BW 27784 was used to produce resveratrol in bioreactors while monitoring cell physiology and plasmid stability through flow cytometry and real-time qPCR, respectively. Initially, the influence of culture conditions and precursor addition was evaluated in screening assays and the data gathered was used to perform the bioreactor assays, allowing the production of 160 μg/mL of resveratrol. Cellular physiology and plasmid instability affected the final resveratrol production, with lower viability and plasmid copy numbers associated with lower yields. In sum, this study describes new tools to monitor the bioprocess, evaluating the effect of culture conditions, and its correlation with cell physiology and plasmid <b>segregational</b> <b>stability,</b> in order to define a viable and scalable bioprocess to fulfill the need for larger quantities of resveratrol...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{replication}} origins from resident plasmids of Bacillus thuringienis subsp. kurstaki HD 263 and HD 73 were cloned in Escherichia coli. Three {{of these}} replication origins, originating from plasmids of 43, 44, and 60 MDa, {{were used to}} construct a set of compatible shuttle vectors that exhibit structural and <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> in the Cry- strain B. thuringiensis HD 73 - 26. These shuttle vectors, pEG 597, pEG 853, and pEG 854, were designed with rare restriction sites that permit various adaptations, including the construction of small recombinant plasmids lacking antibiotic resistance genes. The cryIA(c) and cryIIA insecticidal crystal protein genes were inserted into these vectors to demonstrate crystal protein production in B. thuringiensis. Introduction of a cloned cryIA(c) gene from strain HD 263 into a B. thuringiensis subsp. aizawai strain exhibiting good insecticidal activity against Spodoptera exigua resulted in a recombinant strain with an improved spectrum of insecticidal activity. Shuttle vectors of this sort should be valuable in future genetic studies of B. thuringiensis {{as well as in}} the development of B. thuringiensis strains for use as microbial pesticides...|$|E
40|$|Partition cassettes, {{essential}} for the <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> of low-copy-number bacterial plasmids, typically encode two autoregulated proteins and an adjacent cis-acting centromere analog to which one or perhaps both proteins bind. The diminutive partition region of pTAR of Agrobacterium spp. {{was reported to be}} exceptional, encoding only a single protein, ParA (D. R. Gallie and C. I. Kado, J. Mol. Biol. 193 : 465 – 478, 1987). However, resequencing of the region revealed two small downstream genes, parB and orf- 84, of which only parB was found to be {{essential for}} partitioning in A. tumefaciens. Purified ParA exhibited a weak ATPase activity that was modestly increased by nonspecific DNA. ParB bound in vitro to repeated sequences present in a region, parS, that possesses centromere and operator functions and within which we identified the primary transcription start site by primer extension. In certain respects the Par proteins behave normally in the foreign host Escherichia coli. In E. coli, as in A. tumefaciens, ParB repressed the partition operon; ParA, inactive alone, augmented this repression. Functional similarities between the partition system of pTAR and those of other plasmids and bacteria are prominent, despite differences in size, organization, and amino acid sequence...|$|E
40|$|Many {{micro-organisms}} cause important {{diseases of}} the female genital tract. Because systematic vaccination does not usually provide a good immune response at mucosal sites, commensal lactobacilli from the female genital tract were developed as vehicles to deliver continued doses of foreign antigen directly to the genital mucosal surface {{with the aim of}} stimulating strong local mucosal immune responses. Lactobacilli were shown to be common inhabitants of the genital tract of the animal model studied, the guinea-pig. One species, Lactobacillus fermentum, was found in all guinea-pigs studied and was chosen for genetic manipulation. Improved methods of electroporation were developed to enable the routine transformation of L. fermentum BR 11 strain with the broad host range plasmid pNZ 17. This recombinantly modified Lactobacillus strain was shown to possess good <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> over 120 generations in the absence of antibiotic selection. When this recombinant L. fermentum strain was administered to the vaginal tract of three guinea-pigs it persisted for only 5 days. Despite the relatively short period of persistence in these initial experiments, this novel vaccine approach could provide an effective means of stimulating mucosal immunity in the female genital tract...|$|E
40|$|High <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> of the streptococcal plasmid pSM 19035 is {{achieved}} by the concerted action of systems involved in plasmid copy number control, multimer resolution, and postsegregational killing. In this study, we demonstrate the role of two genes, δ and ω, in plasmid stabilization by a partition mechanism. We show that these two genes can stabilize the native pSM 19035 replicon {{as well as other}} θ- and σ-type plasmids in Bacillus subtilis. In contrast to other known partition systems, in this case the two genes are transcribed separately; however, they are coregulated by the product of the parB-like gene ω. Analysis of mutants of the parA-like gene δ showed that the Walker A ATPase motif is necessary for plasmid stabilization. The ParB-like product of the ω gene binds to three regions containing repeated WATCACW heptamers, localized in the copS (regulation of plasmid copy number), δ, and ω promoter regions. We demonstrate that all three of these regions can cause partition-mediated incompatibility. Moreover, our data suggest that each of these could play the role of a centromere-like sequence. We conclude that δ and ω constitute a novel type of plasmid stabilization system...|$|E
40|$|A cosmid {{cloning vector}} has been {{constructed}} that demonstrates {{high levels of}} <b>segregational</b> <b>stability</b> in Escherichia coli K 12. pPSX is a 14 -kilobase vector derived from the IncW plasmid pR 388. pPSX is highly stable in E coli {{in the absence of}} antibiotic selection, even while expressing the toxic indolocarbazole antitumor antibiotic violacein. The incorporation of the lambda cos sequence enables construction of cosmid libraries with inserts ranging from 24 to 36 kb. The inclusion of a lacZ alpha multiple cloning site (MCS) allows blue/white screening. pPSX cosmids can be extracted from the host cell with commercial plasmid extraction kits facilitating downstream analysis, sequencing and sub-cloning. pPSX can be transferred to a variety of heterologous hosts by either electroporation or mobilization from E. coli S 17 - 1. While it is unstable in non-E. coli hosts without antibiotic selection, heterologous host strains such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Pseudomonas stutzeri will maintain the plasmid under antibiotic selection to allow screening of expressed inserts. pPSX provides the benefits of large insert sizes with high stability to allow cloning of chemotherapeutic gene clusters in E coli and a range of other heterologous hosts.

40|$|We have {{isolated}} and characterized 76 duplications of chromosome I in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans. The region studied is the 20 map unit left {{half of the}} chromosome. Sixty-two duplications were induced with gamma radiation and 14 arose spontaneously. The latter class was apparently the result of spontaneous breaks within the parental duplication. The majority of duplications behave {{as if they are}} free. Three duplications are attached to identifiable sequences from other chromosomes. The duplication breakpoints have been mapped by complementation analysis relative to genes on chromosome I. Nineteen duplication breakpoints and seven deficiency breakpoints divide the left half of the chromosome into 24 regions. We have studied the relationship between duplication size and <b>segregational</b> <b>stability.</b> While size is an important determinant of mitotic stability, {{it is not the only}} one. We observed clear exceptions to a size-stability correlation. In addition to size, duplication stability may be influenced by specific sequences or chromosome structure. The majority of the duplications were stable enough to be powerful tools for gene mapping. Therefore the duplications described here will be useful in the genetic characterization of chromosome I and the techniques we have developed can be adapted to other regions of the genome...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{development}} of several cloning vectors for bifidobacteria based on the replicon of pBC 1, a cryptic plasmid from Bifidobacterium catenulatum L 48 thought to replicate via the theta mode. These vectors, in which antibiotic resistance genes encoding either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance acted as selection markers, were able to replicate {{in a series of}} eight Bifidobacterium species at frequencies ranging from 4. 0 × 101 to 1. 0 × 105 transformants μg− 1 but not in Lactococcus lactis or Lactobacillus casei. They showed a relative copy number of around 30 molecules per chromosome equivalent and a good <b>segregational</b> <b>stability,</b> with more than 95 % of the cells retaining the vectors after 80 to 100 generations in the absence of selection. Vectors contain multiple cloning sites of different lengths, and the lacZα peptide gene was introduced into one of the molecules, thus allowing the easy selection of colonies harboring recombinant plasmids in Escherichia coli. The functionality of the vectors for engineering Bifidobacterium strains was assessed by cloning and examining the expression of an α-l-arabinofuranosidase gene belonging to Bifidobacterium longum. E. coli and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum recombinant clones were stable and showed an increase in α-arabinofuranosidase activity of over 100 -fold compared to that of the untransformed hosts...|$|E
40|$|To {{circumvent}} problems {{encountered in}} the synthesis of active chymosin {{in a number of}} bacteria and fungi, a recombinant DNA L-form expression system that directed the complete secretion of fully activable prochymosin into the extracellular culture medium was developed. The expression plasmid constructions involved the in-frame fusion of prochymosin cDNA minus codons 1 to 4 to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type A gene (speA') sequences, including the speA promoter, ribosomal binding site, and signal sequence and five codons of mature SpeA. Secretion of fusion prochymosin enzymatically and immunologically indistinguishable from bovine prochymosin was achieved after transformation of two stable protoplast type L-form strains derived from Proteus mirabilis. The secreted proenzyme was converted by autocatalytic processing to chymosin showing milk-clotting activity. In controlled laboratory fermentation processes, a maximum specific rate of activable prochymosin synthesis of 0. 57 x 10 (- 3) /h was determined from the time courses of biomass dry weight and product formation. Yields as high as 40 +/- 10 micrograms/ml were obtained in the cell-free culture fluid of strain L 99 carrying a naturally altered expression plasmid of increased <b>segregational</b> <b>stability.</b> The expression-secretion system described may be generally useful for production of recombinant mammalian proteins synthesized intracellularly as aberrantly folded insoluble aggregates...|$|E
