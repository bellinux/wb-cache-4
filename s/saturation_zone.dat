5000|$|If the {{resulting}} shadows {{are unable to}} be processed to acceptable noise or tonal range, one has simply encountered a situation that cannot be taken with a single shot, and consideration could be given to HDR (High Dynamic Range) techniques requiring multiple exposures. If the latter is infeasible due to scene or camera motion, on may revert to the technique of exposing to the important highlights (abbr. ETTIH), which is in fact just a slight generalization of ETTR. With ETTR, exposure is maximized up to the constraint of preserving all highlights at the right edge of the histogram (a constraint implied by the hard saturation of the digital sensor). With ETTIH, exposure is maximized a bit further; the constraint is relaxed so that only the highlights deemed important are preserved before the right edge of the histogram, and the highlights deemed unimportant may fall into the <b>saturation</b> <b>zone</b> of the sensor. Typical examples of unimportant highlights include the sun, other very bright light-sources, and sharp-edged specular highlights like chrome car bumpers in the sun; however, one should avoid blowing areas with smooth luminosity gradients, for instance the sky around the sun, because these likely lead to visible sensor saturation artefacts (banding). Many cameras have over-exposure [...] "blinkies", showing the location of blown highlights which is not evident from the histogram. Some cameras also have under-exposure [...] "blinkies" [...] as an exposure aid. Mirror-less cameras often have [...] "preview zebras", which is another aid for being aware of and correcting over-exposure.|$|E

This time depends on the hillslopes geometry (plan shape and profile curvature), soil properties and climate conditions. The saturation capacity of hillslopes affect the travel time of subsurface flow. The saturation capacity, and subsurface travel time of compound hillslopes depend on parameters such as soil depth, porosity, soil hydraulic conductivity, plan shape (convergent, parallel or divergent), hillslope length, profile curvature (concave, straight or convex) and recharge rate to the groundwater table. An equation for calculating subsurface travel time for all complex hillslopes was presented. This equation {{is a function of}} the <b>saturation</b> <b>zone</b> length (SZL) on the surface. <b>Saturation</b> <b>zone</b> length of the complex hillslopes was calculated numerically by using the hillslope-storage Boussinesq (hsB) model in the steady state conditions, so an analytical equation was presented for calculating the <b>saturation</b> <b>zone</b> length of the straight hillslopes and all plan shapes geometries. Based on our results, the convergent hillslopes become saturated very soon and they showed longer SZL with shorter travel time compared to the parallel and divergent ones. The subsurface average flow rate in convergent hillslopes is much less than the divergent ones in the steady state conditions. Concerning to subsurface travel time, convex hillslopes have more travel time in comparison to straight and concave hillslopes. The convex hillslopes exhibit more average flow rate than concave hillslopes and their saturation capacity is very low. Finally, the effects of recharge rate variations, average bedrock slope and soil depth on <b>saturation</b> <b>zone</b> extension were investigated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{constant}} {{search for}} new materials has provided impetus to research in piezoelectric materials. An anti-plane problem for a cracked unbounded two-dimensional poled piezoelectric plate has been investigated. The crack rims open on account of shear mechanical forces applied at the remote boundary and in-plane electric displacement field prescribed at the infinite boundary. Thus the crack yields both mechanically and electrically. Consequently, a plastic zone and a sat-uration zone protrude ahead of each tip of the crack. These developed zones are in turn closed by applying yield point shear stress at the rims of plastic zone and normal closing saturation limit displacement on the rims of saturation zones. Two cases are investigated when (i) the developed <b>saturation</b> <b>zone</b> length exceeds that of the developed plastic zone, and (ii) <b>saturation</b> <b>zone</b> length is smaller {{than that of the}} plastic zone. Fourier integral transform method is used in each case to obtain the length of plastic zone and <b>saturation</b> <b>zone.</b> Closed form analytic expres-sions are obtained in each case.

40|$|Purpose: The {{investigations}} aim {{to propose}} a model for arresting an electrical opening of a crack which weakensa narrow, poled and infinite piezoelectric strip. The edges of the strip are subjected to uniform, constant anti-planestresses and in-plane electrical displacements. Design/methodology/approach: The loads applied {{at the edges of}} the strip open the crack in a self-similar fashion. Consequently at each tip of the crack a <b>saturation</b> <b>zone</b> protrudes. To stop the crack from further opening the rims ofdeveloped saturation zones are subjected to normal, cohesive linearly varying saturation limit electric displacement. Theedges of the strip are subjected to anti-plane deformation and in-plane electrical displacement. Fourier integral transformmethod employed reduces the problem to the solution of a Fredholm integral equation of second kind. Findings: The electrical displacement, stress intensity factor, the <b>saturation</b> <b>zone</b> length, crack opening displacementand crack growth rate have been calculated. The results obtained presented graphically, analysed and concluded. Research limitations/implications: The ceramic used for strip is being assumed to be electrically morebrittle.
