50|$|The genus Salmonella {{is part of}} {{the family}} of Enterobacteriaceae. Its {{taxonomy}} has been revised and has the potential to confuse. The genus comprises two species, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica, the latter of which is divided into six subspecies: S. e. enterica, S. e. salamae, S. e. arizonae, S. e. diarizonae, S. e. houtenae, and S. e. indica. The taxonomic group contains more than 2500 serotypes (also serovars) defined {{on the basis of the}} somatic O (lipopolysaccharide) and flagellar H antigens (the Kauffman-White classification). The full name of a serotype is given as, for example, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhimurium, but can be abbreviated to Salmonella Typhimurium. Further differentiation of strains to assist clinical and epidemiological investigation may be achieved by antibiotic sensitivity testing and by other molecular biology techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and, increasingly, whole genome sequencing.

40|$|Background: <b>Salmonella</b> are a genus of {{zoonotic}} bacteria {{of worldwide}} economic and health importance. Members of <b>Salmonella</b> enterica subspecies enterica are mainly associated with warm-blooded vertebrates {{and are usually}} transmitted by ingestion of food or watercontaminated by infected feces.

Materials and Methods: A total of 30 <b>Salmonella</b> isolates were serotyped by specific antisera. For the PCR-RFLP method based on the fliC gene, extracted DNA was used as the template for amplifying the fliC gene (1500 bp) using specific primers.

50|$|When a {{macrophage}} ingests a pathogen, {{the pathogen}} becomes {{trapped in a}} phagosome, which then fuses with a lysosome. Within the phagolysosome, enzymes and toxic peroxides digest the pathogen. However, some bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have become resistant to these methods of digestion. Typhoidal <b>Salmonellae</b> induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo, and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action, thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis. Macrophages can digest more than 100 bacteria before they finally die due to their own digestive compounds.|$|E

50|$|While in {{developed}} countries, nontyphoidal serotypes present mostly as gastrointestinal disease; in sub-Saharan Africa, these serotypes {{can create a}} major problem in bloodstream infections, and are the most commonly isolated bacteria from the blood of those presenting with fever. Bloodstream infections caused by nontyphoidal <b>salmonellae</b> in Africa were reported in 2012 to have a case fatality rate of 20-25%. Most cases of invasive nontyphoidal salmonella infection (iNTS) are caused by S. typhimurium or S. enteritidis. A new form of Salmonella typhimurium (ST313) emerged in the southeast of the African continent 75 years ago, followed by a second wave which came out of central Africa 18 years later. This second wave of iNTS possibly originated in the Congo Basin, and early in the event picked up a gene that made it resistant to the antibiotic chloramphenicol. This created the need to use expensive antimicrobial drugs in areas of Africa that were very poor, making treatment difficult. The increased prevalence of iNTS in sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions is thought to be due to the large proportion of the African population with some degree of immune suppression or impairment due to the burden of HIV, malaria, and malnutrition, especially in children. The genetic makeup of iNTS is evolving into a more typhoid-like bacterium, able to efficiently spread around the human body. Symptoms are reported to be diverse, including fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and respiratory symptoms, often with an absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.|$|E

All samples were cultured and their positive results were subjected to PCR method {{in order to determine}} the exact incidence rates of <b>Salmonella</b> spp., <b>Salmonella</b> enteritidis and <b>Salmonella</b> typhimurium and their virulence genes. Results: Totally, 1. 66 % of samples were <b>Salmonella</b> positive. The incidence of <b>Salmonella</b> enteritidis and <b>Salmonella</b> typhimurium were 0. 27 % and 0. 83 %, respectively. Raw sheep milk had the highest prevalence of <b>Salmonella</b> spp. (7. 5 %). All of the <b>Salmonella</b> enteritidis and <b>Salmonella</b> typhimurium isolates harbored their certain virulence factors. Conclusions: To our best knowledge the present study is the first prevalence report of <b>Salmonella</b> spp., <b>Salmonella</b> enteritidis and <b>Salmonella</b> typhimurium in raw sheep and goat samples in Iran. Consumption of pasteurized milk and dairy products can reduce the risk of salmonellosis...|$|R
40|$|Cultivation {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used in <b>Salmonella</b> surveillance systems and outbreak investigations, and consequent-ly, conclusions about <b>Salmonella</b> evolution and transmission are highly dependent on the performance characteristics of these methods. Past {{studies have shown that}} <b>Salmonella</b> serotypes can exhibit different growth characteristics in the same enrichment and selective media. This could lead not only to biased conclusions about the dominant strain present in a sample with mixed <b>Salmonella</b> populations, but also to a low sensitivity for detecting a <b>Salmonella</b> strain in a sample with only a single strain present. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether cultivation media select preferentially for specific strains of <b>Salmonella</b> in heterogeneous cultures. In this study, four different <b>Salmonella</b> strains (one <b>Salmonella</b> Newport, two <b>Salmonella</b> Typhimurium, and one <b>Salmonella</b> Enteritidis) were competed in a broth-based experiment and a bovine fecal experiment with varied combinations and concentrations of each strain. In all experiments, the strain of <b>Salmonella</b> Newport was the most competitive, regardless of the starting concentration and cultivation protocol. One strain of <b>Salmonella</b> Typhimurium was rarely detected in competition, even when it was the only strain present in bovine feces. Overall, the probability of detecting a specific <b>Salmonella</b> strain had little to do with its starting concentration in the sample. The bias introduced by culture could be dramatically biasing <b>Salmonella</b> surveillance systems and hindering traceback investigations during <b>Salmonella</b> outbreaks...|$|R
