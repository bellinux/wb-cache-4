50|$|The Pejsa drag model closed-form {{solution}} prediction method, without <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> factor fine tuning, yields very similar {{results in the}} supersonic flight regime compared to the Doppler radar test derived drag coefficients (Cd) prediction method. At 1500 m range the projectile velocity predictions deviate 10 m/s (32.8 ft/s), which equates to a predicted total drop difference of 23.6 cm (9.3 in) or 0.16 mrad (0.54 MOA) at 50° latitude.|$|E
50|$|An average {{retardation}} coefficient can {{be calculated}} for any given <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> factor if velocity data points are known and distance between said velocity measurements is known. Obviously this is true only within the same flight regime. With velocity actual speed is meant, as velocity is a vector quantity and speed is {{the magnitude of the}} velocity vector. Because the power function does not have constant curvature a simple chord average cannot be used. The Pejsa model uses a weighted average retardation coefficient weighted at 0.25 range.The closer velocity is more heavily weighted. The retardation coefficient is measured in feet whereas range is measured in yards hence 0.25 * 3.0 = 0.75, in some places 0.8 rather than 0.75 is used. The 0.8 comes from rounding in order to allow easy entry on hand calculators. Since the Pejsa model does not use a simple chord weighted average, two velocity measurements are used to find the chord average retardation coefficient at midrange between the two velocity measurements points. In order to find the starting retardation coefficient Dr. Pejsa provides two separate equations in his two books. The first involves the power function. The second equation is identical to the one used to find the weighted average at R / 4; add N * (R/2) where R is the range in feet to the chord average retardation coefficient at midrange and where N is the <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> factor. After the starting retardation coefficient is found the opposite procedure is used in order find the weighted average at R / 4; the starting retardation coefficient minus N * (R/4). In other words, N is used as the slope of the chord line. Dr. Pejsa states that he expanded his drop formula in a power series in order to prove that the weighted average retardation coefficient at R / 4 was a good approximation. For this Dr. Pejsa compared the power series expansion of his drop formula to some other unnamed drop formula’s power expansion to reach his conclusions. The fourth term in both power series matched when the retardation coefficient at 0.25 range was used in Pejsa’s drop formula. The fourth term was also the first term to use N. The higher terms involving N where insignificant and disappeared at N = 0.36, which according to Dr. Pejsa was a lucky coincidence making for an exceedingly accurate linear approximation, especially for N’s around 0.36. If a retardation coefficient function is used exact average values for any N can be obtained because from calculus it is trivial to find the average of any integrable function. Dr. Pejsa states that the retardation coefficient can be modeled by C * VN where C is a fitting coefficient which disappears during the derivation of the drop formula and N the <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> factor.The retardation coefficient equals the velocity squared divided by the retardation rate A. Using an average retardation coefficient allows the Pejsa model to be a closed-form expression within a given flight regime.|$|E
50|$|The {{greatest}} {{strength of the}} Pejsa model is that any projectile within a given flight regime (for example the supersonic flight regime) can be mathematically modeled well with only two velocity measurements, a distance between said velocity measurements, and a slope or deceleration constant factor. The model allows the drag curve to change slopes or curvature at three different points. Down range velocity measurement data can be provided around key inflection points allowing for more accurate calculations of the projectile retardation rate. The Pejsa model allows the slope factor to be tuned to account for subtle differences in the retardation rate of different bullet shapes and sizes. It ranges from 0.1 (flat-nose bullets) to 0.9 (very-low-drag bullets). If this slope or deceleration constant factor is unknown a default value of 0.5 will predict the flight behavior of most modern spitzer-type rifle bullets quite well. With the help of test firing measurements the <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> for a particular bullet/rifle system/shooter combination can be determined. These test firings should preferably be executed at 60% and for extreme long range ballistic predictions also at 80% to 90% of the supersonic range of the projectiles of interest, staying away from erratic transonic effects. With this the Pejsa model can easily be tuned for the specific drag behavior of a specific projectile, making significant better (supersonic) ballistic predictions for ranges beyond 500 m (547 yd) possible. A practical downside of the Pejsa model is that accurate projectile specific down range velocity measurements to provide these better predictions {{can not be easily}} performed by the vast majority of shooting enthusiasts.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} allow {{the use of a}} G1 {{ballistic}} coefficient rather than velocity data Dr. Pejsa provided two reference drag curves. The first reference drag curve is based purely on the Siacci/Mayevski retardation rate function. The second reference drag curve is adjusted to equal the Siacci/Mayevski retardation rate function at a projectile velocity of 2600 fps (792.5 m/s) using a [...]30-06 Springfield Cartridge, Ball, Caliber [...]30 M2 [...] rifle spitzer bullet with a slope or deceleration constant factor of 0.5 in the supersonic flight regime. In other flight regimes the second Pejsa reference drag curve model uses <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> factors of 0.0 or -4.0. These deceleration constant factors can be verified by backing out Pejsa's formulas (the drag curve segments fits the form V(2 - N) / C and the retardation coefficient curve segments fits the form V2 / (V(2 - N) / C) = C * VN where C is a fitting coefficient). The empirical test data Pejsa used to determine the exact shape of his chosen reference drag curve and pre-defined mathematical function that returns the retardation coefficient at a given Mach number was provided by the US military for the Cartridge, Ball, Caliber [...]30 M2 bullet. The calculation of the retardation coefficient function also involves air density, which Pejsa did not mention explicitly. The Siacci/Mayevski G1 model uses the following deceleration parametrization (60 °F, 30 inHg and 67% humidity, air density ρ = 1.2209 kg/m3). Dr. Pejsa suggests using the second drag curve because the Siacci/Mayevski G1 drag curve does not provide a good fit for modern spitzer bullets. To obtain relevant retardation coefficients for optimal long range modeling Dr. Pejsa suggested using accurate projectile specific down range velocity measurement data for a particular projectile to empirically derive the average retardation coefficient rather than using a reference drag curve derived average retardation coefficient. Further he suggested using ammunition with reduced propellant loads to empirically test actual projectile flight behavior at lower velocities. When working with reduced propellant loads utmost care must be taken to avoid dangerous or catastrophic conditions (detonations) with can occur when firing experimental loads in firearms.|$|E
40|$|Any image can be {{described}} in terms of its statistics (i. e. quantitative parameters calculated from the image, for example RMS-contrast, the skewness of image brightness distribution, and <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> of an average amplitude spectrum). It was previously shown that insect and vertebrate visual systems are optimised to the statistics common among natural scenes. However, the exact mechanisms of this process are still unclear and need further investigation. This thesis presents the results of examining links between some image statistics and visual responses in humans and hoverflies. It was found that while image statistics do not play the main role when hoverflies (Eristalis tenax and Episyrphus balteatus) chose what flowers to feed on, there is a link between hoverfly (Episyrphus balteatus) active behaviours and image statistics. There is {{a significant difference in the}} <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> of the average amplitude spectrum, RMS contrast and skewness of brightness distribution between photos of areas where hoverflies were hovering or flying. These photos were also used to create a prediction model of hoverfly behaviour. After model validation, it was concluded that photos of both the ground and the surround should be used for best prediction of behaviour. The best predictor was skewness of image brightness distribution. By using a trackball setup, the optomotor response in walking hoverflies (Eristalis tenax) was found to be influenced by the <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> of an average amplitude spectrum.   Intracellular recording showed that the higher-order neuron cSIFE (The centrifugal stationary inhibited flicker excited) in the hoverfly (Eristalis tenax) lobula plate was inhibited by a range of natural scenes and that this inhibition was strongest in a response to visual stimuli with the <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> of an average amplitude spectrum of 1, which is the typical value for natural environments.   Based on the results of psychophysics study in human subjects it was found that sleep deprivation affects human perception of naturalistic slope constants differently for different image categories (“food” and “real world scenes”).

The difference in AUC observed may be attributable to statistical noise but also the difference in temporal resolution between these techniques. Although blood samples were taken with a resolution of 5 s, the probe system has a maximum resolution of 1 s. In contrast to {{the high degree of}} agreement shown between probe-derived and manual sampling derived IFs, image-derived IFs showed an underestimation and increased variability (Figure 2 and Table 1). PET-derived IF based on a volume-of-interest in the left ventricle of the heart has been described for use as a true arterial IF in a number of species [10, 16, 17, 19 – 21]. Fitting of the IFs to reduce noise had a negligible effect on the coefficient of variation for the AUC ratios with all methods (Table 1). In addition to AUC, the slope constants of a bi-exponential model fitted to the IF curves were compared. Although AUC is a useful method for comparing the integrated activity present in the blood over the duration of the study, a drawback of the method is that it is possible for curves with very different shapes to have similar AUCs. In the present, study it was shown that the shapes of the IF curves are very similar (Figure 2), but comparison of the slope constants of the bi-exponential fit provides an indication of the instantaneous level of radioactivity in the blood, which is of importance for kinetic modeling using the IF curves. Statistical analysis revealed that all methods differed for the first <b>slope</b> <b>constant,</b> but that {{there was no significant difference}} between the probe- and manually derived curves in the second <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> (Table 2).

40|$|Summary This {{map shows}} {{friction}} values on {{a grid of}} 90 x 90 meters for Brazil. Friction values represent the average travel time by car, boat, train or foot (depending on the surface) to cross one grid-cell in horizontal or vertical space. Friction maps are fundamental for calculating accumulated costs maps that {{can serve as a}} substitute for infrastructure data in spatial modelling. The base-data used for creating this friction map comprises: 	A layer of road-infrastructure data obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of transportation (Ministério dos Transportes e Departamento Nacional de Infraestrutura de Transportes). The data is available at [URL]. Planned roads where filtered out of the dataset. 	A layer of rail-roads in Brazil from the same source as (1). 	A layer of oficial hidroways in Brazil from the same source as (1). 	A layer of land-use classes in 2014 obtained from Mapbiomas. The data is available for download here: [URL] 	A layer of hydrological data that was composed from two different datasets from the Brazlian Water Agency (Agencia Nacional das Águas). The source data can be downloaded here: [URL] The datasets from ANA are Drainage Network models based on SRTM data (2000) in the scale of 1 : 100. 000 and in the scale of 1 : 250. 000. We used the lower resolution data (1 : 250. 000) to identify mayor rivers. However the spatial accuracy of this data is not sufficient for our purpose and affluent rivers to the main river are not included. We therefore developed a model to buffer the low resolution data-set with a 10 km buffer {{on each side of the}} river. We than used this buffer areas to crop out the higher resolution data (1 : 100. 000) thereby including affluent rivers of up to 10 km on each side of the main river. Furthermore the higher resolution data is spatially more accurate if compared to satellite imagery. 	A layer of sloped data based on global SRTM elevation data from 2000 available at: [URL] Description of the model: First all data was reprojected to WGS 84, than the data was reclassified to hold travel times to cross one grid-cell for each class in seconds. The following assumptions on travel speed had been used for this purpose: 	Paved Roads: 60 km/h 	Unpaved Roads: 40 km/h 	Waterbodies or navigable stretches in the flooding season: 10 km/h 	Hidroways: 20 km/h 	Railways: 40 km/h 	Forest: 3 km/h (comprises in the original data: forest, planted forest, coastal zone forest) 	Non-forest: 12 km/h (comprises: Agricultural areas, non-forest vegetation, pastures, others) Afterwards, all data-sources where rasterized at a resolution of 90 x 90 meters and stacked in a rasterstack. Than the highest value of each grid-cell in the stack was extracted into a new summary raster. The summary layer is the raw friction map that needs to be corrected for the effect of slope. Slope was calculated from the SRTM 1 data and rescaled to the same extent and resolution as the raw friction map. Slope was included as a constant factor with the following assumptions: 	slope between 0 and 5 degrees: <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> 1 (travel speed is not impacted) 	slope between 5 - 10 degrees: <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> 2 (travel speed is reduced by half) 	slope between 10 - 15 degrees: <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> 3 (travel speed is reduced to a third of the original speed) 	slope above 15 degrees: <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> is 10 (travel speed is reduced to 10 % of the original speed) Slope effects where not applied on water bodies. The corrected friction map was exported as a GeoTiff (WGS 84) in a resolution of 90 x 90 meters. Additional Information: The friction map was created using the R-software environment and GDAL. The script to replicated the results or modify the model with other base data can be obtained on request. The friction map can be used to calculate accumulated cost maps with GIS software (costdistance function in ArcGIS and r. cost function in QGIS) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhereas the {{influence}} on the elevation of visually perceived eye level (VPEL) by two bilaterally symmetric, long (64 °-long), pitched-from-vertical lines in total darkness is {{only a little more}} than the average of the VPELs of the two lines measured separately [Matin & Li (1999). Vision Research, 39, 307 – 329], in the present experiments with 49 2 -line combinations of seven orientations (− 30 ° to + 30 ° pitch), the VPEL for two short (12 °-long) lines equals the additive sum of the separate influences of the two lines. With one line at a fixed orientation, the slope of the VPEL-versus-pitch function with the second line variable equals the slope of the function when viewing one line alone, but is shifted from the 1 -line-alone function by the magnitude of the VPEL of the fixed line. Both the near-averaging and the additivity are summarized by V(θl,θr) =k 1 +k 2 [V(θl) +V(θr) ], where V(θl) and V(θr) are the 1 -line VPELs for the pitches of the left and right lines, and V(θl, θr) is the 2 -line VPEL; the <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> k 2 equals 0. 5 for averaging, and 1. 00 for simple additivity of the separate visual influences. Measured values are k 2 = 0. 99 and k 2 = 0. 61 for short and long lines, respectively. The shift of <b>slope</b> <b>constant</b> is determined by line length and not orientation: parallel and nonparallel lines follow the same rules of combination for short lines as they do for long lines. As for long lines, the short-line results are clear in showing that the visual influence on VPEL is controlled by an opponent-process mechanism. Although ‘saturation-near-an-asymptote’ along with opponency are required components of the interpretation for the basis of the combination of lines of different orientations and different lengths, they are not by themselves sufficient: All results conform to a neurophysiologically-based model [Matin and Li (1997 b). Society for Neuroscience, 23, 175; Matin & Li, under review] that parallel processes feedforward signals from orientation-selective neural units in V 1; the model accounts for the shift from additivity to near-averaging with increase in line length {{as a consequence of the}} increased contribution of shunting...|$|E

The slope was examined as a function of strength and the variables study time, list length, word frequency, and category membership. For normal distributions of familiarity, the slope of the z-ROC is the ratio of the new-item to old-item standard deviations. R. Ratcliff, C. -F. Sheu, and S. D. Gronlund (1992) found that the <b>slope</b> was <b>constant</b> within standard error as a function of strength of encoding, which is inconsistent with the predictions of the global memory models. The results presented here extend this finding: The <b>slope</b> was <b>constant</b> as a function of strength of encoding, list length, and the number of related items from a category in the study list. Word frequency did affect the slope, but within a frequency class the <b>slope</b> was <b>constant</b> as a function of strength. The implications of these data for the global memory models, the attention likelihood model, and variants of these models are discussed. This article presents six new experiments designed to add to the archival database for recognition memory and to test current models of recognition retrieval processes. Each experiment tested recognition memory for words; lists of single words were studied, and each study list was followed by a list of test words. For each test word, subjects were asked to decide whether it had appeared in the study list and to indicate how confident they were of their decision. The confidence judgments were used to construct a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve to show how discrimination of studied from nonstudied test words changes as a function of different criterion settings (i. e., different confidence levels). We repor...|$|R
