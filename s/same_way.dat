5|$|Calcium carbimide {{works in}} the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as disulfiram; it has an {{advantage}} in that the occasional adverse effects of disulfiram, hepatotoxicity and drowsiness, do not occur with calcium carbimide.|$|E
5|$|Later East Anglian kings claimed {{their right}} to rule by being descended from Wuffa, in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> that the Kentish kings claimed descent from Oisc.|$|E
5|$|The fourth jersey {{represented}} the young rider classification, {{marked by a}} white jersey. This was decided the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1985 were eligible.|$|E

5000|$|Errors of {{impunity}} can {{be caused}} in much the <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> as miscarriages of justice can, including, without limitation, the following: ...|$|R
50|$|Guineos {{are not to}} be {{confused}} with plantains, which are far starchier than the guineo and cannot be used in the <b>same</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{downline}} is a rope {{leading from}} the surface down to the underwater workplace. It allows a commercial diver to travel directly {{to and from the}} job site and to control rate of descent and ascent in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as using a shotline. Also sometimes called a jackstay.|$|E
5|$|Active collectors: these collect {{water in}} the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as a dehumidifier; {{although}} the designs work well, they require an energy source, making them uneconomical except in special circumstances. New, innovative designs seek to minimise the energy requirements of active condensers or make use of renewable energy resources.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation is {{the central}} unifying concept in {{behavioural}} ecology. Behaviours can be recorded as traits and inherited in much the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> that eye and hair colour can. Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive fitness.|$|E

50|$|Other semi-acoustic {{instruments}} include basses and mandolins. These {{are similarly}} constructed to semi-acoustic guitars, {{and are used}} in the <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> and with the same limitations.|$|R
50|$|It {{can clearly}} {{be seen that}} {{visuospatial}} dysgnosia does not present itself in the <b>same</b> <b>ways,</b> though {{all of the above}} cases were diagnosed with the disorder and other accompanying diseases.|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards {{the left side of}} the skull.|$|E
5|$|Centuries later, {{the region}} around Salerno {{was the only}} {{exception}} to the rule that (except for skipping units that had regionally fallen out of use) the apothecaries' ounce was subdivided down to the scruple in exactly the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as in the Roman system: It divided the ounce into 10drachms.|$|E
5|$|During the Kamakura and Muromachi period, samurai wore a short sword {{known as}} koshigatana in {{addition}} to the long tachi. Koshigatana were stuck directly into the belt in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as later the katana and uchigatana. They had a mounting without a guard (tsuba). The corresponding style is known as aikuchi ("fitting mouth") as the mouth of the scabbard meets the hilt directly without intervening guard.|$|E
50|$|Union and league {{have the}} <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> of scoring, {{but there are}} {{significant}} differences in the points awarded, and a few minor differences in the laws governing the scoring of tries.|$|R
5000|$|Halocarbons are {{typically}} {{classified in the}} <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> as the similarly structured organic compounds that have hydrogen atoms occupying the molecular sites of the halogen atoms in halocarbons. Among the chemical families are: ...|$|R

5|$|Egyptian gods were {{involved}} in human lives {{as well as in}} the overarching order of nature. This divine influence applied mainly to Egypt, as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside the divine order. But in the New Kingdom, when other nations were under Egyptian control, foreigners were said to be under the sun god's benign rule in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> that Egyptians were.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the New Centenary Camp (1 – 4 August 2007) hosted Scouts {{from both}} the United Kingdom and abroad, celebrating {{the start of the}} second century for Scouting. Scouts from all {{backgrounds}} and religions came together to show the world that peace is possible in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> that Baden-Powell brought together boys from different classes for the first camp back in 1907.|$|E
5|$|For a fully {{secret trust}} to be valid, therefore, it must be proved that there was intention, that this was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee {{accepted}} his obligations. Intention {{is one of the}} three certainties, and applies to {{fully secret trust}}s in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as it does to other express trusts.|$|E
50|$|Bézout's {{identity}} {{works for}} univariate polynomials over a field {{exactly in the}} <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> as for integers. In particular the Bézout's coefficients and the greatest common divisor may be computed with the Extended Euclidean algorithm.|$|R
50|$|Developmental {{psychology}} employs many of {{the research}} methods used {{in other areas of}} psychology. However, infants and children cannot be tested in the <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> as adults, so different methods are often used to study their development.|$|R
5000|$|In the Bengali language, mahalla (pronounced mo-hol-la) {{also means}} an urban neighbourhood.In Iran, mahalla {{is widely used}} in the <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> as {{mentioned}} above for urban neighborhoods.In South Africa, mahala is a slang term meaning [...] "free of charge".|$|R
5|$|Horse and cart – Especially in {{developing}} world areas, more {{traditional methods of}} transport include transport such as horse and cart, used in much the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as motorcycle or bicycle stretcher units to transport to a local clinic.|$|E
5|$|However, the President may again {{submit a}} written {{declaration}} of recovery to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. That declaration could be responded {{to by the}} Vice President {{and a majority of}} the Cabinet in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as stated earlier. The specified 21-day Congressional procedure would start again.|$|E
5|$|In {{much the}} <b>same</b> <b>way</b> {{that there is}} a {{national}} coat of arms, each province and territory possesses its own unique arms; Saskatchewan's is known formally as Her Majesty's Arms in Right of Saskatchewan. The year after Confederation, Queen Victoria issued Royal Warrants assigning arms to Canada's original four provinces: Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.|$|E
5000|$|The Great Vowel Shift {{occurred}} over centuries, {{and not all}} varieties of English were affected in the <b>same</b> <b>ways.</b> For example, some speakers in Scotland still pronounce house similarly to its sound in Middle English before the shift, as [...]|$|R
50|$|Custom scripted {{functions}} are called aliases. Aliases that return a value {{are known as}} custom identifiers. Both are called from the command line or other parts of a script in the <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> as built-in commands and identifiers (and can even supersede them).|$|R
5000|$|Aquatic insects {{or water}} insects live {{some portion of}} their life cycle in the water. They feed in the <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> as other insects. Some diving insects, such as predatory diving beetles, can hunt for food {{underwater}} where land-living insects cannot compete.|$|R
5|$|In the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as the {{logarithm}} reverses exponentiation, {{the complex}} logarithm is the inverse {{function of the}} exponential function applied to complex numbers. The discrete logarithm is another variant; it has uses in public-key cryptography.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{recorded}} visiting white-flowered plants {{include the}} Australian painted lady (Vanessa kershawi) and yellow admiral (V. itea), {{as well as}} bees. Field work in southern Tasmania showed that the introduced bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) sometimes robbed nectar by piercing {{the base of the}} tube. This then allowed honeybees (Apis mellifera) to retrieve nectar the <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> Epacris impressa is host to the scale insect Lecanodiaspis microcribraria.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and Cylindraspis tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, which became food for the parrots. Anodorhynchus macaws depended on now-extinct South American megafauna in the <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> but now rely on domesticated cattle for this service.|$|E
