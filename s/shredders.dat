5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is {{progressive}} metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style {{emerged in the}} United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day <b>shredders.</b>|$|E

An editor for the libertarian monthly Reason also speculated about the usefulness of the detailed information to government investigators. The original Ars Technica blog posting, on the other hand, dismissed privacy concerns, showing that the detail pages do not contain sensitive information.|$|E
5|$|The aquatic larvae {{are found}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{habitats}} such as streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, spring seeps and temporary waters (vernal pools). The larvae of many species use silk to make protective cases, which are often strengthened with gravel, sand, twigs, bitten-off pieces of plants, or other debris. The larvae exhibit various feeding strategies, with different species being predators, leaf <b>shredders,</b> algal grazers, or collectors of particles from the water column and benthos. Most adults have short lives during which they do not feed.|$|E

25|$|Since CD-Rs {{in general}} cannot be logically erased to any degree, the {{disposal}} of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Heating the disc in a microwave oven for 10–15 seconds effectively destroys the data layer by causing arcing in the metal reflective layer, but this same arcing may cause damage or excessive wear to the microwave oven.

50|$|By {{the time}} of the second season, Stockman was {{recovered}} and forced back into the <b>Shredder's</b> service, though now the Shredder has the power to torture him whenever he steps out of line. Stockman is able to trap the Turtles inside the Utroms' virtual reality, and when they do emerge, confronts them {{with the rest of the}} Foot. Professor Honeycutt later frees Stockman from the <b>Shredder's</b> control, and Stockman gleefully turns on his master and subdues him, leaving the Foot. After the <b>Shredder's</b> defeat, Stockman allied himself with Leatherhead, helping him to build a transmat to journey to the Utroms' homeworld. Stockman's deception is unveiled by the Turtles, and the scientist flees, but not before causing Leatherhead to become trapped in a cave-in. Stockman later allies himself with the mafia during the crime war in the wake of the power vacuum left by the <b>Shredder's</b> defeat.|$|R
500|$|In 1955, {{after five}} years of reconstruction, the Rotes Rathaus was fully {{operational}} and departments were able to move back into it from both administration buildings and from other more remote locations. Early in the same year, it was announced that Altes Stadthaus was to be transferred from the Magistrat (now of East Berlin, West Berlin having established the separate Berlin Senate) to the Council of Ministers of the GDR, which had been established in 1949, to house the significantly increased workforce. Altes Stadthaus was planned to be only an interim solution to this problem. Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl moved his offices into the building later that year, after renovation work to create appropriate accommodations that included furnishings for various official rooms, the planned expansion onto the fourth floor, upgrading of the stairways, ventilation equipment, and electrical work had been completed. Red carpets were laid in hallways and stair landings, and eventually paper <b>shredders</b> were placed in all offices. Between 1958–61, the building was extensively altered. The inner courtyard was covered [...] and the [...] "Bear Hall" [...] was converted into the chamber of the Council of Ministers. The hall capacity was reduced from 1,500 to 300 people, the windows and arcades on the long sides were closed off, wood wall moldings and a suspended ceiling installed to create a modern room within the space. The candelabra, bronze door grilles, and marble flooring were removed. In 1959, the bear statue was also removed and installed in the newly opened East Berlin zoo in Friedrichsfelde. A security zone was created {{at the front of the}} building. The public entrance to what was now the [...] "Building of the Council of Ministers" [...] was now on Klosterstraße. The main entrance facing Jüdenstraße, over which the GDR national emblem, the hammer and compass, was installed in place of the arms of the City of Berlin, was only opened on special occasions. The alterations demonstrated the negative opinion in the GDR of Wilhelmine architecture, and cost 2million marks.|$|E

2500|$|Biota {{should change}} with {{this change in}} energy from the {{headwaters}} {{to the mouth of}} these systems. [...] Namely, <b>shredders</b> should prosper in low-ordered systems and grazers in mid-ordered sites. [...] Microbial decomposition should play the largest role in energy production for low-ordered sites and large rivers, while photosynthesis, in addition to degraded allochthonous inputs from upstream will be essential in mid-ordered systems. [...] As mid-ordered sites will theoretically receive the largest variety of energy inputs, they might be expected to host the most biological diversity (Vannote et al. 1980).|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, Marshall updated {{its product}} line {{again with the}} JCM900 series. Reviewed by Guitarist {{magazine}} in the UK and given the line, [...] "Shredders, here is an amp you won't need to have modified", this move by Marshall was again an outgrowth of musicians' desires, featuring more distortion than ever and retaining popular aspects of the late JCM800 models. However, despite such marketing claims they were not as hi-gain as advertised and lacked a full gain stage. Marshall rectified this with the SL-X series (as used by the group Kiss). This model was one channel, 2 switchable master volumes, and was given an additional pre-amp ECC83/12AX7 instead of diode-based distortion. Still, if not for <b>shredders,</b> the JCM900 was well received by younger players associated with pop, rock, punk and grunge which was widespread by the early 1990s. The Dual Reverb was also notably used by Dave Navarro.|$|E

2500|$|Invertebrates can be {{organized}} into many feeding guilds in lotic systems. [...] Some species are <b>shredders,</b> which use large and powerful mouth parts {{to feed on}} non-woody CPOM and their associated microorganisms. [...] Others are suspension feeders, which use their setae, filtering aparati, nets, or even secretions to collect FPOM and microbes from the water. [...] These species may be passive collectors, utilizing the natural flow of the system, or they may generate their own current to draw water, and also, FPOM in Allan. [...] Members of the gatherer-collector guild actively search for FPOM under rocks and in other places where the stream flow has slackened enough to allow deposition. [...] Grazing invertebrates utilize scraping, rasping, and browsing adaptations to feed on periphyton and detritus. [...] Finally, several families are predatory, capturing and consuming animal prey. [...] Both {{the number of species}} and the abundance of individuals within each guild is largely dependent upon food availability. [...] Thus, these values may vary across both seasons and systems.|$|E

2500|$|Leaded {{glass from}} CRTs is reused in car batteries, ammunition, and lead wheel weights, or sold to {{foundries}} as a fluxing agent in processing raw lead ore. Copper, gold, palladium, silver and tin are valuable metals sold to smelters for recycling. Hazardous smoke and gases are captured, contained and treated to mitigate environmental threat. These methods allow for safe reclamation of all valuable computer construction materials. Hewlett-Packard product recycling solutions manager Renee St. Denis describes its process as: [...] "We move them through giant <b>shredders</b> about 30 {{feet tall and}} it shreds everything into pieces {{about the size of}} a quarter. Once your disk drive is shredded into pieces about this big, it's hard to get the data off". An ideal electronic waste recycling plant combines dismantling for component recovery with increased cost-effective processing of bulk electronic waste. Reuse is an alternative option to recycling because it extends the lifespan of a device. Devices still need eventual recycling, but by allowing others to purchase used electronics, recycling can be postponed and value gained from device use.|$|E
