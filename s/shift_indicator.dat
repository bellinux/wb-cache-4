40|$|European {{regulations}} set {{the emissions}} requirements for new vehicles at 130 g CO 2 /km, {{with an additional}} 10 g CO 2 /km to be achieved by additional complementary measures, including gear <b>shift</b> <b>indicators.</b> However, there is presently little knowledge of how much fuel or CO 2 could actually be saved {{by the introduction of}} gear <b>shift</b> <b>indicators,</b> and there is no consensus on how these savings should be quantified. This study presents a procedure which allows these savings to be quantified over a New European Driving Cycle, and explores the trade-off between fuel savings and drivability. A vehicle model was established and calibrated using data obtained from pedal ramp tests conducted at steady speed using a chassis dynamometer, significantly reducing the time required to generate a calibration data set when compared with a steady-state mapping approach. This model was used for the optimisation of gear shift points on the New European Driving Cycle for reduced fuel consumption subject to drivability constraints. During model validation the greatest fuel saving achieved experimentally for a warm engine was 3. 6 % over the New European Driving Cycle, within the constraints imposed using subjective driver appraisal of vehicle drivability. The same shift strategy for a cold start driving cycle showed a fuel saving of 4. 3 % over the baseline, with corresponding savings in CO 2 of 4. 5 % or 6. 4 g CO 2 /km. For both hot and cold tests the savings were made entirely in the urban phase of the New European Driving Cycle; {{there were no significant differences}} in fuel consumption in the extra-urban phase. These results suggest that the introduction of gear <b>shift</b> <b>indicators</b> could have a substantial impact, contributing significantly towards the 10 g CO 2 /km to be achieved by additional complementary measures when assessed in this way. It is not clear whether these savings would translate into real world driving conditions, but for legislative purposes an assessment procedure based on the New European Driving Cycle remains a logical choice for simplicity and continuity...|$|R

Large fuel savings are possible by targeting the role of driver behaviour in the protection of the environment, and teaching them how to ‘eco-drive’. This study forms part of the ecoDriver project, which aims to develop an in-vehicle eco-driving support system.

A driving simulator was used to test three potential eco-driving interfaces which used a common eco-driving guidance algorithm.

Objective eco-driving performance was measured as the error between desired accelerator position defined by the system and accelerator position selected by the driver.

A set of optimum gear ratios are determined for 4, 5 and 6 -speed transmission systems as the governing parameters in the optimisation process.

A 7. 5 % reduction in the BSFC and 6. 75 % in NOx are attainable in the best case scenario for a 6 -speed transmission and a gear shifting strategy, based on the least BSFC for the case of the chosen engine.

We review these features, suggest several new ones and test most of them in implemented topic segmentation algorithms. Hints about topic boundaries include repetitions of character sequences, patterns of word and word n-gram repetition, word frequency, the presence of cue words and phrases and the use of synonyms. ^ The algorithms we present use cues singly or in combination to identify topic shifts in several kinds of documents. One algorithm tracks compression performance, which is an <b>indicator</b> of topic <b>shift</b> because self-similarity within topic segments should be greater than between-segment similarity. Another technique relies on word repetition and places boundaries by minimizing word repetitions across segment boundaries. A third method compares the performance of a language model with and without knowledge of the contents of preceding sentences to determine whether a topic shift has occurred. We use the output of this algorithm in a statistical model which incorporates synonymy, bigram repetition and other features for topic segmentation. ^ We benchmark our algorithms and compare them to algorithms from the literature using concatenations of documents, and then perform further evaluation of our techniques using a collection of news broadcasts transcribed both by annotators and using a speech recognition system. We also test the effectiveness of our algorithms for identifying both chapter boundaries in works of literature and story boundaries in Spanish news broadcasts. ^ We suggest ways to improve information retrieval, language modeling and various natural language processing algorithms by exploiting the topic segmentation. ...|$|R

This phenomenon, known as critical slowing down CSD], leads to {{spatial and temporal}} signatures in ecological state variables, thus potentially offering early <b>indicators</b> of regime <b>shifts.</b> <b>Indicators</b> using temporal dynamics have been empirically validated in laboratory microcosms and other well-mixed systems, but tests of spatial <b>indicators</b> of regime <b>shifts</b> at large spatial scales {{in the field are}} rare due to the relative absence of high-resolution data and difficulties in experimental manipulations. Here, we test theoretical predictions of CSD-based spatial indicators using large-scale field data from the Serengeti-Mara grassland-woodland system. Location: Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, Tanzania and Kenya. Time period: Year 2000 Major taxa studied: Vegetation Method: We used a space-for-time substitution method to empirically test the validity of CSD-based spatial indicators, i. e., we computed indicators along a spatial in lieu of temporal] gradient of ecological states. First we used a model of vegetation dynamics to determine if our space-for-time substitution method was appropriate. Then we tested for CSD-based spatial indicators using high-resolution spatial vegetation 30 m] and rainfall 2. 5 km] data from the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. Results: Our model predicts that CSD-based indicators increase along a spatial gradient of alternative vegetation states. Empirical analyses suggest that grasslands and woodlands occur as alternative stable states in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem with rainfall as one of the potential drivers of transitions between these states. We found that four indices of CSD showed the theoretically expected increasing trends along spatial gradients of grasslands to woodlands: spatial variance, spatial skewness, spatial correlation at lag- 1 and spatial spectra at low frequencies. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that CSD-based spatial indicators can offer early warning signals of critical transitions in large-scale ecosystems...|$|R
