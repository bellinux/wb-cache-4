25|$|After the Americans {{launched}} an invasion in July 1812, the war raged {{back and forth}} along the border of Upper Canada, on land {{as well as on}} the waters of the Great Lakes. The British succeeded in capturing Detroit in July, and again in October. On July 12, US General William Hull invaded Canada at Sandwich (later known as Windsor). The invasion was quickly halted and Hull withdrew, giving General Isaac Brock the excuse he needed to abandon his previous orders and advance on Detroit, securing Shawnee chief Tecumseh's aid to do <b>so.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> even with his aboriginal allies, Brock was outnumbered approximately two to one. However, Brock had gauged Hull as a timid man, and particularly as being afraid of Tecumseh's confederacy; he was thus able to convince Hull to surrender. The defeat of Detroit was utter and complete. A major American thrust across the Niagara frontier was defeated at the Battle of Queenston Heights, where Sir Isaac Brock lost his life.|$|E
500|$|The {{scenes with}} Tyler Durden were staged to conceal that the {{character}} was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. The character was not filmed in two shots {{with a group of}} people, nor was he shown in any over the shoulder shots in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for subliminal effect. Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a [...] "little devil on the shoulder". Fincher explained the subliminal frames: [...] "Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> he exists only {{on the periphery of the}} Narrator's consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|The seal from 1752 {{is shown}} in Figure 2. The beaver honored Albany's past as an {{important}} fur trading port. Adding {{to the history of}} this seal, one historian states, [...] " [...] displays the beaver, but looking in the original, more like a drowned cat than the fat and sleek animal, it was intended to represent. Neither the resolution nor the records state why the change was made." [...] In 1755 the original seal (Figure 1) was reinstated for use by the mayor in licensing businesses. <b>So</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> the city had two seals, one corporate and one public. The earlier seal, however, was last seen in 1761 and the beaver continued as the sole city seal from then on.|$|E

500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. <b>So</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
2500|$|At 11:30p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged {{down two}} Milwaukee police {{officers}} {{at the corner of}} North 25th Street. The officers noted Edwards had a handcuff attached to his wrist, whereupon Edwards explained to the officers that a [...] "freak" [...] had placed the handcuffs upon him and asked if the police could remove them. When the officers' handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping. When the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, Dahmer invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had indeed placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done <b>so.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> Edwards divulged to the officers that Dahmer had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. Dahmer made no comment to this revelation; indicating to one of the officers, Rolf Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser in the bedroom. As Mueller entered the bedroom, Dahmer attempted to pass Mueller to himself retrieve the key, whereupon the second officer present, Robert Rauth, informed him to [...] "back off".|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} little {{research}} on methods of the allosteric regulation of sucrose phosphorylase, <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> the function of allosteric molecules can only be hypothesized. Due {{to the nature of}} its function in metabolic pathways, it is likely that sucrose phosphorylase is additionally regulated by other common metabolites. For example, the presence of ATP would probably inhibit sucrose phosphorylase since ATP {{is a product of the}} catabolic pathway. Conversely, ADP would likely stimulate sucrose phosphorylase to increase levels of ATP. Further research on the subject would be required to support or refute these ideas.|$|E

50|$|The four {{above-mentioned}} books, {{produced in}} the years 1998-2012, deal with all genres of Faroese folk singing, <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> Marianne Clausen’s work with preserving and publishing these folk melodies was finished. She was, however, called on by many to write a primer, or textbook, {{which could be used}} in music teaching, in the Faroes and elsewhere, about Faroese folk singing. This resulted in her last book, Føroya ljóð - Sound of the Faroes from 2014, like her four previous books with cover painted by Tróndur Patursson, and with text only on the book spine. Here she presented 280 of her previously published melody examples, and used them in a discussion of, among other things, the tonality of the melodies, which is briefly referred below.|$|E
