2500|$|The Jewish {{community}} in Omaha, Nebraska, {{has made significant}} cultural, economic and <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> to the city. The first Jewish settlers came to the city shortly after {{it was founded in}} 1856. [...] The most numerous Jewish immigrants were from eastern Europe and the Russian Empire. [...] They arrived in four waves of immigration to the US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [...] Immigrants were active in working class and socialist politics, especially during the 1920s and 1930s. [...] Others established themselves as merchants and businessmen in the city. The Jewish community supported philanthropy and created important cultural and charitable institutions. Born to socialist parents in Omaha, renowned Jewish feminist author Tillie Olsen worked when she was young in the meatpacking plants and helped organize unions. The Jewish youth organization Aleph Zadik Aleph was established by immigrants in Omaha.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{competition}} among universities {{has a whole}} new face, and emphasis is given toward interdependence and interactive evolution between universities and regions. From this social perspective, universities should contribute to regional development by serving the regional society using results of intellectual work, and {{it is necessary for}} universities to accomplish <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> and regional cooperation strategically. One of the most important parts in strategic planning is that students participate in activities for <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> and regional cooperation. This paper presents a survey of the university students’ awareness on <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> and regional cooperation using several statistical methods and attempts to find factors which affect activities for <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> and regional cooperation using logistic regression analysis...|$|R

2500|$|In Estonia, {{which has}} had a flat tax since 1994 (rate has been 20% since 2015, and used to be 21-26%), {{studies have shown that}} the {{significant}} increase in tax revenue experienced was caused partly by a disproportionately rising VAT revenue. Moreover, Estonia and Slovakia have high <b>social</b> <b>contributions,</b> pegged to wage levels. Both matters raise questions regarding the justice of the flat tax system, and thus its long-term political sustainability. The Estonian economist and former chairman of his country's parliamentary budget committee Olev Raju, stated in September 2005 that [...] "income disparities are rising and calls for a progressive system of taxation are getting louder – this could put an end to the flat tax after the next election". However, this did not happen, because after the 2007 elections a right-wing coalition was formed which stated its will to keep the flat tax in existence. However, critics argue that the tax rates these countries have are actually more progressive than flat.|$|E

In the morally fraught domain of criminal justice, we perpetrate this injustice in many ways, including in our tendency to see people who have committed offences as social threats. One way that we exhibit this tendency in our use of classificatory terms such as ‘murderer’ and ‘rapist’ that essentialise people’s wrongdoing. We also engage in more concrete, material forms of <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> injustice when we give people criminal records they can never spend, impose punishments that stretch or sever their social bonds, and deny them support when {{they are trying to}} reintegrate after punishment.

The results of econometric models suggest that the activities of the Tax Administration of the Republic of Slovenia, which were more stringently performed in the area of <b>social</b> security <b>contributions</b> in the most recent period, are an important - but not the only factor - behind the higher level of compliance in connection with <b>social</b> security <b>contributions.</b> At the same time, the decrease in tax compliance with other taxes (income tax, corporate income tax, and VAT) did not essentially influence the higher level of compliance with <b>social</b> security <b>contributions.</b> The more consistent treatment of unpaid <b>social</b> security <b>contributions</b> as a criminal offence and the higher public awareness about the importance of paying <b>social</b> security <b>contributions</b> in the latest period are recognized as important factors which simultaneously constitute the main difference between <b>social</b> security <b>contributions</b> and other taxes. The higher level of public awareness about the benefits that result from public services financed with taxes is recognized as a possible way to more optimally collect taxes in Slovenia...|$|R
