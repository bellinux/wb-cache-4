5|$|Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit {{stops to}} change to {{intermediate}} tyres on lap 12. After his early pit <b>stop,</b> <b>Button</b> moved up to eighth place on the lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops the following lap, with Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on the 14th lap and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times {{in an attempt to}} move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off the track at the Spoon Curve, rejoining the race at the run-off area. The mistake reduced the time deficit by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, and began a challenge for the position. Vettel moved to the inside lane and passed Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on the lap. Although Ricciardo attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency <b>stop</b> <b>button,</b> only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E
25|$|Through 21 CFR 1040, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates laser {{products}} entering {{commerce and}} requires all classIIIb and classIV lasers offered in commerce in the US to have five standard safety features: a key switch, a safety interlock dongle, a power indicator, an aperture shutter, and an emission delay (normally {{two to three}} seconds). OEM lasers, designed to be parts of other components (such as DVD burners), are exempt from this requirement.

25|$|McLaren {{brought in}} both Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen for their second stops, and Timo Glock also pitted. The Safety Car was not deemed {{necessary}} to clear Webber's car, giving Jenson Button, {{who had been}} following Kovalainen, the opportunity {{to put in a}} series of fast laps before his pit stop. With Barrichello running in seventh after a small problem at his second pit <b>stop,</b> <b>Button</b> had an opportunity to stay ahead of his teammate and extend his Championship lead. He pitted on lap 51, emerging in a net fifth position behind the impressively recovering Vettel and ahead of Barrichello.|$|E
25|$|At Spa, he {{qualified}} 4th, but {{suffered from}} anti-stall {{for the third}} time in 2009 and he found himself last, but missed the first lap crash which took out four drivers including teammate Button. While the safety car was out he pitted and changed strategy which enabled him to climb back up to 7th. During the last three laps the car had an engine oil leak, but he still managed to finish, before his car caught fire in the pit lane after the race. At Monza, he qualified 5th, despite carrying more fuel to try a different strategy with only one stop. After passing Kovalainen at the start, Barrichello managed not to lose too much time, as he had the advantage of just one stop against Hamilton, Räikkönen and Sutil's two stop strategy. By Hamilton's second pit <b>stop,</b> <b>Button</b> and Barrichello were running first and second. Hamilton tried to pressure Button by forcing his car, but on the last lap he crashed, giving third place to Räikkönen, and fourth to Sutil. Barrichello won the 11th race in his Formula One career, and gained more points on Button in their fight for the world title.|$|E

The common features of such units are the ability to manually send the robot to a desired position, or [...] "inch" [...] or [...] "jog" [...] to adjust a position. They also have a means to change the speed since a low speed is usually required for careful positioning, or while test-running through a new or modified routine.

2500|$|In {{a typical}} hard wired motor {{start and stop}} circuit (called a control circuit) a motor is started by pushing a [...] "Start" [...] or [...] "Run" [...] button that {{activates}} a pair of electrical relays. The [...] "lock-in" [...] relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the <b>stop</b> <b>button</b> is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The [...] "lock in" [...] contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a [...] "stop" [...] or [...] "off" [...] button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.|$|E
50|$|Skill <b>stop</b> <b>buttons</b> predated the Bally {{electromechanical}} {{slot machines}} of the 1960s and 70s. They appeared on mechanical slot machines manufactured by Mills Novelty Co. {{as early as}} the mid 1920s. These machines had modified reel-stop arms, which allowed them to be released from the timing bar, earlier than in a normal play, simply by pressing the buttons {{on the front of the}} machine, located between each reel.|$|R
