5|$|The TWHNC {{features}} {{a wide variety}} of classes in both in-hand and performance, including divisions for youth, amateurs, and professionals. Horses may be <b>shod</b> <b>with</b> keg shoes or performance stacks; flat-shod classes are particularly popular among amateur owners who train their own horses. Leadline classes, for children under six, are a crowd favorite. All horses entered must be registered with the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association, although some may be registered with the Spotted Saddle Horse and Racking Horse associations as well. Double registration does not affect a horse's ability to enter the Celebration.|$|E

A racing version was campaigned in rallies and developed during 1979 and 1980 seasons: entries backed by Jolly Club were driven by Pregliasco, Ormezzano and Verini.

25|$|During the Second World War the Meccano factory was commandeered by {{the invading}} Germans {{and used in}} the Nazi war effort. The Bobigny factory was also {{produced}} an equivalent toy to the Meccano using the Märklin name. From 1945, the model vehicles were forcibly <b>shod</b> <b>with</b> solid metal wheels and the pumps did not have rubber hoses due to the shortage of rubber which was needed for the army. In the early post war period, rubber was needed badly as the French supply came from Cambodia and Laos in war against France, rubber tyres were not fitted on models until 1950. In 1951, the headquarters and offices which were still at Rue Rebeval closed and Dinky Toys production was now solely based at Bobigny.

2500|$|One {{drawback}} of oxen was {{the difficulty}} of shoeing. Oxen hooves are cloven (split), {{and they had to}} be <b>shod</b> <b>with</b> two curved pieces of metal, one {{on each side of the}} hoof. While horses and mules allowed themselves to be shod relatively easily, the process was more difficult with oxen, which would lie down and tuck their feet under themselves. [...] As a result, several men had to lift and hold an ox while he was being shod.|$|E
2500|$|British frogmen of World War II and {{for some}} time {{afterwards}} used a similar one or two piece rubberized knit fabric suit by Siebe Gorman. They produced the one-piece front-entry Sladen suit with integral rubber helmet, developed by the British Admiralty for use with manned torpedoes, and in the late 1950s also the Essjee two-piece swim suit, based on the Sladen suit. The Essjee suit consisted of a jacket with rubber hood and lightweight wrist cuffs, and trousers <b>shod</b> <b>with</b> moulded rubber soles. The two parts were sealed by rolling the overlapped rubber skirts of the jacket and trousers together and these were {{held in place by}} a separate rubber cummerbund. Soft sponge-rubber pads inside the hood covered the ears and allowed them to be equalised. There was space under the suit for plenty of [...] woollen underclothes. The suit was available in proofed gabardine or rubberised stockinette, with the cloth on the outside and the rubber inside, to protect the rubber from sunlight while in use.|$|E

40|$|Veterinarians had {{different}} names throughout the 19 th century in Spain: veterinary surgeons, farriers, castrators, marshals, etc., {{and they were}} not professionally and socially recognized until the 20 th century. In 1850 they were given sanitary and zootechnical responsibilities, although many of them continued practicing horse <b>shodding.</b> <b>With</b> the creation of veterinary schools, the foundations of modern veterinary medicine were established in Spain; this has a special importance for public health issues, especially regarding figures like deputy veterinary and meat inspector, as they tried to understand the impact of animal diseases on the population who consumed animal meat. Studies in the Historical Archives of Jerez de los Caballeros (Badajoz, Spain) made it possible to analyze how veterinary professionals lived and worked there during the 19 th century, how they settled in or left the city, how they treated epidemics in animals for human consumption, and how they suffered the economic difficulties of the period and the City.

2500|$|The name [...] "Walton" [...] is Anglo-Saxon {{in origin}} and is cognate {{with the common}} phonetic {{combination}} meaning [...] "Briton settlement" [...] (literally, [...] "Welsh Town" [...] – weal(as) tun). Before the Romans and the Saxons were present, a Celtic settlement was here. The most common Old English word for the Celtic inhabitants was the [...] "Wealas", originally meaning [...] "foreigners" [...] or [...] "strangers". William Camden identified Cowey Stakes or Sale, Walton as the place where Julius Caesar forded the River Thames on his second invasion of Britain, which stakes the Venerable Bede spoke of remaining in his time. A fisherman removed several stakes about thigh-width and [...] made of wood that was very black and hard enough to turn an axe, and <b>shod</b> <b>with</b> iron. He sold these to John Montagu, 5th Earl of Sandwich, who used {{to come to the}} neighbouring Shepperton bank to fish, for half a guinea a piece.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was {{to examine the effects of}} footwear on kinetics and lower extremity electromyographic (EMG) activity during the vertical jump (VJ) and standing long jump. Fifteen men performed the 2 jump types in 3 footwear conditions: barefoot, minimal shoes, and cross-training shoes. Jump displacement and kinetic data were collected, along with EMG activity of the biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, peroneus longus, semitendinosus/semimembranosus, soleus (SOL), tibialis anterior, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis. Subjective footwear performance and comfort were also assessed with a custom survey. No differences were found in jump displacement, peak ground reaction forces (GRF), countermovement and propulsive phase durations, vertical impulse, peak countermovement, or average propulsive EMG activity. Significant differences in peak propulsive root mean square EMG were found between barefoot and minimal shoes (p = 0. 030) and minimal shoes and shod (p = 0. 031) conditions for the SOL during the VJ, and for average countermovement EMG of the semitendinosus/semimembranosus during the VJ between barefoot and shod (p = 0. 039). Moderate-to-large effect sizes (3 ̆e 0. 59) were found between conditions for horizontal GRF, propulsive phase duration, average EMG amplitude, and duration of EMG activity during the countermovement. Participants reported higher comfort ratings when <b>shod</b> compared <b>with</b> barefoot and minimal shoes for both jumps. Participants also perceived better performance when <b>shod</b> compared <b>with</b> barefoot and minimal shoes for the VJ only. No acute differences in displacement were observed between barefoot, minimal shoes, and cross-trainer shoes during vertical and horizontal jumps. Some differences in muscle activation and timing seem to be present, and thus, training effects between footwear conditions should be examined. Footwear familiarization may prove beneficial, as acute increases in comfort seem unrelated to performance improvements...|$|R
