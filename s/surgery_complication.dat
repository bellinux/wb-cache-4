40|$|Background: CBD {{stones are}} the commonest cause of obstructive {{jaundice}} and cholangitis and in elderly patients with major underlying disease {{has a high}} incidence of mortality. Materials and Methods: In this study, we overviewed 200 patients with CBD stones which treated with cholecystectomy and Endoscopic sphinctrotomy or cholecystectomy and open CBD Exploration, and compare them for <b>surgery</b> <b>complication,</b> treatment failure and hospitalization complications. Results: We found that these two groups were equal for <b>surgery</b> <b>complication</b> and morbidity. But in patients with Endoscopic sphinctrotomy they had added complication of this procedure. Failure in stone removal both immediately after procedure and in final assessment and costs was considerably higher in the patients that were treated with Endoscopic sphinctrotomy. Conclusion: These results do not support preoperative Endoscopic sphinctrotomy as a technique for stone removal on the basis of efficacy, morbidity rate and cost. But overall conclusion about comparison of two methods is dependant to other studies about long term morbidity and other factors that affect results...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{demonstrate}} {{an unusual}} case of orbital trauma due to dental <b>surgery</b> <b>complication.</b> Observations: An elderly patient who underwent dental implantation to the zygomatic bone was hospitalized in the ophthalmology department with impaired abduction {{of her right}} eye, also evident on ocular examination. Head computed tomography demonstrated damage to the lateral rectus and to the inferior oblique muscles. Clinical assessment determined these muscles could not be repaired and reattached. The extent of irreversible damage in the patient was permanent limitation in movement of her affected eye with subsequent strabismus. Conclusions and importance: Accurate pre-operative planning of dental zygomatic implant insertion, as well as selecting the size {{and direction of the}} implant, are imperative. Moreover, performing surgery in multidisciplinary centers with oculofacial plastic surgeons in such cases, may reduce risk of this complication, make it a safer procedure, and allow immediate treatment when required...|$|E
40|$|Toxic {{anterior}} segment syndrome (TASS) is {{a sterile}} intraocular inflammation caused by noninfectious substances, resulting in extensive toxic {{damage to the}} intraocular tissues. Possible etiologic factors of TASS include surgical trauma, bacterial endotoxin, intraocular solutions with inappropriate pH and osmolality, preservatives, denatured ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVD), inadequate sterilization, cleaning and rinsing of surgical devices, intraocular lenses, polishing and sterilizing compounds which are related to intraocular lenses. The characteristic signs and symptoms such as blurred vision, corneal edema, hypopyon and nonreactive pupil usually occur 24 hours after the cataract surgery. The differential diagnosis of TASS from infectious endophthalmitis is important. The main treatment for TASS formation is prevention.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The New York (NY) State Inpatient Database was used to query 8, 117 cases of diverticular disease occurring in patients aged 65 - 85 in 2006. Race and SES were assessed by creating a composite score based on race, primary insurance payer, and median income bracket. RESULTS: Primary outcomes were differences in disease presentation, use of elective <b>surgery,</b> <b>complication</b> rates when surgery was performed, and overall mortality and length of stay. Patients of lower SES were younger, {{more likely to be}} female, to have multiple co-morbid conditions, to present as emergent/urgent admissions, and to present with diverticulitis complicated by hemorrhage (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001).

A 61 -year-old male with a 20 -year history of progressive bilateral profound {{sensorineural hearing loss}} underwent cochlear implant surgery on the left ear with Clarion Hi-Res 90 K (Advanced Bionics, Sylmar, CA, USA). Ten days after surgery, the patient presented visible tumefaction behind the ear corresponding to the receiver-stimulator. Ultrasonography, with a probe of 30 MHz, of the surface behind the ear showed formation of probable liquid content but aspiration with a 20 -gauge needle yielded 30 cm 3 of air without blood or pus. An unusual case is described of a minor complication occurring in an adult cochlear implant patient presenting a swelling behind the ear that {{was found to be}} collected air. Although ultrasonography can be useful to evaluate localization of swelling behind the ear and to differentiate between liquid and solid collection, it is not useful for identification of air collection.

Objective. The {{aim of this study}} is to present patients with pyoderma gangrenosum which imitated breast cancer and their treatment. Case report. Two women suspected of having breast cancer developed painful and non-healing ulceration after surgical excision of nodules. Although in histopathology mastopathic changes were described, the diagnosis was verified and subsequent biopsies showed no cancerous changes. Ulcerations were treated as an infectious <b>surgery</b> <b>complication.</b> The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum was made on the basis of characteristic anamnesis, clinical features and histopathological examination. In the treatment cyclosporine with dapsone and cyclosporine with glucocorticosteroids were used and a very quick local response and pain relief were obtained. Conclusions. The presented cases illustrate diagnostic difficulties and the role of the pathergy phenomenon in the development of pyoderma gangrenosum lesions. The course and treatment of the disease in both cases also reveal the ineffectiveness of monotherapy with glucocorticosteroids...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the UCSD {{experience}} with 456 consecutive carotid endarterectomy procedures confirms the acceptably low operative mortality and morbidity associated with this operation. Immediate complications were not different when routine or selective shunting was performed, but the patients with a low internal carotid artery back pressure had higher operative complication rates. The coexistence of atherosclerosis {{in other parts of}} the body severe-enough to warrant surgery for them was not associated with either higher early or late carotid <b>surgery</b> <b>complication</b> rates. Following both coronary bypass and carotid procedures, the late mortality was decreased, and the late incidence of stroke was particularly low in comparison to the remainder of the patient group. Late follow-up emphasized the high continuing attrition rate from all causes in these patients. Late strokes continued to occur, particularly in patients with prior strokes and severe preoperative bilateral carotid disease. The late course of patients with posterior circulation transient ischemic attacks treated by carotid endarterectomy was quite similar to that of patients treated for anterior circulation transient ischemia attacks (TIAs). Newer postoperative screening procedures may decrease the incidence of late postoperative stroke by identifying recurrent carotid stenosis while it is still in the asymptomatic stage...|$|E
40|$|General {{anesthesia}} is {{an essential}} part in dental practice. It is a drug- induced loss of consciousness administered by a qualified dentist or by anesthesiologist, to provide conditions favorable and convenient for surgery both for the patient and the dentist. Certain criteria should be fulfilled to preform general anesthesia such as patient evaluation, preoperative preparation, personnel and equipment requirements, monitoring and documentation and recovery and discharge. General anesthetic drugs are classified into 3 major groups such as intravenous that act on GABAA receptors and produce mainly immobilization and unconsciousness, gaseous anesthetics mainly acting on NMDA receptors and 2 P domain potassium channels and volatile halogenated anesthetics acting on GABA, glycin, 2 P potassium and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. All these drugs have certain effect on the CNS, respiratory and cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal systems. Under the effect of general anesthesia in oral and maxillofacial <b>surgery</b> <b>complication</b> can occur either intraoperative or postoperatively related to nervous, cardiopulmonary or gastrointestinal system.

The study aim to compare thyroid surgery complications with and without drains appliance. Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted, 66 patients who were candidate for thyroid surgery (total- subtotal thyroidectomy and thyroid lobectomy) divided into 2 groups. Each group was randomized into "drain " and "non drain " subgroup. Some indicators were investigated such as primary thyroid size, fluid collection in thyroid bed (early and late), hospital stay, change in voice, dysphagia, wound infection, hematoma, seroma, and change in plasma calcium level. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square test and Student’s T test. Results: Duration of hospitalization in the patients without drains and received drain group were 2. 3 and 3 days, respectively (p 0. 05) of fluid collection in thyroid bed and the incidence of other complications after surgery Conclusion: Routine use drains usage after thyroid surgery may not be necessary.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{introduction}} of minimally invasive valve surgery {{has been associated}} with an increased use of peripheral vessel cannulation in cardiopulmonary bypass. These techniques are associated with potential problems at the aorta or cannulation sites. The goal {{of this study was to}} review and describe our current practice to avoid vascular problems during cannulation of peripheral vessels. MethodData collection for this study was done retrospectively by reviewing the files of all patients who underwent a minimally invasive mitral and/or tricuspid surgery in our institution from 1997 to the end of 2005. ResultsOur cohort of 978 patients revealed an overall rate of peripheral vascular complication of 1. 0 % with 44. 4 % presenting at the time of the surgery and 63. 6 % at long-term follow-up. Acute peripheral vascular problems were treated by simple graft replacement of the diseased segment in most cases. All aortic complications happened at the time of the <b>surgery</b> (<b>complication</b> rate of 0. 9 %) with 60 % of them associated with cannulation problems. Most patients were treated by replacement of the ascending aorta. ConclusionsA systematic and careful approach is associated with a low risk of vascular problems. Prevention and planning with precise surgical technique remain the main conditions to safely use peripheral cannulation and perfusion for minimally invasive mitral valve surgery...|$|E
40|$|Page kidney {{is one of}} {{secondary}} arterial hypertension forms and it is due to external compression of renal parenchyma. Hematomas, masses or fluid collection, that lead to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, resulting in systemic hypertension and then renal failure are the main causes. Nowadays higher necessity of kidney transplants led to more frequent use of marginal grafts, exposed to major risk of primary non function, delayed graft function or acute post-surgical complications such as capsular detachment and following hematoma. Page effect must be suspected when we notice serum creatinine increase, diuresis contraction and arterial hypertension. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) could allow diagnosis but CT scan may detect even very small hematomas that require urgent surgical drainage {{in order to obtain}} rapid recovery of renal function.
