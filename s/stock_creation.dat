40|$|Tropical forests play an {{important}} role in mitigation of climate change and are the habitat for traditional and indigenous forest communities. We hypothesised that in order to improve the forest conservation by local inhabitants and to increase their revenue from the work with non-timber forest products (NTFPs), organisational, methodical as well as financial support is required. We concentrated on Brazil nuts as a profitable NTFP. After conducting field research of economic activities in two forest communities of Rond 4;nia, Brazil, we conducted three stages of longitudinal experimental research while applying the Fair Trade concept. We organised a team of Brazil nut harvesters, developed a harvesting strategy, provided pre-financing for the <b>stock</b> <b>creation</b> of Brazil nuts and created a sales plan. Analysis of these interventions suggested that through organisational support and pre-financing, Brazil nut harvesters were able to organise themselves to increase their income and manage new forest territories sustainably. We identified the relationship between external support continuity, size of pre-financing and number of participants, their income as well as the size of managed forest territory. Clear land tenure and technical, organisational and marketing assistance are essential throughout the first years of intervention...|$|E

The study also analyses {{the performance of the}} merged banks in relation to a control group based on financial ratios. The results of cumulative abnormal returns analysis signify that merger announcements are value-creating activities for the acquirer banks. At the same time, merger announcements erode shareholder wealth for the target banks. The framework of pre-merger and post-merger comparison of the operating performance of the acquirer banks was based on three models whereby the cash flow was deflated by market value of assets, book value of assets, and income. The result does not provide evidence to support the view that corporate performance improves after mergers. bank mergers; cumulative abnormal returns; CAR; acquirer banks; target banks; cash flow models; value creation; banking industry; India; stock market wealth creation; operating performance; financial ratios; shareholder wealth. ...|$|R
50|$|The use {{of private}} {{flows of capital}} and <b>stock</b> market <b>creation</b> began to shape into a new theory of {{development}} put forward by the World Bank’s World Development Report for 2000. Foreign investors {{should have access to}} “well-regulated” financial markets which would provide the “surest path” to economic development. Businesses in low-income countries gain direct access to the private capital from industrialized countries. Companies in developing countries do not have to rely on loans or aid that are negotiated through political means and receive capital directly from private investors. This would free capital from exposure to inefficient or corrupt government structures, unleash local entrepreneurial potential and hopefully improve economic growth. This would encourage policy and corporate managers to make “future-oriented decisions about the governance of their economic system.” Capital-deprived developing countries can craft policies to convince investors about the future prospects of their country. Instead of relying on the slow process of domestic capital accumulation, they can sell equity to or borrow from foreign investors and spur economic development faster. “Moreover, stock markets generate a wealth of intelligence through the operation of the price system, which helps guide decisions of both managers and investors. The benefits to investors are rooted in prospective growth rates unattainable in advanced economies and high returns matching the risks involved.” This is known as the “financial market theory of development.” There is an assumption that accompanies this theory; it implies that stock markets will improve economic growth to the degree based on how integrated they are into an “institutional matrix” that sends signals to decisions makers who would look for growth opportunities (Weber, Davis and Lounsbury, p. 1322).|$|R

40|$|Large grazing ungulates—notably cattle, elk and American bison—if given {{a choice}} exhibit a grazing {{preference}} for regrowth on recently burned areas of grassland. Traditional rangeland management approaches that minimize inherent rangeland heterogeneity are increasingly understood as counter to the evolutionary history of rangeland. Heterogeneity is defi ned as variation in the characteristics of vegetation including species, biomass, and height. Recent research now fi nds an alternative approach to rangeland management through patch burning, giving a variegated texture to the grazing land and more closely simulating the earlier evolutionary pattern of much North American rangeland. Patch burning creates a mosaic of patches at varying stages of recovery from burning and grazing disturbance. Advantages include more diverse plant and animal habitats, more consistent fuel <b>stock</b> control, and <b>creation</b> of the grazing habitat preferred by both domesticated cattle and indigenous grazing species.

40|$|International audienceFrom {{time immemorial}} until the Renaissance {{one could not}} {{separate}} architecture from its education. Although {{there is evidence that}} architecture was discussed from antiquity by such important thinkers as Plato in Ancient Greece, Vitruvius in Ancient Rome and the master builders (Villard de Honnecourt, Mathes Röriczer, etc.) in the Middle Ages, there are no suggestions of formal courses taking place anywhere. The Renaissance brought the first from a series of three dissociations (Tschumi, 1995) in the field of architecture: a schism between practice and theory. The following dissociations occurred under the auspices of their own socio-cultural revolution (Choay, 2006), leading to ‘the moment of architecture’s undeniable flourishing’ (Koolhaas, 2006), yet paradoxically also the moment of its undeniable self-dissociation. One can acknowledge this moment as the fourth socio-cultural revolution: the Digital Era. Despite the fact that we talk about three major dissociations, the way that architects have learned and worked changed significantly only after the digital began to influence the architectural society. It did so not only by replacing the old tools with new ones but by influencing architectural thinking as well. Since the field has never been as dissociated as it is now, the paper is to examine the way architecture is taught and learned in this advanced technological era. This paper accordingly proposes a three part methodology of architectural education, unconsciously practiced, in the digital age ‘drafting network’ in order to outline a possible first association. The methodology relates to the way that digital mediums are used and have impacted the architectural society: drafting relates to new tools, network to one of the main aspects of architectural education in this era - its ever more intimate relation with the profession, while code will emphasise the most significant aspect of the Digital Era that spans from the digitisation of existing book <b>stocks</b> to the <b>creation</b> of the computational design studio...|$|R
40|$|Conventional wisdom has it {{that the}} primary {{function}} of the stock market is to raise cash for companies for the purpose of investing in productive capabilities. The conventional wisdom is wrong. Academic research on sources of corporate finance shows that, compared with other sources of funds, stock markets in advanced countries have been insignificant suppliers of capital for corporations. The purpose of this essay is to build a rigorous and relevant conception of the evolving role of the stock market in the U. S. corporate economy. In fact, the functions of the stock market go well beyond “cash” to include four other functions, which can be summarized as “control,” “creation,” “combination,” and “compensation. ” In this paper, I argue, based on historical evidence, that in the growth of the U. S. economy the key function of the stock market was control. Specifically, the stock market enabled the separation of managerial control over the allocation of corporate resources from the ownership of the company’s shares. Yet, assuming that the key function of the stock market is cash, economists known as agency theorists see this separation of control from ownership as the “original sin” of American capitalism, and argue that the evils of managerial control can be overcome by compelling corporate managers as “agents” to maximize the value of corporate shareholders as “principals. ” What is missing from the agency-theory argument is a theory of the value-creating firm, or what I call a “theory of innovative enterprise. ” The value-creation process requires three social conditions of innovative enterprise: strategic control, organizational integration, and financial commitment. The functions of the stock market may support the types of strategic control, organizational integration, and financial commitment that can result in the generation of high-quality products at low unit costs—the economic definition of innovative enterprise. It is possible, however, that the functions of the stock market may undermine the types of strategic control, organizational integration, and financial commitment that the innovation process requires. In this paper, I provide a brief overview {{of the role of the}} control function of the stock market in supporting innovative enterprise in the historical rise to dominance of U. S. managerial capitalism from the early decades of the twentieth century. Then I elaborate the five functions of the <b>stock</b> market—control, cash, <b>creation,</b> combination, and compensation—in terms of the ways in which, from the perspective of the theory of innovative enterprise, each function can support value creation or, alternatively, empower value extraction. I then turn to a discussion of the evolving roles of the five functions of the stock market in major U. S. business corporations over the past century. The concluding section draws on the history of the actual functions of U. S. stock markets to critique the dominant ideology that, for the sake of superior economic performance, a company should be run to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). I indicate how MSV undermines the social conditions of innovative enterprise: strategic control, organizational integration, and financial commitment...|$|R
