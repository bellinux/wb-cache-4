5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and <b>shot)</b> <b>noise</b> but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by Schottky in 1918 on <b>shot</b> <b>noise.</b> To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, a more absorbing resist actually {{leads to}} less vertical dose uniformity. This also means <b>shot</b> <b>noise</b> is worse {{toward the bottom}} of a highly absorbing EUV resist layer.|$|E
25|$|With {{the natural}} Poisson {{distribution}} {{due to the}} random arrival and absorption times of the photons, there is an expected natural dose (photon number) variation of at least several percent 3 sigma, making the exposure process susceptible to stochastic variations. The dose variation leads to {{a variation of the}} feature edge position, effectively becoming a blur component. Unlike the hard resolution limit imposed by diffraction, <b>shot</b> <b>noise</b> imposes a softer limit, with the main guideline being the ITRS line width roughness (LWR) spec of 8% (3s) of linewidth. Increasing the dose will reduce the <b>shot</b> <b>noise,</b> but this also requires higher source power.|$|E
40|$|One of the readily {{accessible}} observables in trapped cold-atom experiments is the column density, which is determined from optical depth (OD) obtained from absorption imaging and the absorption cross-section (σ_ abs).

25|$|A {{much shorter}} {{wavelength}} (~6.7nm) would be beyond EUV, {{and is often}} referred to as BEUV (Beyond Extreme UltraViolet). A shorter wavelength would have worse <b>shot</b> <b>noise</b> effects without ensuring sufficient dose.|$|E
25|$|The {{two issues}} of <b>shot</b> <b>noise</b> and EUV-released {{electrons}} point out two constraining factors: 1) keeping dose {{high enough to}} reduce <b>shot</b> <b>noise</b> to tolerable levels, but also 2) avoiding too high a dose due to the increased contribution of EUV-released photoelectrons and secondary electrons to the resist exposure process, increasing the edge blur and thereby limiting the resolution. Aside from the resolution impact, higher dose also increases outgassing and limits throughput, and crosslinking occurs at very high dose levels. For chemically amplified resists, higher dose exposure also increases line edge roughness due to acid generator decomposition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>noise</b> is {{produced}} by electrons in transit across a discontinuity, which occurs in all detectors. <b>Shot</b> <b>noise</b> is the dominant source in most receivers. There will also be flicker noise caused by electron transit through amplification devices, which is reduced using heterodyne amplification. Another reason for heterodyne processing is that for fixed fractional bandwidth, the instantaneous bandwidth increases linearly in frequency. This allows improved range resolution. The one notable exception to heterodyne (downconversion) radar systems is ultra-wideband radar. Here a single cycle, or transient wave, is used similar to UWB communications, see List of UWB channels.|$|E

Pure polypeptide alamethicin forms stable ion channels with multiple conductance states in artificial phospholipid bilayers isolated onto tips of micropipettes with gigaohm seals. In the single-channel current recorded by voltage-clamp techniques, excess noise was found after the background instrumental noise and the intrinsic Johnson and <b>shot</b> <b>noises</b> were removed. The noise que to ion concentration fluctuations via diffusion was isolated by the dependence of the excess current noise on buffer ion concentration.

Both AM and FM noise due to transmitter and local oscillator semiconductor lasers have been taken into account. The nonlinear dependence between the phase noise variance and the laser linewidth is considered. A heterodyne receiver is studied in terms of its output SNR (signal-to-noise ratio), taking into account AM noise and both thermal and <b>shot</b> <b>noises.</b> The required SNR to achieve a BER (bit error rate) of 10 - 9 is studied, considering the FM noise in both semiconductor lasers.

25|$|Even {{with higher}} absorption, EUV has a larger <b>shot</b> <b>noise</b> concern than the ArF (193 nm) wavelength, mainly {{because it is}} applied to smaller {{dimensions}} and current dose targets are lower due to currently available source power levels.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} concern {{comes from}} shot noise; sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs) cause the required dose to be lower, {{so as not}} to print the assist features accidentally.

The major <b>shot</b> <b>noises</b> in the down-looking SAIL and the side-looking SAIL are, respectively, from the dark current of photodiode and the local beam current.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose the}} {{implementation}} of spectral-ampli-tude-coding optical {{code division multiple access}} (SAC-OCDMA) as a contention resolution technique in optical burst switched (OBS) networks. The new system architecture is presented in details where an all-optical methodology for cancelling multiple access interference is proposed. Performance evaluation of the proposed system in both MAC and optical layers is introduced where the overall burst error rate of the system is evaluated in three cases: full, partial, and no code conversion capabilities taking into account the receiver dark current, thermal, and <b>shot</b> <b>noises</b> at the egress nodes. Our results reveal that a considerable improvement in the performance of each core node in the system is achieved by using SAC-OCDMA instead of WDM in the optical layer underneath an OBS based MAC layer. We also conclude that a slight increase in the employed number of code converters enhances the overall system performance noticeably. Finally, optimum values for the number of codes, which lead to minimum overall burst error rate, are reached at different traffic conditions.

40|$|Conductance noise {{measurement}} of the open states of alamethicin transmembrane channels reveals excess noise attributable to cooperative low-frequency molecular dynamics that can generate fluctuations approximately 1 A rms in the effective channel pore radius. Single-channel currents through both persistent and nonpersistent channels with multiple conductance states formed by purified polypeptide alamethicin in artificial phospholipid bilayers isolated onto micropipettes with gigaohm seals were recorded using a voltage-clamp technique with low background noise (rms noise < 3 pA up to 20 kHz). Current noise power spectra between 100 Hz and 20 kHz of each open channel state showed little frequency dependence. Noise from undetected conductance state transitions was insignificant. Johnson and <b>shot</b> <b>noises</b> were evaluated. Current noise caused by electrolyte concentration fluctuation via diffusion was isolated by its dependence on buffer concentration. After removing these contributions, significant current noise remains in all persistent channel states and increases in higher conductance states. In nonpersistent channels, remaining noise occurs primarily in the lowest two states. These fluctuations of channel conductance are attributed to thermal oscillations of the channel molecular conformation and are modeled as a Langevin translational oscillation of alamethicin molecules moving radially from the channel pore, damped mostly by lipid bilayer viscosity...|$|R
25|$|Interferometric {{detectors}} {{are limited}} at high frequencies by <b>shot</b> <b>noise,</b> which occurs because the lasers produce photons randomly; one analogy is to rainfall—the rate of rainfall, like the laser intensity, is measurable, but the raindrops, like photons, fall at random times, causing fluctuations around the average value. This leads to noise at {{the output of}} the detector, much like radio static. In addition, for sufficiently high laser power, the random momentum transferred to the test masses by the laser photons shakes the mirrors, masking signals of low frequencies. Thermal noise (e.g., Brownian motion) is another limit to sensitivity. In addition to these 'stationary' (constant) noise sources, all ground-based detectors are also limited at low frequencies by seismic noise and other forms of environmental vibration, and other 'non-stationary' noise sources; creaks in mechanical structures, lightning or other large electrical disturbances, etc. may also create noise masking an event or may even imitate an event.

One of these is an expansion for the cumulants, which are all finite, subject to mild conditions on the functions defining the process. This is in contrast with the Levy distribution -which can be obtained from our model in certain limits- which has no finite moments. The evaluation of the power spectrum and the form of the probability density function in the tails of the distribution shows that the model exhibits a 1 /f spectrum and long tails in a natural way. A careful analysis of the characteristic function shows that it may be separated into a part representing a Levy processes together with another part representing the deviation of our model from the Levy process. This allows our process to be viewed as a generalization of the Levy process which has finite moments. Comment: Revtex (aps), 15 pages, no figures. Submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
