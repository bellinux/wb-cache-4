40|$|There {{were two}} main {{purposes}} of this study. First, the study tried to determine if religion and occupation had affected <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> in Newfoundland from 1901 to 1921. Second, the study attempted to show if religion, occupation and <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> had affected literacy during the same period. [...] Arguments were presented providing a rationale for the conceptual model used in the study. These arguments indicated a positive association between the percent Protestant in a community and the percent of <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and literacy, and a positive association between the percent of <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and the percent of literacy. In addition, it was argued {{that there was a}} negative association between the percent fishermen in a community and the percent of <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and literacy. [...] The sample consisted of 404 communities selected at random from the census return of Newfoundland for 1901. The same 404 communities were also selected in 1911 and 1921. Labrador District and the city of St. John’s were excluded from the sample. [...] The findings of the study are presented under five main headings: (1) religious composition and school attendance; (2) occupational composition and school attendance; (3) religious composition and literacy; (4) occupational composition and literacy; and, (5) <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and literacy. [...] The hypothesized positive associations between the percent Protestant and <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and literacy were not supported. Indeed, in communities over 200 in population, there was a consistent negative association between percent Protestant and <b>school</b> <b>attendance.</b> [...] Only in communities without teachers was there a consistent negative association between the percent fishermen and <b>school</b> <b>attendance.</b> When teachers were available, there appeared to be little relationship between occupation and <b>school</b> <b>attendance.</b> [...] The findings of the study supported both the hypothesis of a negative association between the percent fishermen and literacy, and the hypothesis of a positive association between <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and literacy. ...|$|R

To isolate the effect of remittances from the effect of sometimes concurrent household out-migration, we focus on children in households without members currently residing in the United States. While girls' <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> rises with the receipt of remittances, secondary school-age children and younger siblings are the ones who most decidedly gain from remittances. Additionally, we find that migration negatively impacts the <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> of children as it eliminates the positive effect of remittances when we expand the sample to include children in households with members residing abroad.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and attainment in Ghana {{with a view to}} deriving implications for policy direction. Using micro-level data from the Ghana living standards surveys, our gender disaggregated probit models on current <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and attainment show that parental education and household resources are significant determinants of schooling. The effect of household resources on current <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> is higher for daughters than it is for sons. It appears that for male and female children the impact of household resources on <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> has reduced, statistically speaking. Father's schooling effects on the education of female children decreased between 1992 and 1999. Mother's schooling effects on <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> of daughters in 1992 were not significantly different from those realized in 1999. However, the effects of mother's schooling levels on <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> of male children appear to have reduced. Other significant determinants of children's schooling are the age of children, school infrastructure, religion and urban residency. The paper concludes that education matters and has an intergenerational impact. Arguably, sustainable poverty reduction approaches cannot ignore the role of education and implications for employment, earnings and social development.

40|$|Analysis of <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> in Switzerland in 1800 // The {{right to}} a free public {{education}} {{and in the meantime}} the duty to send children to school is found in the Swiss Federal Constitution. At {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> was already mandatory in several cantons, such as Zurich or Vaud. In 1800, the federal government introduced nationwide compulsory education. Unsettled is the question of the actual <b>school</b> <b>attendance.</b> Existing research conveys the image of rather bad and inconsistent <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> in Switzerland at the end of the eighteenth century. Indeed, there were numerous reasons for children not to go to school: Many children had to work on their parents’ farm in summer. Therefore, in many villages, classes only took place in winter. But in winter, cold weather prevented poorer children with insufficient clothing from going to school. In proto-industrialised regions, where the domestic system was the main source of family income, children had to help out at home in summer and in winter. In many cases, they had to work and earn their own money. Mothers and fathers also kept their children at home for various other reasons: Since there were not enough schools in rural areas, many classrooms were overcrowded – sometimes, more than 100 children gathered in one classroom – and in a bad state with wet walls and no heating. Despite the striking fact that education in the Swiss public is often depicted as the one and only resource of the country, there is not much research about the history of Swiss public schools before 1830 (the years after 1830, when most of the cantons introduced constitutions, are believed as the birth date of public school) : There are almost no actual numbers or <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> rates and only very few sources are to be found in the archives. In the context of a multinational six-year scientific project, the data of the first nationwide school-inquiry (from the year 1799) had been transliterated, edited and published The so-called Stapfer-Enquête with its answers from more than 2400 schools provides a unique opportunity to be concerned with <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> in 1800. This standardized questionnaire can be seen as a unique source – it is the only nationwide school inquiry answered by teachers at that time. Teachers had to give answers about their income, the school building the subjects they taught as well as the number of students in the classroom. With the help of the data of this inquiry (as well as data of other recently discovered and edited regional school inquiries), this dissertation aims to analyse <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> in 1800. The core question is: How many children went to school in Switzerland in 1800 ? The first goal is to track down how many children really went to school in 1800. The analysis also aims to explicate possible motives for good or bad <b>school</b> <b>attendance,</b> with respect to gender, denomination, distance to school plus economic and sociological factors. The question about relative <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> – as an indicator of the level of education in a society and the quality of education in a specific country is relevant: The matter is of public interest – today and back then. As shown above, there is a clear perception about <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> in 1800. Some of the theories about this “low” <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> still exist in the research of history of education: <b>School</b> <b>attendance</b> rates were specifically low in rural and catholic areas. Girls went to school more rarely than boys. The results of this analysis show another picture: Numerous rural and catholic schools used to have quite good <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> rates and girls also went to school. In order to get a clear picture about <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> in Switzerland in 1800, this dissertation not only calculates <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> rates (the sample consists of 126 schools), it also explains differences between high and low rates. By using quantitative and qualitative statistical methods, <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> data are commented and compared. Apart from doing so, the analysis builds a connection between the <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> data and historic theory in order to explain the results in a greater context. It refers to previously existing research and clarifies to what extent arguments and beliefs about <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> in Switzerland in 1800 have to be confirmed or contested. Furthermore, it develops new theses about <b>schools</b> and <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> in Switzerland at the end of the eighteenth century. An important thesis is, that <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> relies on the accessibility of the school (the distance between children’s homes and the school building) as well as the identification with and the financial support of public education in a local community. These three factors – accessibility, identification and financial support – have an influence on the quality of school personnel – back in 1800 and today...|$|R

It explores Australian {{and international}} literature to {{develop an understanding of}} the risk factors and protective factors involved in strengthening <b>school</b> <b>attendance.</b> The paper then articulates a number of design principles to underpin future investment and intervention policies, and concludes with proposed guideposts which could be considered by policy-makers going forward. Educators and policy-makers are increasingly calling for ‘high expectations’ in education, including in Indigenous education. One of these expectations is improved rates of <b>school</b> <b>attendance.</b> The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has included <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> as a key Closing the Gap measure in national Indigenous affairs policy. COAG is seeking to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous student attendance by 2018. This paper posits that addressing poor <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> has to be seen in an holistic light: firstly by recognising the multifaceted nature of the challenge; and secondly by embracing a suite of responses to meet the many interdependencies involved. The paper argues that issues concerning Indigenous students’ <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> fundamentally represent a broader social policy challenge, not merely a challenge within education policy circles. This paper questions whether a ‘one-sizefits-all’ or an ‘across-the-board’ response may be too blunt an instrument to effect positive change.

40|$|In Brazil, {{even though}} school {{participation}} is compulsory for children between 7 to 14 years old, {{some of them}} are not enrolled in the education system. One of the main reasons is their participation to the work market that may have an impact on their health. Moreover, child's <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> in public <b>schools</b> usually insures a meal to child but for children working, they have to accumulate two journeys: school and job. So, child's health could be explained by both, <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and work market participation. In addition, problems related to <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and <b>school</b> progress could be related to child work or his health. Therefore, we cannot explore determinants of one of these components <b>school</b> <b>attendance,</b> health and child work without studying their interactions. In this paper, we use the database Living Standards Measurement Study Survey 1996 / 1997 (Pesquisa de Padrões de Vida - PPV) to look at this interactions. It appears that child's labor and <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> have a very strong correlation. <b>School</b> <b>attendance</b> has a negative impact in child's probability to participate in labor market. For instance, child ´s labor market affects negatively child ´s probability to evaluate his health as good and excellent. We also note that <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> does not have a significant impact in child ´s health evaluation. The main conclusion of our article is that the development of human capital should consider together health and education. A policy focusing only in education, as incentives to go to school, {{does not seem to be}} sufficient to improve child's health. Also, government should also consider the population at risk, as children from poor families, living in worse conditions and obliged to work. ...|$|R
