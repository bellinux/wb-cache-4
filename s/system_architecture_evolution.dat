Co-evolution is generated by two elements missing in previous analyses: securitisation and bank equity capital. As banks evolve via improvements in credit screening, they securitise higher quality credits. This encourages greater investor participation and spurs capital market evolution. And, if capital market evolution is spurred by greater investor participation, banks find it cheaper to raise equity capital to satisfy endogenously arising risk-sensitive capital requirements. Bank evolution is thus stimulated as banks consequently serve previously unserved high-risk borrowers. Numerous additional results are obtained. Copyright � The Author(s).

40|$|This Master thesis investigates {{solutions}} for handling congestion in All-IP radio networks. A mixed traffic scenario including a video and voice conversation {{has been studied}} using an advanced radio network simulator. The preventive measures investigated in this thesis are a bit rate adaptation scheme together with a congestion detection and notification mechanism, for real time video traffic using the UDP protocol. The adaptation scheme {{is divided into two}} different stages. The first stage use packet losses as an indication of congestion and does bit rate adaptation based on this. The second stage uses congestion information received from the network as basis for adapting the video bit rate. The congestion detection mechanism implemented trigger congestion notifications by monitoring packet's buffer delay in radio transmitter. To transfer congestion notification from the radio transmitter to end-users, a new mechanism similar to ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) has been implemented using the RTP protocol (header) instead of the IP protocol which is the case for ECN over TCP/IP. The implemented algorithms have been tested in a 3 GPP SAE/LTE (<b>Systems</b> <b>Architecture</b> Evolution/Long-Term <b>Evolution)</b> <b>system</b> simulator. Simulation results show that radio resource management can be improved when congestion detection and notification is enabled in eNode B. Results also show that it is better in terms of radio resource management, to use congestion information received from eNode B than detecting congestion based on amount of packet loss.

40|$|Recent {{advancement}} in <b>System</b> <b>Architecture</b> <b>Evolution</b> (SAE) {{has opened the}} door for the deployment of femtocells on a large scale. Deployment of femtocells in the existing macrocell networks and in 4 G networks will significantly increase because femtocell offers increase coverage and capacity in both home and office environments. Hence it is likely that these low-power home based access points are going to change the landscape of mobile technology and the networking business in the coming years. This thesis work offers a deep insight into the mobile communication <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>evolution</b> and typically explains femtocellular aspects in the evolution of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) architecture. This research work mainly focuses on architectural variations of 3 G and 4 G femtocells along with the operational functionality of Local IP Access (LIPA). LIPA introduces the functionality in femtocells to access a home Local Area Network (LAN) and enable customers to use the Internet through Internet-enabled devices. Hence users have the capability to have simultaneous access to the operator's network as well as having access to their own home LAN. The way LIPA works is explained How it can create problems for femtocells deployment and what solutions LIPA offers for providing easy femtocell configurations. With the help of the extensive study about LIPA-enabled femtocells, different scenarios are discussed and two different solutions are proposed both for 3 G and 4 G femtocells. For maintaining higher data rates, 3 G and 4 G systems require a good coverage area to increase system performance. But research results suggest that two-thirds of consumers suffer from inadequate indoor signal penetration which actually leads to poor coverage for consumers, who do not enjoy the full data capacity as guaranteed. 4 G systems will facilitate high speed data services, but poor coverage and interference will definitely diminish the quality of real-time applications and will significantly slow down high speed data services. The aim of this thesis is to propose di_erent logical indoor 4 G femtocell architectures based on 3 GPP specifications that will also be capable of providing LIPA functionality...|$|E

This warm circumstellar dust, {{analogous}} to the interplanetary dust found {{in the vicinity of}} the Earth in our own system, is produced in comet breakups and asteroid collisions. Emission and or scattered light from the exozodi will be the major source of astrophysical noise for a future space telescope aimed at direct imaging and spectroscopy of terrestrial planets (exo- Earths) around nearby stars. About 20 of nearby field stars have cold dust coming from planetesimals at large distances from the stars (Eiroa et al. 2013, AA, 555, A 11; Siercho et al. 2014, ApJ, 785, 33).

40|$|The power {{requirements}} for inner city transit buses {{are characterized by}} power peaks about {{an order of magnitude}} larger than the average power usage of the vehicle. For these vehicles, hybrid power trains can offer significantly improved fuel economy and exhaust emissions. A critical design challenge, however, has been developing the energy storage and power management system to respond to these rapid power variations. Most hybrid vehicles today use chemical energy storage batteries to supplement the power from the fuel burning generator unit. Chemical storage batteries however, present several difficulties in power management and control. These difficulties include (1) inadequate life, (2) limited current delivery as well as absorption during regenerative braking, (3) inaccurate measurement of state of charge, and (4) stored energy safety issues. Recent advances in ultra-capacitor technology create an opportunity to address these concerns. The NASA Lewis Research Center, in cooperation with industry and academia, has developed an advanced hybrid electric transit bus using ultra-capacitors as the primary energy storage system. At over 15, 000 -kg gross weight, this is the largest vehicle of its kind ever built using this advanced energy storage technology.

40|$|Abstract—Software {{architecture}} is {{considered as a}} set of architectural design decisions (ADDs). Capturing and representing ADDs during the architecting process is necessary for reducing architectural knowledge evaporation. Moreover, managing the evolution of ADDs helps to maintain consistency between requirements and the deployed system. In this paper, we create the Triple View Model (TVM) as a general architecture framework for documenting ADDs. The TVM clarifies the notion of ADDs in three different views and covers key features of the architecting process. Based on the TVM, we propose a scenario-based methodology (SceMethod) to manage the documentation and evolution of ADDs. Furthermore, we also develop a UML metamodel that incorporates evolution-centered characteristics to manage ADDs evolution. We conduct a case study on an industrial project to validate the applicability and the effectiveness of the TVM, the SceMethod and the UML metamodel.
