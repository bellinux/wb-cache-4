6000|$|But the {{masterpiece}} went to Mrs. Dinnie, baker, {{in return}} for a flagon bun. Long ago her daughter, Janet, and Betsy had agreed to marry on the same day, and many a quip had Mrs. Dinnie cast at their romantic compact. But Janet died, and so it was a sad letter that Tommy had to write to her mother. [...] "I'm doubting you're no auld enough for this ane," [...] soft-hearted Betsy said, but she did not know her man. [...] "Tell me some one thing the mother used often to say when she was taking her fun off the pair of you," [...] he said, and [...] "Where is she buried?" [...] was a suggestive question, with the happy tag, [...] "Is there a tree hanging over the grave?" [...] Thus assisted, he composed a letter that had a tear in every sentence. Betsy rubbed her eyes red over it, and not all its sentiments were allowed to die, for Mrs. Dinnie, touched to the heart, printed the best of them in black licorice on <b>short</b> <b>bread</b> for funeral feasts, at which they gave rise to solemn reflections as they went down.|$|E

40|$|Celiac disease (CD) is {{a chronic}} {{intestinal}} inflammation showing a strong association to HLA-DQ 2. 5. This thesis {{focused on the}} use of soluble MHC class II tetramers to examine the underlying mechanism for this selective CD association and also to develop a potential diagnostic tool based on the detection of gluten specific T cells. DQ 2. 5 is associated with atypically high amounts of Ii-chain derived CLIP peptides. This phenotype was assigned to an abnormally low interaction with the peptide editing molecule HLA-DM, and high kinetic stability of CLIP peptides to DQ 2. 5. HLA-DQ 2. 2 is a highly similar molecule, but does not show strong CD association. Interestingly, this molecule displayed a CLIP low phenotype due to a drastically reduced kinetic stability for CLIP. This was assigned to a polymorphic residue causing the gain/loss of a hydrogen bond involved in peptide binding. In addition, the application of a <b>short</b> <b>bread</b> challenge allowed for the detection of gluten reactive T cells in peripheral blood of CD patients using flow cytometry and MHC tetramers. This opens for the use of MHC tetramers as a diagnostic tool for diseases where the antigen and MHC restriction elements are known...|$|E

60|$|NOTE.--Retreat of the Mar column. The army {{which so}} long and so usefully held the passes behind Mar, over the neck of Long Bluff, did not begin to retreat until the enemy had already {{occupied}} Mar and begun to engage their outposts. Supplies had already been cut off by the advanced position of Stevenson. The men were <b>short</b> of <b>bread.</b> The roads were heavy; the horses starving. The rear of the column was continually and disastrously engaged with the enemy pouring after. It is perhaps the saddest chapter {{in the history of}} the war. My grandmother, Mrs. Hankey (née Pillworthy), then a young girl on a mountain farm on the line of the retreat, distinctly remembers giving a soda biscuit, which was greedily received, to Colonel Diggory Jacks, then in command of our division, and lending him an umbrella, which was never returned.

40|$|One of {{the ways}} of haploid {{production}} is a cross between wheat and maize. Recently success has been achieved in this method, leading {{to the production of}} zygotes; these zygotes generally undergo elimination of maize chromosomes and thus lead to production of wheat haploid plant. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop an efficient method of haploid production via maize pollination in <b>short</b> duration <b>bread</b> and durum wheat cultivars grown in Iran and India. Pollination of agronomically superior varieties of six hexaploid wheat (2 n= 2 x= 42) : Golestan, Mahdavi MACS- 2496, HD- 2189, NIAW- 34, NI- 5439 and four tetraploid wheat (2 n= 2 x= 28) : MACS- 9, MACS- 2846, MACS- 1967, Raj- 1555 with pollen from maize cultivar resulted in haploid embryos by post pollination treatment with four concentration of dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and silver nitrate (AgNO 3). Treatment with 3 mgL− 1 2, 4 -D plus (120 - 180 mgL− 1 AgNO 3) gave highest frequency of haploid embryos and haploid plants. In this study haploid embryos and haploid plants were produced from all of the ten genotypes, but frequency of haploid embryos (7. 45 %) and haploid plants (1. 06 %) in hexaploid wheat was more than haploid embryos (6. 16 %) and haploid plants (0. 83 %) in tetraploid wheat.

60|$|Finding {{the wounded}} man so firm, {{you may be}} sure the {{authorities}} did not leave {{the rest of us}} in peace. No stone was left unturned. We were had in again and again to be examined, now singly, now in twos and threes. We were threatened with all sorts of impossible severities and tempted with all manner of improbable rewards. I suppose I was five times interrogated, and came off from each with flying colours. I am like old Souvaroff, I cannot understand a soldier being taken aback by any question; he should answer, as he marches on the fire, with an instant briskness and gaiety. I may have been <b>short</b> of <b>bread,</b> gold or grace; I was never yet found wanting in an answer. My comrades, if they were not all so ready, were none of them less staunch; and I may say here at once that the inquiry came to nothing at the time, and the death of Goguelat remained a mystery of the prison. Such were the veterans of France! And yet I should be disingenuous if I did not own this was a case apart; in ordinary circumstances, some one might have stumbled or been intimidated into an admission; and what bound us together with a closeness beyond that of mere comrades was a secret to which we were all committed and a design in which all were equally engaged. No need to inquire as to its nature: there is only one desire, and only one kind of design, that blooms in prisons. And the fact that our tunnel was near done supported and inspired us.|$|R
60|$|We {{have seen}} that the {{essential}} process arising out {{of the growth of}} science and mechanism, and more particularly out of the still developing new facilities of locomotion and communication science has afforded, is the deliquescence of the social organizations of the past, and the synthesis of ampler and still ampler and more complicated and still more complicated social unities. The suggestion is powerful, the conclusion is hard to resist, that, through whatever disorders of danger and conflict, whatever centuries of misunderstanding and bloodshed, men may still have to pass, this process nevertheless aims finally, and will attain to the establishment of one world-state at peace within itself. In the economic sense, indeed, a world-state is already established. Even to-day we do all buy and sell in the same markets--albeit the owners of certain ancient rights levy their tolls here and there--and the Hindoo starves, the Italian feels the pinch, before the Germans or the English go <b>short</b> of <b>bread.</b> There is no real autonomy any more in the world, no simple right to an absolute independence such as formerly the Swiss could claim. The nations and boundaries of to-day do no more than mark claims to exemptions, privileges, and corners in the market--claims valid enough to those whose minds and souls are turned towards the past, but absurdities to those who look to the future as the end and justification of our present stresses. The claim to political liberty amounts, as a rule, to no more than the claim of a man to live in a parish without observing sanitary precautions or paying rates because he had an excellent great-grandfather. Against all these old isolations, these obsolescent particularisms, the forces of mechanical and scientific development fight, and fight irresistibly; and upon the general recognition of this conflict, upon the intelligence and courage with which its inflexible conditions are negotiated, depends very largely the amount of bloodshed and avoidable misery the coming years will hold.|$|R
60|$|Matter is a far-fetched theory, and materialism {{is without}} a root in man. To him {{everything}} {{is important in}} the degree to which it moves him. The telegraph wires and posts, the electricity speeding from clerk to clerk, the clerks, the glad or sorrowful import of the message, and the paper on which it is finally brought to him at home, are all equally facts, all equally exist for man. A word or a thought can wound him as acutely as a knife of steel. If he thinks he is loved, he will rise up and glory to himself, although he be in a distant land and <b>short</b> of necessary <b>bread.</b> Does he think he is not loved?--he may have the woman at his beck, and there is not a joy for him in all the world. Indeed, if we are to make any account of this figment of reason, the distinction between material and immaterial, we shall conclude that the life of each man as an individual is immaterial, although the continuation and prospects of mankind as a race turn upon material conditions. The physical business of each man's body is transacted for him; like a sybarite, he has attentive valets in his own viscera; he breathes, he sweats, he digests without an effort, or so much as a consenting volition; for the most part he even eats, not with a wakeful consciousness, but as it were between two thoughts. His life is centred among other and more important considerations; touch him in his honour or his love, creatures of the imagination which attach him to mankind or to an individual man or woman; cross him in his piety which connects his soul with heaven; and he turns from his food, he loathes his breath, and with a magnanimous emotion cuts the knots of his existence and frees himself at a blow from the web of pains and pleasures.|$|R
40|$|Rust {{resistance}} genes Lr 37, Sr 38, and Yr 17 {{are located}} within {{a segment of}} Triticum ventricosum (Tausch) Cess. chromosome 2 NS translocated to the <b>short</b> arm of <b>bread</b> wheat chromosome 2 AS. Characterization of this chromosome segment by 13 {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) markers indicated that the 2 NS translocation replaced approximately half of the short arm of chromosome 2 A (distal 25 - 38 centimorgans, cM). The objective {{of this study was to}} develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays based on RFLP marker cMWG 682 to facilitate the transfer of this cluster of rust resistance genes into commercial wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivats. DNA sequence was obtained from the A-, B-, D-, and N-alleles of cMWG 682 and was used to design N-allele specific primers. The 2 NS fragment amplified by PCR primers cosegregated with the presence of the RFLP- 2 NS band in all backcross populations. A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) was used to develop a marker for the 2 A-allele. This marker can be used to differentiate homozygous and heterozygous plants carrying the 2 NS translocation in the final cycle of backcross introgression or in screenings for homozygous plants in segregating populations. Finally, a third PCR assay was developed by means of TaqMan technology as a high-throughput alternative for selection of the 2 NS/ 2 AS translocation in large segregating populations in breeding programs that have access to real time PCR equipment. These molecular markers were used to develop four hard red spring isogenic lines homozygous for the 2 NS chromosome segment. One of the isogenic lines, derived from 'Anza,' did not show the expected resistance in spite of the presence of all the RFLP markers for the 2 NS chromosome segment. Analysis of F 1 hybrids suggested that a suppressor of the Lr 37 gene is present in Anza. These isogenic lines will provide a valuable tool to test the effects of the large 2 NS translocation on quality and agronomic performance...|$|R
6000|$|His narrative, as the judicious reader {{no doubt}} is aware, is written maturely and at ease, {{long after the}} voyage is over, whereof it recounts the adventures and perils; the winds adverse and favourable; the storms, shoals, shipwrecks, islands, and so forth, which Clive Newcome met in his early journey in life. In such a history events follow each other without {{necessarily}} having a connection with one another. One ship crosses another ship, and after a visit from one captain to his comrade, they sail away each on his course. The Clive Newcome meets a vessel which makes signals that she is <b>short</b> of <b>bread</b> and water; and after supplying her, our captain leaves her to see her no more. One {{or two of the}} vessels with which we commenced the voyage together, part company in a gale, and founder miserably; others, after being wofully battered in the tempest, make port, or are cast upon surprising islands where all sorts of unlooked-for prosperity awaits the lucky crew. Also, no doubt, the writer of the book, into whose hands Clive Newcome's logs have been put, and who is charged with the duty of making two octavo volumes out of his friend's story, dresses up the narrative in his own way; utters his own remarks in place of Newcome's; makes fanciful descriptions of individuals and incidents with which he never could have been personally acquainted; and commits blunders, which the critics will discover. A great number of the descriptions in Cook's Voyages, for instance, were notoriously invented by Dr. Hawkesworth, who [...] "did" [...] the book: so in the present volumes, where dialogues are written down, which the reporter could by no possibility have heard, and where motives are detected which the persons actuated by them certainly never confided to the writer, the public must once for all be warned that the author's individual fancy very likely supplies much of the narrative; and that he forms it as best he may, out of stray papers, conversations reported to him, and his knowledge, right or wrong, of the characters of the persons engaged. And, {{as is the case with}} the most orthodox histories, the writer's own guesses or conjectures are printed in exactly the same type as the most ascertained patent facts. I fancy, for my part, that the speeches attributed to Clive, the Colonel, and the rest, are as authentic as the orations in Sallust or Livy, and only implore the truth-loving public to believe that incidents here told, and which passed very probably without witnesses, were either confided to me subsequently as compiler of this biography, or are of such a nature that they must have happened from what we know happened after. For example, when you read such words as QVE ROMANVS on a battered Roman stone, your profound antiquarian knowledge enables you to assert that SENATVS POPVLVS was also inscribed there at some time or other. You take a mutilated statue of Mars, Bacchus, Apollo, or Virorum, and you pop him on a wanting hand, an absent foot, or a nose which time or barbarians have defaced. You tell your tales as you can, and state the facts as you think they must have been. In this manner, Mr. James (historiographer to Her Majesty), Titus Livius, Professor Alison, Robinson Crusoe, and all historians proceeded. Blunders there must be in the best of these narratives, and more asserted than they can possibly know or vouch for.|$|R
