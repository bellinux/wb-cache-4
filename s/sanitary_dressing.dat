40|$|A. This {{directive}} {{is being}} reissued to provide off-line inspection program personnel (IPP) with information regarding how {{to verify that}} cattle slaughter operations are implementing <b>sanitary</b> <b>dressing</b> and process control procedures, and that the procedures they are implementing prevent contamination of carcasses and ensure that insanitary conditions are not created. B. In addition, this directive provides information describing how IPP are to assess the <b>sanitary</b> <b>dressing</b> and process controls cattle slaughter establishments employ in their food safety systems. Such controls are likely to include decontamination and antimicrobial intervention treatments. Establishments should verify {{the effectiveness of these}} controls by sampling and testing for microorganisms of beef manufacturing trimmings, other raw ground beef components (including head meat and cheek meat), and raw ground beef...|$|E
40|$|This {{directive}} provides off-line inspection program personnel (IPP) {{assigned to}} establishments {{operating under the}} Public Health Information System (PHIS) with an inspection methodology and instructions regarding how to verify that poultry slaughter establishments are performing <b>sanitary</b> <b>dressing</b> procedures {{in a manner that}} will prevent the creation of insanitary conditions, and the adulteration of product. This directive provides that IPP are to verify that the establishment is operating in a manner that prevents poultry from becoming contaminated throughout the slaughter process, and is not just cleaning contaminated poultry in order to meet visible cleanliness expectations. In addition, this directive provides that IPP are to verify that the establishment’s <b>sanitary</b> <b>dressing</b> process results in poultry carcasses that enter the chiller without visible contamination (9 CFR 381. 65 (e)). Finally, this directive provides that in establishments using air chilling, IPP are to verify that no visible contamination is present on poultry carcasses at the time they enter the cooler or, if packaged before cooling, before packaging...|$|E
40|$|The {{slaughter}} {{process for}} cattle and other meat-producing animals involves {{the removal of}} the bacteria-free meat from between two contaminated surfaces- the hide and the GI tract. In this process, no matter how carefully it is carried out, there will invariably be transfer of bacteria to the carcass. The food safety goal of the slaughter process is minimize bacterial contamination of the carcass, and effectively remove contamination which has occurred. The primary weapon in reducing bacterial contamination of beef carcasses is employing effective <b>sanitary</b> <b>dressing</b> procedures during slaughter. There is no substitute for trying to keep bacteria off the carcass in the first place. Workers should know, understand and use the recommended <b>sanitary</b> <b>dressing</b> techniques in whatever slaughter method is used. A list of current “best practices ” as developed by the beef slaughter industry, is included {{at the end of this}} report. However, no matter how carefully a plant dresses beef carcasses, it is inevitable that bacteria will contaminate the carcass, some of which could potentially be fecal pathogens such as E. coli O 157 :H 7 or Salmonella. Therefore, applying “interventions ” to carcasses during and after the dressing procedure to effectively remove or inactivate bacterial contamination and improve meat safety is important. Such “interventions ” include trimming, steam vacuuming, carcass washing...|$|E
5000|$|On May 16, 1864 with editor Joe Goodman {{out of town}} Twain's {{unsigned}} piece (entitled the [...] "Grand Ball at Los Angeles Plata") {{made its}} way {{into the hands of the}} printer for the Enterprise and appeared in the paper on May 17. The piece asked why the Great Austin Flour Sack had not been taken to Carson City to raise funds there; it claimed [...] "that the reason the Flour Sack was not taken from Dayton to Carson was because it was stated that the money raised at the <b>Sanitary</b> Fancy <b>Dress</b> Ball, recently held in Carson for the St. Louis Fair, had been diverted from its legitimate course, and was to be sent to aid a Miscegenation Society somewhere in the East; and it was feared the proceeds of the sack might be similarly disposed of." [...] The piece added cryptically that the claim was [...] "a hoax, but not all a hoax, for an effort is being made to divert those funds from their proper course." ...|$|R

50|$|Eleanor Parker {{recalled}} {{the film as}} the most difficult experience she ever had making a movie:It was simply a dreadful nightmare. We had a terrible producer who made no accommodations for the company or crew on location. We were in Egypt, {{out in the desert}} filming, with no <b>sanitary</b> facilities, no <b>dressing</b> rooms to speak of, it was unbelievable. Robert Taylor and I had to use the bathrooms with the locals, hiding behind coats. Additionally, the director (Robert Pirosh) {{had no idea what he}} was doing; the headcameraman (Robert Surtees) was directing the film. Then the crew wasn’t getting paid and our great cameraman told them that we were all going out on strike until everyone got paid. Believe me, the money showed up. The film's world premiere took place simultaneously on 21 July 1954 in Cairo and Alexandria (as well as New York City). It marked the first time an American film had a world premiere in Egypt.|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{paucity of}} {{information}} regarding the epidemiology of Escherichia coli O 157 : H 7 in developing countries. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of E. coli O 157 : H 7 associated with beef cattle at processing plants and at retail shops in Ethiopia. Methods: Various samples were collected from beef cattle at slaughter/processing plants, carcass at retail shops and humans at health centers. E. coli O 157 : H 7 was isolated, identified and characterized for antimicrobial resistance, using standard microbiological methods. Results: At the processing plants E. coli O 157 : H 7 was detected in 1. 89 % of fecal, 0. 81 % of intestinal mucosal swab, 0. 54 % of skin swab and 0. 54 % of carcass internal swab samples. At retail shops it was detected in 0. 8 % of carcass and 0. 8 % of cutting board swab samples, while all samples from utensils, hands from workers, and fecal and stool samples were negative. All isolates were resistant to Amoxicillin, moderately resistant to Cefoxitine and Nitrofurantoins but susceptible to other antimicrobials tested. Conclusions:E. coli O 157 : H 7 occurs at low prevalence in beef cattle, and the current <b>sanitary</b> <b>dressing</b> procedures in the processing plants and storage conditions in the retail shops are effective against E. coli O 157 : H 7. </p...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} that third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3 GCr) Escherichia coli, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole- resistant (COTr) E. coli, 3 GCr Salmonella enterica, and nalidixic acid-resistant (NALr) S. enterica may be present in cattle production environments, persist through beef processing, and contaminate final products. The prevalences and concentrations of these organisms were determined in feces and hides (at feedlot and processing plant), pre-evisceration carcasses, and final carcasses from three lots of fed cattle (n= 184). The prevalences and concentrations were further determined for strip loins from 103 of the carcasses. 3 GCr Salmonella was detected on 7. 6 % of hides during processing and was not detected on the final carcasses or strip loins. NALr S. enterica was detected on only one hide. 3 GCr E. coli and COTr E. coli were detected on 100. 0 % of hides during processing. Concentrations of 3 GCr E. coli and COTr E. coli on hides were correlated with pre-evisceration carcass contamination. 3 GCr E. coli and COTr E. coli were each detected on only 0. 5 % of final carcasses and were not detected on strip loins. Five hundred and 42 isolates were screened for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) virulence-associated markers. Only two COTr E. coli isolates from hides were ExPEC, indicating that fed cattle products are not {{a significant source of}} ExPEC causing human urinary tract infections. The very low prevalences of these organisms on final carcasses and their absence on strip loins demonstrate that current <b>sanitary</b> <b>dressing</b> procedures and processing interventions are effective against antimicrobial-resistant bacteria...|$|E
40|$|This {{multi-phase}} {{project was}} designed (1) to evaluate existing post-harvest process controls and intervention strategies {{used to reduce}} Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, (2) to evaluate the impacts of cattle source and environmental factors on Salmonella prevalence in bovine lymph nodes, and (3) to evaluate sanitary conditions of feedyards in South Texas. The ultimate goal of this project was to identify and implement measures that reduce E. coli O 157 :H 7 in beef harvest facilities, and Salmonella prevalence in feedyards. To evaluate process control of E. coli O 157 :H 7 throughout the beef harvest process, samples were collected from harvest floor processing areas at two commercial beef slaughter establishments, and enumerated for aerobic plate counts, E. coli/coliform, and Enterobacteriaceae. To survey existing Salmonella prevalence, bovine lymph nodes (n = 307) were collected from beef carcasses at a commercial beef processing plant. Lymph nodes were extracted from cattle sourced from seven feedyards. Salmonella prevalence in lymph nodes {{was found to be}} 0 % in cattle sourced from only one of the seven yards. Lymph nodes from cattle sourced from the other feedyards yielded positive samples, with varying prevalence. Of the remaining six feedyards, one feedyard yielded 88. 2 % prevalence of Salmonella in bovine lymph nodes, which was significantly higher than all other feedyards (42. 9, 40. 0, 40. 0, 24. 0, and 4. 0 %). The prevalence of Salmonella in the feedlot environment was compared among three feedyards; one yard had 65. 0 % environmental prevalence of Salmonella, which was statistically higher than the other feedyards surveyed. Of the two remaining yards, one had 0 % prevalence of Salmonella in fecal and soil samples, which was also the feedyard with 0 % prevalence of Salmonella in lymph nodes. Findings include (1) the significance of effective <b>sanitary</b> <b>dressing</b> procedures and intervention strategies in a beef harvest environment, (2) that there is clear feedyard-to-feedyard variation with relation to Salmonella prevalence in bovine lymph nodes, and (3) that differences in environmental factors existed among feedyards although the reasons remain unclear...|$|E
