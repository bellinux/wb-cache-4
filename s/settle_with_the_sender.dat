25|$|It is {{important}} to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> private key, and thus only <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> could have sent the message and nobody else could have altered it in transit (data integrity). <b>The</b> alleged <b>sender</b> could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> himself, and such assertions may or may not relieve <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity; and, therefore, <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> may repudiate <b>the</b> message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).|$|R

5000|$|The verb [...] "consign" [...] means [...] "to send" [...] and {{therefore}} the noun [...] "consignment" [...] means [...] "sending goods to another person". In the case of [...] "retail consignment" [...] or [...] "sales consignment" [...] (often just {{referred to as a}} [...] "consignment"), goods are sent to the agent for the purpose of sale. The ownership of these goods remains <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender.</b> <b>The</b> agent sells the goods on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> according to instructions. <b>The</b> <b>sender</b> of goods is known as the [...] "consignor" [...] and <b>the</b> agent entrusted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> custody and care of the goods is known as the [...] "consignee".|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the dense coding {{in the case}} of non-symmetric Hilbert spaces of <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> and receiver's particles sharing the quantum maximally entangled state.

30|$|Although {{the duty}} cycle {{of most of}} the nodes in the {{forwarder}} set are synchronized <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender’s</b> cycle, we prefer to select the relay node closer to the sink.

30|$|The idea {{in these}} {{scenarios}} is to test separately each Federate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sender</b> Federate in scenarios 1 to 3, {{and later to}} integrate two Federates per experiment in scenarios 4 and 5.

50|$|Emotion plays {{a central}} role in IDT as a {{motivation}} and result of deception. Emotion can motivate deception, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> relying on relevant knowledge (informational, relational and behavioral familiarity) to achieve goals such as self-gratification, avoiding a negative emotional outcome or creating a negative emotional outcome for the target of deception. Emotion can be a result of deception, since a physical response occurs in <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> (usually arousal and negative affect).|$|R
50|$|ARP {{may also}} be used as a simple {{announcement}} protocol. This is useful for updating other hosts' mappings of a hardware address when <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> IP address or MAC address has changed. Such an announcement, also called a gratuitous ARP message, is usually broadcast as an ARP request containing <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> protocol address (SPA) in the target field (TPA=SPA), <b>with</b> <b>the</b> target hardware address (THA) set to zero. An alternative way is to broadcast an ARP reply <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> hardware and protocol addresses (SHA and SPA) duplicated in the target fields (TPA=SPA, THA=SHA).|$|R
5000|$|Digital signatures, {{in which}} a message is signed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> private key and can be {{verified}} by anyone who has access to <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> public key. This verification proves that <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> {{had access to the}} private key, and therefore is likely to be <b>the</b> person associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> public key. This also ensures that the message has not been tampered with, as a signature is mathematically bound to the message it originally was made with, and verification will fail for practically any other message, no matter how similar to the original message.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, Rabin reinvented a weak {{variant of}} the {{technique}} of oblivious transfer invented by Wiesner {{under the name of}} multiplexing, allowing a sender to transmit a message to a receiver where the receiver has some probability between 0 and 1 of learning <b>the</b> message, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> being unaware whether the receiver was able to do so.|$|R

30|$|Applications of {{asymmetric}} encryption in Blockchain systems mainly include information encryption and digital signature. In information encryption, <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> node uses <b>the</b> receiver node’s public key to encrypt the information, and broadcasts {{the information to}} the network; only nodes which hold the receiver’s private key can decrypt the information. In digital signature, <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> encrypts a message using its private key, and broadcasts the message to the network. The receiver decrypts <b>the</b> message <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender’s</b> public key, to verify that the message is sent by <b>the</b> <b>sender.</b> Many {{asymmetric encryption}} algorithms [6] are available, such as SHA 256, RIMPED 160, RSA, Elgamal, Rabin, D-H, and ECC.|$|R
50|$|In addition, many inter-application {{communications}} have an intrinsically synchronous aspect, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> specifically {{wanting to}} wait for a reply to a message before continuing (see real-time computing and near-real-time for extreme cases). Because message-based communication inherently functions asynchronously, it may not fit well in such situations.

40|$|We {{consider}} a market signaling {{model in which}} receivers observe both <b>the</b> <b>sender’s</b> costly signal {{as well as a}} stochastic grade that is correlated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sender’s</b> type. In equilibrium, <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> resolves <b>the</b> trade-off between using the costly signal versus relying on the noisy grade to distinguish himself. When grades are sufficiently informative, separating equilibria do not survive common refinements. The prediction depends on the prior—it involves full pooling when the prior puts sufficient weight on the high type and partial pooling otherwise. The equilibrium converges to the full-information outcome as the fraction of high types goes to one—resolving a long-standing paradox within the signaling literature...|$|R
