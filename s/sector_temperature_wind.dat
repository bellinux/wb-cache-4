Inti General Yaja Steel Semarang {{located at the}} intersection of Jrakah is one of steel smelting industry which uses the MFO as fuel for their production activities. The volume of fuel MFO used for by PT. Inti General Yaja Steel Semarang production and the volume of vehicles passing through Jrakah intersection are the source of carbon monoxide (CO) which the dispersion process is affected by humidity, <b>temperature,</b> <b>wind</b> direction and speed. This study aim is to determine the effect of the pollutant sources volume, humidity, <b>temperature,</b> <b>wind</b> direction and speed on the concentration of CO {{in the area of the}} factory PT. Inti General Yaja Steel and at the Jrakah intersection, besides, to determine whether the concentration of CO is mutually influenced by conditions in these two places. The research was conducted at vehicle crowded hours, normal factory production hours and non- production factory hours. Based on these results, the concentration of CO in the factory area range in value from 2 to 2. 75 ppm at both vehicle crowded hours, normal production at the factory hours and non- production factory hours. The concentration of CO at the Jrakah intersection in vehicle crowded hours (7 : 00 to 8 : 00) are in range of 1. 75 ppm - 30. 25 ppm, the concentration of CO at Jrakah intersection in normal production hours (15 : 00 p. m. to 16 : 00) were between 11. 25 ppm - 22. 25 ppm, and the concentration of CO at Jrakah intersection in non-production hours (19 : 00 to 20 : 00) were in the range 4. 5 ppm - 22. 25 ppm. The statistic results indicate that there are significant differences in the concentrations of CO results in the factory area and at the Jrakah intersection. CO concentration in factory area is not affected by the volume of fuel, humidity, <b>temperature,</b> <b>wind</b> speed and direction in its area, while the concentration of CO in Jrakah intersection are affected by the volume of vehicles passing through, humidity, <b>temperature,</b> <b>wind</b> speed and direction at the intersection itself. The concentration of CO in the area of the factory is not affected by the volume of vehicles passing through, humidity, <b>temperature,</b> <b>wind</b> speed and direction at the Jrakah intersection, and so the concentration of CO in the intersection Jrakah are not affected by the volume of fuel, humidity, <b>temperature,</b> <b>wind</b> speed and direction in the factory area.

30|$|The {{standardized}} FAO 56 Penman-Monteith model, {{which has}} been the most reasonable method in both humid and arid climatic conditions, provides reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimates for planning and efficient use of agricultural water resources. And sensitivity analysis is important in understanding the relative importance of climatic variables to the variation of reference evapotranspiration. In this study, a non-dimensional relative sensitivity coefficient was employed to predict responses of ETo to perturbations of four climatic variables in the Ejina oasis northwest China. A 20 -year historical dataset of daily air <b>temperature,</b> <b>wind</b> speed, relative humidity and daily sunshine duration in the Ejina oasis was used in the analysis. Results have shown that daily sensitivity coefficients exhibited large fluctuations during the growing season, and shortwave radiation was the most sensitive variable in general for the Ejina oasis, followed by air <b>temperature,</b> <b>wind</b> speed and relative humidity. According to this study, the response of ETo can be preferably predicted under perturbation of air <b>temperature,</b> <b>wind</b> speed, relative humidity and shortwave radiation by their sensitivity coefficients.|$|R
