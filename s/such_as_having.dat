5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{five different}} modes: Hunt, Nest, Rescue, Defend and Arena, which have different objectives {{for both the}} Hunters and the Monster. Evolve provides two different structures to these game modes: Quick Play, which starts a single playthrough match; and Evacuation, {{which serves as a}} five-match, multiplayer story mode. In Evacuation, each match gives the winning side an advantage in the next map, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a toxic gas the Monster is immune to, or autonomous gun turrets to assist the Hunters. The Evacuation mode ends with a 'Defend' match. Evolve also features an Observer Mode, allowing players to watch a match without playing in the match. The spectator can jump between cameras and view the match from both the Hunters' and the Monster's perspectives.|$|E

5|$|Organisms {{were first}} {{classified}} by Aristotle (Greece, 384–322 BC) during his {{stay on the}} Island of Lesbos. He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms attributes, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied. He divided all living things into two groups: plants and animals. Some of his groups of animals, such as Anhaima (animals without blood, translated as invertebrates) and Enhaima (animals with blood, roughly the vertebrates), as well as groups like the sharks and cetaceans, are still commonly used today. His student Theophrastus (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his Historia Plantarum. Again, several plant groups currently still recognized {{can be traced back}} to Theophrastus, such as Cornus, Crocus, and Narcissus.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{and only}} known specimen, {{which is in}} very poor condition, is {{preserved}} in the Museum d'Histoire Naturel de Neuchâtel as specimen MHNN 91.2426. It has five auricular lobules {{in front of the}} ears {{on each side of the}} head, 39 rows of scales around the midbody, keels on its dorsal scales, and the third supraocular scale in contact with the frontal scale, all characters which align it with Trachylepis rather than Mabuya. The other putative mainland South American Trachylepis, T.maculata, has five instead of three keels, 32 to 34 midbody scales, and separated parietal scales. T.tschudii agrees with the Noronha skink in size, coloration, numbers of scales, and discrete characters, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> the supranasal, parietal, and prefrontal scales all in contact.|$|E
5|$|Theme Park offers {{three levels}} of simulation: the higher {{difficulties}} requiring more management of aspects such as logistics. For example, at full level, the player must manage research, negotiations, stocks, and shares. On sandbox, the game does not involve those aspects. The player can switch mode at any time. Game time is implemented like a calendar: {{at the end of}} each year, the player is judged on that year's performance against rivals. Game speed can be adjusted, and staff can be moved by the player. Cash awards may be earned for doing well, and trophies may be awarded for achievements <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> the longest roller coaster.|$|E

5|$|A {{version for}} PC was {{developed}} by Square's Costa Mesa offices. Square invested in a PC version so they could reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled {{by a team of}} 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but including help from Tokyo. Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished. The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays. The PC version came with a license for Yamaha Corporation's software synthesizer S-YXG70, allowing high-quality sequenced music despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to XG format files was done by Yamaha.|$|E
5|$|Double Dash {{was first}} shown at E3 2001 as a seven-second video clip. The clip {{featured}} Mario and Luigi driving their karts on a bump mapped 3D surface with no background. At the time, {{it was early}} in development, and the working title of the game was simply Mario Kart. In April 2003, Nintendo released the first pictures and details of the game, as well as revealing the title to be Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. At E3 2003, a playable demo of the game was available. New features, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> two characters drive one kart, had been implemented. An updated demo with some new additions was shown at the Games Convention in August 2003. In September, Nintendo held a Gamers' Summit for the press, in which a nearly complete and more sped up version of Double Dash was displayed. The Gamers' Summit also announced the North American release date to be November 17, 2003.|$|E

The PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC versions feature higher visual fidelity, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a higher texture resolution and more animal fur. The game was supported by downloadable content upon launch. The first DLC, Escape From Durgesh Prison, featuring a new mission set during the main campaign, {{was released}} on January 13, 2015. It can be played solo or with another player. The Overrun DLC, which added new maps, a new vehicle, and a new mode to the game's competitive multiplayer, {{was released on}} February 10, 2015 for the consoles, and February 12, 2015 for PC. The Hurk Deluxe Pack was released on January 28, 2015 and added several story missions and weapons. The last downloadable content, Valley of the Yetis, features a new region and new story missions which can be played solo or co-cooperatively with another player. Valley of the Yetis was released on March 10, 2015 in North America and March 11, 2015 in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The manga was {{not popular}} initially. Although he {{suspected}} the fighting genre would appeal more to its shōnen audience, Toriyama tried {{to stick to}} the Journey to the West adventure aspect which he himself enjoyed. <b>Such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> the setting change each chapter, different enemies popping up, and different locations. It was only after he became tired of Torishima nagging about its popularity that Toriyama gave in and developed more battles with the first shown Tenkaichi Budōkai. Despite his reluctance, the author said it felt good when the series picked up in popularity at that point. However, he said he still tried to resist by returning to the adventure aspect with the Red Ribbon Army arc, and visiting Penguin Village from Dr. Slump to add comedy. When that did not work out, fighting became the main theme for the manga.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners' {{day began}} at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli {{describes}} roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz {{at that time}} of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he was a prisoner in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|Casting Crowns {{was formed}} in 1999 by Mark Hall (lead vocals), Hector Cervantes (guitar, vocals), Juan DeVevo (guitar, vocals), and Melodee DeVevo (violin, vocals) as a student worship band. The band is {{originally}} from Daytona Beach, Florida but relocated to Eagle's Landing First Baptist Church in McDonough, Georgia in 2001, where they recruited Megan Garrett (piano/vocals), Andy Williams (drums), and Chris Huffman (bass guitar) as members. One of their independent records was discovered by Mark A. Miller, the lead vocalist for country band Sawyer Brown. Although Casting Crowns had not released their independent records with intentions of receiving a record deal, Miller offered the band {{the opportunity to become}} the first artists signed to his record label. The band agreed to join and signed with the as-yet-unnamed record label, an imprint of Provident Label Group, and began work on their debut album. As a group, Casting Crowns was unusual in several ways, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> seven members, never having toured before, and their producer (Miller) having no history in the Christian music industry. However, Christian singer and songwriter Steven Curtis Chapman was brought in to co-produce the album with Miller, giving the project a greater amount of support in the Christian music industry. Terry Hemmings, Provident Label Group CEO/President and a personal friend of Miller, openly predicted success for Casting Crowns and made them one of his top priorities at the label. While most artists in a similar situation would have received nine months for artist development, Hemmings gave the band four months and sped up the album's release. Casting Crowns was recorded at Glow in the Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee. The album was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E

5|$|On the February 6 {{episode of}} Raw, Lita teamed with Edge {{in a loss}} to Cena and Maria. She {{continued}} to manage Edge into mid-2006, frequently interfering on his behalf during his feud with Mick Foley. In May 2006, Foley joined forces with Edge and Lita, with the trio defeating Foley's ECW rivals Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer, and Beulah McGillicutty in an impromptu six-person tag team match at One Night Stand after Edge speared and pinned Beulah. On the August 14 episode of Raw, Lita won her third Women's Championship by defeating Mickie James. She lost the title to longtime rival, Trish Stratus, at Unforgiven in Stratus's retirement match. The next night on Raw, the Women's Championship was vacated and a tournament was scheduled to crown a new champion. Lita won the tournament on November 5 at Cyber Sunday defeating Mickie James in a lumberjill match. Throughout the month, Lita made James compete in several handicap matches, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> one hand tied behind her back and being blindfolded. On the November 20, episode of Raw, Lita announced that her final match would be at Survivor Series. Lita lost her final match and the Women's title to rival, Mickie James. Due to Lita's retirement, her relationship with Edge abruptly ended at the event, with no explanation.|$|E
