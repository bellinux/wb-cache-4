2500|$|Cooperation {{with the}} Conservative-Liberal {{coalition}} government {{resulted in the}} implementation of some of their key demands, most importantly strong restrictions in immigration policies, which have resulted in what is often described as Europe's strictest immigration laws. The new government enacted rules that prevented Danish citizens and others from bringing a foreign spouse into the country unless both partners were aged 24 or above, passed a solvency test showing the Dane had not claimed social security for 12 months and could lodge a bond of 60,011 kroner (about 10,100 USD). One declared aim of this was to fight arranged marriages. These new rules had the effect that while about 8,151 family reunification permits were granted in 2002, the number had fallen to 3,525 by 2005. Some social benefits for refugees were also cut by 30-40% during their first seven years in the country, ordinary unemployment benefits being replaced by a reduced [...] "start-up aid". Whereas the government coalition's declared aim with this was to improve integration by inciting people to work, immigration spokesman Søren Krarup of DPP has expressed his content in that the <b>start-up</b> <b>aid</b> has decreased the number of economic refugees greatly, showing them that [...] "one does not find gold in the streets in Denmark". Nevertheless, total immigration increased post implementation of the migration reforms.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a survey of}} literature on the <b>start-up</b> <b>aid</b> for young farmers. The {{second part of the}} study examines the development of the capital invested in agriculture and the amount of liabilities on full time farms transferred to the next generation on the basis of bookkeeping and support register data of a sample of farms collected from farms that received <b>start-up</b> <b>aid</b> in 1996 - 1999. In Finland the <b>start-up</b> <b>aid</b> in the form of subsidies has been applied for 20 years, but loans have a much longer history. The objective has been to direct <b>start-up</b> <b>aid</b> to farms where the preconditions for economically rational agriculture exist, but not to such on extent or for secondary activities so that the farms could be considered to be in real need of support. Many of the criteria for the <b>start-up</b> <b>aid,</b> such as the maximum age, full-time farming and residence on the farm, as well as regulation of the use of the subsidy, have been eased. Certain conditions have also become stricter, the most notably the minimum size of the farm, which was tightened neet minimialat korvattiin vaatimuksella, että tilalla katsottiin voitavan olla edellytof the EU membership, but according to the criteria, {{at least one of the}} spouses had to gain all of his/her livelihood from agriculture and forestry. In connection with the revision of the EU provision this criterion was eased, and part-time farms became eligible for <b>start-up</b> <b>aid</b> as well. In Finland <b>start-up</b> <b>aid</b> has been paid up to the maximum set by the EU. In 1995 - 1999 the maximum amounts of the subsidy and loan were 15, 000 euros each, and since 2000 these have been 25, 000 euros. The average age of starting in agriculture was 28 years, and about 40 % of the farmers gained the possession of the farm at the age of 26 - 30 years. In 2000 the average cultivated area of the farms included in the study was 45 ha, while the average arable area of all farms receiving income support was 28 ha. The numbers of livestock were also higher than the average. On farms where the transfer included the transaction of real estate, movable property, or both against compensation, the average cost estimate of the transfer was 80, 000 euros. About 10 % of the transfers involved no such transaction, but these were realised through leasing or as gifts. One year after the transfer the average debts of the new farmers were 57, 000 euros, and only about 4 % of the farms were free from debt. The degree of self-sufficiency, i. e. the share of own capital in the capital invested in agriculture, averaged 50 %. On pig and poultry farms the degree of self- sufficiency was 30 %, on crop farms it was 45 % and on dairy farms 56 %. Most new farmers invested heavily in agriculture in the first few years after the transfer. More than half of the farms purchased or leased arable land. Even if the investments increased the average amount of debt on the farms, the debts grew more slowly than the amount of own capital. Five years after the transfer the average degree of self-sufficiency was 60 %, and the differences between the farms had decreased. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) <b>Start-up</b> <b>aid</b> and the capital stock of farm...|$|E
40|$|On 7 February 2005, the European Commission {{published}} draft “Community {{guidelines on}} {{the financing of}} airports and <b>start-up</b> <b>aid</b> to airlines departing from regional airports” for consultation. This article focuses on the Draft Guidelines’ statements on “start-up aid,” which seek to integrate the Commission’s statements in last year’s Charleroi decision into a consistent state aid policy framework. It is submitted here that such an attempt is highly problematic, given {{the absence of a}} coherent and objective justification for <b>start-up</b> <b>aid</b> in its proposed form. The Commission should not depart from its long-standing hostility to operating aid for reasons of perceived political expediency. At the very least, the Commission should limit the distortive effects of such aid to the greatest possible extent, in particular by limiting it to routes to and from truly regional airports...|$|E
40|$|Turning {{unemployment}} into self-employment {{has become}} an increasingly impor-tant part of active labor market policies (ALMP) in many OECD countries. Germany {{is a good example}} where the spending on <b>start-up</b> <b>aids</b> for the unemployed accounted for nearly 17 % of the total spending on ALMP in 2004. In contrast to other policies— like vocational training, job creation schemes, or wage subsidies—the empirical evi-dence on the effectiveness of such programs is scarce; especially regarding long-term effects. This paper aims to close this gap. We use survey data from a large sample of participants in two distinct start-up programs (and a control group of unemployed who did not enter these programs). Based on conditional propensity score matching methods we estimate the long-term effects of the programs against nonparticipation. Our results show {{that at the end of}} the observation period, both programs are effective with respect to different outcome variables. Additionally, we conduct extensive sensi-tivity checks and also consider effect heterogeneity. We finally conclude that programs aimed at turning the unemployed into entrepreneurs may be a promising active labor market policy, both in Germany and elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time, NMR Imaging {{has been used}} to provide {{non-invasive}} quantitative data for transient washwater addition to rising foam. Washwater is routinely added to flotation froths to aid rejection of unwanted gangue material from the concentrate stream. The results show that washwater added to a mature foam (i. e., one that has attained its equilibrium liquid fraction) travels down the column, whereas washwater added to an immature foam travels up the column. This observation has important implications for flotation plant practise; washwater added too early at <b>start-up</b> will not <b>aid</b> gangue rejection but will instead merely lead to a wetter concentrate stream. This is explained theoretically {{in the context of the}} Hydrodynamic Theory of Rising Foam...|$|R

In this article we have studied the performance of a small sample on new Estonian firms that received public start-up grant. For the analysis we use the rather unique data on the firms’ plans for the 3 successive years after the start-up. The decisions to grant the <b>start-up</b> <b>aid</b> were maid based on these plans. The results indicated that while many firms could not meet their reported goals (in terms of turnover, profit and the number of jobs created) {{and more than half of}} the firms had tax arrears, the estimated labour taxes paid by these firms were much higher compared to the sum of the grant, thus indicating the positive net impact of grants on the state’s fiscal position...|$|E

5000|$|MIT {{played an}} {{integral}} role in establishing Route 128 as a technopole. MIT {{was established in}} 1861 as a technical university. [...] After the Second World War, MIT encouraged technological innovation through commercially oriented research. [...] Funding for research projects came from large corporations such as GE, Eastern Kodak, and Dupont, {{as well as the}} federal government. [...] In 1930, the Division of Industrial Cooperation and Research which solicited research contracts from companies was discontinued, although MIT maintained its capacity to solicit corporate contracts. [...] Many of research projects included electronic innovations and projects for the federal government. In 1941, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) was created. [...] During the 1940s and 1950s, MIT received one third of the OSRD’s contracts, which was estimated at $330 million in contracts for research projects. [...] Harvard University and other local universities also received funding for research projects alongside MIT. This area was named “Research Row”. [...] Unlike Frederick Terman’s approach of <b>aiding</b> <b>start-up</b> companies within Stanford University, MIT had a strict policy which would not invest in start-up companies of its students, as investing was considered risky and inconsistent with their policies. [...] Despite MIT choosing not to invest in start-up organizations around the region, there were many technology firms that provided funding. MIT continues to solicit contracts from corporations and is still highly regarded as an institution that is a leader in technological innovations.|$|R
40|$|Many modern {{economic}} theories place {{great importance}} upon entrepreneurship in the economy. Some see the entrepreneur {{as the individual}} who bears risk of operating a business {{in the face of}} uncertainty about future conditions and who is rewarded through profits and losses. The 20 th century economist Joseph Schumpter saw the entrepreneur as the medium by which advancing technology is incorporated into society as businesses seek competitive advantages through more efficient product development processes. Due to the importance that capitalistic systems place upon entrepreneurship, it has become a well studied subject with many texts to discuss how entrepreneurs can succeed in modern society. Many entrepreneuring and business management courses {{go so far as to}} discuss the characteristic phases and prominent challenges that fledgling companies face in their efforts to bring a new product into a competitive market. However, even with all of these <b>aids,</b> <b>start-up</b> companies fail at an enormous rate. Indeed, the odds of shepherding a new company through the travails of becoming a well established company (as measured by the ability to reach Initial Public Offering (IPO)) have been estimated to be six in 1, 000, 000. Each niche industry has characteristic challenges which act as barriers to entry for new products into that industry. Thus, the applicability of broad generalizations is subject to limitations within niche markets. This paper will discuss entrepreneurship as it relates to general aviation. The goals of this paper will be to: introduce general aviation; discuss the details of marrying entrepreneurship with general aviation; and present a sample business plan which would characterize a possible entrepreneurial venture...|$|R
5000|$|Whilst {{the above}} {{improvements}} have proven vital and beneficial to firms, consumers have also enjoyed {{the rewards of}} such expansion through cheaper pricing due to increased competition, access to a wider array of goods and better quality products due {{to the ability of}} firms to contact a bigger range of suppliers. Popular online sale sites which have become a staple of the internet due to Global Reach initiatives has also allowed the general public to access foreign markets, most commonly those of small home-run firms. The economic concept of the multiplier affect applies in some such cases as domestic markets can prosper directly through the opportunities provided by Global Reach. Firms have also embraced the internet to enabling the user to access their websites in several languages and in cases of online retail, allowing the customer to view the products with the price tag in the appropriate currency. Businesses can use the internet to come closer to their customers. Most firm websites provide contact information for its users allowing consumers unprecedented access into the firm, helping the business to establish a loyal consumer base. [...] Other small businesses can also benefit from one firm’s decision to move forward technologically. The internet allows businesses to publish its information to be available on a public front, potentially <b>aiding</b> <b>start-up</b> firms to review potential aims and target market. Especially relevant in the face of emerging concerns for climate change, businesses are under pressure to look forward to more environmentally sustainable means of growth, for example the availability of email as a means of contact reduces the environmental strain on paper use.|$|R
40|$|A {{drug that}} is {{effective}} in one group of patients may have a reduced or no effect in other patients. Similarly, the risk for side effects differs between patients. The discipline of pharmacogenomics studies how genetic variation in the population can influence this drug response. In this thesis, we have used multiple approaches to examine these challenges and opportunities in pharmacogenomics: we studied variants with well-established functional effects, used specialized genotyping chips focusing on cardiovascular genes or rare variation, and increased sample sizes by meta-analyzing studies. Thematically, we have focused on common diseases: atherosclerosis, asthma, and high blood pressure. Chapter 1 of this thesis is the General Introduction. In Chapter 2 we review current evidence for associations between genetic variability and differences in response to statins and ACE-inhibitors. Here, we show that the (initial) enthusiasm for possible applications of pharmacogenetic research {{has resulted in a}} high number of publications. Many of these studies, which combine genetics with pharmacology, are of low quality, at least in the field of statin pharmacogenetics. This results in false-positive findings and non-replication. Chapter 3 describes three new studies into the pharmacogenetics of statin response. In all studies, we combined evidence from several independent studies, and explored how the polymorphisms change the response to statins. Results of these studies indicated that there is a small, but statistically significant effect of genetic variation on statin efficacy. Chapter 4 presents candidate gene (array) approaches to asthma and lung function pharmacogenetics. Again, the effects of genetic variation on the response to drugs in this disease area are small. The thesis concludes with the General discussion, which provides a general discussion of the findings in a broader perspective, commenting on the implications for clinical practice, methodological challenges and opportunities, and making recommendations for future research. The ideal of ‘personalized medicine’, where every patient receives a tailored treatment, is difficult to achieve due to the small effect sizes, a generally favorable response, and the added difficulty of a need for genotyping. It therefore seems unlikely that it will become the norm in the coming years, especially for common diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, or asthma. We have also seen that there are still many, yet unused, possibilities to improve the current pharmacogenomic research methods, and {{to have an impact on}} medicine. Much of this pharmacogenomic research will <b>aid</b> <b>start-ups</b> and established pharmaceutical companies in establishing targets for pharmacological action. Pharmacogenomics can also help to get market approval for drugs, if there are problems with side effects or a lack of efficacy in a genetically-defined subgroup of patients. We further plead for a larger role for multiethnic research in pharmacogenetic research. With a systematic and hypothesis-free approach we have learned a great deal about human biology and disease in the last decade. It is time to turn this knowledge into new and improved therapies...|$|R
