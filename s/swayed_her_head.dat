60|$|She {{returned}} {{silent and}} weak denials to his charges, and <b>swayed</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> desperately, {{as if to}} thrust away the words as they came showering about her ears from the lips of the trembling man in the climax of life, with his bronzed Roman face and fine frame.|$|E
6000|$|The {{old woman}} sat staring hard into the fire, her pale eyes wide open. [...] "Ay," [...] she broke in; [...] "and eight-and-twenty years you have lived and {{never seen the}} likes of this house, I reckon. There's a many things to see, when one's still but eight-and-twenty." [...] She <b>swayed</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slowly from side to side. [...] "A many things to see and sorrow for." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{they stood}} {{and watched the}} curls of hair {{trailing}} {{down the back of}} the successful rival, and the waving of her feather, as she <b>swayed</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> After a few timid notes and uncertain touches her playing became markedly correct, and towards the end full and free. But, whether from prejudice or unbiassed judgment, the venerable body of musicians could not help thinking that the simpler notes they had been wont to bring forth were more in keeping with the simplicity of their old church than the crowded chords and interludes it was her pleasure to produce.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Cosham {{approved}} of this sentiment with more ponderous sagacity from {{her side of}} the tea-table, in the first place by <b>swaying</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and in the second by remarking: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dare to disobey us and {{you will}} quickly find out," [...] snapped Indigo, <b>swaying</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{from side to side}} on its long, swan-like neck like the {{pendulum}} of a clock.|$|R
60|$|She was dying: we saw it, {{and thanked}} God--for while she lived she could feel, and what must she have felt? She raised herself upon her bony hands, and blindly gazed around <b>her,</b> <b>swaying</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slowly {{from side to}} side as a {{tortoise}} does. She could not see, for her whitish eyes were covered with a horny film. Oh, the horrible pathos of the sight! But she could still speak.|$|R
60|$|It was so rare to hear {{my mother}} say a hard word against anybody (unless it were General Buonaparte) that I was {{across the room and}} at the window in a jump. A pony-chaise was coming slowly down the village street, and in it was the queerest-looking person that I had ever seen. She was very stout, with a face that was of so dark a red that it shaded away into purple over the nose and cheeks. She wore a great hat with a white curling ostrich feather, and from under its brim her two bold, black eyes stared out with a look of anger and {{defiance}} as if to tell the folk that she thought less of them than they could do of her. She had some sort of scarlet pelisse with white swans-down about her neck, and she held the reins slack in her hands, while the pony wandered from side to side of the road as the fancy took him. Each time the chaise <b>swayed,</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> with the great hat swayed also, so that sometimes we saw the crown of it and sometimes the brim.|$|E
60|$|Still {{the doctor}} spoke {{soothing}} words, and still {{he held her}} hand. He knew that his words could not console her; but the sounds of his kindness at such desolate moments are, to such minds as hers, some alleviation of grief. She hardly answered him, but sat there staring out before her, leaving her hand passively to him, and <b>swaying</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> backwards and forwards as though her grief were too heavy to be borne.|$|R
60|$|With an easy, indolent, {{and in its}} {{indolence}} supple, feline movement, {{she rose}} from the chair, so provokingly ignoring me now, that for very rage I held my ground within less than a foot of her. Leisurely and tranquil, behaving right before me with the ease of a person alone in a room, she extended her beautiful arms, with her hands clenched, <b>her</b> body <b>swaying,</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown back a little, revelling contemptuously {{in a sense of}} relief, easing her limbs in freedom after all these days of crouching, motionless poses when she had been so furious and so afraid.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes sank before his; {{her bosom}} {{rose and fell}} rapidly. His {{influence}} over <b>her</b> maintained its <b>sway.</b> She bowed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in speechless submission.|$|R
6000|$|... "No--she {{does not}} matter--she is always jealous. I {{tell you it}} was Monseigneur. You did wrong to show {{yourself}} to him. And if you stay here you will repent it. Mark my words. Go. Here is my lord's carriage"--and seizing Becky's arm, he rushed down an alley of the garden as Lord Steyne's barouche, blazing with heraldic devices, came whirling along the avenue, borne by the almost priceless horses, and bearing Madame de Belladonna lolling on the cushions, dark, sulky, and blooming, a King Charles in her lap, a white parasol <b>swaying</b> over <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and old Steyne stretched at her side with a livid face and ghastly eyes. Hate, or anger, or desire caused them to brighten now and then still, but ordinarily, they gave no light, and seemed tired of looking out on a world of which almost all the pleasure and all the best beauty had palled upon the worn-out wicked old man.|$|R
6000|$|Now, man of croziers, shadows {{called our}} names [...] And then away, away, like {{whirling}} flames; [...] And now fled by, mist-covered, without sound, [...] The youth and lady and {{the deer and}} hound; [...] "Gaze no more on the phantoms," [...] Niam said, [...] And kissed my eyes, and, <b>swaying</b> <b>her</b> bright <b>head</b> [...] And <b>her</b> bright body, sang of faery and man [...] Before God was or my old line began; [...] Wars shadowy, vast, exultant; faeries of old [...] Who wedded men with rings of Druid gold; [...] And how those lovers never turn their eyes [...] Upon the life that fades and flickers and dies, [...] But love and kiss on dim shores far away [...] Rolled round with music of the sighing spray: [...] But sang no more, as when, like a brown bee [...] That has drunk full, she crossed the misty sea [...] With me in her white arms a hundred years [...] Before this day; for now the fall of tears [...] Troubled her song.|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{unexpectedly}} got up {{from the}} chair, <b>swaying</b> <b>her</b> supple figure and stretching her arms above <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> He stopped to look at her curiously, paused, and then went on: ...|$|R
60|$|Liza {{saw what}} a {{sensation}} she was creating; she arched {{her back and}} lifted <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and walked down the}} street, <b>swaying</b> <b>her</b> body from side to side, and swaggering along as though the whole place belonged to her.|$|R
60|$|She leaned <b>her</b> small, {{delicate}} <b>head</b> upon <b>her</b> {{hand and}} began <b>swaying</b> <b>her</b> feet slowly backwards and forwards.|$|R

60|$|Best of {{all it is}} {{to observe}} the birds when {{breeding}} in May. Brean Down is an ancient favourite breeding-site, and the birds breed there in the rabbit holes, and sometimes under a thick furze-bush on the ground. At another spot on this coast I have had the rare good fortune to find a number of pairs breeding at one spot on private enclosed land, where I could approach them very closely, and watch them any day {{for hours at a}} stretch, studying their curious sign-language, about which nothing, to my knowledge, has hitherto been written. There were about thirty pairs, and their breeding-holes were mostly rabbit-burrows scattered about on a piece of sandy ground, about an acre and a half in extent, almost surrounded by water. When I watched them the birds were laying; and at about ten o'clock in the morning they would begin to come in from the sea in pairs, all to settle down at one spot; and by creeping some distance at the water-side among the rushes, I could get within forty yards of them, and watch them by the hour without being discovered by them. In an hour or so there would be forty or fifty birds forming a flock, each couple always keeping close together, some sitting on the short grass, others standing, all very quiet. At length one bird in the flock, a male, would all at once begin to move his head in a slow, measured manner from side to side, like a pianist swaying his body in time to his own music. If no notice was taken of this motion by the duck sitting by his side dozing on the grass, the drake, would take a few steps forward and place himself directly before her, so as to compel her to give attention, and rock more vigorously than ever, haranguing her, as it were, although without words; the meaning of it all being {{that it was time for}} her to get up and go to her burrow to lay her egg. I do not know any other species in which the male takes it on himself to instruct his mate on a domestic matter which one would imagine to be exclusively within her own province; and some ornithologists may doubt that I have given a right explanation of these curious doings of the sheldrake. But mark what follows: The duck at length gets up, in a lazy, reluctant way, perhaps, and stretches a wing and a leg, and then after awhile <b>sways</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> two or three times, as if to say that she is ready. At once the drake, followed by her, walks off, and leads the way to the burrow, which may be a couple of hundred yards away; and during the walk she sometimes stops, whereupon he at once turns back and begins the swaying motion again. At last, arriving at the mouth of the burrow, he steps aside and invites her to enter, rocking himself again, and anon bending his head down and looking into the cavity, then drawing back again; and at last, after so much persuasion on his part, she lowers <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> creeps quietly down and disappears within. Left alone, the drake stations himself at the burrow's mouth, with head raised like a sentinel on duty; but after five or ten minutes he slowly walks back to the flock, and settles down for a quiet nap among his fellows. They are all married couples; and every drake among them, when in some mysterious way he knows the time has come for the egg to be laid, has to go through the same long ceremonious performance, with variations according to his partner's individual disposition.|$|R

60|$|She ceased <b>her</b> <b>swaying</b> movement, and now, with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sunk between <b>her</b> shoulders, {{she hugged}} herself with both her arms; and {{she stared at}} Almayer with wild eyes, while her teeth chattered, {{rattling}} violently and uninterruptedly, with a very loud sound, in the deep peace of the house.|$|R
60|$|They {{remained}} {{beside the}} coffin, she kneeling with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> buried in <b>her</b> wrinkled hands, he standing silent and passionately wrathful both against {{one man and}} against destiny. He had almost screamed with horror when de Chavasse thus brutally uttered Lady Sue's name: {{he had seen the}} young girl almost <b>sway</b> on <b>her</b> feet, as she smothered the cry of agony and horror which at her guardian's callous taunt had risen to her lips.|$|R

6000|$|Playful as Mr. Hawkesworth's manner was, Lily saw the earnestness {{that was}} veiled under it: {{she felt the}} solemnity of Eleanor's appeal, and {{knew that this was}} no time to let herself be <b>swayed</b> by <b>her</b> wishes. There was a silence. At last, after a great struggle, Lily's better {{judgment}} gained the mastery, and raising <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> she said, 'Oh! Frank, do not ask me--I wish--but, Eleanor, when you see how much harm we have done, how utterly we have failed--' ...|$|R
60|$|He smiled, {{for she was}} <b>swaying,</b> <b>her</b> lids half closed. By {{a supreme}} effort she conquered her terror and looked at him. The look was in his eyes still, {{intensified}} now.|$|R

60|$|Beatrice {{was leaning}} back with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> bent a little forward, {{so that he}} could only see her chin and the sweet curve of the lips above it. But she could see all his face as it <b>swayed</b> towards <b>her</b> with each motion of the paddle, and she watched it with interest. It was a new type of face to her, so strong and manly, and yet so gentle about the mouth--almost too gentle she thought. What made him marry Lady Honoria? Beatrice wondered; she did not look {{particularly}} gentle, though she was such a graceful woman.|$|R
6000|$|She {{drew back}} {{and away from}} him, bewildered and horrified. Slowly she rose to her feet.

6000|$|Nedda {{bent over}} him; her hair covered his wet <b>head,</b> <b>her</b> hands trembled on his shoulders. Her heart {{felt as if}} it would melt right out of her; she longed so to warm and dry him with herself. And, in turn, his wet arms {{clutched}} her close, his wet hands could not keep still on her. Then he drew back, and whispering: [...] "Oh, Nedda! Nedda!" [...] fled out like a dark ghost. Oblivious that she was damp from head to foot, Nedda stood <b>swaying,</b> <b>her</b> eyes closed and her lips just open; then, putting out her arms, she drew them suddenly in and clasped herself....|$|R
