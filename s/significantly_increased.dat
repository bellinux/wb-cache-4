5|$|Death from {{pneumothorax}} is very uncommon (except {{in tension}} pneumothoraces). British statistics show an annual mortality rate of 1.26 and 0.62 deaths per million person-years {{in men and}} women, respectively. A <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> risk of death is seen in older victims and in those with secondary pneumothoraces.|$|E

5|$|A {{project to}} improve the {{performance}} of the J 34 resulted in one Hunter being fitted with a Swedish-designed afterburner in 1958. While this <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> the engine's thrust, there was little improvement in overall performance, thus the project was shelved. The last of the J 34s was retired from service in 1969.|$|E

5|$|A {{study from}} 2005 {{concluded}} that heat waves <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> in frequency, persistence and spatial {{coverage in the}} decade 1991-2000, {{when compared to the}} period between 1971–80 and 1981-90. A severe heat wave in Orissa in 1998 resulted in nearly 1300 deaths. Based on observations, heat wave related mortality has increased in India prior to 2005. The 2015 Indian heat wave killed more than 2,500 people.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the park}} by {{tourists}} improved {{in the early years}} of the park, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable. Tourism <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> after the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, but the long horseback ride to reach the area was a deterrent. Three stagecoach roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access for the growing number of visitors to Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Federation, overall {{literacy}} in Sarawak was quite low. In 1960, the overall literacy rate was 25%, with a heavy slant in the literacy rate towards the Chinese population, 53%, {{compared with that of}} indigenous peoples which was substantially lower, only 17%. By 2007, overall literacy in adults aged 15 and over had <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> to 92.3% and in 2012, this had climbed to 96%.|$|E

5|$|Conditions in Yosemite Valley {{and access}} to the park {{steadily}} improved. In 1878, Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional moraine in the valley to drain a swamp behind it. Tourism <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> after a Sacramento to Stockton extension of the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 and the Central Pacific Railroad reached Merced in 1872.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on {{attracting}} students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, {{by which it}} <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> its endowment. Sturges Hall was constructed as the University's first library in 1855. In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in Merrick Hall. The Ohio Wesleyan Female College, established in 1853, merged with the university in 1877. Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and music education greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.|$|E

5|$|Tellurium {{is used in}} cadmium {{telluride}} (CdTe) solar panels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests of tellurium demonstrated {{some of the greatest}} efficiencies for solar cell electric power generators. Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> tellurium demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges.|$|E
5|$|The Shinano River system, {{particularly}} in its upper reaches (Chikuma River) {{and in the}} Sai basin, is used for hydroelectric power generation due to the steep gradient in its upper reaches and its high discharge producing, as a whole, 2,618 megawatts. While the construction of hydroelectric power stations began before World War II, it <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> following the war. These power plants, such as the Shimofanato Power Station and the 450,000 kilowatt JR East Shinano River Hydropower Station near Ojiya, supply Tokyo.|$|E

5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
