40|$|The solar {{tracking}} unit {{was developed to}} support the Laser Heterodyne Spectrometer (LHS) airborne instrument, but has application to a general class of airborne solar occultation <b>research</b> <b>instruments.</b> The unit consists of a mirror mounted on two gimbals, {{one of which is}} hollow. The mirror reflects a 7. 6 cm (3. 0 in.) diameter beam of sunlight through the hollow gimbal into the <b>research</b> <b>instrument</b> optical axis. A portion of the reflected sunlight is directed into a tracking telescope which uses a four quadrant silicon detector to produce the servo error signals. The colinearity of the tracker output beam and the <b>research</b> <b>instrument</b> optical axis is maintained to better than + or - 1 arc-minute.

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{hesitation}} in participation among Pakistani women {{when it comes to}} giving their responses in surveys related to breast cancer which {{may be due to the}} associated stigma and conservatism in society. We felt that no <b>research</b> <b>instrument</b> was able to extract information from the respondents to the extent it was needed for the successful execution of our study. The need to develop a <b>research</b> <b>instrument</b> tailored for Pakistani women was based upon the fact that most Pakistani women come from a conservative background and sometimes view this topic as provocative and believe discussing publicly about it as inappropriate. Existing <b>research</b> <b>instruments</b> exhibited a number of weaknesses during literature review. Therefore, using them may not be able to extract information concretely. A <b>research</b> <b>instrument</b> was, thus, developed exclusively. It was coined as, “breast cancer inventory (BCI) ” by a panel of experts for executing a study aimed at documenting awareness, knowledge, and attitudes of Pakistani women regarding breast cancer and early detection techniques. The study is still in the data collection phase. The statistical analysis involved the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure and Bartlett’s test for sampling adequacy. In addition, reliability analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were, also employed. This concept paper focuses on the development, piloting and validation of the BCI. It is the first <b>research</b> <b>instrument</b> which has high acceptability among Pakistani women and is able to extract adequate information from the respondents without causing embarrassment or unease...|$|R

This help sheet {{is designed to help}} you understand some of the issues surrounding instruments as well as introduce information resources {{that can be used to}} find information about them. The first question you need to answer is this: Do I need to find information about a <b>research</b> <b>instrument</b> or do I need to obtain a copy for use in research? If you need information about a <b>research</b> <b>instrument,</b> what kind of information do you need: information on content, development, psychometric properties (reliability, validity, etc.) ? If you plan to use the <b>instrument</b> in <b>research,</b> you need to be concerned not only with obtaining the instrument, but also obtaining permission to use the instrument. Let’s review of the main sources of test and instrument information. Health and Psychosocial Instruments (HaPI) Health and Psychosocial Instruments can be accessed via the MCO Network Applications window. It indexes primary sources (articles about the instruments which may include a copy of the published or unpublished instrument), secondary sources (journal articles that use the published or unpublished instrument), and review/compendium sources (like Mental Measurements Yearbook; published or unpublished instruments).

40|$|The {{extent of}} the {{application}} of the strategic planning process on dental education institutions was the problem in this descriptive study. The specific purpose was to describe the status of strategic planning based on the perceptions of the respondents. The organization, the characteristics and the impact of the strategic planning process would be investigated and described by this research. The total population of the doctoral and post-doctoral dental education institutions were included in the study. A specifically developed <b>research</b> <b>instrument</b> was used to elicit the perceptions of the respondents, both experts and chief executive officers (deans). All the experts (100 percent) completed and validated the <b>research</b> <b>instrument</b> and 65 percent of the dental education institutions completed the <b>research</b> <b>instrument.</b> The <b>research</b> <b>instrument</b> evaluated three areas of strategic planning: organization, characteristics, and the impact of strategic planning on their institutions. It was concluded that all dental education institutions participate in the strategic planning process and that the organization in the strategic planning process and that the organization and characteristics are generally similar to those in higher education institutions. The application of the strategic planning process has been proven beneficial in higher education institutions and there are perceived benefits in dental education. The study also concluded that there were conflicting perceptions that showed differences between dental and higher education institutions. These differences demonstrated that the dental education^institutions were not using the strategic planning process at the same functioning level as higher education institutions...|$|R
