25|$|Because {{of a mass}} {{emigration}} of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti {{became a}} popular take-out dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken curry, potatoes, a boiled egg and various vegetables, most notably the kousenband or yardlong bean. Another variation includes shrimp and aubergine. The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg and yardlong beans are served <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>on</b> a plate, with the aloo puri folded in fours on top. One then has the option to spice the dish with a very hot chutney made of Madame Jeanette peppers.|$|E
25|$|The {{rapid rise}} of Sudoku in Britain from {{relative}} obscurity to a front-page feature in national newspapers attracted commentary {{in the media}} and parody (such as when The Guardian G2 section advertised itself as the first newspaper supplement with a Sudoku grid on every page). Recognizing the different psychological appeals of easy and difficult puzzles, The Times introduced both, <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side,</b> <b>on</b> June 20, 2005. From July 2005, Channel 4 included a daily Sudoku game in their teletext service. On August 2, the BBC's program guide Radio Times featured a weekly Super Sudoku with a 16×16 grid.|$|E

25|$|The seconed type of volcano-ice {{interaction}} is located {{only to the}} east, south and southwest of the Tanzilla Plateau, in the Cassiar Mountains, Skeena Mountains and in the Boundary Ranges. Volcanic activity in these locations is also largely mafic in composition, but the extensive elevations of these areas had a much more impressive influence on glaciation and subglacial volcanism. High altitude glaciation took over when the Cordilleran Ice Sheet was not present and even when buried by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, basal ice movement was strongly influenced by the deep, pre-glacial drainages. Accordingly, the erosional remnants of subglacial volcanoes are minor and intermittent. In the Skeena Mountains, separated outcrops of pillow lava and volcanic breccia are generally found <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>on</b> the summits of sharp rugged mountain ridges, with presumably temporally-associated pyroclastic rocks having collected downslope.|$|E
25|$|On {{election}} day, {{there was}} intimidation and fraud on all sides, employed by both parties. Edgefield and Laurens counties had more votes for Democratic candidate Wade Hampton III {{than the total}} number of registered voters in either county. The returns were disputed all the way to Washington, where they {{played a central role in}} the Compromise of 1877. Both parties claimed victory. For a while, two separate state assemblies did business <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>on</b> the floor of the State House (their Speakers shared the Speaker's desk, but each had his own gavel), until the Democrats moved to their own building. There the Democrats continued to pass resolutions and conducted the state's business, just as the Republicans were doing. The Republican State Assembly tossed out results of the tainted election and reelected Chamberlain as governor. A week later, General Wade Hampton III took the oath of office for the Democrats.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the Dutch {{aircraft}} manufacturer, Fokker, realising that the {{increasing use of}} jet-powered fighters meant that existing piston-engined advanced trainers had insufficient performance, started design of a jet-engined advanced trainer, the S.14 Machtrainer. According to Harker the idea for a Dutch jet trainer originated after Rolls-Royce approached Fokker with drawings for a Derwent-powered jet trainer. Rolls-Royce feared losing the large market for jet trainers to the Goblin-powered Vampire and, after an unsuccessful attempt to interest Miles Aircraft in producing a Derwent-powered competitor, approached Fokker. The S.14 was a low-winged monoplane of all-metal construction. In order to aid use in its role as a trainer, the crew of two sat <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>on</b> Martin-Baker ejection seats, with room in the spacious cockpit for a third crew member, although this capability was never used. This gave a fairly wide fuselage. It had a retractable tricycle undercarriage, and was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Derwent engine mounted in the centre fuselage, fed from air inlets in the aircraft's nose. Three airbrakes were fitted to the rear fuselage. The wing design and size allowed for the aircraft to land at much lower speeds than most jet aircraft at the time.|$|E
