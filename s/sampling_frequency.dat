Frequency reproduction is always strictly {{less than half of}} the <b>sampling</b> <b>frequency,</b> and imperfect filters require a larger margin for error (noise level versus sharpness of filter), so an 8kHz sampling rate limits the maximum frequency to 4kHz, while a 48kHz sampling rate limits an MP3 to a maximum 24kHz sound reproduction.

The implementation of the audio part of this broadcasting system {{was based on a}} two chips encoder (one for the subband transform, one for the psychoacoustic model designed by the team of G. Stoll (IRT Germany), later known as psychoacoustic model I) and a real time decoder using one Motorola 56001 DSP chip running an integer arithmetics software designed by Y.F.

25|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} that enables fingerprints to be visualised on metallic and electrically conductive surfaces without {{the need to develop}} the prints first. This technique involves the use of an instrument called a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP), which measures the voltage, or electrical potential, at pre-set intervals over the surface of an object on which a fingerprint may have been deposited. These measurements can then be mapped to produce an image of the fingerprint. A higher resolution image can be obtained by increasing the number of points sampled, but {{at the expense of the}} time taken for the process. A <b>sampling</b> <b>frequency</b> of 20 points per mm is high enough to visualise a fingerprint in sufficient detail for identification purposes and produces a voltage map in 2–3 hours. As of 2010, this technique had been shown to work effectively on a wide range of forensically important metal surfaces including iron, steel and aluminium. While initial experiments were performed on flat surfaces, the {{technique has}} been further developed to cope with irregular or curved surfaces, such as the warped cylindrical surface of fired cartridge cases. Research during 2010 at Swansea University has found that physically removing a fingerprint from a metal surface, for example by rubbing with a tissue, does not necessarily result in the loss of all fingerprint information from that surface. The reason for this is that the differences in potential that are the basis of the visualisation are caused by the interaction of inorganic salts in the fingerprint deposit and the metal surface and begin to occur as soon as the finger comes into contact with the metal, resulting in the formation of metal-ion complexes that cannot easily be removed.|$|E

The design is simple; each bit controls a driver, which is either fully 'on' or 'off'. Problems with this design have led manufacturers to abandon it as impractical for the present. First, for a reasonable number of bits (required for adequate sound reproduction quality), the physical size of a speaker system becomes very large. Secondly, due to inherent analog digital conversion problems, the effect of aliasing is unavoidable, so that the audio output is [...] "reflected" [...] at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the <b>sampling</b> <b>frequency,</b> causing an unacceptably high level of ultrasonics to accompany the desired output.
