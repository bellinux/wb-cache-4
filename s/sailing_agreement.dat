This Article argues that clear sailing provisions often facilitate collusive settlements in cases involving non-pecuniary relief or claims-made common funds that return all unclaimed monies to the defendant. Because these types of settlements present difficult valuation problems, trial courts lack a clear benchmark for calculating attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees. Defendants and class can exploit this uncertainty by presenting an inflated settlement value to the court (to justify higher attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees) while simultaneously reducing the true cost imposed on the defendant. Although courts purportedly apply 2 ̆ 2 heightened scrutiny 2 ̆ 2 to settlements involving clear sailing agreements, this approach rarely threatens the underlying settlement. As a result, clear sailing agreements tend to undermine the deterrence function of class action by producing settlements that are systemically too low. This Article proposes a per se ban on settlements that rely upon clear sailing provisions. In addition, this Article recommends the appointment of guardian ad litem to litigate the issue of attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees in all cases involving non-pecuniary relief or a claims-made reverter fund...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was twofold: (1) to {{validate}} the use of action sport cameras for quantifying focus of visual attention in sailing and (2) to apply this method to examine whether an external focus of attention is associated with better performance in upwind sailing. To test the validity of this novel quantification method, we first calculated the agreement between gaze location measures and head orientation measures in 13 sailors sailing upwind during training regattas using a head mounted eye tracker. The results confirmed that for measuring visual focus of attention in upwind <b>sailing,</b> the <b>agreement</b> for the two measures was high (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0. 97) and the 95 % limits of agreement were acceptable (between − 8. 0 % and 14. 6 %). In a next step, we quantified the focus of visual attention in sailing upwind as fast as possible by means of an action sport camera. We captured sailing performance, operationalised as boat speed {{in the direction of the}} wind, and environmental conditions using a GPS, compass and wind meter. Four trials, each lasting 1 min, were analysed for 15 sailors each, resulting in a total of 30 upwind speed trials on port tack and 30 upwind speed trials on starboard tack. The results revealed that in sailing-within constantly changing environments-the focus of attention is not a significant predictor for better upwind sailing performances. This implicates that neither external nor internal foci of attention was per se correlated with better performances. Rather, relatively large interindividual differences seem to indicate that different visual attention strategies can lead to similar performance outcomes...|$|R
