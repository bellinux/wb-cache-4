25|$|Viscosity, a {{physical}} property, {{is a measure}} of how well adjacent molecules stick to one another. A solid can withstand a <b>shearing</b> <b>force</b> due to the strength of these sticky intermolecular forces. A fluid will continuously deform when subjected to a similar load. While a gas has a lower value of viscosity than a liquid, it is still an observable property. If gases had no viscosity, then they would not stick to the surface of a wing and form a boundary layer. A study of the delta wing in the Schlieren image reveals that the gas particles stick to one another (see Boundary layer section).|$|E

That is, the moment is the integral of the <b>shear</b> <b>force.</b> If the <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> is constant over an interval, the moment equation will be in terms of x (linear).

2500|$|In some {{applications}} another rough broad division among fluids is made: {{ideal and}} non-ideal fluids. An Ideal fluid is non-viscous and offers no resistance whatsoever to a <b>shearing</b> <b>force.</b> [...] An ideal fluid really does not exist, {{but in some}} calculations, the assumption is justifiable. One {{example of this is}} the flow far from solid surfaces. In many cases the viscous effects are concentrated near the solid boundaries (such as in boundary layers) while in regions of the flow field far away from the boundaries the viscous effects can be neglected and the fluid there is treated as it were inviscid (ideal flow). When the viscosity is negleted, the term containing the viscous stress tensor [...] in the Navier–Stokes equation vanishes. The equation reduced in this form is called the Euler equation.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{tomato ketchup}} has an additive, usually xanthan gum, {{which gives the}} {{condiment}} a pseudoplastic or [...] "shear thinning" [...] property - more commonly known as thixotropic. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added—usually 0.5%—which can {{make it difficult to}} pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct <b>shearing</b> <b>force.</b> These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.|$|E

Because the ratios for the other two subjects that wore high-heeled shoes without straps were 175 % and 168 %, respectively, fixing of the instep may be effective for reducing the <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> even when high-heeled shoes are worn.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the validity of a model for estimating <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> on the buttocks of elderly people with kyphosis. METHOD: The subjects with kyphosis were 10 elderly people in a facility providing health care services for the elderly. The <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> was measured using a force plate and, simultaneously, the position of the resultant centre of mass of the upper body and the inclination angle of the trunk were measured. The estimated <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> was calculated by substituting these values in the model. RESULTS: The average value of the measured <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> was 8. 4 SD 1. 4 [%BW], and the average value of the estimated <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> was 5. 8 SD 1. 0 [%BW]. Although there was a significant difference between these two values (p <  0. 01), there was a strong positive correlation between them (r =  0. 786, p <  0. 01). The regression line between the two values was y =  1. 097 x + 1. 96, where x = estimated value, y = measured value. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the estimated <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> was close to the measured <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> and thus is approximately known by substituting the calculated values for the linear regression...|$|R
