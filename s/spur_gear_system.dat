However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding on the general dynamic behavior of planetary gear systems with tooth faults. Planetary gears are normally used as effective power transmission elements with high power to weight/volume ratios, large speed reductions in compact volume, and high reliability. They tend to have high efficiency and are used in many applications, such as automotive, heavy truck/tractor, helicopter, wind turbines and bucket wheel reclaimer gearboxes. The purpose of this research is to develop a vibration analysis system that simulates dynamic behavior of large low speed, high torque planetary spur gear systems such as used in bucket wheel reclaimer and wind turbine gearboxes, with and without gear element faults.

40|$|With the {{projected}} growth of wind {{energy in the}} United States expected to account for 20 % of the energy portfolio by 2030, it can be expected that wind turbines will not only increase in number, but also in size. This increase in size implies that internal components, such as the gearbox, will also increase to handle the higher loads. And given the high failure rates for gearbox components already in existence, one could expect more failure if nothing is done to improve reliability. It {{is well known that}} wind loading is not constant, rather it is random and ultimately causes fatigue loading. This thesis is concerned with studying what the effects of dynamic loading are on a smaller gear system. It is assumed {{the findings of this study}} can be scaled to a larger wind turbine system. A simple spur gear pair is first simulated at constant loading to establish a baseline and then run with a sinusoidal input with differing amplitudes and frequencies. The hypothesis is that by varying the amplitude and frequency, the responses for gear contact force and input and output shaft torques will also vary. And if these variations are noted, then conclusions may be drawn as how the frequency and amplitude influence the system. After which, it may then be correlated to a wind turbine system. Knowing what affects the frequency and amplitude have on a smaller system may help to establish guidelines. For this model, mechanical simulation software is used to build a multibody dynamics model of a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> with flexible shafts.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to develop a control- oriented dynamic model for geared servomechanisms with backlash and friction and to establish systematic methodologies of designing a feedforward plus feedback controller to achieve high precision. First, the dynamic model {{for the purpose of}} real- time control is developed for a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> with backlash and friction. The complicated variation of the meshing stiffness as a function of contact point along the line of action is studied. Then the mean value of the meshing stiffness is used as the stiffness constant in the proposed model. Without sliding friction, two, simulations, free vibration and constant load operation, are performed to illustrate the effects of backlash on gear dynamics. Comparisons are also given of the simulation results with those of Yang and Sun's model. Then the average friction torque instead of the instantaneous friction torque is, proposed for the model to simplify the complexity of the system. Another two simulations are performed to illustrate the effects of backlash and friction on gear dynamics. In addition, the effect of adding a damper on the driving shaft, is also studied. Secondly, since the model for a geared servomechanism with backlash and friction is one example of nonsmooth dynamic systems, the traditional methods of examining existence and uniqueness properties and checking stability condition for such geared system are no longer valid. In this dissertation, Filippov's solution concept and his theorems are used to examine the existence and uniqueness properties for the proposed dynamic model. Furthermore, based on the extended stability theorems proposed by Shevitz and Paden, a general methodology is developed for the analysis of the stability, conditions of the equilibrium points for piece-wise continuous systems. The developed dynamic model is also examined using the above strategy. Finally, conventional control methods for a geared servomechanism usually do not take backlash and friction into account. As a result, accurate position control can not be achieved. In this dissertation, a new open-loop, optimization- based controller is developed to achieve accurate position tracking of a geared servomechanism. Path generation, selection of appropriate control input function, and optimization techniques for the design of such a controller are discussed. A systematic method of finding appropriate state, feedback gains to reduce the effects of possible load disturbance and model errors is also proposed. Numerical simulation results indicate that the improvement is quite satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} methodology combining an optimization technique, three dimensional analytical {{rigid body}} dynamics and a novel method for non linear stiffness analysis, namely Pseudo-Interference Stiffness Estimation method (PISE), is proposed to aid engineers and gear designers to dramatically reduce gear design time {{and improve the}} existing <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> performance. One of the major concerns in gear design is the reduction of gear dynamic load. Minimizing gear dynamic load will decrease gear noise, increase efficiency, improve pitting fatigue life, and help prevent gear tooth fracture. Therefore, the proposed method is aimed at minimizing this force by utilizing tooth profile modification techniques, tooth crowning and shaving. The main aim of this methodology is {{to search for the}} optimum profiles of tooth crowning and shaving that eventually lead to the optimum dynamic tooth load in the gear mesh. Additionally, this method is easy to implement and computationally inexpensive. To validate the proposed method, a detailed design study is numerically investigated and compared with experimental data from NASA and other sources as reported in the literature. The results have shown that the dynamic tooth load can be reduced up to 50 percent of its original value. However, this reduction is only valid at the operating ranges of the design load and design speed When the optimized gear system is operated at of design speed and off-design torque, its dynamic load may change significantly. It is also found that the effect of profile modification on the dynamic response of the gear system was mostly observed to be a reduction in the peak dynamic tooth load at the resonance speed. ^ Later, the investigation of gear tooth durability was conducted to validate an improvement of gear life. The rating factors given in AGMA publication, Hertzian contact stress, bending fatigue stress, flash temperature and PV index are employed in gear durability determination. The values of these quantities along the line of action were evaluated and plotted to illustrate their distribution. The results show that, with the reduction of 50 percent in dynamic tooth load, the reductions in PV index, bending fatigue, Hertzian contact stress, and flash temperature can be achieved up to 64, 58, 28 and 39 percent, respectively. Thus, this guarantees that the risks of pitting failure, scoring failure and tooth fracture are greatly improved. Besides, the variation of these quantities along the line of action explicitly indicates that pitting failure is likely to occur around pitch point and points in tip and dedendum zones are prone to scoring failure. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{analyzing}} the dynamic behavior of the <b>gear</b> transmission <b>system</b> in a braiding machine. In order to observe the nonlinear phenomenon and reveal the time-varying gear meshing mechanism, a mathematical model with five degrees-of-freedom <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> under internal and external random disturbance of <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> is established. With this model, bifurcation diagrams, Poincare maps, phase diagrams, power spectrum, time-process diagrams, and Lyapunov exponents are used to identify the chaotic status. Meanwhile, by these analytical methods, <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> pair with or without random perturbation are compared. The numerical {{results suggest that the}} vibration behavior of the model is consistent with that of Clifford system. The chaotic system associated parameters are picked out, which can be helpful to the design and control of braiding machines...|$|R

Molecular systems are categorized into three classes according to the orientation of the gear axes: i) bent (bevel gears), ii) linear, and ii) parallel (<b>spur</b> <b>gears).</b> To date, no examples of molecular gears in which the axes of rotation lie in parallel have been reported; correspondingly, the bulk of this report focuses on the factors one must evaluate to construct such systems...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{concern in}} gear design {{is to reduce}} the dynamic load and noise of <b>gear</b> <b>systems.</b> It has been found that the noise generated from gearing is basically due to gearbox vibration excited by the dynamic load. Since one of the situations that demand high performance is the high rotational speeds, {{there is a need to}} understand the dynamic behavior of the gears at such speeds. Such knowledge would shed light on detrimental characteristics like dynamic loads and vibrations. An efficient way in performing studies on the dynamic behavior of gears is using computer aided analysis on numerical models. In this paper, a developed computer program is introduced to analyze dynamic behavior of <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> with asymmetric teeth that have a potential use for higher performance in wind turbine gearboxes. This program can be used to compare conventional <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> with symmetric teeth and <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> with asymmetric teeth. By using this program, gear designers can design a gear pair and obtain results, e. g dynamic Load, transmitted torque, static transmission error, and frequency spectra of static transmission error etc., just by pressing a command button...|$|R
