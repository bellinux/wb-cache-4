500|$|The {{opening track}} on the album, [...] "Con los Años Que Me Quedan" [...] ("With the Years I Have Left"), is a Cuban bolero song. Three other bolero tracks on Mi Tierra are [...] "Mi Buen Amor" [...] ("My True Love"), [...] "Volverás" [...] ("You'll Be Back"), and [...] "Hablas de Mí" [...] ("You're Talking About Me"). The title track details {{the passion of}} Estefan's {{homeland}} in a salsa arrangement. In [...] "Ayer" [...] ("Yesterday") the singer finds a flower given to her by a lover and yearns for him to return, since life is short. Its music combines bolero and son music. [...] "No Hay Mal Que Por Bien No Bien" [...] ("Out of All Bad, <b>Some</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Things</b> Come") is a danzón recalling a brief love affair.|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} for the album began with strife and tension. Bassist Jeff Ament wasn't made {{aware that the}} band was recording until three days into the sessions, {{and said that he}} [...] "wasn't super involved with that record on any level." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "I'm sure Jeff was pissed, but it was more about separating, because if we played all together nothing would get done. We'd all just get pissed off at each other." [...] At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions, and considered quitting the band due to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder's control of the creation process. Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was [...] "more on-the-fly during the making of No Code, and <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> happened out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goodman {{enjoyed the}} bebop and cool jazz that was {{beginning}} to arrive in the 1940s. When he heard Thelonious Monk, a celebrated pianist and accompanist to bop players Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, he remarked, [...] "I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I {{like the way he}} played it. ... I think he's got a sense of humor and he's got <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> there." ...|$|E

6000|$|The second brother, Richard, however, had no {{opportunity}} of showing his character. He {{died in the}} New Forest, either from a blow on the head from a branch of a tree, or from a fever caught in the marshes, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral. Perhaps the doom came on him in innocent youth, [...] "because there was <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> in him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{said the}} film [...] "has <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> [...] {{does not have}} enough of them to make the third time the charm." [...] Ken Fox of TV Guide called the film [...] "passable popcorn fare." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail said the film is [...] "kind of fun, but the twists and turns are all too familiar." [...] Michael Sragow of the Baltimore Sun said the film is [...] "like an Indiana Jones movie without rhythm, wit or personality, just a desperate, headlong pace." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Quran {{associates}} Jews with {{rejection of}} God's prophets including Jesus and Muhammad, thus explaining their resistance to him personally. (Cf. Surah 2:87–91; 5:59, 61, 70, and 82.) It also asserts that Jews {{believe that they}} are the sole children of God (Surah 5:18), and that only they will achieve salvation (Surah 2:111). According to the Quran, Jews blasphemously claim that Ezra is the son of God, as Christians claim Jesus is, (Surah 9:30) and that God's hand is fettered (Surah 5:64 – i.e., that they can freely defy God). Some of those who are Jews, [...] "pervert words from their meanings", (Surah 4:44), and because they have committed wrongdoing, God has [...] "forbidden <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> that were previously permitted them", thus explaining Jewish commandments regarding food, Sabbath restrictions on work, and other rulings as a punishment from God (Surah 4:160). They listen for the sake of mendacity (Surah 5:41), twisting the truth, and practice forbidden usury, and therefore they will receive [...] "a painful doom" [...] (Surah 4:161). The Quran gives credence to the Christian claim of Jews scheming against Jesus, [...] "... but God also schemed, and God is the best of schemers"(Surah 3:54). In the Muslim view, the crucifixion of Jesus was an illusion, and thus the supposed Jewish plots against him ended in complete failure. In numerous verses (Surah 3:63, 71; 4:46, 160–161; 5:41–44, 63–64, 82; 6:92) the Quran accuses Jews of deliberately obscuring and perverting scripture.|$|E
2500|$|Time observed, [...] "Porgy and Bess {{is only a}} {{moderate}} and intermittent success as a musical show; {{as an attempt to}} produce a great work of cinematic art, it is a sometimes ponderous failure [...] [...] [...] On the stage the show has an intimate, itch-and-scratch-it folksiness that makes even the dull spots endearing. On the colossal Todd-AO screen, Catfish Row covers a territory that looks almost as big as a football field, and the action often feels about as intimate as a line play seen from the second tier. What the actors are saying or singing comes blaring out of a dozen stereophonic loudspeakers in such volume that the spectator almost continually feels trapped {{in the middle of a}} cheering section. The worst thing about Goldwyn's Porgy, though, is its cinematic monotony. The film is not so much a motion picture as a photographed opera [...] [...] [...] Still, there are <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> about the show. Sammy Davis Jr., looking like an absurd Harlemization of Chico Marx, makes a wonderfully silly stinker out of Sportin' Life. The singing is generally good — particularly the comic bits by Pearl Bailey and the ballads by Adele Addison [...] [...] [...] And the color photography gains a remarkable lushness through the use of filters, though in time [...] [...] [...] the spectator may get tired of the sensation that he is watching the picture through amber-colored sunglasses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Attracted to gray {{characters}} {{instead of}} orcs and angels, Martin regards the hero as the villain {{on the other}} side. The Wall's Night's Watch, whom Martin described as [...] "criminal scum [...] are also heroes and they wear black", was a deliberate twist on fantasy stereotypes. Furthermore, the use of black as the identifying colour for the essentially good Night's Watch {{and the use of}} white for the much corrupted Kingsguard is another example of Martin subverting traditional fantasy which tends to link light colors with good and darker ones with evil. As any universally adored or hated fictional characters are too one-dimensional to present real life, Martin writes his characters with well-mixed natures so that readers will invest in and identify with them. The actions and politics in the novels leave it to the reader to decide about who is good and evil. Characters are explored from many sides through the multiple viewpoint structure so that, unlike in a lot of other fantasy, the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint. This is necessary since in the real world throughout history, most human beings have justified their deeds as the right thing and the opponent's as villainous. It may not always be easy to determine who represents the good and evil side in real life, as some of the darkest villains in history had <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> about them, the greatest heroes had weaknesses and flaws. However, according to Martin, Tyrion Lannister is the most morally neutral main character in the book, which, along with his cynicism, is what makes him his favorite character.|$|E

6000|$|... 6. The romantic movement, {{while it}} {{followed}} its own genius, was not altogether unguided. Strictly speaking, {{there is no}} new movement either in history or in literature; each grows out of <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> which has preceded it, and looks back with reverence to past masters. Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton were the inspiration of the romantic revival; and we can hardly read a poem of the early romanticists without finding a suggestion {{of the influence of}} one of these great leaders.[202] ...|$|R

60|$|We are bid, as I said afore, to {{give thanks}} to God for all men, for kings, {{and for all that}} are in authority. Because, as I said, there is no man with whom we have to do, we doing as we should, but he bringeth <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> to us, or doth <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for us. We will now descend from them that are supreme in authority, and will come to {{inferior}} men: and suppose some of them to act beyond measure, cruelly. What? Can no <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> come to us out of this? Do not even such things as are most bitter to the flesh, tend to awaken Christians to faith and prayer, to a sight of the emptiness of this world, and the fadingness of the best it yields? Doth not God by these things ofttimes call our sins to remembrance, and provoke us to amendment of life? how then can we be offended at things by which we reap so much <b>good,</b> and at <b>things</b> that God makes so profitable for us? Doth not God, ofttimes, even take occasions by the hardest of things that come upon us, to visit our souls with the comforts of his Spirit, to lead us into the glory of his word, and to cause us to savour that love that he has had for us, even from before the world began, till now. A nest of bees and honey did Samson find, even in the belly of that lion that roared upon him. And is all this no good? or can we be without such holy appointments of God? Let these things be considered by us, and let us learn like Christians to kiss the rod, and love it.|$|R
60|$|While I {{was walking}} down to dinner with Lord Shaftesbury, he {{pointed out to me}} in the hall the {{portrait}} of his distinguished ancestor, Antony Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury, whose name he bears.

60|$|In the {{intervals}} the talk wandered into regions unfamiliar to Honora, {{and she had}} a sense that her own horizon was being enlarged. A new vista, at least, had been cut: possibilities became probabilities. Even when Mrs. Kame chose to ridicule Quicksands Honora was silent, so keenly did she feel the justice of her guest's remarks; and the implication was that Honora did not belong there. When train time arrived and they were about to climb into Trixton Brent's omnibus--for which he had obligingly telephoned--Mrs. Kame took Honora's band in both her own. <b>Some</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> after all, could come out of this community--such was the triumphant discovery the lady's manner implied.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{always seems}} to me," [...] said Mr. Gilmore, [...] "that to be {{successful}} in love, a man should not be in love at all; or, at any rate, he should hide it." [...] Then he went off home alone, feeling on his heart that pernicious load of a burden which comes from the unrestrained longing for <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> which cannot be attained. It seemed to him now that nothing in life would be worth a thought if Mary Lowther should continue to say him nay; and it seemed to him, too, that unless the yea were said very quickly, all his aptitudes for enjoyment would be worn out of him.|$|R

60|$|In the meanwhile, Alice of Avenel, sitting {{close to}} an iron candlestick, which {{supported}} a misshapen torch of domestic manufacture, read small detached passages from a thick clasped volume, which she preserved with the greatest care. The art of reading the lady had acquired by her residence in a nunnery during her youth, but she seldom, of late years, put it to any other use than perusing this little volume, which formed her whole library. The family listened to the portions which she selected, as to <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> which there was a merit in hearing with respect, whether it was fully understood or no. To her daughter, Alice of Avenel had determined to impart their mystery more fully, but the knowledge was at that period attended with personal danger, and was not rashly to be trusted to a child.|$|R

Mrs Merdle had shown him that the case of Edmund was urgent, and that infinite advantages might result from his having <b>some</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> directly. In the grammar of Mrs Merdle's verbs on this momentous subject, there was only one mood, the Imperative; and that Mood had only one Tense, the Present.
