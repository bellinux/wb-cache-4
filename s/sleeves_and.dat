5|$|Herbert Chapman won Arsenal's first {{national}} trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers, and added the white <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> brighter red to Arsenal's kit. Arsène Wenger {{has been the}} longest-serving manager and has won the most trophies. He has won a record 7 FA Cups, and his teams set English records for the longest win streak and longest unbeaten run.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E

5|$|Starting in July 2000, the Senators reused the {{alternate}} logo on another third jersey, designed by Ottawa firm Hoselton Brunet, this one black {{with red and}} gold <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> a gold stripe with laurel leaves {{along the bottom of}} the jersey. On the shoulders, was {{a modified version of the}} original Peace Tower logo of the expansion campaign, which the management liked. Like the original logo, this design was leaked onto the Internet.

5|$|Arsenal's home colours {{have been}} the {{inspiration}} {{for at least three}} other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip. In 1920, Sporting Clube de Braga's manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of Os Arsenalistas. These teams still wear those designs to this day.|$|E
5|$|Burnley did {{not play}} any {{pre-season}} friendly games other than a practice match between the first team and the reserves, which was watched by a crowd of around 10,000 at Turf Moor. The team's last competitive match had ended in a 0–2 defeat against Manchester United in the Lancashire Senior Cup on 8May 1920, almost four months earlier. The strip for 1920–21 was very little changed {{from that of the}} previous season; the claret jersey with light blue <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> a light blue stripe around the collar was kept along with the white shorts, but the claret socks were replaced by black.|$|E

40|$|Background: Tibial {{fixation}} of hamstring tendon grafts {{has been}} the weak link in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Hypothesis: Use of a central four-quadrant <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw provides superior fixation when compared with standard interference screw fixation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: In eight pairs of cadaveric knees each anterior cruciate ligament was reconstructed using either an interference screw or a central <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw on the tibial side. The specimens were then subjected to cyclic loading followed by a load-to-failure test. Results: The load required to cause 1 and 2 mm of graft laxity, defined as {{the separation of the}} femur and the tibia at the points of graft fixation, was significantly greater with the <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw than with the interference screw (at 2 mm: <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw, 216. 1 30. 1 N; interference screw, 167. 0 33. 2 N). The force at initial slippage for each of the graft strands was significantly higher with use of the central <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw. Conclusions: The four-quadrant <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw device may provide greater surface area for healing of hamstring tendon grafts and allow equal tensioning of graft strands before fixation. These factors are associated with increased strength of fixation and reduced laxity of the graft after cyclic loading. Clinical Relevance: Use of the central four-quadrant <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw system offers increased strength of fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring tendon graft...|$|R

5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets {{to make sure they}} were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E
5|$|For much of Arsenal's history, {{their home}} colours have been bright red shirts with white <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> white shorts, though {{this has not}} always been the case. The choice of red is in {{recognition}} of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Saigon {{designers}} {{tightened the}} fit of the ao dai to create the version commonly seen today. Trần Kim of Thiết Lập Tailors and Dũng of Dũng Tailors created a dress with raglan <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> a diagonal seam that runs from the collar to the underarm. Madame Nhu, first lady of South Vietnam, popularized a collarless version beginning in 1958. The ao dai was most popular from 1960 to 1975. A brightly colored áo dài hippy was introduced in 1968. The áo dài mini, a version designed for practical use and convenience, had slits that extended above the waist and panels that reached only to the knee.|$|E

5|$|Issued {{nine years}} after Harrison's death, the limited-edition release coincided with {{celebrations}} for Shankar's 90th birthday and was overseen by Harrison's widow, Olivia. Among the lavish packaging for the compilation, each disc appears inside enlarged, 8½-inch <b>sleeves,</b> <b>and</b> each {{copy of the}} set is individually numbered. An accompanying book contains a foreword by American composer Philip Glass, rare photographs documenting Shankar and Harrison's 35-year friendship, and commentary from both artists on the projects featured in the box set. While Collaborations presents {{only a portion of}} Shankar and Harrison's work together, music critics have recognised it as a successful representation of the far-reaching cultural legacy of their partnership.|$|E
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E

His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E

5|$|The {{predominant}} club colours {{are green}} and white, {{which have been}} used since {{the formation of the}} club in 1875. The strip typically has a green body, white <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> a white collar. The shorts are normally white, although green has been used in recent seasons. The socks are green, usually with some white detail. Hibs have used yellow, purple, black, white and a dark green in recent seasons for their alternate kits. In 1977, Hibs became the first club in Scotland to bear sponsorship on their shirts. This arrangement prompted television companies to threaten a boycott of Hibs games if they used the sponsored kit, which resulted in the club using an alternate kit for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Transformed, Chapman's Arsenal claimed {{their first}} {{national}} trophy, the FA Cup, in 1930. Two League Championships followed, in 1930–31 and 1932–33. Chapman also presided over multiple off the pitch changes: white <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> shirt numbers {{were added to}} the kit; a Tube station was named after the club; and the first of two opulent, Art Deco stands was completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football. Suddenly, {{in the middle of the}} 1933–34 season, Chapman died of pneumonia. His work was left to Joe Shaw and George Allison, who saw out a hat-trick with the 1933–34 and 1934–35 titles, and then won the 1936 FA Cup and 1937–38 title.|$|E
5|$|Andover's {{traditional}} {{strip of}} red and black stripes was worn {{for the vast majority}} of their history. This was changed to red and black quarters in 1950 and remained so until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional stripes. When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972, the team's colours were changed, this time to red with a single white stripe. This kit was worn until 1988, when the familiar red and black stripes were re-introduced. For the 2008–09 season, a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary—this was worn for the first time in the pre-season friendly against Salisbury City. The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black shirts with white shorts. However, various combinations have been worn in recent years, such as white shirts with blue <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> blue shorts, and tangerine shirts with white shorts.|$|E

5|$|For the 1924–25 season, the Canadiens {{celebrated their}} world {{champion}} status {{with a special}} jersey design. The team moved their CH logo to their <b>sleeves</b> <b>and</b> played with a large world globe logo crest on their jersey fronts. Montreal {{finished third in the}} league standings and defeated Toronto in the semi-final. The players on the first place Hamilton Tigers refused to participate in a playoff series unless they were paid an additional $200 each. When they failed to relent on their demands, NHL president Frank Calder suspended the entire team, and declared the Canadiens to be the league champions. The Habs thus traveled to the Pacific Coast to play the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the 1925 Stanley Cup Final. The Cougars won the best-of-five series 3–1; {{it was the last time}} a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905, when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers {{would have to}} play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which was meant as an insult. For most of the club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In 1968–69 season, Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the 1973–74 season, the team switched to an all white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern have mostly worn an all red home kit, with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour {{for the first time}} when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue <b>sleeves,</b> <b>and</b> in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches. Bayern also wore a Rotwein coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign, in reference to their first choice colours prior to the late 1960s.|$|E
