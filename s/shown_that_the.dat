30|$|Synthesis of nano-alumina with {{different}} conditions was performed successfully. PXRD data <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main phase {{for all of}} the synthesized nanomaterials was gamma. It <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nanomaterials were synthesized with high purity. SEM images <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> synthesized nanomaterials were in different morphology depending on the synthesis procedure. It is clear that reaction temperature is a main factor on the synthesized nanomaterial’s morphologies. However, it <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fuel type is also an important factor on the morphology of the synthesized nanomaterials. <b>The</b> SEM images <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> morphology of the obtained materials {{is in the form of}} porous particle and irregular particle shape. FTIR spectra of the nano-alumina were investigated in different synthesis conditions.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, 42% of all {{households}} and 76% of {{households in the}} top quintile had two or more income earners. As a result, there was a considerable discrepancy between household and personal income.

5|$|In 2009, it was <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of a smaller planet at Jupiter's position in the Solar System might increase the impact rate of comets on the Earth significantly. A planet of Jupiter's mass still seems to provide increased protection against asteroids, but the total effect on all orbital bodies within the Solar System is unclear. Computer simulations in 2016 have continued to erode the theory.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} {{as late as}} 2002 that Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML) was related to neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen syndrome). In fact, since both ICD9 and ICD10 lack a specific diagnosis code for NSML, the diagnosis code for NF1 is still sometimes used for diagnostic purposes, {{although it has been}} <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gene is not linked to the NF1 locus.|$|E

5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> human eyeball {{is far too}} rigid to spontaneously change shape {{to a degree that}} would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E
