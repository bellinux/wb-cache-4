There is a crane {{at the top of}} the MST, which allows the payload and GEM-60 solid motors to be attached to the vehicle. The MST is rolled away from the rocket several hours before launch. At Vandenberg, the launch pad also has a Mobile Assembly Shelter (MAS), which completely encloses the vehicle; at CCAFS, the vehicle is partly exposed near its bottom.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the three laboratory towers, which have prominent windows and intricate structures that were assembled from prefabricated elements, the central tower of the Richards building, the one devoted to service functions, has few windows and a structure that is a single unit of cast-in-place concrete.

2500|$|The {{design of}} the PSFS Building {{elicited}} both early criticism and praise. In the March 1931 issue of T-Square Club Journal Elbert Conover said, [...] "The day will come when even in America, we will become skillful enough to meet economic pressure without forcing upon the community such ugliness and illogical designing." [...] The PSFS Building {{was one of only}} two U.S. skyscrapers included in the 1932 International style exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Run by Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson, the exhibition was where the term International style was coined. The PSFS Building was praised for its cantilevering facade and the building's organization of shops on the first floor, the banking hall on the second floor, offices above and the <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> in the back. Unlike the PSFS Building, the {{design of the}} other skyscraper—New York City's McGraw-Hill Building—was more due to necessity of publishing operations and zoning restrictions than following an architectural movement. Hitchcock and Johnson were critical of both building's use of ornamental signage at the top. However, Lescaze and Howe's design was not featured at the 1932 Architectural League of New York Annual Exhibition after the skyscraper was deemed as having an ugly and illogical design. Howe responded by saying [...] "Like all institutions which have become traditional, it tends to resent change." ...|$|E

50|$|The followup to Cosmos 133 {{was planned}} for 14 December, but ended disastrously. At liftoff, the Blok A core {{stage of the}} 11A57 booster ignited, but not the strap-ons. A {{shutdown}} command was immediately sent and pad crews began to move the <b>service</b> <b>towers</b> back in place and drain the propellants. This task was completed for the core stage and strap-ons, and then about 30 minutes after the attempted launch, the escape tower suddenly fired. Its exhaust caused the Blok I third stage propellant tanks to overheat and explode, killing one person {{on the ground and}} damaging the Soyuz and core stage/strap-ons beyond repair. LC-1 was also badly damaged and took a month of repair work in the frigid Kazakhstan winter to be restored to use. The reason for the LES firing was thought to be either a timer being activated due to the Earth's rotation affecting the gyroscope package in the launch vehicle or perhaps one of the <b>service</b> <b>towers</b> bumping it.|$|R
