5|$|After {{dinner on}} 8 September, the guests at Tranby Croft listened to music from Ethel Lycett Green until about 11pm, when the prince {{suggested}} {{a game of}} baccarat.

Among the evening's players were the prince, who acted as dealer; Sassoon, who took the part of banker; and Gordon-Cumming. <b>Sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last-named was Stanley Wilson, who was on Levett's left.|$|E

A track was devoted to both title characters, with the icy blue track being christened Batman and its fiery red companion being labeled Robin.

They take part in each of her manoeuvrings so that the dancer herself, in her mad wheeling movements, appears to carry behind her a perpetual comet’s tail of bees.|$|E
