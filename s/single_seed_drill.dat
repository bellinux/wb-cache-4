Six weed control techniques (spring tine harrow, inter row hoe with duckfoot sweeps, separately used or in combinations, inter row hoe with additional tools: finger weeder, torsion weeder, ridging wings) were evaluated concerning the effects on weed ground cover and on plant losses. Soy bean plant stands have been established in various rows spacing using different types of seeders (12. 5 cm with seed drill for harrowing variant and 50 cm with <b>single</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> for hoeing variants). The field trials were conducted at two sites in three years (2011 - 2013). The weed ground cover in the harrowing variant was {{higher than in the}} hoeing variants in three of five environments. In these environments, an additional, late treatment could be realized in the hoeing variants, but not in the harrowing variant. Additional tools above all ridging wings or combinations with spring tine harrow increased the success of {{mechanical weed control}}. The plant losses depended on the adjustments of the techniques and on the time of treatment. Plant losses, caused by working in the row or into the row, should be compensated by higher seeding rates. ...|$|E

In the four environments with high weed pressure, the weed ground cover was already higher at pod filling in the harrowing variant. This resulted in higher yields in the hoeing variants in these environments and was caused by a longer period of weed control with hoeing. The additional tools ridging wings or combinations with spring tine harrow increased the success of {{mechanical weed control}} and the grain yield in comparison to inter row hoe separately.

40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} research farm of The University of Agriculture Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 2011, to investigate the effects of different tillage practices and sowing methods on productivity of wheat and mungbean cropping system on silty clay loam soil. The factors consisted of tillage practices i. e. tine cultivator twice plowed (TC 2), chisels plow followed by rotovator (CR), mouldboard plow followed by rotovator (MR), disk plow followed by rotovator (DR) and tine cultivator followed by rotovator (TCR) in the main plots and sowing methods i. e. sowing with <b>single</b> box <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> (SD), combined drill (CD) and broadcast (BC) in the sub plots. The performance of different tillage implements during seedbed preparation in term of soil depth of cut, wheel slippage, fuel consumption and effective field capacity were statistically significant. Maximum soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth recorded with CR and MR tillage practices, while maximum soil bulk density, soil penetration resistance, at 20 and 40 cm depth, fresh and dry weed biomass were obtained in plots tilled with tine cultivator twice (TC- 2). However, minimum soil penetration resistance and fresh/ dry weed biomass were obtained in plots of CR and MR tillage practices, respectively. Higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth was observed when sowing was done with <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> and combined drill, respectively. Data regarding wheat crop indicated that higher number of tillers m- 2 (403) and grain yield (4. 6 t ha- 1) were obtained in plots tilled with disk plow followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum biological yield (10. 4 t ha- 1) was recorded in plots that were tilled with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator. Sowing by combined <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> resulted in higher emergence, number of tillers, straw yield and biological yield. Similarly, higher number of grains spike- 1, spike length, grain yield and harvest indices were recorded when sowing was done with <b>seed</b> <b>drill.</b> Maximum total nitrogen in soil was noted in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by rotavator. Similarly, sowing by <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> and combine drill recorded greater total nitrogen in soil and wheat straw. The data relating to mungbean crop indicated that chisel plow followed by rotavator resulted in higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depths, higher emergence m- 2, plant height, pod length and total nitrogen in grains. Plots tilled with tine cultivator twice delayed flowering and maturity, increase in fresh and dry weed biomass, soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depth and soil penetration resistance at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant - 1, biological yield, soil total nitrogen were higher in plots tilled with moldboard plow followed by rotavator. The maximum grain yield of mungbean and soil organic matter were recorded in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum harvest indices and total nitrogen in straw were recorded in plots tilled with disk plow followed by rotavator. Higher emergence, plant height, pod length, hundred grain weight, grain yield, biological yield, harvest indices, total soil nitrogen, and total nitrogen in mungbean grain and straw were recorded in plots sown with <b>seed</b> <b>drill.</b> Plots sown with broadcast method delayed flowering and maturity, increase fresh and dry weed biomass and greater soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant- 1, soil organic matter and total nitrogen in soil were greater in plots that were sown with a combined <b>seed</b> <b>drill.</b> Economic analysis of wheat and mungbean showed that maximum net revenue of wheat was obtained with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator (MR) tillage practices and the highest net revenue of mungbean was found with tine cultivator followed by rotavator (TCR) while minimum net revenue were obtained with tine cultivator (TC- 2). Similarly, sowing by <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> (SD) and combine drill (CD) resulted in maximum net revenue as compared to broadcast (BC) sowing method. It is concluded from the studies that all tillage implements when followed by rotavator for seedbed preparation resulted better yield and net economic revenue from wheat and mungbean crops {{as compared to the}} sole used of tine cultivator plowed twice. Similarly sowing by <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> and combined drill showed a higher grain yield and net revenue than broadcast methods...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> is {{a device}} that sows the seeds for crops by {{metering}} out the individual seeds, positioning them in the soil, and covering them to a certain average depth.

40|$|Abstract: At {{the present}} time, {{the most widely}} used machine for seed and oilseed {{planting}} is a <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> with a roller-type-metering device. Due to nonuniform spacing of seeds along the rows and lack of control on planting depth, this machine aggravates the growth related problems and degrades the quality of a sensitive crop such as oilseed rape. To solve the above-mentioned problems, an attempt was made to develop a precision <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> with a roller-type-metering device and a depth control system. Some of the design parameters affecting the uniformity of seed distribution were studied from the view point of roller and brush geometry. Computer software packages were used to design the machine and simulate its operational performance. In the laboratory test, {{it was found that the}} precision <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> performed satisfactorily and its speed and vibration did not affect the performance of metering system significantly. In the field test, a uniform distribution of seed with a reasonable spacing along the row planting was achieved and seed scattering was found to be within an acceptable range.
