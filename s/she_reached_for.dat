She did not reveal her idea to family and registered on her own. However, when <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the final round, she was eliminated by the contest jury when it figured out that she was too young to qualify for the competition. Thu Minh cried her eyes out. Yet, thanks to her father's later encouragement, she continued to practice and returned to the competition {{at the age of}} 16. This time, Thu Minh was still {{the youngest}} contestant and she won a gold medal as the first prize. This first debut impressed audiences and musical experts with a natural high and strong Soprano C voice by performing 2 classic Vietnamese hit songs [...] "Bóng cây Kơ-nia" [...] ("The Shadow of the Kapok Tree") and [...] "Tình ca cho em" [...] ("Love song for you") for the highest scores {{despite the fact that she}} had never been educated for professional music and was pursuing a professional career as a ballet dancer. Almost 20 years later, [...] "Tình ca cho em" [...] is revealed to be a song that its author, musician Nguyen Nam, wrote for Thu Minh as a gift before she attended the contest when she sang this song again and expressed her feelings about the former musician in his funeral and on an aired ceremony.|$|E

50|$|Marjatta lives {{a life of}} respectability and virtue. One {{day when}} she was {{shepherding}} her flock she lamented her maidenhood, and wished for a husband.

60|$|Involuntarily <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> out <b>for</b> her crutch; {{but it was}} {{a little}} beyond her reach, having fallen on the floor, and without it Salome could not move a step.|$|R
60|$|Lucille gave {{a little}} start of amazement as she {{realised}} {{that she was not}} alone in the brougham. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> out <b>for</b> the check-cord, but a strong hand held hers.|$|R

To break free, <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> fun in an interesting form of expression.|$|R
60|$|She stood {{a moment}} as if blindly {{watching}} {{the place where he}} had vanished, and then as a sister might have turned to a brother, <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't walk any. Oh, I {{guess it}} will be all right when I get going again." [...] She tried to smile at him, and with the {{slowness}} of pain <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> her bundle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do play again!" [...] Mrs. Tuke {{called into}} the night. [...] "Do sing something."

6000|$|COMTESSE. Mrs. Shand, {{excuse me}} for saying that if half of what I hear be true, your husband is seeing that lady a great deal too often.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> a bit {{of paper}} which had wrapped {{a small piece of}} {{chocolate}} she had found in her pocket, and began making a boat. He watched her without heeding her. There was something strangely pathetic and tender in her moving, unconscious finger-tips, that were agitated and hurt, really.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> her jacket; and {{the waiter}} sprang forward {{and helped her}} on with it, prolonging the {{business}} needlessly. She wished him [...] "Good evening" [...] {{in a tone of}} distant hauteur, and led the way to the door. Outside the street was dim and silent. Joan held out her hand.|$|E
6000|$|With a low, deep-breathed [...] "Ah!" [...] {{when she}} first saw the brig already under way, <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> Nelson's long glass reposing on {{brackets}} high up the wall. The wide sleeve of the dressing-gown slipped back, uncovering her white arm {{as far as the}} shoulder. Heemskirk gripping the door-handle, as if to crush it, felt like a man just risen to his feet from a drinking bout.|$|E
50|$|That night, {{the dream}} begins again. Liz visualizes {{a pack of}} {{cigarettes}} next to the glass of water on the nightstand. When she is awakened by the clock, <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> a cigarette instead of the glass.

60|$|Suddenly {{the slight}} sharp twing was repeated. It {{seemed to come}} from outside her flesh. She shivered a little, {{thinking}} it might be a centipede. When <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> her shoulder her hand came in contact with a slender stick that had been thrust through a crack between the boards. Jim was trying to rouse her. This had been his method on several occasions when she had fallen asleep after waiting long for him.|$|E
60|$|Una {{had waited}} till Mr. Sidney had {{disposed}} of his soup and filet mignon. She spoke deliberately, almost sternly. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> her new silver link bag, drew out immaculate typewritten schedules, {{and while he}} gaped she read to him precisely the faults {{of each of the}} hotels, her suggested remedies, and her general ideas of hotels, with less cuspidors, more originality, and a room where traveling-men could be at home on a rainy Sunday.|$|E
60|$|The {{speaker was}} Riggs, {{and he had}} possessed himself of part of her baggage with action and speech meant more to impress the curious crowd than to be really kind. In the {{excitement}} of arriving Helen had forgotten him. The manner of sudden reminder--the insincerity of it--made her temper flash. She almost fell, encumbered as she was, in her hurry to descend the steps. She saw the tall hunter in gray step forward close to her as <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the bag Riggs held.|$|E
5000|$|Rehm is an iconoclast {{not because}} she is, at times, {{formally}} inventive but because <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> what can't be seen, that is, she strives for knowledge of [...] "what {{it means to be}} in relation." [...] Her insurgency should, at least partly, become ours. Rehm {{is not the only one}} who must [...] "figure out what to believe and where to begin." [...] To do this, must we open our cabinets and break open the black egg that may hide our conscious ear? ...|$|R

50|$|Back in feudal Japan, Morito, Kesa's lover, tells wistfully {{of their}} final night {{together}} ("Morito").

60|$|Joan ran on, {{stumbling}} over {{rocks and}} brush, with a darkness before her eyes, the terror in her soul. She {{was out in}} the cedars when someone grasped her from behind. She felt the hands as the coils of a snake. Then she was ready to faint, but she must not faint. She struggled away, stood free. It was the man Bill who had caught her. He said something that was unintelligible. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the snag of a dead cedar and, leaning there, fought her weakness, that cold black horror which seemed a physical thing in her mind, her blood, her muscles.|$|E
60|$|Again she bethought {{herself of}} her pistol. As she had fallen, the holster had slipped around {{so that the}} weapon now lay beneath her. Very slowly <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> it; but in so doing {{she was forced to}} raise her body from the ground. Instantly the lion was aroused. With the {{swiftness}} of a cat he reached across the carcass of the horse and placed a heavy, taloned paw upon her breast, crushing her back to earth, and all the time he growled and snarled horribly. His face was a picture of frightful rage incarnate. For a moment neither moved and then from behind her the girl heard a human voice uttering bestial sounds.|$|E
60|$|But Mr. McCaskey was no 50-cent table d'hôter. Let cheap Bohemians {{consider}} coffee the end, if they would. Let {{them make}} that faux pas. He was foxier still. Finger-bowls were not beyond the compass of his experience. They {{were not to}} be had in the Pension Murphy; but their equivalent was at hand. Triumphantly he sent the granite-ware wash basin at the head of his matrimonial adversary. Mrs. McCaskey dodged in time. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> a flatiron, with which, as a sort of cordial, she hoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close. But a loud, wailing scream downstairs caused both her and Mr. McCaskey to pause in a sort of involuntary armistice.|$|E
