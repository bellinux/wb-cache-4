5|$|Onneca's {{historical}} importance <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that she}} provided an important genealogical {{link between the}} Muslim caliphs of Córdoba and the Christian kings of Pamplona, {{as well as between}} the first two royal dynasties of Pamplona.|$|E
5|$|Within the conch fisheries, one of {{the threats}} to {{sustainability}} <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there is almost as much meat in large juveniles {{as there is in}} adults, but only adult conchs can reproduce, and thus sustain a population. In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing, larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate. On a number of islands, subadults provide the majority of the harvest.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over {{the legality of the}} annexation of Texas <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} laws <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> {{third party}} would or could {{interfere with the}} justice system.|$|R
50|$|IPKall's {{popularity}} <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it {{was probably}} the last remaining, widely accessible US-based VoIP service offering free-of-charge PSTN numbers.|$|R
3000|$|... max {{values of}} our {{polygalacturonase}} mainly <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> enzyme was just primarily purified {{and had a}} relatively low purity.|$|R
5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E
5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the night they entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On {{the other side of}} the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E
5000|$|The terms {{upper and}} lower closed limit <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Lin&rarr;&infin;An and Lsn&rarr;&infin;An are always closed sets in the metric {{topology}} on (X, d).|$|R
50|$|Ethiopian {{interest}} <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Eritrean independence groups {{used the}} Hanish Islands {{and the nearby}} Zuqar Island as a base to attack Ethiopian military interests.|$|R
50|$|The {{potential}} problems with immediate execution calculators <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that they are}} imperative. This means that the user must provide details of how the calculation has to be performed.|$|R
5|$|The {{probable}} {{properties of}} further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium {{have not been}} explored yet as of 2015; in fact, it is suspected {{that they may not}} be able to exist. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers. Interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that both elements are located close to the expected locations of islands of stabilities, centered at elements 122 (306Ubb) and 164 (482Uhq).|$|E
5|$|With the {{increase}} of tea's use in Chinese herbology, production methods changed, where the processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried after steaming. Rather the steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea. Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, as older mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production. Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves, which typically required {{the use of a}} cooked rice slurry (米湯) to bind the tea brick together. The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it can be more easily transported and stored.|$|E
5|$|The Jardines de la Galera {{date back}} to the 10th century. They are nestled between the Torre de Espantaperros and the Chemin de ronde, within the Alcazaba. Many Alhambran ruins still exist within the gardens, and have been open to the public since 2007 after the site was {{restored}} after being closed for more than thirty years. The etymology of the gardens <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the gardens provided a respite for prisoners sentenced to the gallows in Seville. Plant species extant in the gardens include cinnamomum camphora, dichondra repens, ceiba speciosa, and trees of the myrtle, laurel, orange, lemon, and pomegranate. Other parks and gardens include Castelar, which has a central pond and several monuments dedicated to the romanticist writer Carolina Coronado and to Luis Chamizo Trigueros, la Legión, Rivillas y Calamón, San Fernando, and La Viña.The city also has a water and leisure park, called the Lusiberia.|$|E
5000|$|The village means [...] "Bay with oysters" [...] or [...] "Oyster Bay", <b>stemming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> bay was {{littered}} with rocks where oysters were abundant, which {{is no longer the}} case today.|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} renowned for his {{problems}} with <b>the</b> tax man, <b>stemming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that he never}} seemed to pay any. This was an unfortunate fact that he turned to humour in his stage act.|$|R
30|$|The main {{theoretical}} premise for ecosystem {{research is}} the simultaneous presence of complementarities and interdependencies between actors. Complementarities between actors <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> functions performed by their respective offers help to create or enhance the user value proposition. Interdependencies between actors <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that their offers are connected within a system-level architecture. While complementarities represent an economic relationship between offers {{in terms of the}} potential for value creation, interdependencies represent a structural relationship between offers in terms of how they are connected for the value to be created and how a change in one offer may affect the contribution of other offers towards value creation.|$|R
5|$|The Andean condor is {{considered}} near {{threatened by the}} IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that {{is in danger of}} extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.|$|E
25|$|How does Agile handle {{turn-over}} in developers, vendors, etc.? My question <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that {{a system}} may be developed by one vendor, but {{may need to be}} maintained by another.|$|E
25|$|Spacelike vectors are in elsewhere. The {{terminology}} <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that spacelike separated {{events are}} connected by vectors requiring faster-than-light travel, and so cannot possibly influence each other. Together with spacelike and lightlike vectors there are 7 classes in all.|$|E
50|$|According to Microsoft {{these issues}} <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that ports 137,138 are {{forwarded}} by default on Cisco routers. Since these ports {{are used by}} NetBIOS to help determine network configuration the added broadcasts can confuse the system.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> electors' {{excitement}} <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> {{outcome of}} an election might significantly impact on their district; where one candidate might have promised a school, roads and bridges, another candidate might not deliver the same for their locality.|$|R
50|$|The {{perceived}} {{advantages of}} OAC over other commercial classifications <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> methodology {{is open and}} documented, and that the data is open and freely available to {{both the public and}} commercial organizations, subject to licensing conditions.|$|R
25|$|Early European {{visitors}} were {{amazed by the}} quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Japan itself is rather poor in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron. Thus, the Japanese were famously frugal with their consumable resources; what little they had they used with expert skill.|$|E
25|$|The {{confusion}} regarding Stalin's {{position on}} the issue <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he, after Lenin's death in 1924, successfully used Lenin's argument– the argument that socialism's success needs the workers of other countries in order to happen– to defeat his competitors within the party by accusing them of betraying Lenin and, therefore, {{the ideals of the}} October Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Early European {{visitors}} {{noted the}} quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Japan itself is rather poor in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron. Thus, the Japanese were famously frugal with their consumable resources; what little they had they used with expert skill though because of this, they had not reached European levels.|$|E
50|$|These major {{dimensions}} of international finance largely <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that sovereign nations {{have the right}} and power to issue currencies, formulate their own economic policies, impose taxes, and regulate movement of people, goods, and capital across their borders.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{debatable}} whether bride kidnapping is actually traditional. Some of <b>the</b> confusion may <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that arranged marriages were traditional, {{and one of}} the ways to escape an arranged marriage was to arrange a consensual [...] "kidnapping." ...|$|R
50|$|Functional {{programming}} {{is very different}} <b>from</b> imperative programming. <b>The</b> most significant differences <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that functional programming avoids side effects, which are used in imperative programming to implement state and I/O. Pure functional programming completely prevents side-effects and provides referential transparency.|$|R
25|$|It was {{administered}} by the Department of the Interior (and later by the Department of the Capital Territory) {{as if it were}} part of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), although it has always been a separate Commonwealth territory. The perception that {{it is part of the}} ACT <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that under the terms of the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act, the laws of the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay Territory.|$|E
25|$|This {{property}} <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that for}} each n, {{the sum of}} nth powers of an algebraic integer x and its conjugates is exactly an integer; this follows from an application of Newton's identities. When x is a Pisot number, the nth powers of the other conjugates tend to 0 as n tends to infinity. Since the sum is an integer, the distance from xn to the nearest integer tends to 0 at an exponential rate.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method used}} early in U.S. history was {{to divide the}} state into electoral {{district}}s. By this method, voters in each district would cast their ballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated by congressional districts. However, the difference <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to gerrymandering.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 twelve EU {{countries}} warned businesses against involving {{themselves in}} the settlements. According to the warnings, economic activities relating to the settlements involve legal and economic risks <b>stemming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> settlements are built on occupied land not recognized as Israel's.|$|R
50|$|Women brewers {{dominated}} alcohol {{production on}} every occupied continent until commercialization and industrialization of brewing occurred. The tradition of brewing {{being in the}} domain of women <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that brewing was a by-product of gathering, and often considered a part of baking.|$|R
5000|$|Kuiper's {{assumptions}} <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that several}} lower-class groups in India had secret languages to conceal communication from oppressive upper-class groups. Today, some Korku-speakers refuse {{to acknowledge the}} Nihali and describe {{the emergence of the}} Nihali into their community as a civil disturbance.|$|R
