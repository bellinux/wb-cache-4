2500|$|Such clay {{has a high}} [...] "shrink-swell" [...] ratio {{depending}} upon {{the amount of water}} present. As it dries from a saturated to a dry state it shrinks greatly – as seen in the cracked clay deposits of drying flooded areas – and this characteristic presents a serious problem to the potter. As the vessel is fired, any water left in the clay will tend to quickly turn to steam and explode the vessel wall in a <b>spawl.</b> It takes care and time to dry these vessels before they can be fired safely. Moreover, as even a well-tempered vessel dries shrinkage rates vary around the contours of the form and will create strains which will crack an air drying vessel if the drying is not slowed and controlled. A high shrinkage rate probably meant lots of effort lost to broken pots in both the drying and firing stages for inexperienced potters and ineffective technologies. Woodland potters attempted to remedy the high shrinkage by using large amounts (up to 33%) of coarse sand and/or grog temper in their efforts to render the clay usable for vessel construction. Moreover, their vessel shapes were necessarily confined to either a flat or conical-bottomed vessel and a thick walled construction were required in order for the vessel to stand, in an unfired state, without collapsing during the air-drying process in preparation for firing. Non-backswamp clays used {{in many parts of the}} world could use grog and/or sand and create a round-bottomed vessel, favored by the cook, but not so with the [...] "gumbo" [...] clays of the Mississippi Valley.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, archeologists working in Northeast Arkansas for the Arkansas Archeological Survey began {{research}} into causes of Mississippi Valley potters' relatively sudden shift to shell temper. The team conducted {{research at the}} AAS Station Lab at Arkansas State University involving macroscopic, microscopic, petrographic thin-sections, atomic absorption and x-ray diffraction analyses. A member of the team, Michael G. Million, also conducted replicative experiments, perhaps the first to do so with the exact clays, tempers and tools used by prehistoric Mississippian potters. Pastes were created {{using a variety of}} temper-to-clay percentages so that vessels as well as test-tiles could be produced for examination. Test tiles gave information about the shrinkage rates of various clay/temper combinations to the 'green' state and then further information upon firing. Simple, round bottom cooking jars were built using coil construction and the Mississippian pottery tool set including a pottery anvil, wooden paddle, mussel shell scrapers and polishing stones. The research discovered that there were very good reasons for using shell tempering for Mississippi Valley clays. The nature of clays formed by such a large meandering river system are distinctive. The huge annually flooded backswamp areas create a clay which is composed of very minute clay particles (primarily silica) and a high proportion of organic content. This is caused by the slow settling or deposition of the alluvial materials after floods. The clay particles tend to measure just a few micrometres in size and in plate-like form. Large amounts of water can be tightly held in the interspace between the clay particles. Add to this the organic ooze, and one has what is known colloquially as [...] "gumbo" [...] clay. [...] Such clay has a high [...] "shrink-swell" [...] ratio depending upon the amount of water present. As it dries from a saturated to a dry state it shrinks greatly - as seen in the cracked clay deposits of drying flooded areas - and this characteristic presents a serious problem to the potter. As the vessel is fired, any water left in the clay will tend to quickly turn to steam and explode the vessel wall in a <b>spawl.</b> It takes care and time to dry these vessels before they can be fired safely.

50|$|According to <b>Spawls</b> & Branch (1995), Ghana and Togo are at {{the eastern}} limit {{of the range of}} this subspecies, and they begin to intergrade here with B. g. gabonica. The {{distribution}} map they provide indicates that the general range for B. g. rhinoceros does not include Togo, but that there has been at least one report of a specimen found there. Togo, together with Benin and at least eastern Ghana, are part of a larger region known as the Dahomey Gap; a relatively dry region that separates the rainforests of West Africa from those of Central Africa.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} found in {{isolated}} populations of the mountainous regions of southern Africa. In South Africa, the species is known {{to occur in the}} Transvaal, along the Drakensberg escarpment of the eastern and northern Transvaal. Elsewhere in South Africa, it occurs in western Natal, Lesotho and eastern Free State, and in the southern coastal mountains of western and eastern Cape Province. <b>Spawls</b> and Branch (1995) also mentioned, in Cape Province, its range extends into the Cape Peninsula. It also occurs in Swaziland, in higher altitudes of eastern Zimbabwe such as the Inyanga Highlands and Chimanimani Mountains and in nearby Mozambique.|$|R
50|$|Based on this LD50 value, <b>Spawls</b> and Branch (1995) {{estimated}} about 300 mg of this venom {{would be}} required to kill an adult. They regarded this venom as one of the weakest of the genus, although the tests are conducted solely on mice, which might have a different reaction from humans to the venom. On the other hand, an older report by the U.S. Navy (1965, 1991) suggested it is highly toxic and a number of deaths have occurred as a result. According to Broadley and Cock (1975), envenomation symptoms in humans include swelling, severe pain, nausea, vomiting and shock. Blisters and necrotic ulcers may form around the bite site.|$|R

C. vauereselli is sympatric in this region with Adolfus jacksoni and were found basking within 3 m of each other on the wall. Adolfus jacksoni appeared to be more common than C. vauereselli. <b>Spawls</b> et al.

50|$|During World War II, Bell {{also built}} heavy bombers under license from other {{aircraft}} companies at a factory near Marietta, Georgia, just northwest of Atlanta. Online by mid-1943, the new plant produced hundreds of Consolidated B-24 Liberators and Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers. In mid-1944, {{the production of}} the B-24 was consolidated from several different companies (including some in Texas) to two large factories: the Consolidated Aircraft Company in San Diego and the Ford Motor Company's <b>spawling</b> factory in Willow Run, near Detroit, Michigan, which had been specially designed to produce B-24s. For the rest of the war, Bell's Marietta plant concentrated on producing B-29s, producing 668 of them by the time contract expired in the fall of 1945. Bell ranked 25th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.|$|R
5000|$|In their {{description}} of B. gabonica, <b>Spawls</b> et al.. (2004) give an average total length of 80-130 cm (32 to 51.5 in), {{with a maximum}} total length of 175 cm (69.3 in), saying the species may possibly grow larger still. They acknowledge reports of specimens over 1.8 m (6 ft), or even over 2 m (6.5 ft) in total length, but claim {{there is no evidence}} to support this. A large specimen of exactly 1.8 m total length, caught in 1973, was found to have weighed 11.3 kg with an empty stomach. Very large specimens may possibly weigh up to 20 kg, which would rank them as the world's heaviest venomous snake ahead of the Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, but these masses are not known to have been verified.|$|R
5000|$|The snake's {{cytotoxic}} venom {{itself is}} not considered particularly toxic based on tests conducted in mice. In mice, the [...] is 0.8-5.0 mg/kg IV, 2.0 mg/kg IP and 5.0-6.0 mg/kg SC. However, the venom glands are enormous and each bite produces the largest quantities of venom of any venomous snake; this is partially {{due to the fact}} that, unlike many African vipers such as the Puff Adder, the Gaboon viper does not release after a bite, which enables it to inject larger amounts of venom. Yield is probably related to body weight, as opposed to milking interval. Brown (1973) gives a venom yield range of 200-1000 mg (of dried venom), A range of 200-600 mg for specimens 125-155 cm in length has also been reported. <b>Spawls</b> and Branch (1995) state from 5 to 7 ml (450-600 mg) of venom may be injected in a single bite.|$|R
