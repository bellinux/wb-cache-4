5|$|Hilbert spaces arise {{naturally}} {{and frequently}} {{in mathematics and}} physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied {{from this point of}} view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and ergodic theory, which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> square-integrable functions, <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> holomorphic functions.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between two compactifications <b>of</b> the moduli <b>space</b> <b>of</b> maps from curves to a toric fano varieties: the Kontsevich moduli <b>space</b> <b>of</b> stable maps and the Ciocan-Fontanine [...] Kim moduli <b>space</b> <b>of</b> stable quasi-maps. We exhibit the moduli <b>space</b> <b>of</b> stable maps as a union of two (reducible) components: the moduli <b>space</b> <b>of</b> relevant maps and the moduli <b>space</b> <b>of</b> irrelevant maps. We equip these spaces with virtual classes such that their sum equals the virtual class <b>of</b> the moduli <b>space</b> <b>of</b> stable maps. The moduli <b>space</b> <b>of</b> relevant maps is birational to the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> qusi-maps and the enumerative invariants defined as virtual intersection numbers on the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> relevant maps are equal to the quasi-maps invariants. On the other hand, the virtual intersection numbers on the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> stable irrelevant maps are zero. This shows that Gromov [...] Witten invariants agree with quasi-map invariants for toric Fano varieties...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E

There were speculative theories, (tensors and spinors have infinite counterparts in the expansors of Dirac and the expinors of Harish-Chandra) consistent with relativity and quantum mechanics, but they have found no proven physical application. Modern speculative theories potentially have similar ingredients per below.|$|E

50|$|Symbolic data {{analysis}} (SDA) {{is an extension}} of standard {{data analysis}} where symbolic data tables are used as input and symbolic objects are made output as a result. The data units are called symbolic since they are more complex than standard ones, as they not only contain values or categories, but also include internal variation and structure. SDA is based on four spaces: the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> individuals, the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> concepts, the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> descriptions, and the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> symbolic objects.

Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth.
