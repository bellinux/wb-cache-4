5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. <b>So,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to {{figure out ways to}} separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, Nomura {{stated that}} the {{original}} game assets for Kingdom Hearts had been lost some time ago. He explained, [...] " [...] was lost, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to research, {{and we had to}} dig out from the actual game what was available and recreate everything for HD. We had to recreate all the graphics and it was actually not that easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Another Vogue {{writer has}} complained Wintour {{excluded}} ordinary working women, {{many of whom}} are regular subscribers, from the pages. [...] "She's obsessed only about reflecting the aspirations of a certain class of reader," [...] she says. [...] "We once had a piece about breast cancer which started with an airline stewardess, but she wouldn't have a stewardess in the magazine <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to go and look for a high-flying businesswoman who'd had cancer." ...|$|E

About filming with Ryan Reynolds, Morrison commented, [...] "We did the whole scene together where I give him the ring, our suits are CGI <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> these grey suits with things on them so it was cool and working with Martin Campbell again was great too".|$|E
500|$|In late 1987, Slayer {{returned}} to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided {{to slow down the}} tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, [...] "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've never done that on an album, before or since." ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 July 2014, it was {{announced}} {{there would be a}} special episode broadcast between the third and fourth series. Filming began on 5 January 2015 and wrapped on 10 February 2015. Moffat confirmed the episode is set in Victorian London, saying, [...] "The special is its own thing. We wouldn't have done the story we're doing, and the way we're doing it, if we didn't have this special. It's not part of the run of three episodes. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> this to do it … It's kind of in its own little bubble." ...|$|E

500|$|However, the {{two films}} {{that could have}} catapulted her to star status, Streets of Fire (she turned down Splash and Risky Business for this film) and The Cotton Club, were both {{commercial}} and critical failures, and her career languished as a result. After The Cotton Club, Lane {{dropped out of the}} movie business and lived with her mother in Georgia. According to the actress, [...] "I hadn't been close to my mom for a long time, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a lot of homework to do. We had to repair our relationship because I wanted my mother back".|$|E
500|$|Docter {{revealed}} that the filmmakers' first story outline had Carl [...] "just want to join his wife up in the sky. It was almost a kind of strange suicide mission or something. And obviously that's [...] Once he gets airborne, then what? <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to have some goal for him to achieve {{that he had not}} yet gotten." [...] As a result, they added the plot of going to South America. The location was chosen due to both Docter's love of tropical locations, but also in wanting a location that Carl could be stuck with a kid due to the inability to leave him with an authority such as a police officer or social worker. They implemented a child character as a way to help Carl stop being [...] "stuck in his ways".|$|E
500|$|For the {{sequences}} {{involving the}} terraforming {{of the city}} Metropolis, Double Negative handled the visual effects for the sequence. In order to construct a Metropolis that seemed convincing and realistic, Double Negative utilized Esri's CityEngine to help procedurally deliver the city. [...] "That was a much more sci-fi based role," [...] said Double Negative visual effects supervisor Ged Wright, “so we took {{what they had done}} and extended it a great deal. The work we were doing was based around the Downtowns for New York, L.A. and Chicago and that gave us the building volumes for heights. We’d skin those volumes with kit parts, but most of it then had to fall down! <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to rig it for destruction and use it for other aspects of the work as well." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was co-directed by Ray Kay and Beyoncé for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was {{released}} the same month: {{it was one}} of eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. I had to do a video for this song. Everyone wanted to know what a 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you have to see it. Everyone has their own version, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> so many women — of different races, sizes, shapes, ages — because we all have those dresses we pull out when we need to shut it down." ...|$|E
500|$|The 3D {{cameras were}} unable to pick up {{anything}} shiny, such as stainless steel, due to a flare. Set decorator Cal Loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality. The saturation of colors also had to be changed to accustom the 3D cameras, which are [...] "slow to pick up information". Loucks said, [...] "It's a very restrictive color palette. For example, in this warehouse scene, we saturated the floors in a dark, dark charcoal, and we thought that was enough, but then the cameras showed them as still being too light. [...] <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to add more and more black. [...] The reason I say it's too light is because we are putting more light onto these sets than we ever have before." ...|$|E

500|$|Production and {{lighting}} designer Roy Bennett used Clay Paky's A.leda B-Eye K20 LED-based moving lights and Clay Paky Sharpys as lighting attachments. Also around 120 B-Eyes by PKG, {{were obtained for}} the tour as well with lighting control from three full-sized grandMA2s and 10 NPUs. According to lighting programmer Jason Baeri, [...] "Bennett's approach to the show was {{to make it an}} immersive rave that reflected Gaga's non-stop party aesthetic... That means active, alive, vibrant and high energy—it requires us to be just as active on stage as in the crowd. The audience is every bit as much a set piece as they are a room of spectators, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to include them as part of Gaga's same party not just watching the spectacle from afar. Cue wise, that's almost like programming two shows at once: Both had to behave as one cohesive element." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{revealed}} in March 2013 in a Famitsu interview, that 66 tracks spanning across all three games (with {{a majority of}} them concentrated in Kingdom Hearts Final Mix) were re-recorded with live instrumentation, {{as opposed to the}} original games' use of the PlayStation 2's built-in tone generator for their background music. In June 2013, Nomura stated that the original game assets for Kingdom Hearts had been lost some time ago. He explained, [...] " [...] was lost, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to research, and we had to dig out from the actual game what was available and recreate everything for HD. We had to recreate all the graphics and it was actually not that easy." [...] In July 2017, Nomura spoke on bringing the collection to the Xbox One, saying he did not believe there was much demand for it outside of North America, but felt it could be a possibility after Square Enix completed development on Kingdom Hearts III.|$|E
500|$|The Hot Lunch {{script was}} sent to Alan Parker {{after the release of}} his {{previous}} film Midnight Express (1978). He chose to work on the project as he wanted make his next film in the United States, and signed on as its director in February 1979. Parker met with De Silva in Manhattan, New York, where it was decided that he would draft his own script with Gore receiving sole screenwriting credit and Parker's colleague Alan Marshall being enlisted as a producer. Gore travelled to London, England, where he and Parker began work on a second draft script. Their new script became significantly darker than what De Silva had originally intended. De Silva said, [...] "I was really motivated and interested in the joy of what the school represented for these kids, and [...] was really much more interested in where the pain was in going to the school, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> our little conflicts based on that area." ...|$|E
