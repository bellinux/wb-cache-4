50|$|A blocked rotor test is {{conducted}} on an induction motor. It {{is also known}} as short circuit test, locked rotor test or stalled torque test. From this test, short circuit current at normal voltage, power factor on short circuit, total leakage reactance, and starting torque of the motor can be found. The test {{is conducted}} at low voltage because if the applied voltage was normal voltage then the current through the stator windings would be high enough to overheat the windings and damage them. The blocked rotor torque test is not performed on wound-rotor motors because the starting torque can be varied as desired. However, a blocked rotor current test is conducted on <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> motors.|$|E
50|$|Like a {{shaded pole}} {{induction}} motor, they use field coils with additional copper shading coils (see the illustration) {{to produce a}} weakly rotating magnetic field. But unlike a shaded pole induction motor (which uses a <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>rotor),</b> the synchronous version of this motor uses a magnetized rotor. This rotor rotates synchronously with the rotating magnetic field: if the rotor begins to lag behind the rotating field, driving torque increases and the rotor speeds up slightly until the rotor's position within the rotating field is a point where torque = drag; similarly, if {{the rotation of the}} field slows down, the rotor will advance relative to the field, torque will decline, or even become negative, slowing the speed of the rotor until it again reaches a position relative to the field where torque = drag.|$|E

40|$|Squirrel cage {{induction}} motors {{are widely}} used in industrial applications such as in industrial drives, pumps, lathe machine and turbines due to its simple and rugged construction and low maintenance requirements. The rotor of the squirrel cage induction motor determines the motor torque and operational efficiency. Failures of the motor occur due to the failure in the rotor and its components. For designing of the rotor with good performance and mechanical durability the causes of those failures should be minimized. The main objective of this thesis is to study structural rigidity of <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> with different surface contact between the rotor components.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this work}} is to find good designs for high-speed induction machines. Special {{attention is paid to}} rotors suitable for these machines. Another goal is to find supply voltage waveforms appropriate for a high-speed induction machine with a solid rotor. In order to design good high-speed machines, modeling is modified and verified. A laminated rotor made for high speeds was tested on a 65  kW 30600 1 /min compressor drive. Two <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> solid steel <b>rotors</b> were tested on a 60  kW 60000 1 /min high-speed machine. In both cases, the rotors were compared against a commercially used copper coated solid steel rotor. The results showed that the laminated construction with a cage should be used whenever possible. At higher speeds, a well-designed <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> solid steel <b>rotor</b> would be better than a copper coated solid steel rotor. The copper coated rotor is preferred at very high speeds. Pulse amplitude modulation and pulse width modulation are techniques used to adjust the supply voltage of electric machines. The feasibility of these modulation types for supplying high-speed induction machines was tested. The results show that pulse amplitude modulation is the best choice for a high-speed induction motor drive. For the high-speed machines considered, the 3 D effects made the 2 D modeling of the electromagnetic properties difficult. Two modifications to the current modeling software were made. In the first modification, the end ring inductance was calculated with a separate 2 D FEM model. In the other modification, the flux fringing in the air gap region was also modeled with a separate 2 D FEM model. A discrepancy between electromagnetic loss calculated and electromagnetic loss measured was noticed. The measurements show circulatory currents flowing in the parallel paths of a stator winding of a high-speed machine. These currents produce extra power loss not modeled in the calculations. It is shown that taking circulatory currents into account, the model provides results close to the measured ones. Thus, the model can be used for the designing and optimization of high-speed machines. Genetic optimization software was used to derive the optimal parameters for a <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> solid steel <b>rotor.</b> General topology suitable for a high-speed induction machine was also studied by using optimization. The results show that both the positioning and the volume of conductors in the rotor are important. Considering the electromagnetic performance, the choice between a laminated and a solid rotor core material is less significant for a high-speed induction machine. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Diagnosis of {{electrical}} induction machines in non-stationary regimes working in randomly changing conditions SUMMARY OF THE THESIS Traditionally, {{the detection of}} faults in electric machines relies on the Fast Fourier Transform {{since most of the}} faults can be reliably diagnosed using it provided the machines are operating under steady state conditions for a reasonable period of time.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{in the field of}} controls for asynchronous induction motors require a precise knowledge of the parameters of the machine.

40|$|The couped-circuit {{approach}} {{is used to}} derive a mathematical model of a general m-n winding machine in which all MMF harmonics are taken into account. The model which is applicable to a <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> or phase-wound <b>rotor</b> has provision for non-integral number of rotor bars per stator pole-pair. A general polyphase to (alpha) -(beta) - 0 components transformation is described. When applied to the stator and rotor of the m-n winding machine, the polyphase to (alpha) -(beta) - 0 transformation divides the harmonics into different groups of harmonics with possible interaction, whereupon each group of harmonics can then be represented by an (alpha) -(beta) or a zero component circuit. This result shows that the usual assumption of representing the <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> by independent harmonics circuits is not valid in general. It is also shown that the polyphase to rotating d-q transformation is applicable when only one harmonic from each (alpha) -(beta) component is to be considered, otherwise a new problem of separating the harmonic voltages within each (alpha) -(beta) component is created. As a special case of the transformation the three phase <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> induction machine is considered. In addition the steady-state equations for asynchronous and synchronous action of a polyphase <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> induction machine are derived. The conditions for synchronous action between two harmonics are identified. It is concluded that every pair of harmonics belonging to {{the same set of}} (alpha) -(beta) components produces synchronous action, conversely every pair of harmonics which produces synchronous action belongs to the same set of (alpha) -(beta) components. This confirms that the harmonics of each set of (alpha) -(beta) components are not separable. Finally, the effects of MMF harmonics on the steady-state and transient behaviors of three sample <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> induction machines with rotors designed to give varying amounts of asynchronous and synchronous torques are studied. The influence of slot opening on the MMF, skew and skin effects are taken into account in the derivation of the parameters for these machines. The computational requirement for the solution of the original phase equations is compared with those of the (alpha) -(beta) and d-q component equations. ...|$|R

40|$|Induction motors {{are used}} in a {{significant}} portion of industrial electric drive applications due to their reliability, relatively low cost and low maintenance required. The <b>Squirrel</b> <b>Cage</b> and Wound <b>Rotor</b> type machines are common examples of an induction machine. One of the important features of an induction motor is its torque speed characteristic. The correct application, motor protection, speed control and efficiency of a machine can depend on correctly identifying this characteristic. The project objective involved the design of experiments to obtain the torque speed characteristics for both the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> and wound <b>rotor</b> type induction motors available in the engineering laboratory. A further aim of the project involved the design and execution of suitable experiments with the Lab-Volt equipment to experimentally determine the electrical parameters of the machines. Determining the electrical parameters involves conducting standard tests such as the DC, No-Load and Locked Rotor test. Once these parameters are known the characteristic curve can be modeled by simulation software and a comparison can be made with the experimental curves. Further work included using 3 measured points within the stable operating region to extrapolate the maximum torque and speed for each machine. An investigation into the effect of increasing the rotor resistance in the wound rotor induction motor (WRIM) was also carried out. Determining the torque speed characteristic experimentally was achieved relatively easily in the stable operating region with the use of an electrodynamometer as a loading device. Torque measurements are read directly from the scale on the faceplate of the electrodynamometer whilst simultaneously measuring the rotational speed with an optical tachometer. Determining the T-S characteristics in the unstable region of operation included coupling the machine being tested to a DC generator. The torque speed characteristic of a DC machine is linear up until the armature windings are saturated. Measurements of the power output (P=V*I) of the armature windings and the rotational speed are taken and the induced torque can then be calculated. Matlab was used in the implementation of this project as a simulation tool.

40|$|The {{concept of}} bearingless motors, which combine both {{motoring}} and rotor bearing capabilities, is appealing especially in high speed and high power machine applications. Although extensive {{research has been}} carried out on permanent magnet and reluctance types of bearingless motors, studies on the induction motor type are less successful. This thesis addresses the bearingless induction motor based on the concept of dual-pole windings, one controlling the motor torque and the other the generated radial forces. A modelling approach is undertaken to investigate the effect of induction machine design on radial force generation and motor levitation under both steady state and transient conditions. The simulation is based on the dynamic reluctance mesh model embedded in vector control systems for the decoupled control of torque, flux and radial force. This is achieved through modification of a previously developed computer software for modelling induction motors in order to model the control of bearingless induction motors. Both the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> and wound <b>rotor</b> induction motors are investigated and their suitability for generating controlled bearing relief forces assessed. Vector control schemes for the bearingless <b>cage</b> and wound <b>rotor</b> induction motors were also designed and simulated. A mixed field oriented vector control scheme, which incorporates the simple rotor field orientation for motoring control and an airgap field orientation for rotor levitation control, is introduced and found to be advantageous in bearingless induction motor control. Apart from investigating totally bearingless conditions, the study also investigates bearing relief capabilities for a vector controlled <b>cage</b> and wound <b>rotor</b> induction motor in which the rotor movement is restricted by bearings but with the bearing load cancelled by suitably directed radial force.
