40|$|Automatic fault {{detection}} and diagnosis (FDD) {{can help enhance}} building energy efficiency by facilitating early detection of occurrence of system faults, especially those of air-conditioning systems, thus enabling rectification of the faults before much energy is wasted due to such faults. However, building owners may not invest in FDD unless they are convinced of the energy cost savings that can be achieved. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on the energy cost impacts of a range of common system faults in variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning systems, which are widely adopted for their good part-load energy efficiency. The faults studied include room air temperature <b>sensor</b> <b>offset,</b> stuck VAV box damper, supply air temperature <b>sensor</b> <b>offset,</b> stuck outdoor air damper and stuck/leaking cooling coil valve. The simulation results indicate that some faults may significantly increase energy use in buildings, for example, negative room air temperature <b>sensor</b> <b>offset,</b> stuck open VAV box damper, negative supply air temperature <b>sensor</b> <b>offset,</b> stuck open outdoor air damper and stuck open and leaking cooling coil valve. Since building occupants may adapt to the symptoms of these faults, such as reduced room air temperature, and thus may not complain about them, the occurrence of such faults are not immediately apparent unless a FDD system is available. Some other faults, e. g. positive supply air temperature <b>sensor</b> <b>offset,</b> positive room air temperature <b>sensor</b> <b>offset,</b> stuck closed cooling coil valve and stuck closed VAV box damper, may allow less energy to be used but will lead to unbearable indoor environmental conditions, such as high indoor temperature. Such faults, therefore, can easily be detected even without a FDD system, as there will be feedback from the building occupants. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|A general AC PM (Permanent Magnet) {{motor control}} system {{consists}} of a motion controller, a current tracking amplifier, a feedback encoder and the motor itself. The motion controller generates two analog commands to the current tracking amplifier and the three phase currents are reproduced at the motor terminals. However, DC offsets are always present at the motor terminals due to the DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) offsets of the motion controller and the current <b>sensor</b> <b>offsets</b> of the current tracking amplifier. These current offsets generate sinusoidal torque disturbance and hence produce velocity ripples. Such a disturbance cannot be rejected by using a simple PI (Proportional plus Integral) control. Furthermore, the current offsets drift with time and temperature so that an off-line compensation does not work satisfactorily.

40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{estimating}} the <b>sensor</b> <b>offset</b> of a cylinder pressure transducer are developed. Both methods fit the pressure data during pre-combustion compression to a polytropic curve. The first method assumes a known polytropic exponent, {{and the other}} estimates the polytropic exponent. The first method results in a linear least-squares problem, and the second method results in a nonlinear least-squares problem. The nonlinear least-squares problem is solved by separating out the nonlinear dependence and solving the single-variable minimization problem. For this, a finite difference Newton method is applied. Using this method, the cost of solving the nonlinear least-squares problem is only slightly higher than solving the linear least-squares problem. Both methods show good statistical behavior. Estimation error variances are inversely proportional {{to the number of}} pressure samples used for the estimation. The method is computationally inexpensive, and well suited for real-time control application...|$|E
40|$|A new {{in-flight}} calibration (IFC) {{method is}} described for the humidity sensor flown routinely since 1994 on the Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapor by Airbus In-Service Aircraft (MOZAIC) program's aircraft. The IFC method corrects the potential drift of the <b>sensor</b> <b>offset</b> at zero relative humidity, {{which is the}} critical parameter in determining {{the uncertainty of the}} measurements. The <b>sensor</b> <b>offset</b> is determined from the measurements themselves as obtained during periods when the aircraft is flying in the lower stratosphere at or above the hygropause, where the H 2 O mixing ratio reaches well-defined minimum values of about 5 ppmv and the contribution of atmospheric H 2 O to the sensor signal is minimal. The selection of stratospheric data is achieved with the help of potential temperature, which can be calculated in situ from measured temperature and pressure. The IFC method is capable of providing humidity measurements in near-real time with an uncertainty of +/- 8 % RH at the surface and +/- 7 % RH in the upper troposphere. For validation, the IFC method was applied to 5 yr of archived raw signals from the MOZAIC aircraft. The resulting humidity data are in good agreement (within 2 % RH) with the original MOZAIC data that used monthly pre- and postflight calibrations of the sensor. The standard deviation of the differences varies with altitude between +/- 4 % and +/- 6 % RH, which is comparable to the accuracy of the MOZAIC laboratory calibrations. Compared to MOZAIC operation based on monthly calibrations in the laboratory, the use of IFC will substantially reduce the efforts for maintenance and thus will enable operation of the sensor on a large fleet of in-service aircraft for near-real-time measurements of humidity in the troposphere. Because the IFC method will not work on aircraft that never enter the lower stratosphere, for example, aircraft that fly exclusively regional routes or in the tropics, regular offline calibrations will remain important for such aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Control and {{diagnosis}} of complex systems demand accurate knowledge of certain quantities {{to be able}} to control the system efficiently and also to detect small errors. Physical sensors are expensive and some quantities are hard or even impossible to measure with physical sensors. This has made model-based estimation an attractive alternative. Model-based estimators are sensitive to errors in the model and since the model complexity needs to be kept low, the accuracy of the models becomes limited. Further, modeling is hard and time consuming and it is desirable to design robust estimators based on existing models. An experimental investigation shows that the model deficiencies in engine applications often are stationary errors while the dynamics of the engine is well described by the model equations. This together with fairly frequent appearance of <b>sensor</b> <b>offsets</b> have led to a demand for systematic ways of handling stationary errors, also called bias, in both models and sensors...|$|R

This paper describes the design and performance of a Kalman filter to estimate inclination from the signals of a triaxial accelerometer. This design is based on assumptions concerning the frequency content of the acceleration of the movement that is measured, {{the knowledge that the}} magnitude of the gravity is 1 g and taking into account a fluctuating <b>sensor</b> <b>offset.</b> It is shown that for measuring trunk and pelvis inclination during the functional three-dimensional activity of stacking crates, the inclination error that is made is approximately 2 /spl deg/ root-mean square.

40|$|In {{instrumentation}} {{and measurement}} systems, external noise {{is often a}} significant problem. The particular signal processing techniques employed to enable such measurements depend somewhat {{on the nature of}} the problem at hand, what is able to be measured, and other factors. Techniques such as coherent averaging and synchronous detection take advantage of situations where a time-synchronous signal is available. A problem which may prevent successful application of these methods is the presence of slowly-changing drift, which is inevitably associated with many types of sensors. In this paper, a novel technique is proposed to estimate the measured signal amplitude using a matrix representation of coherently sampled repetitive measurement sweeps. It is also shown how the technique may be extended using partitioning of the signal matrix to account for both <b>sensor</b> <b>offset</b> and linear time drift. The method is able to simultaneously produce good estimates of the signal amplitude, drift and offset. Results demonstrate that the technique is promising when applied in situations where sensor drift precludes the normal application of synchronous detection. ...|$|E
40|$|The typical {{measurement}} range of integrated Hall sensors lies between approximately 10 mu T and 10 T. Above that range, nonlinear effects occur {{due to an}} increasing Hall angle. Below that range, <b>sensor</b> <b>offsets</b> and noise corrupt measurements. Because of its geometry, vertical Hall elements exhibit considerably less sensitivity making them more susceptible to offset and noise. We present a method of attenuating external fields by using a coating of ferromagnetic material {{for the purpose of}} offset calibration. If the coating is driven into saturation by an integrated excitation wire, the external field becomes "visible" for the sensor and can be measured offset-free. As the integrated excitation wire is able to saturate the coating very locally the unsaturated regions of it may act as a concentrator of the external field and hence increases the sensitivity. Different materials and geometries were modelled and simulated with the finite element method (FEM) and the approach was tested for feasibility. The results of the simulations were used to design an experimental integrated circuit (IC) and to choose a suitable material for the coating layer.

Due to the wide range of different vehicle configurations at Scania CV, all sensors with relevant information regarding vehicle direction are not available on all vehicles. By using a statistical approach, including common sensors installed on the vehicle, a conceptual algorithm calibrating the Steering Wheel Angle <b>Sensor</b> <b>offset</b> in real- time has been developed. The algorithm is simple and relies on the assumption that a vehicle is driving straight ahead most of the time above a certain minimum vehicle speed, thus the most frequent steering wheel angle is the straight ahead angle. The algorithm is only active above the certain minimum vehicle speed and consists of two moving windows comprising steering wheel angle samples in which the calculations are performed. The results show that the algorithm is able to detect offsets with a short calibration time. Storage of samples is required but no vehicle specific parameters are needed. ...|$|E

Falling-Weight Deflectometer (FWD) tests were conducted on the test sections at all stages of pavement construction (pre-base, post-base, and post pavement). Deflection values were highly variable due to variability in surface condition, soil moisture content, density, and stressdependent effects. In general, backcalculated subgrade moduli tended to increase with increasing FWD <b>sensor</b> <b>offset</b> (decreasing stress). Post-base and post-pavement testing also indicated an apparent increase in subgrade modulus relative to pre-base values. Moduli values were also determined for granular base results.
