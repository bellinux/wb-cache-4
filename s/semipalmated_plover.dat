Extra-pair copulations were infrequent (7 % of total copulations), as were within pair copulations (0. 44 hr). Copulations occurred, on average 6. 2 days prior to clutch initiation. Males spent 64 % {{of their time in}} visual contact with their mates.

30|$|As indicated, we did {{not find}} any {{significant}} differences among species in egg mercury concentration, and therefore no relationship between mercury concentration and population status for these four species of shorebirds. We predicted that mercury concentrations in the eggs of species with declining population trends (i.e., black-bellied plovers and ruddy turnstones) would be higher than those species with stable or increasing population trends (i.e., <b>semipalmated</b> <b>plovers</b> and white-rumped sandpipers). Interestingly, the white-rumped sandpiper (having a stable population trend) had the highest individual egg mercury concentrations of all samples (FigureÂ  2). These findings provide no evidence for mercury contamination of eggs as an obvious explanation for declining populations of shorebirds; however, our samples are small and drawn from a single site, and inter- and intra-specific differences need to be considered when conducting a study of contaminants.|$|R

30|$|The four shorebird {{species in}} this study appear to have {{elevated}} egg mercury levels when compared to an earlier study (i.e., Hargreaves et al. 2010, 2011). The eggs used by Hargreaves et al. (2010, 2011) were collected in 2008 from the same four species at the same study site (East Bay). Mean total egg mercury concentrations for each species {{in this study}} were at least three times greater than the results from Hargreaves et al. (2011), and the ranges of egg mercury levels found in each study did not overlap. A similar pattern of contamination was observed in Hargreaves et al. (2011) where black-bellied plovers and ruddy turnstones had the lowest egg mercury concentrations. However, in contrast to our study, they observed the highest egg mercury concentrations among the <b>semipalmated</b> <b>plovers,</b> rather than the white-rumped sandpipers (Hargreaves et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|We {{found no}} {{differences}} in egg mercury concentrations between the species with declining numbers (black-bellied plovers, ruddy turnstones) and the species with stable or increasing numbers (white-rumped sandpipers, <b>semipalmated</b> <b>plovers).</b> These results do not support mercury contamination as a primary contributor to shorebird declines in North America, but ours is not a definitive test. Our sample is small and drawn from a single site, and studies of contaminants in the wild are extremely complex undertakings, with many variables to consider. It is possible that detrimental population-level effects of mercury are not showing up in the shorebird embryonic stage; mercury contamination may be affecting shorebirds at some other stage in their life history, such as at overwintering sites or feeding during migration stopovers. In nature, organisms can be exposed to a toxic âcocktailâ consisting of multiple contaminants, possibly acting antagonistically or synergistically with one another depending on life history stage, as mercury and selenium sometimes do (as in mallard ducks; Heinz and Hoffman 1998).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Development of the Hamlet of Baker Lake (Qamaniâtuaq) in {{the central}} Canadian Arctic during the 1950 s {{was typical of the}} local {{urbanization}} that has occurred in Arctic regions during {{the latter half of the}} 20 th century. The effects of urbanization on bird populations were examined by comparing populations before and after 1950, comparing populations in anthropogenic ecosystems with natural ones, and recording the presence or absence of exotic species usually associated with human dwellings and settlements. Of a total 60 local species, 21 had not been reported prior to 1950. Most of these were waterfowl, shorebirds, and gulls, all species that benefited from the presence of sewage lagoons and a refuse dump, or were associated with building sites (American robin). <b>Semipalmated</b> <b>plovers</b> were associated with gravel pits and gravel roadsides, whereas semipalmated sandpipers, Lapland longspurs, horned larks, Savannah sparrows, and white-crowned sparrows were most abundant in town. Vagrants from south of the tree line have been reported from the study site. It is hypothesized that climatic amelioration in association with the development of urban ecosystems may have encouraged migration overshoots in these species. These vagrants may be the early colonizers that eventually result in breeding range extensions, as has been observed in several waterfowl species, American robins, and white-throated sparrows. Twelve apparent species losses have occurred since 1950, but these are likely due to general scarcity or lack of observers rather than reduced abundance. No exotic âcity â species, such as rock doves, European starlings, or house sparrows, have been recorded in Baker Lake. It is not anticipated that these species would become established or survive at Baker Lake in the near future, because of its isolation and severe winters...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>semipalmated</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius semipalmatus) {{is a small}} plover.

40|$|Ruff and Godwits. On April 19, 1994, I {{discovered}} a red-phased Ruff (Philomachus pugnax) in alternate plumage at the Sacramento Wildlife Management Area in Phelps County. It was feeding with {{a flock of}} Hudsonian Godwits (Limosa haemastica) and Marbled Godwits (Limosa fedoa) in a flooded marshy area. The Ruff was easily recognized and required little effort to identify. I observed and photographed it for about one hour in the early evening, using a Canon AE- 1 and my Kowa TSN- 4 with a 1200 mm photo attachment as a lens. I was unable to locate it the following morning. Several photographs {{have been sent to}} the Records Committee. Snowy Plover and Other Plovers. On May 2, 1994, I found a Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) at the Funk Marsh Waterfowl Production Area in Phelps County. It was on a mud flat with 16 <b>semipalmated</b> <b>Plovers</b> (Charadrius semipalmatus) and a single Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus), as well as a variety of sandpipers. The Snowy Plover was pale on the upperparts and white on the underparts. The bill was black and the legs appeared to be a darkslate color. The bird had a blackish breast band, which was limited {{to the side of the}} breast, and a dark area behind the eye. It possessed the typical Charadrius feature of a blackish area at the front of the crown. The only species that could possibly be confused with a Snowy Plover would be the Piping Plover. Breeding male and female Piping Plovers were eliminated from consideration because this bird had dark legs and bill, a dark area behind the eye, and was smaller in size than the Piping Plover. Non-breeding Piping Plovers have dark legs and bill but lack any darker plumage patterns. Photographs of the Snowy Plover will be sent to the Records Committee...|$|R
40|$|First, I {{want to say}} {{how much}} I {{appreciate}} observers 2 Ì 7 responses to my requests for additional details on various sightings, not just rarities, but early and late dates. It 2 Ì 7 s important to have these details for the archives to help future readers and researchers feel more comfortable with records from our era. Patterns that were apparent included a generally quiet fall for waterfowl (they were all at Lake McConaughy), but excellent numbers of the rarer two scoters (but NO White-winged!) and a surprising 16 Red-necked Grebes. On the other hand, numbers of staging Western Grebes were down significantly, apparently due to poor (dry) summer breeding conditions, but a flock of Brant and a Harlequin Duck added spice. Among herons, there were more Snowy Egrets than Greats in the eastern Rainwater Basin! Snowies and Little Blue Herons appeared in good numbers, and the 10 th Glossy Ibis for 2006 (!) made an appearance. A fifth breeding location for Sandhill Crane was reported. Among shorebirds, record numbers of American Golden-Plovers were located, and the recent increase in fall sightings of White-romped Sandpipers continued. These two species, along with Hudsonian Godwit, are usually scarcer in fall than in spring. Also unprecedented historically was a fall flock of 28 migrant Mountain Plovers; previously, records after July were extremely unusual. Other lingering shorebirds included <b>Semipalmated</b> and Piping <b>Plovers,</b> Black-necked Stilt, Willet, and Long-billed Curlew.
