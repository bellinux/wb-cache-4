25|$|After being flayed, {{the skin}} is soaked in water for about a day. This removes blood and grime from the skin and prepares it for a {{dehairing}} liquor. The dehairing liquor was originally made of rotted, or fermented, vegetable matter, like beer or other liquors, but by the Middle Ages an unhairing bath included lime. Today, the lime solution is occasionally sharpened {{by the use of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfide.</b> The liquor bath would have been in wooden or stone vats and the hides stirred with a long wooden pole to avoid human contact with the alkaline solution. Sometimes the skins would stay in the unhairing bath for eight or more days depending how concentrated and how warm the solution was kept—unhairing could take up to twice as long in winter. The vat was stirred {{two or three times a}} day to ensure the solution's deep and uniform penetration. Replacing the lime water bath also sped the process up. However, if the skins were soaked in the liquor too long, they would be weakened and not able to stand the stretching required for parchment.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the results {{described}} in the literature on the reactivity of sodium toward DBT and its derivates, the effect of sodium dispersed on the surface of a carbonaceous support on the removal of DBT from hexane solution at ambient conditions has been investigated. Since the main objective {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the effect of sodium on the reactive adsorption of DBT from an organic solvent, hexane was chosen as a model solvent. As adsorbents, two carbons with and without sodium on the surface were investigated. The carbons are obtained by carbonization of polystyrene−sulfonic acid−co-maleic acid in sodium salt at 800 °C in nitrogen. The results show that sodium present on the surface of carbon takes part in the reaction with DBT in which sodium metalates and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfides</b> are formed.

The present study proposes to evaluate the antilithiatic property of hydrogen sulfide and its metabolites like thiosulfate & sulfate in an in vitro model. Materials and Methods: The antilithiatic activity of <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulfide</b> (NaSH), <b>sodium</b> thiosulfate (Na 2 S 2 O 3) and sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4) on the kinetics of calcium oxalate crystal formation was investigated both in physiological buffer and in urine from normal and recurrent stone forming volunteers. The stones were characterized by optical and spectroscopic techniques. Results: The stones were characterized to be monoclinic, prismatic and bipyramidal habit which is of calcium monohydrate and dihydrate nature. The FTIR displayed fingerprint corresponding to calcium oxalate in the control while in NaSH treated, S=O vibrations were visible in the spectrum. The order of percentage inhibition was NaSH>Na 2 S 2 O 3 >Na 2 SO 4. Conclusion: Our study indicates that <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulfide</b> and its metabolite thiosulfate are inhibitors of calcium oxalate stone agglomeration which makes them unstable both in physiological buffer and in urine. This effect is attributed to pH changes and complexing of calcium by S 2 O 3 2 -and SO 4 2 - moiety produced by the test compounds. </sec...|$|R
