5|$|When Kubo {{was asked}} to make a cover with a female {{character}} during Christmas, Kubo initially thought of using Rukia; he later changed to use Orihime Inoue as he thought Orihime was more suitable for such role. However, Kubo commented he previously made a Christmas illustration with Rukia, and that he received request by several fans wanting to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>image.</b> In contrast to this, Kubo has found he liked Rukia more in the illustrations in which her face expresses pain such as when {{she is going to}} be executed in the manga.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (<b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive broach, which completely machines the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the broach machines outward from there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E

25|$|<b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> for the {{biological}} {{life cycle of}} the hookworm where it thrives in warm earth where temperatures are over 18°C. They exist primarily in sandy or loamy soil and cannot live in clay or muck. Rainfall averages must be more than 1000mm (40inches) a year for them to survive. Only if these conditions exist can the eggs hatch. Infective larvae of Necator americanus can survive at higher temperatures, whereas those of Ancylostoma duodenale are better adapted to cooler climates. Generally, they live {{for only a few}} weeks at most under natural conditions, and die almost immediately on exposure to direct sunlight or desiccation.|$|E
25|$|In {{a parking}} lot at the end of La Ropa Beach, one of the parking spaces has become a place of reverence for the Virgin of Guadalupe.

The tree has a base constructed around it with stairs allowing visitors to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> more easily.

That is, the received signal has been increased in frequency by the Doppler shift. These high frequency images are shown in the figures by blue light paths.|$|E
25|$|The devil, {{dressed in}} a monk's habit and with fearsome teeth, holds out some stones {{in his left hand}} and a globe in his right hand. He teases Jesus asking him to turn the stones into bread and telling Jesus, with {{reference}} to the globe, that he could be the ruler of the entire world if he chose to be so. Between the devil and the second image of Jesus we see Jesus wearing the crown of thorns, his hands bound and held by a soldier. He is appearing before Pontius Pilate who is seated and wears a turban. He touches his thumb with his left index finger to show that he is speaking. Then we see a second image of Jesus but without the crown of thorns. To understand this scene it is best to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the devil and the image of Christ without the crown of thorns as apparitions and speaking across Pontius and that group.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{recognition}} sub-units {{are used}} for actin or tubulin although there is some overlap. In actin the subunits that bind with prefoldin are probably PFD3 and PFD4, which bind in two places one between residues 60-79 and the other between residues 170-198. The actin is recognized, loaded and delivered to the cytosolic chaperonin (CCT) in an open conformation by the inner end of prefoldin’s [...] "tentacles” (<b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> and note). The contact when actin is delivered is so brief that a tertiary complex is not formed, immediately freeing the prefoldin.|$|E

Jo is delighted, and the mirror is placed in her bedroom. That night, Jo is stunned to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of another girl in the mirror, instead of her own reflection, and {{it is obvious that}} the other girl, Louisa Iredale (also fourteen years old), can see her just as clearly. Louisa is able to 'introduce' herself to Jo by writing her name on a book for Jo to read. However, when Jo tries to write her name on the mirror to introduce herself to Louisa, she is startled when the pen begins to disappear into the mirror. After Louisa is called away to dinner, Jo investigates the mystery and is accidentally pulled through the mirror into Louisa's bedroom in 1919. This leads to the discovery, by Jo and Louisa, that they can visit each other's times, through the mirror, any time they want to do so [...] provided that the mirror is situated in exactly the same place and that the mirror's alignment and orientation are identical within the mirror's frame, at corresponding moments in 1919 and 1995.|$|E
