500|$|The Publicity Bureau was {{the first}} PR agency and was founded by former Boston journalists, {{including}} Ivy Lee. Ivy Lee is sometimes called the father of PR and was influential in establishing it as a professional practice. In 1906, Lee published a Declaration of Principles, which said that PR work {{should be done in}} the open, should be accurate and cover topics of public interest. According to historian Eric Goldman, the declaration of principles marked the beginning of an emphasis on informing, rather than misleading, the public. Ivy Lee is also credited with developing the modern press release and the [...] "two-way-street" [...] philosophy of both listening to and communicating with the public. In 1906, Lee helped facilitate the Pennsylvania Railroad's first positive media coverage after inviting press to the scene of a railroad accident, despite objections from executives. At the time, secrecy about corporate operations was common practice. Lee's work was often identified as spin or propaganda. In 1913 and 1914, the mining union was blaming the Ludlow Massacre, where on-strike miners and their families were killed by state militia, on the Rockefeller family and their coal mining operation, The Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. On the Rockefeller family's behalf, Lee published bulletins called [...] "Facts Concerning the Struggle in Colorado for Industrial Freedom," [...] which contained false and misleading information. Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized versions of the Rockefellers. [...] In response the labor press <b>said</b> <b>Lee</b> [...] "twisted the facts" [...] and called him a [...] "paid liar," [...] a [...] "hired slanderer," [...] and a [...] "poisoner of public opinion." [...] By 1917, Bethlehem Steel company announced it would start a publicity campaign against perceived errors about them. The Y.M.C.A. opened a new press secretary. AT and others also started their first publicity programs.|$|E

He stated that control passed between the players several times before the endgame, and especially praised AlphaGo's moves 151, 157, and 159, calling them [...] "brilliant".|$|R

[...] "It's an incident that an underground revolutionary organization....systemically and collectively plotted to overthrow a free democracy and posed a grave threat to" [...] South Korea's national security, Kim said. He <b>said</b> <b>Lee</b> Seok-ki was indicted on two other charges-inciting a rebellion and praising North Korea in violation of South Korea's anti-Pyongyang security law.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} with an Australian newspaper, Rev. Dr. Thomas Lane Butts <b>said</b> <b>Lee</b> now {{lived in an}} assisted-living facility, wheelchair-bound, partially blind and deaf, and suffering from memory loss. Butts also shared that Lee told him why she never wrote again: [...] "Two reasons: one, I wouldn't go through the pressure and publicity I went through with To Kill a Mockingbird for any amount of money. Second, I have said what I wanted to say, and I will not say it again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee Seok-ki {{had visited}} North Korea on two {{different}} occasions, the South Korean government said on September 2, 2013. Reports <b>said</b> <b>Lee</b> Seok-ki traveled to North Korea to secretly meet with North Korean officials. Any such meeting could link the rebellion plot to North Korea. [...] "Records showed {{he was at the}} Mount Kumgang resort on March 31-April 1 in 2005 and again on March 16–18 of 2007," [...] Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyung-suk said.

2500|$|During his victorious 10-round {{bout with}} Andy Divodi at Madison Square Garden on December 12, 1929, Lee was dealt a blow over {{his right ear}} that {{detached}} his retina. With treatment his vision could have been saved, but Lee feared losing his successful career and masked his injury. In time he lost all sight in his right eye. He quit professional boxing in 1933. Despite having made an estimated $90,000 during his boxing career (roughly equivalent to $ today), Lee was broke. [...] "Just threw it away," [...] Lee later <b>said.</b> <b>Lee</b> eventually lobbied for insurance, health care, financial consultation and retirement homes for fighters. [...] "The average boxer possesses little education," [...] he said in 1946. [...] "If he winds up broke, he has no trade, no education and nobody to turn to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{began playing}} music in school {{when he was}} 9 or 10, and got his first {{acoustic}} guitar at 14. In school, he first played drums, trumpet and clarinet. However, learning to play instruments in school wasn't satisfying to Lee, and he took basic piano lessons on his own. His interest increased dramatically after listening {{to some of the}} popular rock groups at the time. His early influences included Jack Bruce of Cream, John Entwistle of The Who, Jeff Beck, and Procol Harum. [...] "I was mainly interested in early British progressive rock," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Lee.</b> [...] "That's how I learned to play bass, emulating Jack Bruce and people like that." [...] Bruce's style of music was also noticed by Lee, who liked that [...] "his sound was distinctive - it wasn't boring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{somewhat}} supported President Johnson's plan of Reconstruction. In 1866 Lee counseled southerners not {{to resume}} fighting, of which Grant <b>said</b> <b>Lee</b> was [...] "setting {{an example of}} forced acquiescence so grudging and pernicious in its effects as to be hardly realized". Lee joined with Democrats in opposing the Radical Republicans who demanded punitive measures against the South, distrusted its commitment to {{the abolition of slavery}} and, indeed, distrusted the region's loyalty to the United States. Lee supported a system of free public schools for blacks, but forthrightly opposed allowing blacks to vote. [...] "My own opinion is that, at this time, they [...] cannot vote intelligently, and that giving them the [...] would lead to a great deal of demagogism, and lead to embarrassments in various ways," [...] Lee stated. Emory Thomas says Lee had become a suffering Christ-like icon for ex-Confederates. President Grant invited him to the White House in 1869, and he went. Nationally he became an icon of reconciliation between the North and South, and the reintegration of former Confederates into the national fabric.|$|E
