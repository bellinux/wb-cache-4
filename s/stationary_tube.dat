40|$|The ram {{accelerator}} is a propulsive device that accelerates projectiles using gasdynamic cycles {{similar to those}} which generate thrust in airbreathing ramjets. The projectile, analogous to the centerbody of a ramjet, travels supersonically through a <b>stationary</b> <b>tube</b> containing a gaseous fuel and oxidizer mixture. The projectile itself carries no onboard propellant. A combustion zone follows the projectile and stabilizes the shock structure. The resulting pressure distribution continuously accelerates the projectile. Several modes of {{ram accelerator}} operation have been investigated experimentally and theoretically. At velocities below the Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) detonation speed of the propellant mixture, the thermally choked propulsion mode accelerates the projectiles. At projectile velocities between approximately 90 and 110 percent of the C-J speed, a transdetonative propulsion mode occurs. At velocities beyond 110 percent of the C-J speed, projectiles experience superdetonative propulsion. This paper presents recent experimental results from these propulsion modes obtained with the University of Washington's 38 -mm bore ram accelerator.

40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis is performed to study thermal transport phenomena in gas flow through a strongly heated tube whose axis is {{in parallel with}} the rotational axis. The velocity and temperature fields prevail when fluid flows in a rotating tube with uniform heat flux on the tube wall. The two-equation k-ω turbulence and t 2 ¯-εt heat transfer models are employed to determine turbulent viscosity and eddy diffusivity for heat, respectively. The governing boundary-layer equations are discritized {{by means of a}} control volume finitedifference techniques. It is found that the Coriolis and centrifugal (or centripetal) forces cause fluid flow and heat transfer performance in the parallel-rotation system to be drastically different from those in the stationary case. Consequently, even if a tube rotating around a parallel axis is heated with high heat flux whose level causes a laminarizing flow in the <b>stationary</b> <b>tube</b> case, both the turbulent kinetic energy and the temperature variance remain over the pipe cross section, resulting in the suppression of an attenuation in heat transfer performance. In other words, an increase in tube rotation suppresses laminarization of gas flow...|$|E

Another advantage is a possibility to conduct selective excitation in order to excite some minor elements without exciting the major ones.

The phenomena encountered are investigated for steady, hydrodynamically and thermally fully developed laminar flow in circular tubes. A full second-order perturbation solution is obtained {{under the condition that}} the wall heat flux is uniform with peripherally uniform wall temperature. The results cover both the nature of flow transitions and the effect of these transitions on temperature distribution, friction factor and Nusselt number. When the rotation is {{in the same direction as}} the main flow imposed by a pressure gradient and the fluid is heated, the flow and heat transfer remain similar to those observed in <b>stationary</b> curved <b>tubes,</b> radially rotating straight tubes or mixed convection in <b>stationary</b> straight <b>tubes.</b> There are, however, quantitative changes due to the combined effects of centrifugal, Coriolis and buoyancy forces. A more complex behaviour is possible when the rotation is opposite to the flow due to the pressure gradient or when the fluid is cooled.

The flow reversal occurs by passing through a four-cell vortex flow region where overall, the centrifugal, Coriolis and buoyancy forces just neutralize each other.

The ram accelerator is a high velocity ramjet-in-tube projectile launcher whose principle of operation {{is similar to that}} of an airbreathing ramjet. The subcaliber projectile travels supersonically through a <b>stationary</b> <b>tube</b> filled with a premixed combustible gas mixture. In the thermally choked propulsion mode subsonic combustion takes place behind the base of the projectile and leads to thermal choking, which stabilizes a normal shock system on the projectile, thus producing forward thrust. Projectiles with masses in the 45 - 90 g range have been accelerated to velocities up to 2650 m/sec in a 38 mm bore, 16 m long accelerator tube. Operation of the ram accelerator is started by injecting the projectile into the accelerator tube at velocities in the 700 - 1300 m/sec range by means of a conventional gas gun. A specially designed obturator, which seals the bore of the gun during this initial acceleration, enters the ram accelerator together with the projectile. The interaction of the obturator with the propellant gas ignites the gas mixture and establishes stable combustion behind the projectile...|$|E

To achieve this, the behaviour of MOSFETs under kilovoltage x-ray irradiation first needed to be investigated. A dose-to-dose reproducibility of 4. 5 %, and a mean change in sensitivity response of 10. 4 % with accumulated dose were measured. A Monte Carlo model of the x-ray source of a PQ 5000 CT simulator was built and validated in order to investigate the MOSFET response characteristics and perform dose calculations. An over-response of 10 % was observed when the beam energy was decreased from 140 to 80 kVp, and a slight anisotropy of 8. 5 % from the mean value over 360 º was observed. The dosimeters were calibrated on a solid water phantom using a method involving MC surface dose calculations. Good agreement was found between measurements and simulations of surface dose on a cylindrical PMMA phantom for a <b>stationary</b> <b>tube</b> technique, single axial scan and multiple contiguous axial scans, with generally less than 7. 5 % discrepancies.

The {{ram accelerator}} is a chemically propelled, impulsive mass launch system capable of efficiently accelerating relatively large masses from velocities of 0. 7 km/sec to 10 km/sec. The principles of propulsion are based on those of a conventional supersonic air-breathing ramjet; however the device operates in a somewhat different manner. The payload carrying vehicle resembles the center-body of the ramjet and accelerates through a <b>stationary</b> <b>tube</b> which acts as the outer cowling. The tube is filled with premixed gaseous fuel and oxidizer mixtures that burn {{in the vicinity of}} the vehicle's base, producing a thrust which accelerates the vehicle through the tube. This study examines the requirement for placing a 2000 kg vehicle into a 500 km circular orbit with a minimum amount of on-board rocket propellant for orbital maneuvers. The goal is to achieve a 50 pct payload mass fraction. The proposed design requirements have several self-imposed constraints that define the vehicle and tube configurations. Structural considerations on the vehicle and tube wall dictate an upper acceleration limit of 1000 g's and a tube inside diameter of 1. 0 m. In-tube propulsive requirements and vehicle structural constraints result in a vehicle diameter of 0. 76 m, a total length of 7. 5 m and a nose-cone half angle of 7 degrees.

40|$|The two {{principal}} areas of advanced propulsion investigated are the ram accelerator and the flowing gas radiation heater. The {{concept of the}} ram accelerator {{is presented as a}} hypervelocity launcher for large-scale aeroballistic range applications in hypersonics and aerothermodynamics research. The ram accelerator is an in-bore ramjet device in which a projectile shaped like the centerbody of a supersonic ramjet is propelled in a <b>stationary</b> <b>tube</b> filled with a tailored combustible gas mixture. Combustion on and behind the projectile generates thrust which accelerates it to very high velocities. The acceleration can be tailored for the 'soft launch' of instrumented models. The distinctive reacting flow phenomena that have been observed in the ram accelerator are relevant to the aerothermodynamic processes in airbreathing hypersonic propulsion systems and are useful for validating sophisticated CFD codes. The recently demonstrated scalability of the device and the ability to control the rate of acceleration offer unique opportunities {{for the use of the}} ram accelerator as a large-scale hypersonic ground test facility. The flowing gas radiation receiver is a novel concept for using solar energy to heat a working fluid for space power or propulsion. Focused solar radiation is absorbed directly in a working gas, rather than by heat transfer through a solid surface. Previous theoretical analysis had demonstrated that radiation trapping reduces energy loss compared to that of blackbody receivers, and enables higher efficiencies and higher peak temperatures. An experiment was carried out to measure the temperature profile of an infrared-active gas and demonstrate the effect of radiation trapping. The success of this effort validates analytical models of heat transfer in this receiver, and confirms the potential of this approach for achieving high efficiency space power and propulsion...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCollections of motors {{dynamically}} organize {{to extract}} membrane tubes. These tubes grow but often pause or change direction as they traverse an underlying microtubule (MT) network. In vitro, membrane tubes also stall: they stop growing in length despite {{a large group}} of motors available at the tip to pull them forward. In these <b>stationary</b> membrane <b>tubes</b> in vitro, we find that clusters of processive kinesin motors form and reach the tip of the tube at regular time intervals. The average times between cluster arrivals depends on the time over which motors depart from the tip, suggesting that motors are recycled toward the tip. Numerical simulations of the motor dynamics in the membrane tube and on the MTs show that the presence of cooperative binding between motors quantitatively accounts for the clustering observed experimentally. Cooperative binding along the length of the MT and a nucleation point at a distance behind the tip define the recycling period. Based on comparison of the numerical results and experimental data, we estimate a cooperative binding probability and concentration regime where the recycling phenomenon occurs...|$|R

These four parameters were varied over ranges which are typical of advanced gas turbine engine operating conditions. It was found that both Coriolis and buoyancy effects must be considered in turbine blade cooling designs and that the effect of rotation on the heat transfer coefficients was markedly different depending on the flow direction.
