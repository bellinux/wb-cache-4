5|$|Coniferous trees such {{as black}} spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> is most abundant and Norway maple is common.

5|$|Subsequent ashfall from eruptions in the Cascade Range in {{the late}} Miocene contributed to the Mascall Strata, layers of stream-deposited {{volcanic}} tuffs laid atop the Picture Gorge Basalt. Preserved in the Mascall are fossils of animals such as horses, camels, rhinoceroses, bears, pronghorn, deer, weasels, raccoons, cats, dogs, and sloths. These fauna thrived in the monument's open woodland and savannah between 15 and 12million years ago. The fossils of oak, <b>sycamore,</b> <b>maple,</b> ginkgo, and elm trees reflect the area's cool climate during this time period.|$|E
25|$|Deciduous {{trees are}} dominant, with the beech, linden, European ash, and <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> being most widespread. The Little Carpathians PLA {{is the only}} place in Slovakia where some plants grow, for example, Ruscus hypoglossum and Rhamnus saxatilis. Insects include 700 species of {{butterflies}} and 20 species of ants. Notable species of birds are represented by the rock thrush, northern wheatear, black stork, European honey buzzard, short-toed eagle, Eurasian eagle-owl, long-eared owl, and European nightjar. The Landscape Area is home to the largest population of the saker falcon in Slovakia.|$|E

25|$|A modern beginner's bassoon is {{generally}} made of maple, with medium-hardness types such as <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> and sugar maple preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of {{materials such as}} polypropylene and ebonite, primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons {{were made in the}} past but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The bore of the bassoon is conical, like that of the oboe and the saxophone, and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected {{at the bottom of the}} instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and tone holes are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the axis of the bore, which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with hard rubber along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also stained and varnished. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of metal, plastic or ivory. The joints between sections consist of a tenon fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.|$|E
500|$|Acer pseudoplatanus, {{known as}} the {{sycamore}} in the United Kingdom and the <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> in the United States, [...] is a flowering plant species in the soapberry and [...] lychee family Sapindaceae. It is a large deciduous, broad-leaved tree, tolerant of wind and coastal exposure. It is native to Central Europe and Western Asia, from France eastwards to Ukraine, northern Turkey and the Caucasus [...] and southwards {{in the mountains of}} northern Spain and Italy.|$|E
500|$|The {{opposite}} of homologous organs are analogous organs which do similar jobs in two taxa {{that were not}} present in their last common ancestor but rather evolved separately. For example, the wings of insects and birds evolved independently in widely separated groups, and converged functionally to support powered flight, so they are analogous. Similarly, {{the wings of a}} <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> seed and the wings of a bird are analogous but not homologous, as they develop from quite different structures. A structure can be homologous at one level, but only analogous at another. Pterosaur, bird and bat wings are analogous as wings, but homologous as forelimbs because the organ served as a forearm (not a wing) in the last common ancestor of tetrapods, and evolved in different ways in the three groups. Thus, in the pterosaurs, the [...] "wing" [...] involves both the forelimb and the hindlimb. Analogy is called homoplasy in cladistics, and convergent or parallel evolution in evolutionary biology.|$|E
