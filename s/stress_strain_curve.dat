40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new {{measuring}} method {{for a new}} method of measuring for the <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>curve</b> under multi axial stress condition was developed and by means of this special measuring gadget the influence on the forming behaviour und hardening behaviour was investigated. Especially the availability {{for use of the}} laser-optics in practice was examined. The laser-optics, consisting of a measuring head with several laser beam apparatuses and a CCD-camera, were used together with an Erichsen-Sheet-Test-Machine for the bulge-test. All functions could be controlled automatically by means of an especially developed Software. The results gained from the laser-optics method prove the independence of the <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>curve</b> in relation to the orientation of the sample and the measuring drection and the level of the punch velocity. By means of a suitable method of comparing the adequate exactitude of this method could be proven. A fundamental-grundlegend part of this thesis deals with the reproducibility of the laser-optics-method, which was scrutinized in parallel tests with different drawing dies. It turned out that the <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>curve</b> showed a very good correspondence of the process, whereas the fracture effective strain could not be determined accurately. The possibility of determining the stress strain- and handening curves at very high deformation degree is to be considered as a great advantage of this method compared to the conventional flat tensile test. By using different tools a more realistic material testing under multi axial stress condition can be established as well. Another starting-point was the influence of the stress state on formability and hardening behaviour of the examined steels. Various steels showed various fracture effective strains and deformation ratios using the same drawing dies. While the fracture effective strain decreased significantly during the transition from the pure stretch forming- to the plane strain state, the position of the <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>curve</b> did not show any influence. Compared with the flat tensile test it became obvious that the <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>curve</b> of the bulge-test showed a lower position and a more hardening...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{studies the}} NGI-ADP soil model, which can realistically {{simulate}} the anisotropic undrained <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> responses and undrained shear strengths of clays. The model requires direct input parameters of undrained shear strengths and failure shear strains, including triaxial compression test, triaxial extension test and direct simple shear. However, parametric studies {{in this paper}} clearly show that trial-and-error testing of some input parameters is {{necessary in order to}} determine the optimal set of input parameters. The paper proposes the equations of anisotropic <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>curves</b> of this soil model and the technique of soil parameter optimization so that the optimal set of input parameters can be determined automatically and efficiently. The technique of soil parameter optimization is based on the statistical approach of least squares where proposed <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>curves</b> are used to compute model predictions. Finally, the proposed technique of soil parameter optimization of the NGI-ADP model is employed to determine the optimal set of input parameters for Bangkok soft clay...|$|R

As {{they are}} subjected to different loading conditions, compressive membrane forces develop causing failure due to compressive stability. In order that the shells perform their design function adequately, sufficient design margins should exist. These design margins are established by means of experimental tests and numerical analysis. Comparisons between classical, theoretical and experimental results for spherical shells subjected to external pressure loading demonstrated large discrepancies. These discrepancies are attributable to material and geometric imperfections resulting from fabrication methods.;Sufficient design information {{with respect to the}} imperfections is required to perform numerical analyses. The present study addresses these concerns with regard to three commonly occurring loading types, viz., external pressure, gradient loading and a ring loaded axisymmetric penetration.;The material imperfections were modeled by a <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>curve</b> derived from test results or by a cold bending simulation. For each of the loading cases, the perfect shell behavior was initially investigated.

If a material consists of two or more phases or components {{it is very difficult to}} predict the properties like mechanical and other properties based on simple laws such as rule of mixtures. Titanium alloys are capable of producing different microstructures when it subjected to heat treatments, so much of money and time are squandering to study the effect of microstructure on mechanical properties of titanium alloys. This squandering can be reduced with the help of modeling and optimization techniques.
