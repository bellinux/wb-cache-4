5|$|As the 1992 Kansas City Chiefs season began, the team's {{first big}} move was {{the signing of}} quarterback Dave Krieg to compete with DeBerg and Vlasic. A couple weeks after Krieg's signing, DeBerg signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, leaving Vlasic as the primary backup to Krieg. The Chiefs went into {{training}} camp {{and went through the}} preseason with Krieg, Vlasic, and rookie draft pick Matt Blundin. Krieg ended up playing every <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> the season, leaving both Vlasic without a year's worth of playing time as his contract expired. The trading of Joe Montana to the Chiefs put a definitive end to Vlasic's time in Kansas City.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} team must {{line up in}} a legal formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> the ball.|$|E
5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} photographs from the film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E

5|$|On September 12, 1951, Medical Corpsman Serrano {{was serving}} with the 3rd Battalion, Seventh Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), in Korea. The Battalion came under heavy enemy attack and fearlessly dashed through the heavy enemy fire {{to reach a}} wounded Marine, he accidentally tripped the wire of a hidden anti-personnel mine. Hearing the <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> the fuse primer, and realizing that his wounded comrade lay {{helpless}} beside the deadly explosive, he courageously and with complete disregard for his own personal safety threw himself on the man to shield him from the explosion. Although he was seriously wounded {{in the back and}} legs by fragments, and was blown several feet by the concussion, he crawled back to his comrade and administered first aid to him. Although suffering severe pain from his multiple wounds, he refused to seek medical aid for himself until he had completed treatment of his comrade, and then, refusing a stretcher, crawled part of the way to the aid station.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

25|$|As he {{got close}} enough, he {{suddenly}} made a leap and captured the king single-handedly, holding the king under his arm, meanwhile threatening {{to kill the}} king {{if there was any}} attempt of rescue. A little <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> the neck would cause fatality to the King, considering Pu Tong Seal's size, ferocity, and strength. The Burman soldiers wisely retreated at the command of Pu Tong Seal, because of fear of losing their beloved king.|$|E
25|$|The sand {{tiger shark}} is a nocturnal feeder. During the day, they take shelter near rocks, overhangs, caves and reefs often at {{relatively}} shallow depths (<20 m). This is the typical environment where divers encounter sand tigers, hovering just above the bottom in large sandy gutters and caves. However, at night they leave the shelter and hunt over the ocean bottom, often ranging far from their shelter. Sand tigers hunt by stealth. It is the only shark known to gulp air and store it in the shark's stomach, allowing the shark to maintain near-neutral buoyancy which helps it to hunt motionlessly and quietly. Aquarium observations indicate {{that when it comes}} close enough to a prey item, it grabs with a quick sideways <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> the prey. The {{sand tiger shark}} has been observed to gather in hunting groups when preying upon large schools of fish.|$|E

25|$|Having {{the ball}} to start the second half, the Patriots moved to the Jets' 34-yard line on four plays, but on a {{subsequent}} 12-yard Watson reception, the tight end fumbled as he was being tackled by linebacker Eric Barton; the loose ball was recovered by safety Kerry Rhodes and returned 11 yards to the Jets' 33-yard line. However, two sacks of Favre by Wilfork and Seymour, both for losses of nine yards, forced the Jets into their second three-and-out series of the night. Cassel was sacked on the next play, but four plays later, the Patriots had a first down from the Jets' 38-yard line. Patriots center Dan Koppen, who had left the game with an injury {{in the second quarter}} but later returned, snapped the ball while Cassel was making adjustments at the line and was not ready to receive the snap. Cassel chased the Koppen fumble and recovered it at the Patriots' 38-yard line for a loss of 24 yards. The Patriots, later facing 4th-and-21, punted to give the Jets the ball at their own 16-yard line. A Jets punt was followed by an exchange of three-and-outs, eventually setting up a Patriots drive to begin from their own 22-yard line. A 29-yard Welker reception put the Patriots in Jets territory; five plays later, Watson caught a 10-yard touchdown pass, his first of the year, cutting the Jets' lead to 24–19. On the final <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> the third quarter, the Patriots attempted a two-point conversion and succeeded; the Gaffney catch put the Patriots to within a field goal, trailing 24–21.|$|E
500|$|As much as VanDerWerff liked [...] "Rolling in the Deep", he {{felt the}} return of Jesse and its {{resulting}} storyline [...] "was a mess" [...] and [...] "just didn't work". Canning was little moved by the drama surrounding Jesse and Rachel, or the resulting brawl and slap, and Brown thought these developments [...] "lacked any real emotional stakes, and seemed tonally inconsistent with the snarky <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> {{the rest of the}} episode". VanDerWerff found the otherwise excellent final segment marred by Quinn's regression to a [...] "generic bitchy cheerleader" [...] stereotype, which he was saddened by as Agron is among his favorite Glee performers.|$|E

While talking to Dean, who unsuccessfully begs him {{to give up the}} power, Sam sneaks up behind them and attempts to kill him with an angelic blade by stabbing Castiel in the back, but it has no effect. Castiel removes the blade, explains that he is no longer an angel, declaring himself their new God. He then glances at the three hunters before delivering an ultimatum: to profess their own loyalty and love unto him, or be destroyed.|$|E

Ocean posted a <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> Beyoncé in his studio on Twitter, fuelling reports that he had worked with Beyoncé on the new record. As well as posting a picture of Beyoncé recording new material, he also accompanied the image with the comment: [...] "This is the room i am working in this day. not to brag but man, this is surreal. like [...] she is singing my songs.

500|$|Percussive {{effects in}} {{imitation}} of drumming had been introduced to bowed-string instruments by early in the 17th century. The earliest known use of col legno (tapping on the strings {{with the back of}} the bow) is found in Tobias Hume's First Part of Ayres for unaccompanied viola da gamba (1605), in a piece titled Harke, Harke. Carlo Farina, an Italian violinist active in Germany, also used col legno to mimic the sound of a drum in his Capriccio stravagante for four stringed instruments (1627), where he also used devices such as glissando, tremolo, pizzicato, and sul ponticello to imitate the noises of barnyard animals (cat, dog, chicken). Later in the century, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, in certain movements of Battalia (1673), added to these effects the device of placing a sheet of paper under the A string of the double bass, in order to imitate the dry rattle of a snare drum, and in [...] "Die liederliche Gesellschaft von allerley Humor" [...] from the same programmatic battle piece, superimposed eight different melodies in different keys, producing in places dense orchestral clusters. He also uses the percussive <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> fortissimo pizzicato to represent gunshots.|$|E

Have patience and stick with the Birds and root for the Birds." [...] After the Orioles lost six consecutive games {{to begin the}} 1988 season, Ripken was fired. Several years later, he said, [...] "It {{was very difficult to}} accept. I had been in the organization. I had worked my way up to the big leagues. I spent my life with the Orioles." [...] The move [...] "hurt" [...] and [...] "bothered" [...] Cal Jr., but he worked through it and remained with the team for 13 more seasons, the rest of his career. Billy switched his number from 3 to 7, saying, [...] "I just didn't want to see anybody else wear it." [...] After Hall of Famer Frank Robinson replaced Ripken, the Orioles proceeded to lose 15 more consecutive games to set the record for the longest losing streak to start a season. He finished his managerial record with a record of 68 wins and 101 losses.|$|E

500|$|Comics scholar Arnold T. Blumberg {{places the}} end of the Silver Age in June 1973, when Gwen Stacy, girlfriend of Peter Parker (Spider-Man) was killed in a story arc later dubbed [...] "The Night Gwen Stacy Died", saying the era of [...] "innocence" [...] was ended by [...] "the 'snap' heard round the comic book world — the startling, sickening <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> bone that heralded the death of Gwen Stacy." [...] Silver Age {{historian}} Craig Shutt disputes this, saying, [...] "Gwen Stacy's death shocked Spider-Man readers. Such a tragedy makes a strong symbolic ending. This theory gained adherents when Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross' Marvels miniseries in 1994 ended with Gwen's death, but I'm not buying it. It's too late. Too many new directions — especially [...] Conan and monsters [...] — were on firm ground by this time." [...] He also dismisses {{the end of}} the 12-cent comic book, which went to 15 cents as the industry standard in early 1969, noting that the 1962 hike from 10 cents to 12 cents had no bearing in this regard. Shutt's line comes with Fantastic Four #102 (Sept. 1970), Jack Kirby's last regular-run issue before the artist left to join DC Comics; this combines with DC's Superman #229 (Aug. 1970), editor Mort Weisinger's last before retiring.|$|E
500|$|Small Heath {{opened their}} second {{season in the}} Football League with a visit to Walsall, who were playing at Wednesbury because their new ground was not yet ready. Former Small Heath full-back Tom Bayley {{was one of several}} {{newcomers}} for the hosts, but their visitors had few changes in personnel. Teddy Jolley came in at full-back, and replacing Billy Walton was Jack Lee, who [...] "dribbles cleverly, and is a very dangerous forward round goal". In the presence of 4,000 spectators, Lee scored twice as Small Heath won 3–1. Fred Wheldon opened the scoring for Small Heath in the first 30seconds of their next match, at home to Rotherham Town; 15minutes later the visitors were 3–2 ahead, but by half-time the home side had regained the lead. Unsurprisingly the tempo dropped in the second half, but a game played in a [...] "friendly and sportsmanlike spirit" [...] was marred towards the end by Rotherham forward Alf Pickering suffering a fracture of his right leg just below the knee in an accidental collision with Bernard Pumfrey, [...] "the <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> the bone being heard all round the ground". Initial reports suggested the break was such that he was [...] "almost certain" [...] never to play football again. This was followed by a comfortable 6–1 defeat of Burton Swifts, in which Jolley moved to inside right in Jack Hallam's absence through illness, giving Gilbert Smith his debut at full back.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Point of No Return", Castiel helps Sam to keep Dean from {{becoming}} Michael's vessel. He leaves after hearing {{a signal from}} the angels, and finds a resurrected Adam Milligan – Sam and Dean's half-brother who had been previously killed by ghouls. When Dean escapes and tries to contact the angels, Castiel finds him, and angrily attacks him for making Castiel's rebelling against Heaven worthless. Later, he carves a banishing sigil into his own chest and activates it {{in the presence of}} multiple angels in order to clear the way for Sam and Dean to attack Zachariah and save Adam. The effects of the sigil send him onto a fishing boat, now completely human. Despite his lack of power, he is able to defeat the Horseman Pestilence using what appears to be what little is left of his angelic strength, and assists Bobby and Sam in preventing nationwide distribution of the Croatoan virus. In the fifth-season finale, [...] "Swan Song", Castiel loses faith after Sam fails to overpower Lucifer when he possesses him and suggests they get drunk and wait for the end to come. When Dean refuses to give up, Castiel and Bobby follow him and Castiel uses a Molotov cocktail of Holy Fire to temporarily banish Michael to buy Dean time to try to reach Sam. [...] Angry that Castiel attacked his brother, Lucifer obliterates Castiel with a <b>snap</b> <b>of</b> his fingers. After Sam and Dean avert the Apocalypse, Castiel is resurrected once more by God, now more powerful than ever. [...] He heals Dean's injuries and resurrects Bobby and reminds Dean that he got what he wanted: no Apocalypse, no Paradise, just more of the same. [...] Castiel then heads back to Heaven to restore order and become its new leader, believing it to be in chaos as Sam trapped Michael in Lucifer's Cage as well.|$|E
