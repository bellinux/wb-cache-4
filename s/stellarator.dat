25|$|A <b>stellarator</b> is {{a device}} used to confine a hot plasma with {{magnetic}} fields {{in order to}} sustain a controlled nuclear fusion reaction. It is the earliest controlled fusion device. In 1951, American astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer recommended that the United States Atomic Energy Commission commence containing and harnessing nuclear fusion of hydrogen at temperatures exceeding those at the Sun's surface. To do this, Spitzer invented a plasma confinement configuration device called the <b>stellarator.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stellarator: Twisted {{rings of}} hot plasma. The <b>stellarator</b> {{attempts}} {{to create a}} natural twist plasma path, using external magnets, while tokamaks create those magnetic fields using an internal current. Stellarators were developed by Lyman Spitzer in 1950 and have four designs: Torsatron, Heliotron, Heliac and Helias. One example is Wendelstein 7-X, a German fusion device that produced its first plasma on December 10, 2015. It is the world's largest <b>stellarator,</b> designed to investigate the suitability {{of this type of}} device for a power station.|$|E
25|$|Flux loop A loop of wire is {{inserted}} into the magnetic field. As the field passes through the loop, a current is made. The current is measured and used to find the total magnetic flux through that loop. This has been used on the National Compact <b>Stellarator</b> Experiment, the polywell and the LDX machines.|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} confinement {{properties of}} <b>stellarators</b> are analyzed for the neo-classical transport and the magnetic well. Three typical concepts of <b>stellarators</b> (LHD, Wendelstein 7 -X and TJ-II) are compared {{in terms of}} the helical movement of cross sections of the last closed magnetic surface. It is shown that this geometric element strongly determines the confinement properties of both non-planar axis and planar axis <b>stellarators...</b>|$|R
40|$|The global gyrokinetic {{toroidal}} code (GTC) {{has been}} recently upgraded to do simulations in non-axisymmetric equilibrium configuration, such as <b>stellarators.</b> Linear simulation of ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven instabilities {{has been done}} in Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) and Large Helical Device (LHD) <b>stellarators</b> using GTC. Several results are discussed to study characteristics of ITG in <b>stellarators,</b> including toroidal grids convergence, nmodes number convergence, poloidal and parallel spectrums, and electrostatic potential mode structure on flux surface...|$|R
5000|$|However, due to non-axisymmetric {{nature of}} the fields, {{conventional}} <b>stellarators</b> have a combination of toroidal and helical modulation of the magnetic field lines that leads to high transport of plasma out of the confinement volume at fusion relevant conditions. This large transport in conventional <b>stellarators</b> can limit their performance as a fusion reactor.|$|R
25|$|When {{the meeting}} concluded, {{most of the}} {{researchers}} quickly turned out papers saying why Teller's concerns {{did not apply to}} their particular device. The pinch machines did not use magnetic fields in this way at all, while the mirror and <b>stellarator</b> seemed to have various ways out. This was soon followed by a paper by Martin David Kruskal and Martin Schwarzschild discussing pinch machines, however, which demonstrated instabilities in those devices were inherent to the design.|$|E
25|$|Spitzer {{had planned}} an {{aggressive}} development project of four machines, A, B, C, and D. A and B were small research devices, C {{would be the}} prototype of a power-producing machine, and D would be the prototype of a commercial device. A worked without issue, but even by the time B was being used it was clear the <b>stellarator</b> was also suffering from instabilities and plasma leakage. Progress on C slowed as {{attempts were made to}} correct for these problems.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, fusion {{researchers}} have investigated various confinement concepts. The early {{emphasis was on}} three main systems: z-pinch, <b>stellarator</b> and magnetic mirror. The current leading designs are the tokamak and inertial confinement (ICF) by laser. Both designs are being built at very large scales, most notably the ITER tokamak in France, and the National Ignition Facility laser in the USA. Researchers are also studying other designs that may offer cheaper approaches. Among these alternatives there is increasing interest in magnetized target fusion and inertial electrostatic confinement.|$|E
40|$|A {{key issue}} for compact <b>stellarators</b> is the {{stability}} of beta-limiting MHD modes, such as external kink modes driven by bootstrap current and pressure gradient. We report here recent progress in MHD stability studies for low-aspect-ratio Quasi-Axisymmetric <b>Stellarators</b> (QAS) and Quasi-Omnigeneous <b>Stellarators</b> (QOS). We find that the N = 0 periodicity-preserving vertical mode is significantly more stable in <b>stellarators</b> than in tokamaks because of the externally generated rotational transform. It is shown that both low-n external kink modes and high-n ballooning modes can be stabilized at high beta by appropriate 3 D shaping without a conducting wall. The stabilization mechanism for external kink modes in QAS {{appears to be an}} enhancement of local magnetic shear due to 3 D shaping. The stabilization of ballooning mode in QOS is related to a shortening of the normal curvature connection length...|$|R

40|$|The MHD {{stability}} of quasi-axisymmetric compact <b>stellarators</b> is investigated. It is shown that bootstrap current driven external kink modes can be stabilized {{by a combination}} of edge magnetic shear and appropriate 3 D plasma boundary shaping while maintaining good quasi-axisymmetry. The results demonstrate that there exists a new class of <b>stellarators</b> with quasi-axisymmetry, large bootstrap current, high MHD beta limit, and compact size...|$|R
25|$|Magnetic Loops Another {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement is {{to bend the}} field lines back on themselves, either in circles or more commonly in nested toroidal surfaces. The most highly developed system of this type is the tokamak, with the <b>stellarator</b> being next most advanced, followed by the Reversed field pinch. Compact toroids, especially the Field-Reversed Configuration and the spheromak, attempt to combine the advantages of toroidal magnetic surfaces with those of a simply connected (non-toroidal) machine, resulting in a mechanically simpler and smaller confinement area.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{stabilising}} {{force was}} lower than the force available in the pinch, it lasted considerably longer. It appeared that a reactor could be built that would approach the Lawson criterion from a different direction; through extended confinement times rather than increased density. This {{was similar to the}} <b>stellarator</b> approach in concept, and although it would have lower field strength than those machines, the energy needed to maintain the confinement was much lower. Today this approach is known as the reversed field pinch (RFP) and has been a field of continued study.|$|E
25|$|Spitzer's idea won {{funding and}} he began work on the <b>stellarator</b> under the code name Project Matterhorn. His work led to the {{creation}} of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Tuck returned to LANL and arranged local funding to build his machine. By this time, however, it was clear that all of the pinch machines were suffering from the same issues involving stability, and progress stalled. In 1953, Tuck and others suggested a number of solutions to the stability problems. This led to the design of a second series of pinch machines, led by the UK ZETA and Sceptre devices.|$|E
40|$|Stability {{results for}} high-n ideal local {{pressure-driven}} instabilities (ballooning and interchange modes) are {{calculated from the}} COBRA and TERPSICHORE codes and compared for several low aspect ratio <b>stellarators.</b> Such a comparison is important because of the predominant roles that these codes are playing {{in the design of}} compact <b>stellarators</b> at several laboratories around the world.

40|$|Instabilities of the Alfven {{eigenmodes}} (AEs) {{that can}} be driven by circulating energetic ions in optimized <b>stellarators</b> of the Wendelstein line (Helias configurations) are considered. It is stressed that the Alfven instabilities in <b>stellarators</b> may considerably differ from those in tokamaks because specific Alfven eigenmodes and specific resonances of the wave-particle interaction appear when magnetic configurations are non- axisymmetric. An important role of the continuum damping in low-shear <b>stellarators</b> is revealed. Aimed to calculate the continuum damping, a set of resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, which generalize the ideal MHD AE equations obtained in Kolesnichenko et al (Kolesnichenko Ya. I. et al 2001 Phys. Plasmas 8 491), is derived. The derived equations are solved numerically to investigate the damping of the AEs of global character in a Helias reactor...|$|R
40|$|The maximum-J (J is {{the second}} {{adiabatic}} invariant) capability, i. e., the drift reversal capability, is examined in quasi-axisymmetric (QAS) <b>stellarators</b> and quasi-poloidally symmetric (QPS) <b>stellarators</b> as a possible mechanism for turbulent transport suppression. Due {{to the existence of}} non-axisymmetry of the magnetic field strength in QAS configurations, a local maximum of J is created to cause the drift reversal. The increase of magnetic shear in finite beta ezuilibria also has favorable effect in realizing the drift reversal. The radial variation of the uniform magnetic field component plays a crucial role for the drift reversal in a QPS configuration. Thus, the drift reversal capability and its external controllability are demonstrated for QAS and QPS <b>stellarators,</b> by which the impact of magnetic configuration on turbulent transport can be studied in experiments. ...|$|R
25|$|In July 1954, the AERE was reorganised {{into the}} United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Modifications to Harwell's Hangar 7 {{in order to}} house the machine began that year. Despite its {{advanced}} design, the price tag was modest: about US$1million. By late 1956 {{it was clear that}} ZETA was going to come online in mid-1957, beating the Model C <b>stellarator</b> and the newest versions of the Perhapsatron and Columbus. Because these projects were secret, based on the little information available the press concluded they were versions of the same conceptual device, and that the British were far ahead in the race to produce a working machine.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1960s ZETA was not {{the only}} {{experiment}} to suffer from unexpected performance problems. Problems with plasma diffusion across the magnetic fields plagued both the magnetic mirror and <b>stellarator</b> programs, at rates that classical theory could not address. Adding more fields did not appear to correct the problems in any of the existing designs. Work slowed dramatically as teams around the world tried to better understand the physics of the plasmas in their devices. Pfirsch and Schluter were the first to make a significant advance, suggesting that much larger and more powerful machines would be needed to correct these problems. An attitude of pessimism took root across the entire field.|$|E
25|$|The A.D. Sakharov group {{constructed}} the first tokamaks, {{the most successful}} being the T-3 and its larger version T-4. T-4 was tested in 1968 in Novosibirsk, producing the world's first quasistationary fusion reaction. When this were first announced, the international community was highly skeptical. A British team was invited to see T-3, however, and after measuring it in depth they released their results that confirmed the Soviet claims. A burst of activity followed as many planned devices were abandoned and new tokamaks were introduced in their place — the C model <b>stellarator,</b> then under construction after many redesigns, was quickly converted to the Symmetrical Tokamak.|$|E
40|$|In {{the complex}} 3 D {{magnetic}} fields of <b>stellarators,</b> ion-temperature-gradient turbulence {{is shown to}} have two distinct saturation regimes, as revealed by petascale numerical simulations, and explained by a simple turbulence theory. The first regime is marked by strong zonal flows, and matches previous observations in tokamaks. The newly observed second regime, in contrast, exhibits small- scale quasi-two-dimensional turbulence, negligible zonal flows, and, surprisingly, a weaker heat flux scaling. Our findings suggest that key details of the magnetic geometry control turbulence in <b>stellarators.</b> Comment: Erratum added to en...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a European {{transport}} {{project has}} been carried out among several fusion devices for studying the possible link between the mean radial electric field (E-r), long-range correlation (LRC) and edge bifurcations in fusion plasmas. The main results reported in this paper include: (i) the discovery of low-frequency LRCs in potential fluctuations which are amplified during the development of edge mean E-r using electrode biasing and during the spontaneous development of edge sheared flows in <b>stellarators</b> and tokamaks. Evidence of nonlocal energy transfer and the geodesic acoustic mode modulation on local turbulent transport have also been observed. The observed LRCs are consistent with the theory of zonal flows described by a 'predator-prey' model. The results point to a significant link between the LRC and transport bifurcation. (ii) Comparative studies in tokamaks, <b>stellarators</b> and reversed field pinches have revealed significant differences in the level of the LRC. Whereas the LRCs are clearly observed in tokamaks and <b>stellarators,</b> no clear signature of LRCs was seen in the RFX-mod reversed field pinch experiments. These results suggest the possible influence of magnetic perturbations on the LRC, in agreement with recent observations in the resonant magnetic perturbation experiments at the TEXTOR tokamak. (iii) The degree of the LRCs is strongly reduced on approaching the plasma density-limit in tokamaks and <b>stellarators,</b> suggesting the possible role of collisionality or/and the impact of mean E-r x B flow shear on zonal flows...|$|R
40|$|A {{theory of}} Alfvén instabilities {{caused by the}} {{energetic}} ions in helical devices is developed, and specific examples relevant to Wendelstein-line <b>stellarators</b> (W 7 -AS, W 7 -X, a Helias reactor) are considered. In particular, it is shown that in <b>stellarators</b> there exist specific "non-axisymmetric" resonances, which may strongly affect the instabilities, especially, in W 7 -X and the Helias reactor, which are characterized by the rotational transform about unity. These resonances are associated with non-axisymmetric components of the magnetic field strength. Destabilization of Alfvén eigenmodes located in specific gaps of helical devices is studied. The effect of plasma rotation on these instabilities is analysed. The Doppler shift of the eigenmodes characterized by several coupled wave numbers is calculated. Instabilities of Energetic Particle Modes (EPM) are discussed. It is shown {{that the presence of}} "non-axisymmetric" resonances and additional gaps in the Alfvén continuum of <b>stellarators</b> result in a number of new characteristic frequencies of the EPM modes. An explanation of the temporal evolution of MHD (Alfvénic) activity observed in neutral beam experiments on W 7 -AS is suggested...|$|R
25|$|In 1949 an {{expatriate}} German, Ronald Richter, {{proposed the}} Huemul Project in Argentina, announcing positive results in 1951. These {{turned out to}} be fake, but it prompted considerable interest in the concept as a whole. In particular, it prompted Lyman Spitzer to begin considering ways to solve some of the more obvious problems involved in confining a hot plasma, and, unaware of the z-pinch efforts, he developed a new solution to the problem known as the <b>stellarator.</b> Spitzer applied to the US Atomic Energy Commission for funding to build a test device. During this period, Jim Tuck who had worked with the UK teams had been introducing the z-pinch concept to his coworkers at his new job at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). When he heard of Spitzer's pitch for funding, he applied to build a machine of his own, the Perhapsatron.|$|E

500|$|In 1951 Wheeler {{obtained}} {{permission from}} Bradbury {{to set up}} a branch office of the Los Alamos laboratory at Princeton, known as Project Matterhorn, which had two parts. Matterhorn S (for <b>stellarator,</b> another name coined by Wheeler), under Lyman Spitzer, investigated nuclear fusion as a power source. Matterhorn B (for bomb), under Wheeler, engaged in nuclear weapons research. Senior scientists remained disinterested and aloof from the project, so he staffed it with young graduate and post-doctoral students. In January 1953 he was involved in a security breach when he lost a highly classified paper on lithium-6 and the hydrogen bomb design during an overnight train trip. This resulted in Wheeler being given an official reprimand. Matterhorn B's efforts were crowned by the success of the Ivy Mike nuclear test at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific, on November 1, 1953, which Wheeler witnessed. The yield of the Ivy Mike [...] "Sausage" [...] device was reckoned at , about 30 percent higher than Matterhorn B had estimated.

50|$|The goal of {{magnetic}} confinement devices is to minimise energy transport across a magnetic field. Toroidal devices are relatively successful because the magnetic properties {{seen by the}} particles are averaged as they travel around the torus. The strength of the field seen by a particle, however, generally varies, so that some particles will be trapped by the mirror effect. These particles {{will not be able}} to average the magnetic properties so effectively, which will result in increased energy transport. In most <b>stellarators,</b> these changes in field strength are greater than in tokamaks, which is a major reason that transport in <b>stellarators</b> tends to be higher than in tokamaks.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} of two papers about collisionless, {{electrostatic}} micro-instabilities in <b>stellarators,</b> with an emphasis on trapped-particle modes. It is found that, in so-called maximum-$J$ configurations, trapped-particle instabilities are absent in large regions of parameter space. Quasi-isodynamic <b>stellarators</b> have this property (approximately), and the theory predicts that trapped electrons are stabilizing to all eigenmodes with frequencies below the electron bounce frequency. The physical reason is that the bounce-averaged curvature is favorable for all orbits, and that trapped electrons precess in the direction opposite to that in which drift waves propagate, thus precluding wave-particle resonance. These considerations only depend on the electrostatic energy balance, and are independent of all geometric properties of the magnetic field other than the maximum-$J$ condition. However, if the aspect ratio is large and the instability phase velocity differs greatly from the electron and ion thermal speeds, it is possible to derive a variational form for the frequency showing that stability prevails in a yet larger part of parameter space than what follows from the energy argument. Collisionless trapped-electron modes should therefore be more stable in quasi-isodynamic <b>stellarators</b> than in tokamaks. Comment: 9 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem is}} {{analyzed}} {{whether it is}} possible to create net-current-free equilibrium configurations without Pfirsch-Schluter current (j zeta = 0) in conventional <b>stellarators</b> with a planar circular axis. Recently such analysis was presented for the case, when only vertical magnetic field was a control parameter. Here external poloidal field is considered as arbitrary, which must be found from the condition j zeta= 0. It is shown that such suppression of Pfirsch-Schluter current by means of external poloidal field is possible, theoretically, in shear-free systems and in <b>stellarators</b> with l geq 3 only. It can be said also by other words that in ordinary l= 2 <b>stellarators</b> with a shear plasma equilibrium with j zeta = 0 is impossible at any choice of external poloidal field. In these systems, nevertheless, dipole component of Pfirsch-Schluter current can be suppressed or strongly reduced by joint effect of vertical and quadrupole fields. It is shown that in this case phase inversion of Pfirsch-Schluter current current could be obtained at realistic conditions. These results explain, in particular, experimental observations of configurations almost insensitive to plasma pressure in Heliotron E. ...|$|R
