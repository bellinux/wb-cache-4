5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front <b>sprocket</b> <b>shaft</b> was pressed against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus driving the <b>sprocket</b> <b>shaft,</b> the drive chains and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The front sprocket drive shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller {{to move away from}} the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|E
50|$|The clutch and {{flywheel}} {{are mounted}} {{on the back of}} the engine block This part of the clutch is of aluminium and carries a friction surface of leather To make for a more gradual engagement a steel spring is set between the leather and the metal face. It is formed into a ring with projecting tongues which ac t as springs. The large spiral spring to hold the clutch in engagement is stationary. It acts on the fork imparting a sliding motion to the propellor shaft. A ball bearing takes the thrust between fork and the shaft. A long propellor shaft runs from the clutch to the gearbox's first motion shaft. This propellor shaft carries a flexible coupling and is splined to allow longitudinal movement together with the clutch. The gearbox is mounted between the back axle and the <b>sprocket</b> <b>shaft</b> for the chain drive.|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} ways to test {{automotive}} timing chains for wear in a laboratory environment. One novel method proposed by Borg-Warner Morse TEC uses fluid jets striking an impeller blade. The momentum of the oil striking and deflected by the impeller blade is used to produce a torque. This torque is transmitted to the system through the timing chain. A previous theoretical design study (conducted elsewhere) evaluated some of the design factors as they related to machine performance and ultimately to the torque loads applied to the chain. From this theoretical study came the design for two novel bucket and bathtub impeller blades that were predicted to enhance the performance of the machine. This thesis entails the design, manufacturing, and testing of these two new impeller blade designs for comparison with the existing trough shaped blade. In order to test the impeller blades, a data acquisition system was designed utilizing strain gages and slip rings to obtain torque from the spinning system. The tests were run using the existing machine configuration with a crank <b>sprocket</b> <b>shaft</b> speed of 4000 rpm. The jet impingement angles were also modified and the resulting torque generated recorded. The final aspect of the study consisted of installing a variable speed motor onto the machine. Each blade was then run at crank <b>sprocket</b> <b>shaft</b> speeds of 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 rpm. This was done to determine the effects on the maximum and minimum torques and to study jet reformation and system dynamic effects...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] in {{the block}} {{in place of}} the {{camshaft}} was driven by the timing chain and drove the distributor and oil pump in conventional fashion. An additional <b>sprocket</b> on this <b>shaft</b> drove a second [...] "serpentine" [...] timing chain, 6 ft long, which drove both overhead camshafts. The length of this chain made precision timing of the camshafts an issue at high rpms.|$|R
40|$|Described {{here is a}} {{latching}} {{device for}} latching two items together that has a housing and a shaft mounted to one item such that rotation of the <b>shaft</b> by a <b>sprocket</b> causes the <b>shaft</b> to move longitudinally up and down. The shaft has one end extending beyond the housing with an alignment cone attached to this end for engaging a receptor on the other item. A latch mounted to a shaft by a traveling nut provides a pivot point for the latch so that rotation of the shaft causes the pivot point of the latch to translate along the longitudinal axis of the shaft. Camming surfaces and a camming spring are used for rotating the latch so that the latch will engage and disengage a receptor on the other item...|$|R
40|$|The University Alaska Fairbanks Nanook EV {{team has}} {{converted}} another snowmobile to electric power. Our new machine has a 48 km (30 mi) range at 32 km/h (20 mi/h). Building on last year’s success (winning Best Range with our original model), {{we started this}} project with a lighter chassis: a Ski-Doo Tundra 300 F at 167 kg (370 lb), and a stronger motor, a NetGain WarP 7 DC-series motor. The motor is connected directly to the <b>sprocket</b> <b>shaft</b> using two Gates Tri-power BX belts. The accumulator is configured to support 211 V using 396 Headway 10 A·h Lithium-ion cells, which utilize Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO 4) chemistry. This 12. 672 kW·h battery pack is the largest used in any electric snowmobile to date. The batteries are connected to a 249 V Logisystems motor controller to power the motor. The snowmobile is a respectable 295 kg (650 lb). It has {{a top speed of}} 80 km/h (50 mi/h) and it is pretty quiet at 54 dB. This snowmobile is poised to do very well in the competition.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} design, manufacture, {{and testing of}} a motor shaft assembly that is a subcomponent of the drivetrain system in a Formula Electric racecar. The design covers {{detailed analysis of the}} bearing, <b>sprocket,</b> <b>shaft,</b> pins, and spacer created to meet a set of functional requirements. The process of determining these requirements is also covered, along with a set of best practices for thoughtful design in general. An initial phase of testing is covered as well, from the design of the testing apparatus to the execution of a torsional test on the shaft. With limited data, conclusions are hard to draw with certainty, but initial results seem to indicate that the shaft performs as expected. The intent of this document is to serve {{as an example of the}} level of detail and thoroughness that is expected when designing racecar components. To that end, this document should provide a number of unique examples of how specific problems were modeled and addressed in the design. It should also serve as a template for future documentation of such design efforts. by Jack J. Wanderman. Thesis (S. B.)
