40|$|Abstract—In {{traditional}} {{automatic test}} solutions, a <b>test</b> <b>engine</b> usually encompasses all functions in its kernel, including compiling test program, generating test event chain, scheduling test process and executing test events. This makes the engine tightly coupled with test {{language and the}} system under test, {{so that it is}} difficult to maintain, optimize and extend the <b>test</b> <b>engine.</b> In order to solve these problems, a micro-kernel <b>test</b> <b>engine</b> is designed and implemented based on the service oriented architecture. This micro-kernel approach decouples function modules to make the <b>test</b> <b>engine</b> kernel independent of the system under test and the test language. This also makes the <b>test</b> <b>engine</b> more modularized, so that the debugging process and maintenance work of the engine can be much easier. With new compiling component and <b>test</b> adapters, the <b>engine</b> kernel can be extended for new test methods or reused in new test applications.

40|$|Abstract:- With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of software scale and programming languages, {{it is impossible}} to test software manually. The case for automating the software testing process has been made repeatedly and convincingly by numerous testing professionals. Automated tests can promote the efficiency of software testing and then to increase software productivity, improve software quality, and reduce cost in almost all processes of software engineering. White-box testing {{is one of the most}} important software testing strategies that can detect error even when the software specification is vague or incomplete. This paper gives a detailed description of the design and implementation of a <b>testing</b> <b>engine.</b> The <b>testing</b> <b>engine,</b> which is the kernel of a developed structured software-testing tool for the Visual Basic and C/C++ language, mainly consists of three components: program analyzer, source code instrumentation tool and intermediate database. In the <b>testing</b> <b>engine,</b> a block division mechanism and a new block-based CFG model are introduced and some block-based test adequacy criteria are extended. The programs are divided into a sequence of blocks and then instrumented and compiled in the <b>testing</b> <b>engine,</b> and all the information related to the test is saved in the intermediate database. The <b>testing</b> <b>engine,</b> acting as an agency, associates the testing automation module with instrumented executable program rather than the source code, and therefore the testing tool can easily be developed to accommodate new requirements and different testing adequacy criteria. It is also convenient to build a testing environment for multi-languages by modifying the program analyzer only, due to the flexibility of the software architecture...|$|R
40|$|An {{ignition}} source was constructed that {{is capable of}} producing a pulsed corona discharge for the purpose of igniting mixtures in a test chamber. This corona generator is adaptable for use as the {{ignition source}} for one cylinder on a <b>test</b> <b>engine.</b> The first <b>tests</b> were performed in a cylindrical shaped chamber to study the characteristics of the corona and analyze various electrode geometries. Next a test chamber was constructed that closely represented the dimensions of the combustion chamber of the <b>test</b> <b>engine</b> at USC. Combustion tests were performed in this chamber and various electrode diameters and geometries were tested. The data acquisition and control system hardware for the USC engine lab was updated with new equipment. New software was also developed to perform the engine control and data acquisition functions. Work is underway to design a corona electrode that will fit in the new <b>test</b> <b>engine</b> and be capable igniting the mixture in one cylinder at first and eventually in all four cylinders. A <b>test</b> <b>engine</b> was purchased for the project that has two spark plug ports per cylinder.

40|$|We {{are used}} to viewing {{verification}} and validation as tasks to be performed after a knowledge-base is built.

Here, we reverse this order. First, we define a general <b>test</b> <b>engine.</b> Then, we argue that this "test" engine is also a general inference engine. That is, an architecture supporting a generalised <b>test</b> <b>engine</b> subsumes architectures that merely support inference. I. Introduction The knowledge acquisition community {{can be divided into}} a conventional majority and a minority school of thought: ffl In the majority school (e. g.
