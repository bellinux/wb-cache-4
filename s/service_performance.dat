This model is an add-on to a model developed previously by the authors to measure the corporate <b>service</b> quality <b>performance</b> of D/B firms. The project <b>service</b> quality <b>performance</b> model makes use of 10 service quality factors and their relative weights (transferred from the corporate <b>service</b> quality <b>performance</b> model), three components of quality management systems in place in D/B projects (ranked by senior managers in D/B firms) and the relationships between service quality factors and quality system requirements (established by a professional quality system assessor). It uses QFD to calculate a quality performance index. The combined corporate and project <b>service</b> quality <b>performance</b> index can be used by D/B firms to benchmark themselves against their competitors or to monitor their own performance. It can also be used by owners to rank D/B firms relative to their <b>service</b> quality <b>performance.</b> Project <b>service</b> quality, design/build construction, quality function deployment,...|$|R
