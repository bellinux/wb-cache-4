The chemical shifts and the coupling constants were refined by computer simulation of the spectra. The change in the chemical shift of H- 4 of a d-galactopyranosyl residue upon substitution at C- 3 by a beta-d-galactopyranosyl group is proposed to be characteristic for this particular attachment, making H- 4 of galactose a structural-reporter group.

While the dynamics of the agent's opinion is described with an appropriate differential equation, from time to time pairs of agents are allowed to change their locations to improve the homogeneity of opinion (or comfort feeling) with respect to their short range environment. In this way the time scale of transaction dynamics and that of environment update are well separated and controlled by a single parameter. By varying this parameter we discovered a phase change in the number of undecided individuals. This phenomenon arises from the fact that too frequent location exchanges among agents result in frustration in their opinion formation. Our mean field analysis supports this picture.

The holographic bulk corresponds to AdS-soliton geometries.

In 2 + 1 d, in the simple limit where the torus becomes a thin 1 <b>d</b> <b>ring,</b> the EE reduces to a shape-independent constant 2 γ. This is twice the EE obtained by bipartitioning an infinite cylinder into equal halves. We study the RG flow of γ by defining a renormalized EE that 1) is applicable to general QFTs, 2) resolves the failure of the area law subtraction, and 3) is inspired by the F-theorem. We find that the renormalized γ decreases monotonically when the holographic CFT is deformed by a relevant operator for all allowed scaling dimensions.

40|$|A {{lattice network}} {{is a special}} type of network in which all nodes have {{the same number of}} links, and its {{boundary}} conditions are periodic. The most basic lattice network is the ring, a one-dimensional network with periodic border conditions. In contrast, the Cartesian product of <b>d</b> <b>rings</b> forms a d-dimensional lattice network. An analytical expression currently exists for the clustering coefficient in this type of network, but the theoretical value is valid only up to certain connectivity value; in other words, the analytical expression is incomplete. Here we obtain analytically the clustering coefficient expression in d-dimensional lattice networks for any link density. Our analytical results show that the clustering coefficient for a lattice network with density of links that tend to 1, leads to the value of the clustering coefficient of a fully connected network. We developed a model on criminology in which the generalized clustering coefficient expression is applied. The model states that delinquents learn the know-how of crime business by sharing knowledge, directly or indirectly, with their friends of the gang.

In arteries contracted with prostaglandin F 2 alpha, endothelium-dependent relaxations to BHT 920 (an alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist) were increased in coronary arteries from dogs with CHF (maximal relaxation: control - 15 +/- 9 % vs CHF - 92 +/- 5 %; n = 5 - 6; P < 0. 05), with a modest enhancement in renal arteries. Relaxations to adenosine diphosphate and the calcium ionophore were unchanged. Relaxations to BHT 920 in CHF were reduced by NG monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and pertussis toxin but not by indomethacin. These data suggest that endothelium-dependent relaxations are affected heterogeneously in CHF. The enhanced response to alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists in the coronary artery is mediated by nitric oxide through a mechanism sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin. This selective increase in endothelium-dependent relaxations in the coronary artery may contribute to preserving coronary blood flow during CHF...|$|R

These units have been suggested as possible precursors for {{the wide variety of}} zeolites reported to date. The reported structure consists of a planar sheet of double N-membered rings (polygonal prisms) sharing four-membered ring faces in the planes normal to the surface. The units are mostly double six-membered <b>rings</b> (<b>d</b> 6 r), with a significant population of pairs of double four- and eight-membered <b>rings</b> (<b>d</b> 4 r and d 8 r) and pairs of double five- and seven-membered <b>rings</b> (<b>d</b> 5 r and d 7 r), among other minority species.

Recently published data describe the receptive fields for two classes of visually responsive neurons (R 2 and R 3 /R 4 <b>d</b> <b>ring</b> neurons in the central complex) that are essential for visual tasks such as orientation memory for salient objects and simple pattern discriminations. What is interesting is that these cells have very large receptive fields and are very small in number, suggesting that each sub-population of cells might be a bottleneck in the processing of visual information for a specific behaviour, as each subset of cells effectively condenses information from approximately 3000 visual receptors in the eye, to fewer than 50 neurons in total. It has recently been shown how R 1 ring neurons, which receive input from the same areas as the R 2 and R 3 /R 4 d cells, are necessary for place learning in Drosophila. However, how R 1 neurons enable place learning is unknown.

40|$|We have {{considered}} polar ring galaxy candidates, {{the images of}} which {{can be found in the}} SDSS survey. The sample of 78 galaxies includes the most reliable candidates from the SPRC and PRC catalogs, some of which already have kinematic confirmations. We analyze the distributions of studied objects by the angle between the polar ring and the central disk, and by the optical diameter of the outer ring structures. In the vast majority of cases, the outer structures lie in the plane close to polar (within 10 °- 20 °) which indicates the stability of the corresponding orbits in the gravitational potential of the halo. Moderately inclined outer structures are observed only in about 6 % of objects which probably indicates their short lifetime. In such an unstable configuration, the polar ring would often cross the disk of the galaxy, being smaller than it in the diameter. We show that the inner polar structures and outer large-scale polar rings form a single family in the distribution of diameters normalized to the optical size of the galaxy. At the same time, this distribution is bimodal, as the number of objects with <b>d</b> <b>ring</b> = (0. 4 - 0. 7) d disk is small. Such a shape of size distribution is most likely due to the fact that the stability of polar orbits in the inner regions of galaxies is maintained by the bulge or the bar, while in the outer regions it is provided by the spheroidal (or triaxial) halo. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In {{the studies}} of {{conductance}} of closed mesoscopic systems, semi-linear response the-ory (SLRT) offers a novel unified framework {{that goes beyond the}} traditional Kubo formulation. In this Thesis we apply SLRT to two types of mesoscopic systems. The first is disordered quasi- 1 <b>d</b> <b>rings,</b> where we build an analytical model to understand the departure of SLRT results from Kubo results. Guided by the numerical analysis on the statistical properties of the current operator matrix elements, we introduce a random matrix theory (RMT) model which leads to a generalized variable range hopping (VRH) picture of the conductance. Both of these models capture the essential aspects of the mesoscopic conductance for this system. The second system is the Harper model, which is a one-dimensional model that exhibits a Metal-Insulator transition—at the critical point, it possesses fractal structures in both the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues. We are interested in studying how the fractal structures might {{have an effect on the}} mesoscopic conductance calculations.

Six hundred trees (22 botanical families, 43 genera and over 70 species) from semi-arid West Africa were evaluated for their suitability for dendrochronological research; specifically ring development. The samples were classified as 'potentially useful', 'problematic', or 'poor' based on the presence and distinctiveness of annual rings, ability to achieve crossdating between radii using skeleton plots on at least some samples, circuit uniformity, ring wedging, and variability of ring widths. Samples were classified as potentially useful if (a) they exhibited distinctive annual rings that could be identified and counted with little uncertainty and be independently verified by a second person {{with little or no}} error, (b) crossdating between radii could be successfully achieved, at least on some samples, (c) the rings were generally consistent throughout the stem cross section, (<b>d)</b> <b>ring</b> wedging was minimal (in the relative sense) or absent, and (e) the ring widths were variable, indicating the possibility of climatic sensitivity. Seven species, including five from the Caesalpiniaceae family (Cassia sieberiana, Cordyla pinnata, Daniella oliveri, Isoberlinia doka, Tamarindus indica), and one each from Mimosaceae (Acacia seyal) and Verbenaceae (Gmelina arborea) families, that most closely satisfied these criteria were classified as 'potentially useful'. The 'problematic' category includes those samples that satisfied some of the criteria but for which greater diligence is required to detect rings. Eight species from three families were classified in this category. Finally those samples on which ring detection appears futile given current methods and techniques were classified as 'poor'. Most of the samples classified as 'potentially useful' belong to three botanical families, Caesalpiniaceae, Mimosacae, and Verbenaceae. These results are consistent with the findings of other studies, and therefore support further investigation of the potential of West African trees for tree-ring analysis focusing on these families. Furthermore, inability to crossdate between trees and to explain several ring anatomical features underscores the pressing need for comprehensive field studies of cambial activity during the growing season, and for the identification of dormant seasons.

40|$|The {{requirements}} of RF acceleration in the SLC Linac to produce high energy beams are {{complicated by the}} presence of small transverse RF beam deflections which arise from several sources. These RF deflections place stringent tolerances on the phase and amplitude atability of the klystrons. They also force the use of special magnetic bumps to correct the trajectories of oppositely charged beams that will pass down the linac. If left unabated, RF deflections can liiit the performance of the SLC. There are several methods to reduce the deflections. Many measurements of RF defiections {{have been made in the}} low energy part of the iinac where the beams are most sensitive. TOLERANCES ON RF BEAM DEFLECTIONS The SLC linac must accelerate both electrons and positrons. Both beams are injected from their respective damping rings at 1. 21 GeV and ultimately reach 50 GeV. The transverse emittances of these beams are quite small and must be maintained. Trajectory errors in the linac will cause the beams to exhibit betatron oscillations in the FODO lattice of the linac, excite transverse wakefields, and enlarge their emittances. Static trajectory errors can be corrected by DC dipole magnets. However, studies 1 g 2 have shown that pulse-topulse fluctuations in the launching conditions or steering early in the linac must be kept below 13 pm or 0. 3 prad (/? = 42 m). These jitter tolerances relax as the beam energy increases. Small radial asymmetries in the RF fields in an accelerator will deflect beams transversely. The effects of these fields can be observed as beam trajectory errors downstream of an accelerator section driven by a klystron. An example is shown in Fig. 1. In the SLC, both electrons and positrons are deflected in the same direction. Special static magnetic bumps are used to compensate for these deiiections. Fluctuations in the RF power or phase will cause trajectory errors which cannot be corrected. Using the tolerances stated above and the fact that klystron ph&e and amplitude jitters can be kept below 0. 5 degrees and l%, respectively, RF deflections must be kept below 50 keV/c per klystron immediately downstream of the damp <b>ing</b> <b>ring!?,</b> i. e., the RF fields must be aligned to one part in five thousand...|$|R

40|$|Singly-spinning Myers-Perry {{black holes}} in d ≥ 6 spacetime {{dimensions}} are unstable for sufficiently large angular momentum. We numerically construct (in d = 6 and d = 7) two new stationary branches of lumpy (rippled) black hole solutions which bifurcate from {{the onset of}} this ultraspinning instability. We give evidence {{that one of these}} branches connects through a topology-changing merger to black ring solutions which we also construct numerically. The other branch approaches a solution with large curvature invariants. We are also able to compare the <b>d</b> = 7 <b>ring</b> solutions with results from finite-size corrections to the blackfold approach, finding excellent agreement...|$|R
40|$|The cyclobutane {{molecule}} {{has been}} found by electron diffraction to have the following bond distances and bond angles: C–C, 1. 568 ± 0. 02 A; C–H, 1. 098 ± 0. 04 A; ∠HCH, 114 ± 8 °. On the average the ring is nonplanar, with dihedral angle 20 ° (+ 10 °, − 20 °), but the equilibrium symmetry may be either D_(2 <b>d)</b> (puckered <b>ring)</b> or D_(4 h) (planar ring with low rigidity leading to large amplitude of out‐of‐plane bending). This point is discussed in connection with earlier spectroscopic work. The long bond distances found in four‐membered rings are contrasted against the short distances in three‐membered rings, and the strain energies, bond distances, and HCH angles of cycloalkanes are {{discussed in terms of}} modern valence concepts. It is suggested that the potential energy arising from a repulsion of the nonbonded carbon atoms may contribute significantly to the apparently anomalously high strain energy of cyclobutane. The repulsive force associated with such a potential is shown to account satisfactorily for the long C–C distances...|$|R
40|$|Ring {{transformations of}} heterocyclic rings by {{temporary}} opening and subsequent closure {{to a new}} molecule are of particular interest both synthetically and theoretically. Only rearrangement of five-membered heterocycles are discussed and reviewed. These transformations are classified into four groups: (a) "classical ring transformations", where the starting and resulting ring system is of the same size, but the heteroatoms and/or their positions have been changed: (b) "degenerate ring transformations" where {{during the course of}} the transformation the starting compound and product have the same ring system, but the reaction proceeds by a ring opening and subsequent ring closure process: (c) "ring contractions" and "ring expansions" where the sizes of the product rings are smaller or larger, respectively, than those of the starting compound, and (<b>d)</b> "pseudo <b>ring</b> transformations" or "ring-chain transfer", where the process is formally a ring transformation, but is realised by a ring closure of a side chain of the starting heterocycle and opening of the orirignal ring. Reaction mechanism of the most interesting ring transformations are also discussed...|$|R
