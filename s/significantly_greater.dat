Approximately 32 % of all horses addmitted to the clinic of Internal Diseases were presented because of colic. The colic pathology was observed mainly during the spring. A <b>significantly</b> <b>great</b> number of mares and warmblood riding horses was observed mainly during the spring. A <b>significantly</b> <b>great</b> number of mares and warmblood riding horses were presented, and significantly lower number of stallions and halfblood horses. The prevalence of colic increased with age, stagnating around age 13. One thousand one hundred sixty-eight exploratory laparotomies were performed on 1, 069 horses. During the period 1986 - 1994 the number of surgical interventions gradually increased. The short-term survival rate also increased progressively: {{by the end of the}} period studied, it had reached 87 % for conservative treatment and 73 % for surgical corrections. A variable successn rate after surgery was observed among the different surgeons. The determining factors for this variable success were the surgeon's individual experience in abdominal surgery and the period in which the exploratory laparotomies were performed. the success rate after non-invasive or minimally invasive surgical techniques was significantly better than after the use of invasive techniques.

40|$|Aiming at the {{investigation}} of the influence of mineral fertilizers on some physical, physiological and productive characteristics of the barley cv. Kristal, it has been investigated the influence of the increasing doses of nitrogen (0. 100, 120, 140 kg/ha), while the content of P 2 O 5 and K 2 O was constant, that is, P 2 O 5 - 60 kg/ha, K 2 O - 40 kg/ha. The germination energy and germinating ability greatly depend on mineral nourishment and are rather <b>significantly</b> <b>great</b> in relation to the control variant. The germination energy and germinating ability are greatest, 91. 4 % and 94. 5 %, at fertilizing with 100 kg/ha of nitrogen, while the least are 74. 3 % and 75 % in the variant without fertilizing. There are no significant differences in the germination energy and germinating ability among the variants of fertilization. The content of proteins is the greatest in the variants with 120 kg/ha of nitrogen, amounting 15. 20 %, while the least is in the non-fertilized variant, amounting 14 %. AU variants of fertilization show rather <b>significantly</b> <b>great</b> content of proteins in relation to the control one.

5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E

When data from all participants were pooled, {{the study found that}} 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.|$|E
