40|$|The various {{applications}} of the three-phase permanent magnet brushless dc motor (PMBDCM) in the industry are increasing. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the application of a new technology to academic electric machine control and/or power electronics drive courses. An easy method for the implementation of a fully software-configurable digital <b>servo</b> <b>amplifier</b> to drive a three-phase PMBDCM is presented in this paper. This developed <b>servo</b> <b>amplifier</b> may be suitable for an electric machine control course. The change of drive configuration requires additional development time and cost, especially in control software modification, which, in turn, depends on the specific application. The highlight of the paper is the GUI (Graphical User Interface) -based control software (Pro-Motion) setup for implementation of a software-configurable digital <b>servo</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The principle of the operation of the three-phase PMBDCM is discussed first, and then the requirement to develop three different types of servo amplifier-such as velocity, position, and torque servo amplifiers-to drive the three-phase PMBDCM, are explained. The details of a selected motor control integrated circuit (IC), MC 73110 from PMD Corp., are introduced. The various capabilities of the IC that make fast implementation of a software-configurable digital <b>servo</b> <b>amplifier</b> possible are discussed. The MC 73110 IC is incorporated into the <b>servo</b> <b>amplifier</b> design, resulting in an increased ease of use with software configuration. To validate the software-configurable digital controller, a step-by-step design example to develop a velocity <b>servo</b> <b>amplifier</b> is completely explained and some of the test results are discussed.

These navigational computations are performed with carefully designed electronic circuits {{in harmony with}} precision electromechanical components. The electronic parts are the Accelerometer Restoring Amplifier which give a voltage that {{is proportional to the}} acceleration. Ranging from micro-G's to units of G they span a very impressive dynamic range. Also the <b>Servo</b> <b>Amplifiers,</b> picking off the tiny Gyro signals and amplifying this to control the platform gimbal motors, have tight specifications. The actual integration of the accelerometer signal to a velocity signal is performed by an electronic amplifier which controls a velocity-motor which drives a capacitance tachometer. This cap-tach feedback provides the basic integrator signal since the speed of the cap-tach is proportional to acceleration input. The feedback nulls the acceleration input to stop the motor. The motor positions the velocity shaft to pick off the appropriate potentiometer signal which represents velocity. A dead zone network drives the velocity motor in steps which are smoothed to provide the integrated acceleration (= velocity) signal.The velocity integrators operate in a similar manner to the acceleration integrators, except that the output signal is not smoothed because the so-called M-transmitters are step-function devices. The M-transmitters send the integrated velocity (= distance) signal to the Position and Homing System PHI-4.|$|E

40|$|Summary- Suppression of the low-frequency (lf) {{components}} of the modulated data stream is a system requirement in optical recording which facilitates the usage of servo systems for reading the optical disc. Insufficient suppression of the lf {{components of}} the coded spectrum will lead to improper functioning of the servo systems, and/or acoustical noise generated by the servo systems, and/or additional power dissipation in the <b>servo</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Low-frequency components are avoided in {{state of the art}} systems such as CD and DVD by using codes, called dc-free codes, which suppress the energy in the lf range. Clearly, the more lf suppression, the more overhead in coding rate must be spent, and a sound trade-off has to be sought between proper lf suppression and coding efficiency. It has been found that lf suppression can also be improved by coding methods, which use a look-ahead (LA) algorithm that looks ahead p codewords, and evaluates, based on a suitable metric, the full search tree of 2 p possible choices of codewords in the tree. Recently, coding schemes, which use Guided Scrambling (GS) have been proposed for suppressing the lf content. It has been shown that GS schemes can achieve a lf suppression which is very close to the theoretical maximum. In this paper, we will report on a performance comparison of coding schemes based on Look-Ahead and Guided Scrambling techniques...|$|E

40|$|Filament winding is {{a process}} for the {{placement}} of reinforcement fibres on to a rotating surface in a specified geometric pattern. A conventional straight line interpolation controller is not very appropriate for filament winding because the fibre pay-out-eye is at some distance away from the mandrel surface and its movement from one point to another may disturb the position of previously laid fibre on the mandrel. Filament winding demands a controller which can produce fast and smooth carriage movements, and have a path-anticipation capability so that while moving around curves the effect of pay-out-eye movement on previous fibre positions is minimised. This problem can be overcome by using an interpolation technique which determines the pay-out-eye path by considering more than two data points, and whose profile is continuous in nature up to its second derivative. In this project an IDM PC based filament winding controller, using B-spline interpolation technique, is developed. To test {{the performance of the}} controller a 3 -axis CNC filament winding machine was designed and manufactured. For optimum performance, emphasis was given to the low inertia of the machine carriage, {{while at the same time}} maintaining the system's structural stiffness. To reduce the machine carriage weight, the DC servomotors were installed on the machine's frame, instead of the carriage, and a timing belt arrangement was used for power transmission. The controller's electronic hardware was assembled using <b>servo</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> DAC cards, and a purpose built optical encoder interface card. The controller software was developed using TURBO C++ as the main programming language, whereas the hardware interface routines were written in Assembly Language. Problems of winding path deviation as a result of B-spline approximation were tackled using knowledge based programming techniques. The results showed a considerable improvement in winding speed and less fibre slippage in the case of non-geodesic winding patterns, resulting in higher accuracy of fibre placement on the mandrel...|$|E

40|$|As the {{industrial}} robot manipulators {{are widely used}} in various industrial fields, the limitation of traditional closed architectures for robot control systems becomes increasingly evident. It {{is almost impossible to}} modify the planning algorithms, the robot model, or the type of <b>servo</b> <b>amplifier</b> block.

An on-line velocity filter with the function of look-ahead is thus proposed and implemented.

Furthermore, the velocity look-ahead function guarantees the motion accuracy by imposing limits on velocity. Experiments validated the proposed velocity filter and the control system...|$|R

They are also adaptable to many industrial uses, such as steam turbines, process control valves, dampers, motion control, etc. The advantageous features of the improved electrohydraulic linear actuators are best described with respect to shortcomings of prior electrohydraulic linear actuators that the improved ones are intended to supplant. The flow of hydraulic fluid to the two ports of the actuator cylinder is controlled by a servo valve that is controlled by a signal from a <b>servo</b> <b>amplifier</b> that, in turn, receives an analog position-command signal (a current having a value between 4 and 20 mA) from a supervisory control system of the facility. As the position command changes, the servo valve shifts, causing a greater flow of hydraulic fluid {{to one side of}} the cylinder and thereby causing the actuator piston to move to extend or retract a piston rod from the actuator body. A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) directly linked to the piston provides a position-feedback signal, which is compared with the position-command signal in the <b>servo</b> <b>amplifier.</b> When the position-feedback and position-command signals match, the servo valve moves to its null position, in which it holds the actuator piston at a steady position...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of producing a low cost, 6 axis, Industrial Robot. The formulation of a design specification based on market trends is shown, and used {{as a starting point}} for formal design analysis. A robot conceptual design based on two, series coupled, triangular link mechanisms was devised, following a detailed analysis of various kinematic mechanisms. The purpose of the mechanisms analysis was to find a low cost, inherently stiff, means of driving the robot main axes; in particular, the shoulder and elbow joints. By adopting the novel concept of a hand and wrist mechanism, a "true 3 axes" wrist was devised. A unique feature of this is that the roll, pitch and yaw axes form an orthogonal set with the origin at the wrist point. Although emphasis is placed on the robot mechanical design, a <b>Servo</b> <b>amplifier</b> system, suitable for driving all 6 axes of the robot is presented, and recommendations for a position control system are given. Finally, costs relating to the robot mechanical system, <b>Servo</b> <b>amplifier</b> system and Position control system were investigated.
