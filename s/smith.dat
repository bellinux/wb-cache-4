5|$|Although <b>Smith</b> had {{previously}} refused {{to show the}} plates to anyone, he told Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer {{that they would be}} allowed to see them. These men, known collectively as the Three Witnesses, signed a statement stating that they had been shown the golden plates by an angel, and that the voice of God had confirmed the truth of their translation. Later, a group of Eight Witnesses — composed of male members of the Whitmer and <b>Smith</b> families — issued a statement that they had been shown the golden plates by <b>Smith.</b> According to <b>Smith,</b> the angel Moroni took back the plates once <b>Smith</b> finished using them.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Smith</b> {{maintained}} his innocence, detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran's death {{and those of}} the other two women.

At least two witnesses recalled seeing <b>Smith</b> with blood on him: a motorist who saw him buying petrol, and another who spoke with <b>Smith</b> about his appearance. <b>Smith</b> told the latter that he had been in a fight, although he had no visible signs of injury.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1st Marine Division {{landed at}} Wonsan {{as part of}} Almond's US X Corps, Almond and Major General Oliver P. <b>Smith</b> of the 1st Marine Division shared a mutual loathing of each other that dated back to a meeting before the landing at Inchon, when Almond had spoken of how easy amphibious {{landings}} are {{even though he had}} never been involved in one. <b>Smith</b> believed there were large numbers of Chinese forces in North Korea despite the fact that higher headquarters in Tokyo said otherwise, but Almond felt <b>Smith</b> was overly cautious. The mutual distrust between the commanders caused <b>Smith</b> to slow the 1st Marine Division's advance towards the Chosin Reservoir in violation of Almond's instructions. <b>Smith</b> established supply points and airfields along the way at Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri.|$|E

In the early 1990s, <b>Smith's</b> attempted a major expansion into the Southern California market which was completely unsuccessful and resulted in <b>Smith's</b> accumulating nearly $500 million in debt.|$|R
5|$|As news of Gen. Robert E. Lee's {{surrender}} on April 9, 1865, {{reached the}} department, soldiers deserted the Confederacy in droves.

On May 9, <b>Smith</b> made Buckner {{his chief of}} staff. Rumors began to swirl in both Union and Confederate camps that <b>Smith</b> and Buckner would not surrender, but would fall back to Mexico with soldiers who remained loyal to the Confederacy. Though <b>Smith</b> did cross the Rio Grande, he learned on his arrival that Buckner had traveled to New Orleans on May 26 and arranged terms of surrender. <b>Smith</b> had instead instructed Buckner to move all the troops to Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Back at UNITY's headquarters, Cate is congratulated for {{a mission}} well done, and {{everybody}} leaves to grab some rest.

She is then confronted by the supposedly long-dead Tom Goodman, who reveals {{that he is the}} real traitor within UNITY, and a final gun duel ensues. Cate manages to injure Tom and arrest him, but <b>Smith</b> shoots Tom, causing him to fall into a freshly dug grave. <b>Smith</b> then tries to shoot Cate as well, but Jones shoots <b>Smith</b> and reveals that Bruno is still alive. <b>Smith</b> attempts his one last effort to shoot Cate, but Cate kills <b>Smith</b> just in time. With Tom and <b>Smith</b> shot dead, Jones and Bruno decide to tell Cate the truth; Bruno falsified his death so that Cate and the rest of UNITY could find the real traitor. Seven years ago, <b>Smith</b> was taken out of the field by UNITY due to his inadequate fieldwork. In order to sabotage UNITY as a way to avenge himself, <b>Smith</b> joins H.A.R.M. to kill the real Tom Goodman, and replace him with an impostor. When Cate's investigation initially foiled H.A.R.M.'s plan, both <b>Smith</b> and his mole were forced to reveal their true intentions. Cate reacts in shock upon finding out the truth.|$|E
5|$|By early 1844, a rift {{developed}} between <b>Smith</b> {{and a half}} dozen of his closest associates. Most notably, William Law, Smith's trusted counselor, and Robert Foster, a general of the Nauvoo Legion, disagreed with <b>Smith</b> about how to manage Nauvoo's economy. Both also said that <b>Smith</b> had proposed marriage to their wives. Believing the dissidents were plotting against his life, <b>Smith</b> excommunicated them on April 18, 1844.
