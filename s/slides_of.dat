The Medical museum features collections, individual specimens, artifacts, equipment log books/autopsy journals/paper materials and medical instruments and apparati, 25 wax models, 200 mostly skeletal dry specimens; and 400 lantern <b>slides</b> <b>of</b> anatomic specimens. There is a special emphasis on pathology; there are 2000 fluid filled-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens. The Osler collection, for example consists of 60 wet specimens while The Abbott collection consists of 80 wet specimens, mostly examples of congenital cardiac disease.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{intends to}} plant a fake {{advertisement}} to replace Lecktor's, but they realize that without the proper book code the Tooth Fairy will know it is fake; therefore, they let the advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, during which he gives a false and derogatory profile of the Tooth Fairy to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan). Waking in the killer's home, he is shown a slideshow of William Blake's The Great Red Dragon paintings, along with the Tooth Fairy's past victims and <b>slides</b> <b>of</b> a family the killer identifies as his next targets. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair and killed, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the National Tattler as a warning.|$|E

The participants were assigned to either an expressive suppression group (where {{they were asked to}} refrain from showing emotion while watching the slides) or to a control group (where they were not given regulatory instructions at all). As predicted by the researchers, suppressors showed significantly worse performance on a memory test for the orally presented information.|$|E

He then brings in a male patient and has Lana touch both the patient and herself in sexual manner. She cannot complete this form of therapy. Thredson later promises Lana that he will take her with him when his asylum visit is over in a week.|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby {{daughter}} as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ’60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world.

25|$|Cage's {{work from}} the sixties {{features}} some of his largest and most ambitious, not to mention socially utopian pieces, reflecting {{the mood of the}} era yet also his absorption of the writings of both Marshall McLuhan, on the effects of new media, and R. Buckminster Fuller, on the power of technology to promote social change. HPSCHD (1969), a gargantuan and long-running multimedia work made in collaboration with Lejaren Hiller, incorporated the mass superimposition of seven harpsichords playing chance-determined excerpts from the works of Cage, Hiller, and a potted history of canonical classics, with fifty-two tapes of computer-generated sounds, 6,400 <b>slides</b> <b>of</b> designs, many supplied by NASA, and shown from sixty-four slide projectors, with forty motion-picture films. The piece was initially rendered in a five-hour performance at the University of Illinois in 1969, in which the audience arrived after the piece had begun and left before it ended, wandering freely around the auditorium in the time for which they were there.|$|E

500|$|Cannikin was detonated on November 6, 1971, as {{the thirteenth}} {{test of the}} Operation Grommet (1971–1972) {{underground}} nuclear test series. The announced yield was 5 megatons (21PJ) – the largest underground nuclear test in US history. (Estimates for the precise yield range from 4.4 to 5.2 megatons or 18 to 22PJ).

500|$|The plot of {{the film}} is preoccupied with {{misinterpretation}} and mistaken identity: when John sees Laura on the barge with the sisters, he fails to realise it is a premonition and believes Laura is in Venice with them. John himself is mistaken for a Peeping Tom when he follows Laura to the séance, and ultimately he mistakes the mysterious red-coated figure for a child. The concept of Doppelgänger and duplicates feature prominently in the film: reproductions are a constantly recurring motif ranging from reflections in the water, to photographs, to police sketches and the photographic <b>slides</b> <b>of</b> the church John is restoring. Laura comments in a letter to their son that she can't tell the difference between the restored church windows and the [...] "real thing", and later in the film John attempts to make a seamless match between recently manufactured tiles and the old ones in repairing an ancient mosaic. Roeg describes the basic premise of the story as principally being that in life [...] "nothing is what it seems", and even decided to have Donald Sutherland's character utter the line—a scene which required fifteen takes.|$|E

500|$|Wu Hung {{described}} The Founding of the Nation as [...] "arguably {{the most}} celebrated work of official Chinese art". [...] He noted that the painting is the only [...] "canonized" [...] one depicting the October 1 ceremony, and that other artists have tended to give the people's perspective, subjecting themselves to Mao's gaze. [...] The painting is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae, the alteration of artworks or other objects to remove the image or name of a disfavored person. [...] Deng Zhangyu, in a 2014 article, called the painting [...] "the most significant historical image of China's founding". [...] Wu Hung suggested that the alterations to it over the years, while always showing Mao proclaiming the new government, parallel {{the changes that have}} come to China's leadership during the years of Communist governance. [...] Andrews wrote that [...] "its greatest importance to the art world was its elevation as a model of party-approved oil painting". [...] Writer Wu Bing in 2009 called it [...] "a milestone in Chinese oil painting, boldly incorporating national styles". [...] The painting has never been as highly regarded in the West as in China; according to Andrews, [...] "art history students have been known to roar with laughter when <b>slides</b> <b>of</b> it appear on the screen". [...] Art historian Michael Sullivan dismissed it as mere propaganda. [...] Today, following a merger of museums, both paintings are in the National Museum of China, on Tiananmen Square.|$|E
500|$|First Contact was {{the first}} Star Trek film to make {{significant}} use of computer-generated starship models, though physical miniatures were still used for the most important vessels. With the Enterprise-D destroyed during the events of Generations, the task of creating a new starship fell to veteran Star Trek production designer Herman Zimmerman. The script's only guide on {{the appearance of the}} vessel was the line [...] "the new Enterprise sleekly comes out of the nebula". Working with illustrator John Eaves, the designers conceived the new Sovereign Class Enterprise-E as [...] "leaner, sleeker, and mean enough to answer any Borg threat you can imagine". Braga and Moore intended it to be more muscular and militaryesque. Eaves looked at the structure of previous Enterprise iterations, and designed a more streamlined, capable war vessel than the Enterprise-D, reducing the neck area of the ship and lengthening the nacelles. Eaves produced 30 to 40 sketches before he found a final design he liked and began making minor changes. Working from blueprints created by Paramount's Rick Sternbach, the model shop at effects house Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) fabricated a [...] miniature over a five-month period. Hull patterns were carved out of wood, then cast and assembled over an aluminum armature. The model's panels were painted in an alternating matte and gloss scheme to add texture. The crew had multiple difficulties in prepping the miniature for filming; while the model shop originally wanted to save time by casting windows using a clear fiberglass, the material came out tacky. ILM instead cut the windows using a laser. <b>Slides</b> <b>of</b> the sets were added behind the window frames to make the interior seem more dimensional when the camera tracked past the ship.|$|E
