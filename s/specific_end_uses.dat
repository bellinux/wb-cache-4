Malting of cereal grains is known to increase the bioavailability of macro- and micronutrients. However, the detailed effects of malting on sorghum grain anthocyanins, a major class of phenolics that influence the taste and colour of sorghum-based foods, requires further investigation. Eight commercial sorghum hybrids harvested from three regions in eastern Australia were malted and analysed for colour, tannin content, total phenolic content (TPC), flavan- 4 -ols, total flavonoids, total anthocyanins and 3 -deoxyanthocyanins. Grains of all the sorghums were found to be tannin-free. Malting decreased the TPC of all samples. For TPC, the grand means among all the sorghum cultivars for raw and malted grain were 2. 77 and 2. 48 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) /g, respectively. For flavan- 4 -ols, the grand means for raw and malted sorghum grains were 2. 98 and 2. 23 abs/mL/g, respectively. Remarkably, total anthocyanin levels more than doubled upon malting whereas total flavonoid levels decreased by 12 %. The average abundance of 3 -deoxyanthocyanins in raw sorghum grains increased for about 8 -fold upon malting.

We have developed a genetic linkage map using a combination of microsatellite and DArT markers using a population derived from a cross between two winter oats, Buffalo and Tardis. The use of DArT markers enables meta-QTL analysis with results from other published mapping studies in oats.

Buffalo is a husked dwarf variety with low kernel content, small grains and poor resistance to mildew; Tardis is a conventional height variety with excellent kernel content, large grains and high resistance to disease. This population will therefore help elucidate the drawbacks often associated with dwarf oats such as poor panicle extrusion, low kernel content, late flowering and mildew susceptibility which have previously limited the use of the dwarfing gene in winter oat variety development. Results from QTL analysis has provided a map location of the dw 6 dwarfing gene.

40|$|Being able {{to disaggregate}} total energy demand into {{components}} attributable to <b>specific</b> <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> provides useful information and represents a primary input into {{any attempt to}} simulate the impact of policies aimed at encouraging households to use less energy or shift load. Conceptually the estimation problem can be solved by directly metering individual appliances.

More recently, with access to limited direct metering, both approaches have been used in combination.

The distinctive aspects are the extent and richness of the metering data and the fact that optimal design techniques were used to decide on the pattern of metering. As such, the empirical results are able to provide a very detailed and accurate picture of how total residential load is disaggregated by end uses. Significantly, the consumption of high penetration end uses such as lighting, which cannot be estimated by conventional conditional demand analysis, has been successfully estimated.

Hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) could {{form the basis for}} rendering human faecal wastes safe whilst at the same time generating a carbon-rich material (hydrochar) and providing prospects for the recovery of energy. The work presented here has an objective of the search for optimal conditions for the HTC conversion of human faecal waste. Primary sewage sludge (PSS) and synthetic faeces (SF), of various moisture contents, were used as feedstocks to investigate the kinetics of decomposition of solids during HTC over a range of reaction times and temperatures. Decomposition was found to follow first-order kinetics, and the corresponding activation energies were obtained. Temperature was of primary importance to influence solid decomposition. Higher temperatures resulted in higher solids conversion to hydrochar. The energy contents of the hydrochars from PSS carbonised at 140 200 oC for 4 h ranged from 21. 5 to 23. 1 MJ kg 1. Moisture content was found to affect the HTC process and feedstocks, with higher initial moisture contents resulted in lower hydrochar yields. The effect of reaction conditions on the characteristics of the hydrochar, liquid and gas products from HTC of faecal material, and the conditions leading to optimal hydrochar characteristics were investigated using a Response Surface Methodology (RSM).

Forecasts of DG adoption published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) are made using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), which has a forecasting module that predicts the penetration of several possible commercial building DG technologies over the period 2005 - 2025. NEMS is also used for estimating the future benefits of Department of Energy research and development used in support of budget requests and management decisionmaking. The NEMS approach to modeling DG has some limitations, including constraints on the amount of DG allowed for retrofits to existing buildings and a small number of possible sizes for each DG technology. An alternative approach called Commercial Sector Model (ComSeM) is developed to improve the way in which DG adoption is modeled. The approach incorporates load shapes for <b>specific</b> <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> in specific building types in specific regions, e. g., cooling in hospitals in Atlanta or space heating in Chicago offices.

The Distributed Energy Resources Market Diffusion Model (DER-MaDiM) is then used to then tailor the DER-CAM results to adoption projections for the entire U.
