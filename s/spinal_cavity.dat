40|$|Syringomyelia is the {{development}} of fluid-filled cysts in the spinal cord. This disease is frequently seen together with the Chiari Malformation, a medical condition characterized by the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils into the spinal canal. The pathogenesis is unknown. However, several theories relate it to a disruption of cerebrospinal fluid flow. In this work, a viscous and porous model based on the coupled Navier-Stokes/Darcy system has been developed, aimed for applications on realistic geometries of the spinal canal. Modeling the spinal cord as a rigid porous medium, this can be used to study flow through the spinal cord and in the central canal—a narrow channel {{in the center of the}} cord which may have an important role in the pathogenesis of syringomyelia. We have developed and investigated the applicability of different finite element schemes for solution of the model equations. In particular, we have considered a coupled scheme, based on a unified, mixed formulation, and variants of an incremental pressure correction scheme (IPCS). In addition, simulations were done on a simple two-dimensional model, used to study how spinal canal flow is affected by the presence of a <b>spinal</b> cord <b>cavity,</b> representing a cyst or a segment of the central canal. Accuracy and convergence properties of the schemes were investigated using the method of manufactured solutions. Stability and accuracy for typical spinal canal flow, as well as possible simplifications of the schemes, were investigated using the two-dimensional model. The IPCS was found not applicable for spinal canal flow, either because of instabilities or because a too small time step would be required for a sufficient accuracy. However, with simpler equation parameters the IPCS performed well, indicating that it might be used in other types of problems. The coupled scheme is deemed applicable for spinal canal flow. Furthermore, it could be simplified by removing the inertial term in Darcy's law and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman interface term. Simulations on the two-dimensional model show that the pressure field is altered by the presence of <b>spinal</b> cord <b>cavities.</b> In particular, radial gradients are introduced...|$|R

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: A rat {{model was}} {{developed}} to elucidate the role of excitatory amino acids and spinal subarachnoid block in the genesis of post-traumatic syringomyelia. This excitotoxic model produces intramedullary cavities rather than the dilation of the central canal (canalicular syringomyelia) created by previous animal models. OBJECTIVES: To produce extracanalicular cysts in the rat spinal cord with quisqualic acid, a potent agonist of multiple excitatory amino acid receptors, and to compare the effects of excitotoxic injury only with that of excitotoxic injury and subarachnoid block with kaolin. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In post-traumatic syringomyelia, primary injury and excitotoxic cell death secondary to elevated levels of excitatory amino acids may initiate a pathologic process leading {{to the formation of}} <b>spinal</b> <b>cavities.</b> Subarachnoid block by arachnoiditis may promote enlargement of the cavities. METHODS: Three control rats received a unilateral injection of normal saline into the spinal cord, and another five rats received an injection of kaolin into the spinal subarachnoid space. Quisqualic acid was injected unilaterally into the spinal cord of 20 rats, and 13 additional rats received a unilateral injection of quisqualic acid into the spinal cord after injection of kaolin into the subarachnoid space. Histologic and immunocytochemical assessments were undertaken. RESULTS: In the control groups, no parenchymal cyst developed in any of the animals. Spinal cord cyst formation was observed in 16 of 19 animals in the quisqualic acid groups, but no cysts exceeding two segments in the length of the spinal cord developed in any of the rats. Much larger cavities were seen in 9 of 11 animals in the group with quisqualic acid and kaolin, and cysts exceeding two segments developed in all 9 of these (9 / 11; 82 %). CONCLUSIONS: In post-traumatic syringomyelia, excitotoxic cell death occurring secondarily to elevated levels of excitatory amino acids may contribute to the pathologic process leading to the formation of spinal cord cysts.

40|$|When solids and liquids {{are brought}} together, {{interfacial}} double-layers {{are likely to}} form. They {{are too small to}} feel or see so their presence goes mostly unnoticed at the macroscopic level. A double layer is essentially a cluster of ions and/or charged molecules which are drawn from the body of a liquid to the surface of a solid. They are responsible for stabilising some of our most important fluids [...] blood, milk, paints, and inks. Without the protection of double-layers, these mixtures clump and lose their fluidity. This thesis examines both electricity generation from, and the electrical impedance of, interfacial double layers. Interfacial double-layers represent the underlying theme of this work, which is broken into two parts. In part I, double layers are used as a means of converting fluid-mechanical energy into electrical energy. My application for this is an energy harvester that could power electronic water meters. Domestic water meters are typically installed where electrical connection is not feasible. Harvesting energy at the meter may make electronic metering a feasible long-term solution. My findings show that double layer based energy harvesters are not efficient enough for this application yet. However, recent literature on the subject suggests large gains in efficiency may be possible using more exotic materials. Such gains would allow a compact harvester to generate enough energy to operate an electronic meter with wireless transmitter. Part II models the electrical impedance of electrodes submerged in electrolytes. Double-layers contribute to the electrical impedance between solid-fluid interfaces. This work is important to designers of medical implants. Engineers use solutions of saline to mimic the environment experienced by their implants once implanted. This provides a way to test implant electronics without putting a patient at risk. A way of characterising the interface between electrodes and an electrolyte is to model it mathematically. An electrical model of an electrode-electrolyte interface was recently developed by my supervisor, Jonathan Scott. I use that model to compare electrodes placed in solutions of saline to those placed in a living animal. Measurements of the two show that no one concentration of saline matches the situation inside a live <b>spinal</b> <b>cavity.</b> I then create a low-cost electrolyte test solution that better matches the impedance measured in a living animal's <b>spinal</b> <b>cavity...</b>|$|E

In the present study, hTERT was transfected into rat Schwann cells. A rat model of acute spinal cord injury was established by the modified free-falling method. Retrovirus PLXSN was injected at the site of spinal cord injury as a vector to mediate hTERT gene-transfected Schwann cells (1 × 10 10 /L; 10 μL) or Schwann cells (1 × 10 10 /L; 10 μL) without hTERT gene transfection. Between 1 and 4 weeks after model establishment, motor function of the lower limb improved in the hTERT-transfected group compared with the group with non-transfected Schwann cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results revealed that the number of apoptotic cells, and gene expression of aquaporin 4 / 9 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 / 2 decreased at the site of injury in both groups; however, the effect improved in the hTERT-transfected group compared with the Schwann cells without hTERT transfection group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, PKH 26 fluorescent labeling, and electrophysiological testing demonstrated that compared with the non-transfected group, <b>spinal</b> cord <b>cavity</b> and motor and sensory evoked potential latencies were reduced, while the number of PKH 26 -positive cells and the motor and sensory evoked potential amplitude increased at the site of injury in the hTERT-transfected group.

40|$|AANS, 2016. OBJECTIVE: The {{pathogenesis}} of posttraumatic syringomyelia remains enigmatic and is {{not adequately}} explained by current theories. Experimental investigations require a reproducible animal model that replicates the human condition. Current animal models are imperfect because of their low reliability, severe neurological deficits, or dissimilar mechanism of injury. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a reproducible rodent model of posttraumatic syringomyelia using a spinal cord impactor that produces an injury that more closely mimics the human condition and does not produce severe neurological deficits. METHODS: The study consisted of 2 parts. Seventy animals were studied overall: 20 in Experiment 1 and 48 in Experiment 2 after two rats with severe deficits were killed early. Experiment 1 aimed to determine the optimal force setting for inducing a cystic cavity without neurological deficits using a computer-controlled motorized spinal cord impactor. Twenty animals received an impact that ranged from 50 to 150 kDyn. Using the optimal force for producing an initial cyst determined from Experiment 1, Experiment 2 aimed to compare the progression of cavities in animals with and those without arachnoiditis induced by kaolin. Forty-eight animals were killed at 1, 3, 6, or 12 weeks after syrinx induction. Measurements of cavity size and maximum anteroposterior and lateral diameters were evaluated using light microscopy. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, cavities were present in 95 % of the animals. The duration of limb weakness and <b>spinal</b> cord <b>cavity</b> size correlated with the delivered force. The optimal force chosen for Experiment 2 was 75 kDyn. In Experiment 2, cavities occurred in 92 % of the animals. Animals in the kaolin groups developed larger cavities and more vacuolations and enlarged perivascular spaces than those in the nonkaolin groups.

40|$|Abstract—Appropriate {{velocity}} {{boundary conditions}} are a prerequisite in computational hemodynamics. A method for mapping analytical or experimental velocity profiles on anatomically realistic boundary cross-sections is presented. Interpolation is required because the computational and experimental domains are seldom aligned. In {{the absence of}} velocity information one alternative is the adaptation of analytical profiles based on volumetric flux constraints. The presented algorithms {{are based on the}} Schwarz-Christoffel (S-C) mapping of singly or doubly connected polygons to the unit circle or an annulus with unary external radius. S-C transformations are combined to construct a one-to-one invertiblemapbetween the target surface and themeasurement domain or the support of the source analytical profile. The proposed technique permits us to segment each space sepa-rately and map one onto the other in its entirety.

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{which have}} been presented show that the spinal fluid occupies a unique position among the fluids which accumulate in serous cavities of the body. It contains normally neither proteolytic enzyme nor anti-enzyme, whereas blood serum, from which it is derived, exhibits both enzymotic and anti-enzymotic activity. In the blood anti-enzyme greatly predominates over enzyme, so that proteolysis does not occur, unless the anti-enzymotic power of the serum has been destroyed {{by the addition of}} acid. In pathological conditions both enzyme and anti-enzyme may make their appearance in the spinal fluid. With inflammations of other serous cavities of the body the anti-enzyme of the exuded serum as a rule preponderates over and restrains the activity of the proteolytic enzyme freed from leucocytes. On the other hand, in infection of the meninges with Diplococcus lanceolatus and with Streptococcus mucosus free proteolytic enzyme has been present in considerable amount in four of five fluids {{which have been}} tested. Free proteolytic enzyme has not been observed in the spinal fluid in cases of epidemic meningitis. The cases which have been studied demonstrate that in epidemic meningitis some anti-enzymotic action may be present {{in the early stages of}} the disease; but it tends to disappear rapidly so that anti-enzyme seems to be constantly at a low ebb. It is possible that the absence of anti-enzyme in normal spinal fluid, and the tendency for it to disappear so much more rapidly than in other inflammatory exudates, may explain in part the severity of acute meningeal infections. Non-inflammatory transudates into the subdural spaces differ from inflammatory exudates in that the inhibitory element of the blood serum accumulates, and this accumulation suggests an interference with the elimination of the antibody from the spinal fluid. Such interference is not evident in so-called serous meningitis. In content of anti-enzyme the spinal fluid of chronic conditions, such as tuberculous meningitis, apparently occupies an intermediate position between acute inflammation and serous effusion, and five of seven tuberculous fluids which were tested exhibited various degrees of anti-enzymotic action. Variations in content of enzyme and anti-enzyme, noted above, may depend upon the rapidity with which the fluid, carrying the elements mentioned, enters the <b>spinal</b> <b>cavity,</b> as well as upon the rate of their elimination from the spinal fluid. Subdural injection of large quantities of anti-meningitis serum (horse's blood serum) does not increase the anti-enzymotic activity of fluids withdrawn twenty-four hours after its injection; disappearance of anti-enzyme being caused by rapid elimination of serum from the spinal fluid...|$|E

Transients equivalent to both arterial pulsation and percussive coughing are used to excite wave propagation. Propagation is investigated in this model and one with a central canal {{down the middle of}} the cord tissue, and in further idealized versions of it, including a model with no cord, one with a rigid cord, one with a rigid dura, and a double-length untapered variant of the rigid-dura model.

These require a period of adaptation and can substantially affect both crew member performance and posture. These physiological effects, when work activities are conducted, have been known to impact the body's center of gravity, reach, flexibility, and dexterity. All these aspects of posture must be considered to safely and efficiently design space systems and hardware. NASA has documented its microgravity body posture in the Man-Systems Integration Standards (MSIS); the space community uses the MSIS posture to design workstations and tools for space application. However, the microgravity body posture should be further investigated for several reasons, including small sample size in previous studies, possible imprecision, and lack of detail. JSC undertook this study to investigate human body posture exhibited under microgravity conditions. STS- 57 crew members were instructed to assume a relaxed posture that was not oriented to any work area or task. Crew members were asked to don shorts and tank tops and to be blindfolded while data were recorded. Video data were acquired once during the mission from each of the six crew members.

40|$|Intramedullary hemorrhagic {{necrosis}} occurs early after {{spinal cord}} injury {{at the site of}} injury and adjacent segments. It is considered harmful because of its potential to aggravate secondary injury, and to interfere with axonal regeneration; it might also lead to an unfavorable environment for intralesional implants. Removal of hemorrhagic necrosis has been attempted before with variable results. The invasive nature of these procedures carries the risk of exacerbating damage to the injured cord. The overall objective for this study was to test several strategies for non-damaging removal of hemorrhagic necrosis and characterize the resulting cavity looking for a space for future intralesional therapeutic implants in rats with acute cord injury. Rats were subjected to graded cord contusion, and hemorrhagic necrosis was removed after 24 h. Three grades of myelotomy (extensive, medium sized, and small) were tested. Using the small surgical approach to debridement, early and late effects of the intervention were determined by histology and by analytical and behavioral analysis. Appearance and capacity of the resulting cavity were characterized. Satisfactory removal of hemorrhagic necrosis was achieved with all three surgical approaches to debridement. However, bleeding in spared cord tissue was excessive after medium sized and extensive myelotomies but similar to control injured rats after small cord surgery. Small surgical approach to debridement produced no swelling nor acute inflammation changes, nor did it affect long-term spontaneous locomotor recovery, but resulted in modest improvement of myelination in rats subjected to both moderate and severe injuries. Cavity created after intervention was filled with 10 to 15 μL of hydrogel. In conclusion, by small surgical approach to debridement, removal of hemorrhagic necrosis was achieved after acute cord contusion thereby creating intramedullary spaces without further damaging the injured <b>spinal</b> cord.

The aim {{of this study was to}} qualify and compare the secondary cancer risk (SCR) after intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Patients and methods: We analyzed the treatment plans of a cohort of 10 NPC patients originally treated with IMRT or VMAT. Dose distributions in these plans were used to calculate the organ equivalent dose (OED) with Schneider’s full model. Analyses were applied to the brain stem, <b>spinal</b> cord, oral <b>cavity,</b> pharynx, parotid glands, lung, mandible, healthy tissue, and planning target volume. Results: We observed that the OED-based risks of SCR were slightly higher for the oral cavity and mandible when VMAT was used. No significant difference was found in terms of the doses to other organs, including the brain stem, parotids, pharynx, submandibular gland, lung, spinal cord, and healthy tissue. In the NPC cohort, the lungs were the organs that were most sensitive to radiation-induced cancer. Conclusion: VMAT afforded superior results in terms of organ-at-risk-sparing compared with IMRT. Most OED-based second cancer risks for various organs were similar when VMAT and IMRT were employed, but the risks for the oral cavity and mandible were slightly higher when VMAT was used.

No presente estudo, o PRP foi utilizado para reparar uma falha óssea diafisária segmentar de meia espessura e 2 cm de comprimento produzida no radio de coelhos Nova Zelândia. O periósteo foi ressecado na circunferência do {{local da}} falha e a cavidade medular foi selada com cera óssea em todos os animais para bloquear a chegada de celular regeneradoras que não fossem do próprio osso, mas dos tecidos vizinhos. Três grupos de 15 animais cada foram planejados, de acordo com o procedimento realizado: 1) falha deixada vazia; 2) falha preenchida com o PRP; e 3) falha preenchida com um {{material}} inerte (Gelfoam®). Em cada grupo os animais foram distribuídos em três subgrupos de acordo com o período de observação pós-operatória, de 4, 8 e 12 semanas, respectivamente, depois do qual os animais foram mortos e o radio, ressecado para os estudos histológicos. Radiografias e cintilografias foram obtidas a intervalos de 4 semanas, começando na quarta semana pós-operatória. Cicatrização completa e remodelação foram observadas no grupo 2 já na 8 ª semana, enquanto que nos grupos 1 e 3 esse processo era apenas parcial na 12 ª. A captação do tecnécio estava aumentada em todos os grupos, assim permanecendo durante todo o período de observação nos grupos 1 e 3, mas diminuindo da 8 ª para a 12 ª semana no grupo 2, acompanhando o processo de remodelação, com diferenças significantes entre os grupos (p The autogenous blood plasma with high platelet concentration obtained through centrifugation (platelet-rich plasma, or PRP) {{has been used}} in clinical practice to stimulate bone healing in a number of situations, allegedly because of its ability to carry a high concentration of platelet-derived and beta-transformer growth factors, which are well known to stimulate different tissues growth and repair. In the present study, PRP was used to repair a half-thick, 2 -cm long segmental diaphyseal bone gap produced on New Zealand rabbits’ radius. Periosteum was dried at the circumference of the gap site and the <b>spinal</b> cord <b>cavity</b> was sealed with bony wax in all animals in order to block the entrance of repairing cells other than the ones from the bone itself, but from surrounding tissues. Three groups of 15 animals each were designed, according to the procedure performed: 1) gap left empty; 2) gap filled with PRP; and 3) gap filled with an inert material (Gelfoam®). In each group, the animals were deployed into three subgroups according to postoperative follow-up period, of 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively, after which animals were sacrificed and the radius was dried for histological study purposes. X-rays and scintiscan were taken within 4 weeks intervals, starting from the fourth postoperative week. Full healing and remodeling were seen in group 2 as soon as the 8 th postoperative week, while in groups 1 and 3, that process was only partial at the 12 th week. Tecnetium uptake was increased in all groups, remaining as such throughout the whole follow-up period in groups 1 and 3, but showing reduction between the 8 th and 12 th week in group 2, accompanying remodeling process, with significant differences between groups (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Injury severs the axons in {{the spinal}} cord causing {{permanent}} functional loss. After injury, {{a series of events}} occur around the lesion site, including the deposition of growth cone inhibitory astroglial scar tissue containing chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) - rich regions. It is important to encourage axons to extend through these inhibitory regions for regeneration to occur. The work presented in this dissertation investigates the effect of three proteins, constitutively active (CA) -Cdc 42, CA-Rac 1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on axonal outgrowth through CSPGs-rich inhibitory regions after spinal cord injury (SCI). Cdc 42 and Rac 1 are members of the Rho GTPase family and BDNF {{is a member of the}} neurotrophin sub-family. These three proteins affect the actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Therefore, Cdc 42, Rac 1, and BDNF promote axonal outgrowth. The effect of CA-Cdc 42 and CA-Rac 1 on neurite extension through CSPG regions was determined in an in vitro model. Rac 1 and Cdc 42 s ability to modulate CSPG-dependent inhibition has yet to be explored. In this study, a stripe assay was utilized to examine the effects of modulating all three Rho GTPases on neurite extension across inhibitory CSPG lanes. Alternating laminin (LN) and CSPG lanes were created and NG 108 - 15 cells and E 9 chick dorsal root ganglions (DRGs), were cultured on the lanes. Using the protein delivery agent Chariot, the neuronal response to exposure of CA and dominant negative (DN) Rho GTPases, along with the bacterial toxin C 3, was determined by quantifying the percent ratio of neurites crossing the CSPG lanes. CA-Cdc 42, CA-Rac 1, and C 3 transferase significantly increased the number of neurites crossing into the CSPG lanes compared to the negative controls for both the NG 108 - 15 cells and the E 9 chick DRGs. We also show that these mutant proteins require the delivery vehicle, Chariot, to enter the neurons and affect neurite extension. Therefore, activation of Cdc 42 and Rac helps overcome the CSPG-dependent inhibition of neurite extension. In an in vivo study, CA-Cdc 42 and CA-Rac 1 were locally delivered into a <b>spinal</b> cord <b>cavity.</b> Additionally, BDNF was delivered to the lesion site, either individually or in combination with either CA-Cdc 42 or CA-Rac 1. The dorsal over-hemisection model was utilized, creating a ~ 2 mm defect that was filled with an in situ gelling hydrogel scaffold containing lipid microtubules loaded with the protein(s) to encourage axons. The lipid microtubules enable slow release of proteins while the hydrogel serves to localize them to the lesion site and permit axonal growth. The results from this study demonstrate that groups treated with BDNF, CA-Cdc 42, CA-Rac 1, BDNF/CA-Cdc 42, and BDNF/CA-Rac 1 had significantly higher percentage of axons from the corticospinal tract (CST) that traversed the CSPG-inhibitory regions, as well as penetrate the glial scar compared to the untreated and agarose controls. Although axons from the CST tract did not infiltrate the scaffold-filled lesion, NF- 160 + axons were observed in the scaffold. Treatment with BDNF, CA-Cdc 42, and CA-Rac 1 also reduced the inflammatory response, quantified by analyzing GFAP and CS- 56 intensity for reactive astrocytes and CSPGs, respectively, at the interface of the scaffold and host tissue. Therefore, the local delivery of CA-Cdc 42, CA-Rac 1 and BDNF, individual and combination demonstrated the ability of axons to extend through CSPG inhibitory regions, as well as reduce the glial scar components.
