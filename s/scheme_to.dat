5000|$|Since {{at least}} 1941, {{particularly}} in the 1970s and 1980s, and prior to 1987, the courts had interpreted the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes as criminalizing not only <b>schemes</b> <b>to</b> defraud victims of money and property, but also <b>schemes</b> <b>to</b> defraud victims of intangible rights such as the [...] "honest services" [...] of a public official. In 1987, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in McNally v. United States that the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes pertained strictly <b>to</b> <b>schemes</b> <b>to</b> defraud victims of tangible property, including money. In 1988, Congress enacted a new law that specifically criminalized <b>schemes</b> <b>to</b> defraud victims of [...] "the intangible right of honest services." ...|$|R

A light-rail scheme was proposed in 1982 as the least expensive rail-based transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area. Government approval was granted in 1988 and the network began operating services between Bury Interchange and Victoria on 6 April 1992, becoming the United Kingdom's first modern street-running rail system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only first-generation tram system in the UK that had survived up to Metrolink's creation.|$|E

Similarly a Copenhagen '96 scheme was pained for Copenhagen's term as the European Capital of Culture. Since 2002, SAS has painted selected aircraft in a Star Alliance livery. With the delivery of the A319 in 2006, one aircraft was delivered in a retro Viking scheme.|$|E
