5|$|The Space Interferometry Mission, or <b>SIM,</b> {{also known}} as <b>SIM</b> Lite (formerly known as <b>SIM</b> PlanetQuest), was a planned space {{telescope}} proposed by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in conjunction with contractor Northrop Grumman. One of the main goals of the mission was the hunt for Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of nearby stars other than the Sun. <b>SIM</b> was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>SIM</b> Lite was {{originally}} proposed for a 2005 launch, aboard an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). As {{a result of}} continued budget cuts, the launch date was pushed back at least five times. NASA had set a preliminary launch date for 2015. As of February 2007, many of the engineers working on the <b>SIM</b> program had {{moved on to other}} areas and projects, and NASA directed the project to allocate its resources toward engineering risk reduction. However, the preliminary budget for NASA for 2008 included zero dollars for <b>SIM.</b>|$|E

5|$|The initial {{contracts}} for <b>SIM</b> Lite were awarded in 1998, totaling US$200million. Work on the <b>SIM</b> project required {{scientists and engineers}} to move through eight specific new technology milestones, and by November 2006, all eight had been completed.|$|E
5|$|The mission's planet finding {{component}} {{was set up}} {{to serve}} as an important complement to the future missions designed to image and measure terrestrial and other exoplanets. <b>SIM</b> Lite was to perform an important task that these missions will not be capable of: determining planet masses. Another task that the <b>SIM</b> was envisioned to perform for the future missions will include providing the orbital characteristics of the planets. With this knowledge other missions can estimate the optimal times and projected star–planet separation angles for them to observe the terrestrial (and other) planets <b>SIM</b> has detected.|$|E

5|$|At JAMMA's 1992 Amusement Machine Show in Japan, {{held during}} 27–19 August 1992, Namco debuted a racing game called <b>Sim</b> Drive for the Namco System 22 arcade system board. It was {{a sequel to}} Eunos Roadster Driving Simulator, a Mazda MX-5 driving {{simulation}} arcade game that Namco developed with Mazda and released in 1990. Its 3D polygon graphics stood out for its use of Gouraud shading and texture mapping. After a location test at the show, where it was previewed by the November 1992 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, <b>Sim</b> Drive had a limited Japanese release in December 1992, but {{did not get a}} mass-market release. It served as a prototype for Ridge Racer.|$|E
5|$|Captain Canuck and Orb both folded by 1976, but in Kitchener, Ontario in December 1977, Dave Sim's {{independent}} {{comic book}} Cerebus debuted, and {{would become the}} longest-lived original Canadian comic book. Benefiting from distribution in the emerging comic shop market, it started as a Howard the Duck-like parody of Barry Windsor-Smith's Conan the Barbarian comics. The story eventually grew to fit Sim's expanding ambitions, both in content and technique, with its earth-pig protagonist getting embroiled in politics, becoming prime minister of a powerful city-state, then a Pope who ascends to the moon—all within the first third of its projected 300-issue run. <b>Sim</b> came to conceive the series as a self-enclosed story, which itself would be divided into novels—or graphic novels, which were gaining in prominence in the North American comic book world in the 1980s and 1990s. While <b>Sim</b> and his partner Gerhard's technical achievements impressed and influenced his peers, <b>Sim</b> also spoke out for creators' rights, promoted his peers and up-and-coming creators, and fiercely promoted self-publishing as an ideal. Americans Jeff Smith with Bone and Terry Moore with Strangers in Paradise took Sim's cue, as did Canadian M'Oak (Mark Oakley) with his long-running Thieves and Kings. Eddie Campbell took Sim's personal advice to self-publish the collected From Hell {{at the turn of}} the century. <b>Sim</b> also stirred considerable controversy, sometimes with the content of Cerebus, and sometimes with his editorials and personal interactions.|$|E
5|$|Cerebus creator Dave <b>Sim</b> has {{published}} a comic book since 2008 called glamourpuss which is an examination of Alex Raymond's career (and the techniques of other photorealists like Stan Drake and Al Williamson) structured around a hypothetical storyline set during {{the last day of}} Raymond's life.|$|E

5|$|The attackers {{had planned}} the attack several months {{ahead of time}} and knew some areas well enough to vanish and {{reappear}} after security forces had left. Several sources have quoted Kasab telling the police that the group received help from Mumbai residents. The attackers used at least three <b>SIM</b> cards purchased on the Indian side of the border with Bangladesh. There were also reports of a <b>SIM</b> card purchased in the US state New Jersey, if this is the case, then this would go back to Iraqi Intelligence Services and Al Qaeda from 9–11 or Jemmah Ismaliyah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad through Iraqi Intelligence from Saddam Hussein's old network of militants that was never proved. Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari, an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks. Later, the police arrested two Indian suspects, Mikhtar Ahmad, who is from Srinagar in Kashmir, and Tausif Rehman, a resident of Kolkata. They supplied the <b>SIM</b> cards, one in Calcutta, and the other in New Delhi.|$|E
