40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{instructional}} experiences of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in an guided inquiry-based science classroom. Drawing from social constructive perspectives about teaching and learning, I focused on the initial attempts of students to participate fully in an inquiry-based astronomy unit. The astronomy unit incorporated features of project-based science inquiry and aligned with national standards. This study described the opportunities provided to and challenges faced by <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> as they participated in the guided inquiry-based learning environment. Additionally, discursive practices of students including student-generated questions, student discussions, and students' science notebook writing were examined. Also, students' alternative conceptions about scientific phenomena and changes in students' thinking during the course of instruction, if any, were described. Methods of data collection included classroom observations, video records, pre- and post- curriculum assessments, attitudes toward science measurement, student interviews, and student artifacts (i. e., science notebook entries, student-constructed models). Findings showed that student learning was enhanced when the instructor-researcher guided students in accomplishing inquiry tasks and in making sense of their inquiry experiences. Additionally, the use of appropriate reflective prompts assisted <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> to fully participate in the writing tasks of the inquiry-based learning environment. Results suggested that the quantity and quality of student-generated questions increased with extended inquiry instruction. Also, students used questions to not only establish verbal communication, but to elaborate on their own thinking and expand or explain the thinking of others. Findings suggested also that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have similar alternative frameworks about scientific phenomena (i. e, causes of lunar phases, reason for the seasons) as do their peers with sight.

50|$|According to Michael J.Bina, the 12th {{president}} of MSB since 2008, public schools cannot fully support <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> {{because they have}} not learned or been trained how to. He states that despite the government’s efforts to make all children regardless of disability feel welcomed and accepted in public schools, “schools for the blind and visually impaired continue to be relevant… The services of these institutions help visually handicapped students to gain access in normal educational settings. They provide the necessary support for attaining skills that would complement the ones they learn from public schools.” Therefore to accomplish this standard that President Bina has set for schools that intend to help the visually impaired, the Maryland School for the Blind, along with many other institutions for the blind, incorporate the Expanded Core Curriculum. Of course these schools teach subjects that are taught in public schools, such as history, math, English, etc, but they are known as the core curriculum. The Expanded Core Curriculum’s aim is to teach students the life skills that will help them become proficient in their core curriculum and eventually live well off on their own. The ECC covers nine aspects that the students need to learn: compensatory or functional academic skills, orientation and mobility, social interaction skills, independent living skills, recreation and leisure skills, career education, use of assistive technology, sensory efficiency skills, and self-determination. Each aspect focuses on a specific set of skills. The orientation and mobility aspect, for example, teaches students how to get around private and public environments - their own home, restaurants, parks, etc., special techniques - trailing, techniques on self-defense, cane skills, etc., and how to travel in unfamiliar or dangerous terrain - revolving doors, iced sidewalks, etc. Then there is the social interaction skills. It may sound unnecessary to those without any visual impairment, but the seeing learn social cues, such as gestures, the meaning of certain facial expressions, body positions, and movements, through what they see and hear. They are able to associate reactions and expressions to certain concepts even if they are not doing so intentionally. Understandably, the visually impaired cannot learn social skills through this method of sight. Therefore, the ECC carefully teaches the {{blind and visually impaired students}} numerous socials skills so that they can interact with those around them whether they be blind or not.|$|E

However, it is also advisable for a general teacher to have some of this knowledge in order to counteract the challenges associated with teaching <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in inclusive classrooms.
