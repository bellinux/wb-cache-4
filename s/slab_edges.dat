50|$|As a slab window develops, {{the mantle}} {{in that region}} becomes {{increasingly}} hot and dry. The decrease in hydration causes arc volcanism to diminish or stop entirely, as magma production in subduction zones generally results from hydration of the mantle wedge due to de-watering of the subducting slab. Slab-window magmatism may then replace this melting, and can be produced by multiple processes, including increased temperatures, mantle circulation producing interaction of supra- and sub-slab mantle, partial melting of subducted <b>slab</b> <b>edges</b> and extension in the upper plate. Mantle flowing upward through the slab window in order {{to compensate for the}} decreased lithospheric volume can also produce decompression melting. Slab window melts are distinguished from calc-alkaline subduction-related magmas by their different chemical compositions.The increase in temperature caused by the presence of a slab window can also produce anomalous high temperature metamorphism in the region between the trench and the volcanic arc.|$|E

Here we summarize published data on CKD rocks and demonstrate a systematic south-to-north change of their compositions from moderately fractionated basalt-andesite tholeiitic series to highly fractionated basalt-rhyolite calc-alkaline series including high-magnesian andesites near the <b>slab</b> <b>edge.</b> Localized <b>slab</b> melting at the <b>slab</b> <b>edge</b> cannot explain these regional geochemical variations. Instead, we propose that the thermal state of the mantle wedge can be the key factor governing the composition of CKD magmas. We integrate the results from petrology and numeric modeling to demonstrate the northward decrease of the mantle wedge temperatures beneath CKD volcanoes, which correlates with decreasing slab dip, length of mantle columns, and magma flux. We envision two petrogenetic models, which relate the composition of erupted magmas to the subduction parameters beneath the CKD. The first model suggests that mantle temperature governs melt-peridotite equilibria and favors generation of andesitic primary melts in cold mantle regions above the shallowly subducting Pacific <b>slab</b> <b>edge.</b> Alternatively, mantle temperature may control magmatic productivity along the CKD, which decreases sharply toward the <b>slab</b> <b>edge</b> and thus allows more extensive magma fractionation deeper in the crust and mixing of highly evolved and mantle-derived magmas to generate Si-rich “primitive” magmas. These results point to a possible casual link between deep mantle and shallow crustal magmatic processes.

We present {{a series of}} free subduction analog models where W was systematically varied to upscaled values of 250 – 3600 km to investigate its effect on subducting plate kinematics and upper mantle return flow around the lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges.</b> We particularly focused on the upwelling component of mantle flow, which might promote decompression melting and could thereby produce intraplate volcanism. The models show that W has a strong control on trench curvature and on the trench retreat, subducting plate, and subduction velocities, generally in good agreement with previous modeling studies. Upper mantle flow velocity maps produced {{by means of a}} stereoscopic particle image velocimetry technique indicate that the magnitude of the subduction-induced mantle flow around the lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges</b> correlates positively with the product of W and trench retreat velocity. For all models an important upwelling component is always produced close to the lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges,</b> with higher magnitudes for wider slabs. The trench-parallel lateral extent of this upwelling component is the same irrespective of W, but its maximum magnitude gets located closer to the subducting plate in the trench-normal direction and it is more focused when W increases. For W ≤ 2000 km the upwelling occurs laterally (in the trench-parallel direction) next to the subslab domain and the mantle wedge domain, while for W ≥ 2000 km it is located only next to the subslab domain and focuses closer to the trench tip, because of stronger poloidal flow in the mantle wedge extending laterally...|$|E
40|$|The north Caribbean plate {{boundary}} zone {{is a broad}} deformation zone with several fault systems and tectonic blocks that move with different velocities. The indentation by the Bahamas Platform (the “Bahamas Collision”) is generally invoked {{as a cause of}} this fragmentation. We propose that a second driver of deformation is {{the western edge of the}} south dipping Puerto Rico slab moving sideways with the North America plate. The westward motion of the <b>slab</b> <b>edge</b> results in a push on the Caribbean plate farther west. We refer to this second mechanism for deformation as “Slab Edge Push. ” The motion of the North America plate relative to the Caribbean plate causes both drivers to migrate from east to west.

These geochemical characteristics are distinct from the southern Central Kamchatka depression volcanoes located above the subducting Pacific slab. Extensive fluid-triggered mantle melting dominates magma genesis beneath the largest Kamchatka volcanoes in the south, whereas low-degree decompression melting of the Pacific asthenospheric mantle is the major magma generation process north of the Pacific <b>slab</b> <b>edge.</b> Quaternary detachment of the subducted Pacific plate fragment resulted in the influx of fertile mantle beneath Kamchatka.

40|$|Mountain {{building}} above subduction zones, such as {{observed in}} the Andes, is enigmatic, and the key parameter controlling the underlying dynamics remains a matter of considerable debate. A global survey of subduction zones is presented here, illustrating the correlation between overriding plate deformation rate and twelve physical parameters: overriding plate velocity, subducting plate velocity, trench velocity, convergence velocity, subduction velocity, subduction zone accretion rate, subducting plate age, subduction polarity, shallow slab dip, deep slab dip, lateral slab edge proximity, and subducting ridge proximity. All correlation coefficients are low (R ≤ 0. 39), irrespective of the global reference frame, relative plate motion model, or overriding plate deformation model, except for the trench velocity (0. 33 - 0. 68, exact value depends on adopted global reference frame) and subduction velocity, which shows an anticorrelation (0. 55 - 0. 57). This implies that no individual parameter can explain overriding plate deformation, except that trench retreat generally corresponds to extension while an approximately stable trench or trench advance generally corresponds to shortening. Understanding {{of the variety of}} strain patterns is obtained when slab edge proximity and overriding plate velocity are combined. Orogenesis occurs in overriding plates bordering central regions of wide subduction zones (≥∼ 4000 km) when the overriding plate is moving trenchward at 0 - 2 cm/yr (e. g., Andes, Japan). Because the center of a wide slab offers large resistance to lateral migration, the overriding plate effectively collides with the subduction hinge, forcing the slab to attain a shallow dip angle (e. g., Nazca and Japan slabs). Overriding plate extension is only found close to lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges</b> or during overriding plate motion away from the center of a wide subduction zone, but in the latter scenario, maximum extension velocities are much lower than in the former scenario. For subduction settings close to lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges,</b> overriding plate motion plays no significant role in overriding plate deformation. Thus, for rapid overriding plate extension, the key ingredient is rapid trench retreat, which only occurs close to lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges,</b> while for overriding plate shortening, the key ingredients are (1) the resistance to rapid trench and hinge retreat, which occurs far from lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges,</b> and (2) trenchward overriding plate motion...|$|E

40|$|The northeastern Caribbean {{exhibits}} high deformation and is fragmented {{by several}} faults into smaller tectonic blocks. One of these faults {{was the site}} of the catastrophic 12 th of January 2010 earthquake. In this thesis I aim to constrain the main forces driving lithospheric deformation in the Caribbean region in general, and specifically in the northeastern Caribbean plate boundary zone. First I determine the lithospheric forces acting on the Caribbean plate. I find that frictional forces, including an extra push at the island of Hispaniola are the main forces driving the Caribbean plate. I investigate the mantle structure underneath the Caribbean plate using a seismic P-wave velocity model. Using the correlation between material temperature and seismic velocity I link the observed mantle structure to tectonic reconstructions, in particular to suggested sites of subduction of cold lithosphere. The tomography confirms Cenozoic subduction under the Lesser Antilles, under the Maracaibo block and under Central America, as well as Mesozoic subduction under the Greater Antilles and Central America. Moreover, the shape of the subducting slab under the Lesser Antilles leads us to infer that that the northeastern Caribbean plate boundary is not a simple STEP. Instead of vertical tearing of the subducting slab, the latter remains attached to the lithosphere at the surface. The particular structure of this slab, resembling an amphitheatre, has important implications for the evolution and deformation of the plate boundary. Finally I investigate these implications of the inferred slab structure in particular its laterally moving edge, using the calculated force magnitudes. The <b>slab</b> <b>edge</b> exerts a push on the overriding Caribbean plate, which henceforth is referred to as “slab edge push”. I compare the <b>slab</b> <b>edge</b> push with the implications of collision with the carbonate Bahamas platform, the generally accepted cause for the observed lithospheric deformation in the northeastern Caribbean plate boundary zone. For the Present, both the <b>slab</b> <b>edge</b> push and the Bahamas collision reproduce the observations of lithospheric deformation. Both scenarios fail to correctly predict the observed Miocene rotation of the Puerto Rico – Virgin Island microplate. Only {{a combination of the two}} scenarios correctly explains the observations of rotation, with the relative contribution of the <b>slab</b> <b>edge</b> larger than the contribution of the Bahamas collision.

We investigate how subducting plate velocity, trench velocity and the partitioning {{of these two}} velocity components vary for individual subduction zone segments {{as a function of}} proximity to the closest lateral slab edge (DSE). We present a global compilation for 207 trench segments from 17 active subduction zones on Earth and three-dimensional numerical models of progressive free subduction of a single oceanic plate that subducts into a stratified mantle. The results show that the subducting plate velocity is always high (≥ 5. 1 cm/yr (models) and ≤ 4. 2 cm/yr (nature)) and trench velocity is always low (≥ 2. 5 cm/yr (models) and ≤ 1. 7 cm/yr (nature)) in the center of wide subduction zones (DSE > 2200 km). Only in regions close to lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges</b> (DSE < 1000 km), be it for narrow or wide subduction zones, can the trench velocity exceed 4 cm/yr (models) and 6 cm/yr (nature) and can the subducting plate velocity go below 4 cm/yr (models) and 2 cm/yr (nature). In general, plate velocities, trench velocities and subduction partitioning are much more variable near <b>slab</b> <b>edges</b> than in the center of wide subduction zones owing to other parameters that affect subduction kinematics.

The experiments model a dense highviscosity plate (subducting lithosphere) overlying a less dense low-viscosity layer (upper mantle). The overriding lithosphere is not incorporated. Several important features of slab behavior were investigated including the temporal variability of hinge line migration, the kinematic behavior of the slab and the subduction-induced upper mantle flow. Both fixed and free trailing edge boundary conditions of the subducting plate were investigated. Results show that hinge line retreat is a natural consequence of subduction of a negatively buoyant slab. The migration rate increases until the slab approaches the upper-lower mantle discontinuity, resulting in a decrease in migration rate followed by a renewed increase and finally approaching a steady state. Slab retreat results in mantle flow, with material initially located underneath the slab flowing around the lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges</b> toward the mantle wedge. Experimental results indicate that all rollback-induced flow occurs around the lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges,</b> forcing the hinge line to attain a convex shape toward the direction of retreat. No signs for poloidal flow underneath the slab tip have been detected. Only a small component of toroidal-type flow was observed underneath slanting slab tips.

40|$|Subducting slabs {{provide the}} main driving force for plate motion and {{flow in the}} Earth's mantle, and geodynamic, seismic and geochemical studies offer insight into slab {{dynamics}} and subduction-induced flow. Most previous geodynamic studies treat subduction zones as either infinite in trench-parallel extent (that is, two-dimensional) or finite in width but fixed in space. Subduction zones and their associated slabs are, however, limited in lateral extent (250 - 7, 400 km) and their three-dimensional geometry evolves over time. Here we show that slab width controls two first-order features of plate tectonics-the curvature of subduction zones and their tendency to retreat backwards with time. Using three-dimensional numerical simulations of free subduction, we show that trench migration rate is inversely related to slab width and depends on proximity to a lateral slab edge. These {{results are consistent with}} retreat velocities observed globally, with maximum velocities (6 - 16 cm yr- 1) only observed close to <b>slab</b> <b>edges</b> (2, 000 km) retreat velocities are always slow (< 2. 0 cm yr- 1). Models with narrow slabs (≤ 1, 500 km) retreat fast and develop a curved geometry, concave towards the mantle wedge side. Models with slabs intermediate in width (∼ 2, 000 - 3, 000 km) are sublinear and retreat more slowly. Models with wide slabs (≥ 4, 000 km) are nearly stationary in the centre and develop a convex geometry, whereas trench retreat increases towards concave-shaped edges.

On each section the in-plane components are mapped {{as well as the}} out-of-plane component for several experimental times. The results indicate that four types of maximum upwelling are produced by the subduction-induced mantle flow. The first two are associated with the poloidal circulation occurring in the mantle wedge and in the sub-slab domain. A third type is produced by horizontal motion and deformation of the frontal part of the slab lying on the 660 km discontinuity. The fourth type results from quasi-toroidal return flow around the lateral <b>slab</b> <b>edges,</b> which produces a maximum upwelling located slightly laterally away from the sub-slab domain and can have another maximum upwelling located laterally away from the mantle wedge. These upwellings occur during the whole subduction process. In contrast, the poloidal circulation in the mantle wedge produces a zone of upwelling that is vigorous during the free falling phase of the slab sinking but that decreases in intensity when reaching the steady-state phase. The position of the maximum upward component and horizontal components of the mantle flow velocity field has been tracked through time. Their time-evolving magnitude is well correlated to the trench retreat rate. The maximum upwelling velocity located laterally away from the subducting plate is ~ 18 - 24 % of the trench retreat rate during the steady-state subduction phase. It is observed in the mid upper mantle but upwellings are produced throughout the whole upper mantle thickness, potentially promoting decompression melting.

Some stations located away from the plate boundaries have their fast directions controlled by the absolute motion of the North American plate. The fast axis for station ZAIG, located in the Mesa Central, is oriented WNW-ESE and is different from all the other measurements in this study...|$|E
40|$|A mesh-free {{approach}} {{is used for}} analysing {{the effect of the}} friction factor on three-dimensional steady state <b>slab</b> <b>edging,</b> which is based on the Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM, Liu et al., 1995) and the material flow formulation for slightly compressible materials (Osakada et al., 1982). In order to cope with the singularity {{at the corner of the}} roll entry, a simple technique with a very thin array of cells at the inlet region adjacent to the plastic deformation zone (Xiong et al., 2003) is used. The results show that the dog-bone shape becomes smaller with the increment of friction factor. The roll separating force and total rolling torque increase with the friction factor...|$|R
50|$|The main slab {{preserves}} {{a significant}} portion of the left leg. Pieces of both femora remain, and a large part of the left femur is preserved in natural articulation at the knee with the lower leg, which preserves only the left tibia in proximal. The left fibula is preserved on the main slab, but the distal elements of the lower leg are broken off at the <b>slab</b> <b>edge.</b> The left metartarsus and foot are preserved only as faint impressions, but these are distinct enough to derive the pedal phalange formula 2-3-4-5-0 that is typical for the genus (Ostrom 1972b) The claw impressions are also relatively distinct and allow for comparison with the forelimb claws.|$|R
40|$|Volcanism in Sicily (Italy) at Mount Etna (0. 5 Ma to present) and the Iblean Plateau (ca. 7. 0 - 1. 1 Ma) remains enigmatic, {{because it}} is located in close {{proximity}} to, but is laterally offset from, the Calabrian subduction zone. Previous work suggests that the volcanism results from a plume or from lateral mantle flow from underneath Africa through a slab window across a lithospheric step. Here I propose that Mount Etna and the Iblean volcanics are related to decompression melting of upper mantle material that is flowing around the southern Ionian <b>slab</b> <b>edge</b> to accommodate east-directed rollback of the Ionian slab that resumed in the Late Miocene. New three-dimensional fluid dynamic subduction models demonstrate that rollback-induced mantle return flow occurs in a quasi-toroidal fashion with a component of downwelling directly below and above the slab, and a component of upwelling next to the subduction zone with maximum upwelling observed next to the subslab region. Significant upwelling (≥ 71 % of the maximum) is observed at 90 - 430 km depth and extends 55 - 660 km away from the projected distance of inferred arc magmatism above the <b>slab</b> <b>edge.</b> The models can explain the large spatial separation {{of as much as}} 430 km between intraplate volcanism in Sicily and arc magmatism during the past ~ 7 m. y., and their contemporaneous activity. The maximum upwelling velocity in the models composes 32 % of the trench rollback velocity. With rollback velocities up to 10 - 19 cm/yr during the past ~ 8 m. y., the models predict maximum rollback-induced upper mantle upwelling velocities of 3. 2 - 6. 1 cm/yr below Sicily...|$|R
