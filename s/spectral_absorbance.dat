Evaluating the non-ionic detergent Dehypon LS 54 for wet cleaning. Dehypon LS 54 is a new commercial detergent available for textile conservation. DRIFTS {{was used to assess}} its removal from fibres in the cleaning process. Detergent traces in washed but unrinsed fabrics showed characteristic spectral peaks. ATR FTIR could not detect any detergent. 2. Identification of oils characterising historical Turkey red (TR) calico dyeing. DRIFTS revealed traces of oils on calico fabric for historical TR manufactured in mid- 19 th century. Distinctive <b>spectral</b> <b>absorbances</b> for oil bonded to fibres were detected in known TR textiles. These were absent in un-oiled calico and textiles that looked like TR but not made by the process. Thus DRIFTS offers a quick, non-invasive analytical screening tool to identify historical TR textiles. 3. Degradation assessment for historical viscose rayon fibres. Viscose rayon is weak when wet - an issue for textile conservation. Its strength reflects excess hydroxyl groups, amorphous polymeric structure, and low degree of polymerisation, and is affected by manufacturing methods and ageing.

40|$|Use of fecal Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (F. NIRS) for {{measuring}} dietary attributes such as crude protein concentration and DM (dry matter) digestibility differs from most NIRS applications in several respects. Importantly, in developing calibration equations, constituent reference values and spectra are measured on different substrates: constituent values {{are determined by}} analyzing diet samples using appropriate laboratory techniques while the NIR spectra are obtained by scanning fecal samples from animals consuming the same diets. Thus the term “diet-fecal pairs” {{is often used to}} describe these samples for developing calibration equations, which are defined as derivative calibrations in Chapter 1. Obviously an important characteristic of diet-fecal pairs is that the sample analyzed for diet reference values must be truly representative of the diet consumed and the sampled feces also must be properly matched with that same diet. A second unusual aspect of F. NIRS technology is that the dietary material of interest is modified by digestion in the gastrointestinal tract before the spectra are measured. Therefore, there is an implicit assumption that there are stable and close correlations between the <b>spectral</b> <b>absorbances</b> of feces at certain wavelengths and the dietary attributes of interest. It appears that deviations from such correlations between diet and fecal components introduce errors with some types of diets. In this paper we discuss the development of F.

We focus on the techniques and methods used for obtaining diet-fecal pairs that meet the requirements of robust calibration equations...|$|R

40|$|The {{prediction}} of infrared (IR) emission spectra from the exhaust gases of rocket plumes finds numerous {{applications in the}} strategic identification of rockets. These rocket fingerprints could be classified, thus allowing for the distinction between friend and foe. Likewise, the plume radiation intensity could also be reduced for stealth purposes, where accurate {{prediction of}} the spectra {{could be used to}} determine whether rockets have the required stealth characteristics during their design phase already. This would reduce the high manufacturing and testing costs involved in later stages. The challenge of predicting the plume radiance is describing the thermodynamic combustion process within the rocket chamber, the plume structure and the rocket plume chemical composition. The factors guiding these processes are the rocket motor design parameters, as well as the rocket motor fuel chemistry. In addition, environmental conditions have a significant implact on the plume structure and the plume chemical composition. Previously, attempts were made to model the middle IR band emission spectra (2 to 5. 5 um) from the rocket fuel chemistry and the physical properties during combustion by making use of techniques such as quantum mechanics and computational fluid dynamids. These methods proved to be too time consuming and the accuracies of the predictions were not acceptable (Roodt, 1998). More recently, Roodt (1998) was the first to show that the IR spectra could be modelled with a multilayer perceptron neural network using the elemental composition and other physical properties of the rocket motor fuel as input. Although these models were successful, there were some indications that they were not optimal and in this investigation the use of multilayer perceptrons similar to the ones used by Roodt (1998), as well as linear partial least squares (PLS) and neural network PLS (with and without weight updating) are considered. In addition, the modelling problem is considered in terms of a forward mapping, i. e. prediction of the emission spectra of the rockets from their design parameters, as well as a reverse mapping, where the rocket design parameters are predicted from the middle-IR <b>spectral</b> <b>absorbances</b> of the rocket plume...|$|R

Proof of shock deformation has been {{detected in the}} crystal structure of several Stardust samples from Comet Wild 2 [2, 3].

Distortions to crystal structure also affect the ideal absorption spectra in the infrared, and [4], thus providing indirect evidence of its impact history and a means of remotely investigating the impact history of small bodies through comparing laboratory spectra with spectra observed by telescopes or spacecraft. -The effects of impacts propagating shock waves through minerals were investigated through laboratory impact experiments. Utilizing NASA Johnson Space Center's Experimental Impact Laboratory, projectiles were fired from the vertical gun at velocities ranging from 2. 0 to 2. 8 km/sec, projected impact velocities between Kuiper Belt Objects. Two types of projectiles were used, including spherical alumina ceramic, whose density mimics that of rock, and cylinders made from the same material that they impacted. The target materials chosen for testing included: OLIVINES forsterite (Mg 2 SiO 4) and fayalite, Fe 2 SiO 4); PYROXENES enstatite (Mg 2 Si 2 O 6) and diopside (MgCaSi 2 O 6); and CARBONATES magnesite (MgCO 3) and siderite (FeCO 3). Targets were impacted at either 25 C or cooled to - 20 C {{to examine the effects}} of temperature, if any, on lattice distortions during the shock propagation. As comets and asteroids can undergo a wide range of temperatures in their orbital lifetimes, the effect of temperature on the equation of state of minerals being shocked needs to be examined for interpreting the results of these experiments. The porosity of the target mineral is varied by either grinding it into a powder/granular texture or as whole mineral rocks to investigate the differences in shock propagation when voids are present. By varying velocity, ambient temperature, and porosity, we can investigate different variables affecting impacts in the solar system. -Data indicates that there is a non-linear relationship between peak shock pressure and the variation in infrared <b>spectral</b> <b>absorbances</b> by the distorted crystal structure.

These crops were native Andean red sweetpotato and purple corn, and new peach, plum and purple carrot varieties from breeding programs. For antioxidant activity, DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) was used as the free radical source and results were expressed on Trolox (6 -hydroxy- 2, 5, 7, 8 -tetramethyl- 2 -carboxylic acid) basis. Purple corn had 2 to 6 times higher antioxidant activity than blueberries analyzed. Red sweetpotato had higher activity than one blueberry and similar as two others. Plum BY 94 M 1945 had higher antioxidant activity than one blueberry while peach BY 94 P 7552 and purple carrot had similar activities. Crops were analyzed by sections, with the epidermis and exocarp having the greatest concentrations of anthocyanins, phenolics and antioxidant activity. Cob epidermis had 6. 6 times higher antioxidant activity than whole corn. Positive correlations were obtained between anthocyanins and phenolics vs. antioxidant activity. Antimicrobial activity of purple corn, red sweetpotato, plum and purple carrot was assayed on Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Enteritidis, and correlated with antioxidant activity, anthocyanin and phenolic content of the extracts. Three antimicrobial assays showed different inhibitory results. Plum extracts showed bacterial inhibition on the three assays and highest inhibition against both bacteria as measured with the plate count assay. Purple carrot and red sweetpotato showed some effect against S. Enteritidis but none against E. coli. Purple corn showed no effect against either bacterium.
