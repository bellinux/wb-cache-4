5|$|The {{first game}} was close at the halfway point, Ottawa leading Dawson three to one. In the second half, the play became violent. Norman Watt of Dawson tripped Ottawa's Art Moore, who retaliated {{with a stick}} {{to the mouth of}} Watt. Watt {{promptly}} knocked Moore out, hitting him on the head with his <b>stick.</b> <b>The</b> game ended 9–2 for Ottawa. The game left a poor taste in the mouth for the Yukoners, who complained that several goals were offside.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{it emerged}} that Dyer had worn gloves to avoid leaving {{fingerprints}} on {{the letters and}} used water to <b>stick</b> <b>the</b> stamps rather than licking them, {{but that he had}} made errors, such as leaving a copy of an extortion demand on a newsagent's photocopier, however, there is speculation that this was done so his letter would reach Tesco by a person other than himself. Although Dyer initially demanded only £200,000, Tesco would have lost an estimated £5million had they complied with Dyer's demand to place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo.|$|E
5|$|In 1080°s two trick modes, trick {{attack and}} contest, players accrue points from {{completed}} tricks. In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players {{to perform a}} series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 25 tricks, {{all of which are}} performed by using a combination of circular positions of the control <b>stick,</b> <b>the</b> R button, and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity and required time. The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.|$|E

5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden <b>stick.</b> <b>The</b> bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E
5|$|In late 2009, Polytron {{presented}} an iPhone game called Power Pill at Pecha Kucha Montreal. The game features a panacean pill that travels through human bodies as its playable protagonist, and {{it uses the}} iPhone's multi-touch screen. GameSetWatch Eric Caoili compared it to Soul Bubbles and Irritating <b>Stick.</b> <b>The</b> game was developed with Alec Holowka of Infinite Ammo, and a level editor {{was expected to be}} included. While working on Fez, Fish revived a game project called SuperHyperCube, which was based on Wiimote motion capture input and stereoscopic navigation. Fish felt the game would work better with the new Kinect motion tracking. The adapted game was a finalist at Indiecade 2011.|$|E
5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or <b>stick,</b> <b>the</b> hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E
50|$|The pleated fan {{consists}} of a mount {{and a set of}} <b>sticks.</b> <b>The</b> outer <b>sticks</b> (<b>the</b> guards) are wider than the others and are often more decorated. At the base of <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> is a pivot which connects the fan and allows it to spread and open. The base is either shaped or rounded off.|$|R
25|$|Stick save: A save {{made with}} <b>the</b> goaltender's <b>stick.</b> On <b>stick</b> saves, <b>the</b> goaltender should not keep a tight grip on <b>the</b> <b>stick,</b> instead {{allowing}} <b>the</b> shot's momentum to push <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> back into <b>the</b> skates/pads, cushioning the blow.|$|R
50|$|In mitred <b>sticking,</b> <b>the</b> profile (known as <b>the</b> <b>sticking)</b> {{is applied}} to the edges of both the rail and stile and then a section of <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> at <b>the</b> ends of each stile is removed leaving a mitred edge which aligns to a similar mitre cut on the ends of <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> on each rail. This {{traditional}} method is more time consuming to complete, hence the popularity of cope and stick for manufactured items.|$|R
5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by the force of the drop. The force of ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in {{the lower part of the}} purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or <b>stick.</b> <b>The</b> hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E
5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or <b>stick,</b> <b>the</b> hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{incident}} in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences. A K'iche' soldier tried to seize bread from a Kaqchikel woman who was selling it in the market. The woman refused the soldier and drove him off with a <b>stick.</b> <b>The</b> Kaqchikel demanded {{the execution of the}} K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded the punishment of the Kaqchikel bread seller. When the Kaqchikel lords refused to hand her over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab. King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj. On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led their people out of the K'iche' capital to found their own capital at Iximche. The exact year of this event is not known with certainty but {{is believed to have been}} between AD 1470 and 1485, with some scholars, such as Guillemín, preferring 1470. The Kaqchikel abandoned their previous capital Chiavar (speculated to be modern Chichicastenango) because it was too close to Q'umarkaj.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player character can move left and right and can jump; unlike the prior trilogy of episodes in the series, known collectively as Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, Keen cannot jump higher using a pogo <b>stick.</b> <b>The</b> levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above so as to give a pseudo-3D effect, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though unlike in Vorticons the player can save their game at any point. In between levels the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral John P. Whitney {{requested}} Shepard's {{services as}} an aide de camp, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard's request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent. He flight tested the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger. The Vought F7U Cutlass {{had a tendency to}} go into an inverted spin during a snap roll. This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot let go of the <b>stick</b> <b>the</b> aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found this was not the case. He was unable {{to break out of the}} spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy cancelled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. Fortunately, he managed to restart the engine.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to <b>stick</b> <b>the</b> grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E

5|$|This king {{established}} {{a number of}} enduring traditions in Imerina. A law imposing a fine on a homeowner whose house fire destroys neighboring property was promulgated by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. He also established the rule that all citizens of Ambohimanga or Antananarivo should pass to offer hasina to the sovereign and wish him or her a long life if a fire ever broke out in their city, and that citizens should likewise congratulate the owners of houses that were spared from destruction if a fire had occurred nearby. He designated specific areas where water could be drawn for use in royal circumcision ceremonies. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana also created three formal ways of pronouncing a sacred and binding oath; these included the mively rano (striking {{the surface of a}} body of water with a <b>stick),</b> <b>the</b> milefon'omby (striking a calf with a spear) and the misotro vokaka (drinking water mixed with ashes taken from a king's tomb). After capturing Ambohitrabiby, he obliged all the andriana (nobles) and other powerful figures in the community there to formalize their allegiance to him by enacting one of these oaths.|$|E
5|$|The Four-Way Elimination Tag Team {{match for}} the NWA World Tag Team Championship was next, in which The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens), who were {{accompanied}} by Jimmy Hart, defended against the teams of Alex Shelley and Sean Waltman, America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), and Team Canada (A-1 and Eric Young). The bout duration was 18 minutes and 1 second. Waltman was advertised to team with Shelley for the encounter, but missed the show due to undisclosed reasons. In this bout, if {{a member of a}} team is pinned or made to submit, then him and his partner is eliminated from the contest; the objective is to be the last team standing. Shelley began the bout alone, until Chris Candido's legitimate brother Johnny Candido, who was in attendance along with several of Candido's family members, jumped the railing to join Shelley as his tag team partner. A bit later, Douglas kicked Candido in the crotch and pinned him with a roll-up pin, thus eliminating Shelley and Candido from the contest. AMW were the next eliminated; Young pinned Harris with a roll-up after A-1 hit Harris across the back with a hockey <b>stick.</b> <b>The</b> Naturals pinned A-1 after slamming him into the mat face-first with their signature tag team Natural Disaster maneuver. Due to the pin, Team Canada were eliminated from the contest, thus giving the victory to The Naturals who retained the NWA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

50|$|With the underhand grip, {{there are}} several {{different}} techniques employed which involve slight variations in finger positioning and usage. Common with all techniques is the usage of the wrist in rotating (a motion like turning a door knob) as the fundamental motion of <b>the</b> <b>stick.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> has started moving, more involved techniques require the exclusive use of the thumb for bouncing <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> when playing at a faster tempo. <b>The</b> <b>stick</b> then rests {{in the space between}} the thumb and index finger, and the two fingers close around <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> with <b>the</b> thumb atop the index at the first knuckle. The middle finger then rests slightly on top side of <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> (typically <b>the</b> side fingertip is the only contact made). <b>The</b> <b>stick</b> then rests on the cuticle of the ring finger with the little finger supporting the ring finger from below.|$|R
