30|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the patterns in moisture content found in the seven other species, the non-native <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> had much higher moisture content than all other species throughout the growing season. Even on its driest sampling date, the moisture content of <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> was still more than double a probable value for moisture of extinction. One caveat to our findings is that limited pilot sampling on 28 June 2013 confirmed that the new <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> location we moved to in July was more mesic than our original <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> location. Mean moisture content for <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> at our initial location was 239 % compared to 290 % at the location we moved to (a 18 % difference relative to the new location). <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> was also sampled from two other locations in the Bald Hills that had mean moisture contents of 201 % and 203 %, a 31 % and 30 % difference relative to our new <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> location, respectively. On 25 September 2012, however, the relative difference between six of the <b>grass</b> species and <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> ranged from 84 % to 95 % (relative to <b>Harding</b> <b>grass),</b> and the relative difference between <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> and California fescue was 58 % (relative to <b>Harding</b> <b>grass).</b> It is unlikely that sampling in the more mesic location would negate the general pattern we reported, as the magnitude of difference between <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> and the other species was so large. Additionally, at our sampling location, <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> culms were noticeably greener late into the fall compared to the other co-occurring species. Although the inferences we are able to make from a single study location are somewhat limited, the patterns that we observed are still noteworthy.|$|R

30|$|The high {{moisture}} content of <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> may {{have implications for}} prescribed fire. In the Bald Hills, known <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> infestations totaled approximately 33 ha in 2012, with infestation densities ranging from scattered individuals to dense monocultures (S. Samuels, personal communication). Depending on the density and extent of <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> infestations, combined with burn-day weather conditions of wind speed and relative humidity, as well as topographic position, this species may act to dampen fire intensity. Because of the other threats it poses to native species, park managers are currently trying to eradicate this species from the Bald Hills. The potential impediments that this species may pose to prescribed burning may serve as additional motivation for managers to eradicate this species from fire-dependent ecosystems.|$|R

30|$|The grass populations sampled, for {{all species}} except <b>Harding</b> <b>grass,</b> were spread {{throughout}} a 150 m × 150 m area; the <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> population {{was less than}} 1 km away. Species were sampled {{in the same order}} on each date to maximize efficiency and maintain consistency. To evaluate the effect that time of collection had on fuel moisture values, we sampled from a subset of four species every two hours over an eight-hour period, on a single day on 10 October 2012. Two native species, California fescue and blue wildrye, and two non-native species, <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> and sweet vernal grass, were sampled. We sampled these species at two-hour intervals between 0900 hr and 1700 hr. Due to the small amount of <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> remaining at our study site, only two to three samples of this species were collected at each interval. The number of samples collected for the other species depended upon the abundance of easily accessible material; three samples were collected for blue wildrye, four for California fescue, and five for sweet vernal grass. Throughout the eight-hour sampling period, the air temperature ranged from 12.8 °C to 16.7 °C, relative humidity ranged from 62 % to 80 %, and wind speeds ranged from 3.2 km h− 1 to 9.7 km h− 1.|$|R

5000|$|... —2013 UPDATE on {{populations in}} San Mateo County, Montata Mountain, {{north of town}} of Montara: Specific {{consistent}} counts of this species are difficult due to the low stature, extending flowering period, and difficult terrain, making year-to-year comparisons problematic. 2013 surveys have clearly shown that Population 4 still exists above the existing <b>harding</b> <b>grass</b> invasion, with at least 500 plants found in this area.—2014 UPDATE. Hand-weeding of the area around Population No. 3 during summer 2011 has significantly lowered the weed plant cover of the area, with the big rattlesnake grass (Briza) originally at 61% cover in 2011 is now down to 1% cover in 2014.

30|$|By {{the early}} 1990 s, tall oatgrass (Arrhenatherum elatius [L.] J. Presl & C. Presl), {{sweet vernal grass}} (Anthoxanthum odoratum L.), and dogtail (Cynosurus echinatus L.), {{were among the most}} {{dominant}} non-native species in the grasslands of the Bald Hills (Saenz 1983, Grenier 1989, Arguello 1994). <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> (Phalaris aquatica L.) was first detected in the park at this time, and quickly spread throughout the grasslands. Due to its tendency to form dense monocultures, <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> is currently the most problematic non-native grass in the park (S. Samuels, National Park Service, Orick, California, USA, personal communication). A prescribed fire program was initiated in the early 1990 s to control invasion of the native conifer Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb] Franco var. menziesii) and to maintain native herbaceous species richness (Underwood et al. 2003). The fire season for the area spans early summer to late fall; prescribed fires typically occur between September and early November each year.|$|R
30|$|The {{non-native}} dogtail {{had significantly}} lower mean moisture content {{than all other}} species except sweet vernal grass and California oatgrass (Tukey HSD P < 0.05). On 6 August, the mean moisture content of dogtail and California oatgrass were 21 % and 42 %, respectively. They were the only species to fall below an ignition threshold at this date, assuming a conservative moisture of extinction value of 55 % (Dimitrakopoulos et al. 2010). Mean moisture content of all other species ranged from 57 % to 182 % in August. By the next sampling date, 5 September, the mean moisture content for all other species except <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> and California fescue ranged from 6 % to 29 % (Figure 3) and fell below a probable threshold for moisture of extinction. On this date, the mean moisture content of California fescue was 59 %, while the moisture content of <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> remained much higher {{with a mean of}} 117 %.|$|R

It had wider molars than its predecessors, which are {{believed}} to have been used for crunching the <b>hard</b> <b>grasses</b> of the steppes. The hind legs, which were relatively short, had side toes equipped with small hooves, but they probably only touched the ground when running. Merychippus radiated into at least 19 additional grassland species.|$|R

30|$|The {{relative}} {{dominance of}} non-native species in a fuelbed {{will have a}} significant impact on the overall contribution of the species on the fire regime. A survey of understory vegetation in the oak woodlands of the Bald Hills found that the mean cover of dogtail was 9 % (Livingston 2014). Comparatively, mean cover for tall oatgrass, sweet vernal grass, California brome, blue wildrye, and California fescue in oak woodland understories ranged from only 1 % to 4 %. California oatgrass occurred in woodland understory sampling rarely, and <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> was not detected in this survey (Livingston 2014). California oatgrass is one of the more common native grass species in the prairies of the Bald Hills, however, and <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> has primarily invaded prairies. Although its overall cover was low in the oak woodland understory survey, California fescue is dominant in several areas of the Bald Hills (Engber et al. 2011), and where it does occur, its cover is generally very high. The non-native species that we studied commonly invade other grasslands and woodlands ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest (Dennehy et al. 2011, Stanley et al. 2011) and elsewhere (Hitchcock 1971), making the results of this study relevant at broader geographic scales.|$|R

30|$|To compare fuel {{moisture}} {{of native}} and non-native grasses, we sampled eight grass species during the 2012 growing season. We concentrated sampling over 131 days from 6 June through 14 October 2012 within in a 150 m × 150 m area within the East and West Williams Ridge burn units. The study site {{is representative of}} a typical grassland in the Bald Hills, based on the species composition (Figure 1). Away from edges of oak woodlands and conifer forest, grasslands in the Bald Hills are largely devoid of woody fuels (Engber et al. 2011). The burn units were 22.5 km inland from the Pacific Ocean at an elevation of 730 m. Both units were located within 1 km of a remote automated weather station (RAWS) located at Schoolhouse Peak (SHUC 1). Williams Ridge West was burned in 1992, and both units were burned in 1995, 1997, 2005, and on 19 October 2012. One study species, <b>Harding</b> <b>grass,</b> was not abundant in the Williams Ridge burn units so a population was selected in a separate burn unit within 1 km of the other species. Following sampling in June, the initial patch of <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> selected for our study was accidentally sprayed with herbicide. For all other months, sampling occurred approximately 10 m downslope of the original population.|$|R
