500|$|Destiny Hope Cyrus {{was born}} November 23, 1992, in Franklin, Tennessee, to Leticia Jean [...] "Tish" [...] Cyrus (née Finley) and singer Billy Ray Cyrus. Cyrus {{was born with}} {{supraventricular}} tachycardia, a condition which causes an abnormal resting heart rate. Her birth name, Destiny Hope, reflects her parents' belief that she would accomplish great things, and she was given the nickname [...] "Smiley", later shortened to [...] "Miley", because she often <b>smiled</b> <b>as</b> an infant. She changed her name to Miley Ray Cyrus; her middle name honors her grandfather, Democratic politician Ronald Ray Cyrus.|$|E
2500|$|Kennedy was {{presented}} to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during her father's service as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Her father presented his daughters instead of, more customarily, choosing about thirty young American debutantes, a decision which earned him favor in the press. Kennedy's [...] "slowness" [...] was also unconventional and daring for a debut (two of the queen's nieces remained in a mental hospital because they were mentally ill). Young women would practice the rather complicated royal curtsey, sometimes learning the performance at the Vacani School of Dancing near Harrods. She practiced for hours. She wore a gown made of white tulle with a net train and carried a bouquet of lilies of the valley. Her sister Kathleen was described as [...] "stunning, but {{she was only a}} shadow of Rosemary's beauty." [...] Just as Rosemary was about to [...] "glide off" [...] by stepping to the right, she tripped and nearly fell. Rose Kennedy never discussed the incident and treated the debut as a triumph. The crowd made no sign, the King and the Queen <b>smiled</b> <b>as</b> if nothing had happened, and it is unknown whether Rosemary was aware of her own stumble.|$|E
