40|$|OBJECTIVES Calcium {{silicate}} cements are biocompatible dental materials applicable {{in contact}} with vital tissue. The novel tricalcium <b>silicate</b> <b>cement</b> Biodentine™ offers properties superior to commonly used mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate its cytocompatibility and ability to induce differentiation and mineralization in three-dimensional cultures of dental pulp stem cells after direct contact with the material. MATERIALS AND METHODS Test materials included a new tricalcium silicate (Biodentine™, Septodont, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France), MTA (ProRoot® MTA, DENSPLY Tulsa Dental Specialities, Johnson City, TN, USA), glass ionomer (Ketac™ Molar Aplicap™, 3 M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany), human dentin disks and polystyrene. Magnetic activated cell sorting for to the surface antigen STRO- 1 was performed to gain a fraction enriched with mesenchymal stem cells. Samples were allowed to set and dental pulp stem cells in collagen carriers were placed on top. Scanning electron microscopy of tricalcium <b>silicate</b> <b>cement</b> surfaces with and without cells was conducted. Cell viability was measured for 14  days by MTT assay. Alkaline phosphatase activity was evaluated (days 3, 7, and 14) and expression of mineralization-associated genes (COL 1 A 1, ALP, DSPP, and RUNX 2) was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR. Nonparametric statistical analysis for cell viability and alkaline phosphatase data was performed to compare different materials as well as time points (Mann-Whitney U test, α[*]=[*] 0. 05). RESULTS Cell viability was highest on tricalcium <b>silicate</b> <b>cement,</b> followed by MTA. Viability on glass ionomer cement and dentin disks was significantly lower. Alkaline phosphatase activity was lower in cells on new tricalcium <b>silicate</b> <b>cement</b> compared to MTA, whereas expression patterns of marker genes were alike. CONCLUSIONS Increased cell viability and similar levels of mineralization-associated gene expression in three-dimensional cell cultures on the novel tricalcium <b>silicate</b> <b>cement</b> and mineral trioxide aggregate indicate that the material is cytocompatible and bioactive.

This project aimed to investigate the potential of calcium <b>silicate</b> <b>cements</b> to liberate dentine extracellular matrix (dECM) components, characterise growth factors present and determine if these dECM components, or any specific growth factor characterised, had bioactive effects on pulp wound healing. dECM was solubilised from human dentine using solutions of EDTA, calcium hydroxide, white MTA, grey MTA and Biodentine®. Proteomic analysis using cytokine arrays and multiplex ELISA demonstrated {{the presence of a}} broad range of growth factors, which were differentially released, suggesting that each agent had differing capacities to liberate such molecules. In vitro analysis of pulp cells exposed to dECM components released by calcium <b>silicate</b> <b>cements,</b> demonstrated increased capacity for cell proliferation and chemotaxis.

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of AgNPs on physicochemical/mechanical properties and antibacterial activity of white MTA (WMTA) and PC associated with ZrO 2. The following materials were evaluated: WMTA; PC 70 % + ZrO 2 30 %; WMTA+ AgNPs; and PC 70 % + ZrO 2 30 % + AgNPs. The study evaluated radiopacity, setting time, pH, compressive strength and solubility. For radiopacity analysis, radiographs were made alongside an aluminum (Al) step wedge. To evaluate the antibacterial activity, direct contact test was performed on planktonic cells and Enterococcus faecalis biofilm induced on bovine root dentin for 14 days. The experimental periods were 5 and 15 h. Data were obtained as CFU mL- 1. The obtained data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey tests (p< 0. 05). The addition of AgNPs to WMTA increased the pH, lowered the solubility and the initial and final setting times. The addition of AgNPs to PC/ZrO 2 maintained the pH, lowered the solubility, and increased the setting time and compressive strength. The radiopacity of all materials was higher than 4 mmAl.

The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the surface structure and composition of a cement paste under wet conditions and in real time during setting by environmental scanning electron microscopy connected with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (ESEM-EDX) and micro-Raman techniques. Methods: White Pro Root MTA and experimental white tetrasilicate cement (wTC) and wTC containing bismuth oxide (wTC-Bi) were studied. Cement disks were analyzed 10 minutes after powder-liquid mixing (freshly prepared samples) and after immersion in Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees C for 24 hours (24 -hour-aged samples). Results: Freshly prepared wet cements at ESEM-EDX exposed an irregular surface (displaying calcium, silicon, aluminum, chlorine reflexes, and bismuth traces in MTA and wTC-Bi) with needle-like and cubic-hexagonal shaped crystals. Aggregates of spheroidal Ca-P-rich crystals (spherulites) appeared on the surface of 24 -hour-aged samples. The starting unhydrated powders displayed the typical Raman bands of Portland cement components: alite, belite, and calcium sulfate (only as anhydrite in MTA and as both anhydrite and gypsum in wTC and wTC-Bi). MTA powder showed higher amount of calcium carbonate and lower quantities of anhydrite and higher crystallinity of the silicate component, leading to a slower hydration reaction. Products/markers of hydration reactions were present on fresh samples; ettringite formed on the surface of all the cements; calcium hydroxide (portlandite) was detected only on the surface of wTC, but no conclusion can be drawn on wTC-Bi and MTA because of the interference of bismuth oxide. Calcium phosphate and calcite/aragonite bands were detected on all 24 -hour-aged cements; portlandite was no longer detected on wTC.

Changes in the surface roughness of restoration materials after tooth brushing are inevitable, and the abrasion is known to increase the possibility of dental plaque accumulation. Aim of the study: To evaluate in vitro surface roughness changes of different dental restorative materials after tooth brushing simulation. Material and methods: Fifty specimens of two composite materials (Evicrol, Super-Cor), two glass ionomer materials (Glassfill, Kavitan Cem) and a <b>silicate</b> <b>cement</b> (Fritex) were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each group of specimens was divided in three subgroups for tooth brushing simulation: using {{two different types of}} toothpaste and without toothpaste. Before and after 153 hours of tooth brushing simulation with a custom-made device, the surface roughness was measured with a surface roughness tester. Statistical analysis was performed after collecting the data. Results: All materials exhibited changes in surface roughness after the use of both toothpastes. The self-curing composite showed the less change and glass ionomer materials showed the greatest changes in surface roughness. Conclusions: The surface changes of dental materials depended on their composition and the cleaning procedure. Although self-curing composite was the most resistant to surface changes, its surface roughness values were high.

In addition, an in vitro tooth model was used to study the interactions between these materials and PDL cells. For this purpose, human extracted incisors were sectioned at the enamel-cementum junction; root canals were prepared, sterilized, and filled with lateral condensation with both materials. The root apices were dipped in the culture medium for 24 hours. These conditioned media were used to investigate their effects on human PDL cells. Cell proliferation was investigated with the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MU) assay, and the secretion of angiogenic and osteogenic growth factors was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: BioRoot RCS has less toxic effects on PDL cells than PCS and induced a higher secretion of angiogenic and osteogenic growth factors than PCS. Conclusions: Taken together, these preclinical {{results suggest that the}} calcium <b>silicate</b> <b>cement</b> (BioRoot RCS) has a higher bioactivity than the zinc oxide eugenol sealer (PCS) on human PDL cells...|$|E
40|$|Tricalcium {{silicate}} cements {{have been}} successfully employed in the biomedical field as bioactive bone and dentin substitutes, with widely acclaimed osteoactive properties. This research analyzed the effects of different tricalcium <b>silicate</b> <b>cement</b> formulations on the temporal osteoactivity profile of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMW-MSCs). These cells were exposed to four commercially available tricalcium <b>silicate</b> <b>cement</b> formulations in osteogenic differentiation medium. After 1, 3, 7 and 10 days, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were performed to detect expression of the target osteogenic markers ALP, RUNX 2, OSX, OPN, MSX 2 and OCN. After 3, 7, 14 and 21 days, alkaline phosphatase assay was performed to detect changes in intracellular enzyme level. An Alizarin Red S assay was performed after 28 days to detect extracellular matrix mineralization. In the presence of tricalcium silicate cements, target osteogenic markers were downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels at all time points. Intracellular alkaline phosphatase enzyme levels and extracellular mineralization of the experimental groups {{were not significantly different}} from the untreated control. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed increases in downregulation of RUNX 2, OSX, MSX 2 and OCN with increasing time of exposure to the tricalcium silicate cements, while ALP showed peak downregulation at day 7. For Western blotting, OSX, OPN, MSX 2 and OCN showed increased downregulation with increased exposure time to the tested cements. Alkaline phosphatase enzyme levels generally declined after day 7. Based on these results, it is concluded that tricalcium silicate cements do not induce osteogenic differentiation of hBM-MSCs in vitro...|$|E
5000|$|Bismuth oxide is {{occasionally}} used in dental {{materials to}} make them more opaque to X-rays than the surrounding tooth structure. In particular, bismuth (III) oxide has been used in hydraulic <b>silicate</b> <b>cements</b> (HSC), originally in [...] "MTA" [...] (a trade name, standing for the chemically-meaningless [...] "mineral trioxide aggregate") from 10 to 20% by mass with a mixture of mainly di- and tri-calcium silicate powders. Such HSC is used for dental treatments such as: apicoectomy, apexification, pulp capping, pulpotomy, pulp regeneration, internal repair of iatrogenic perforations, repair of resorption perforations, root canal sealing and obturation. MTA sets into a hard filling material when mixed with water. Some resin-based materials also include an HSC with bismuth oxide. Problems have allegedly arisen with bismuth oxide because it is claimed not to be inert at high pH, specifically that it slows the setting of the HSC, but also over time can lose color by exposure to light or reaction with other materials that may have been used in the tooth treatment, such as sodium hypochlorite.|$|R

40|$|Wells 13 / 28 - 2, 13 / 28 - 3 and 13 / 29 - 1, {{located in}} the Inner Moray Firth, {{penetrated}} a predominantly arenaceous marine to non-marine sedimentary complex of Oxfordian age banked up against an argillized Caledonian granite. These sediments exhibit a close relationship between the pattern of mineral diagenesis and the physico-chemical conditions of the original depositional environment. Both marine and non-marine lithofacies have undergone a complex alternation of mineral cementation and grain dissolution. The marine lithofacies is dominated by <b>silicate</b> <b>cements.</b> The earliest cements consist of chert, phosphate and pyrite; these were followed, sequentially, byfine-grained quartz and minor mica, quartz overgrowth, dolomite (non-ferroan toferroan), and calcite (non-ferroan toferroan). The non-marine lithofacies i dominated by clay mineral cements. The earliest cement is kaolinite, followed by quartz overgrowth cement, hen by mica cement and, finally, by a late phase of kaolinite cement. The porewaters esponsible for the non-marine mica cement have caused extensive argiUization of the granite occurring adjacent to the non-marine sediments inWell 13 / 29 - 1. K-Ar radioisotope dating suggests hat the precipitation of the mica cement and the granite argillization both took place sometime during the late Early Cretaceous (95 - 115 Ma, lat...|$|R
