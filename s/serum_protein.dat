25|$|PON1 {{in humans}} is encoded by the PON1 gene {{which is located}} on the long arm of {{chromosome}} 7. Although many nutritional, life-style and pharmaceutical modulators of PON1 are known., by far the biggest effect on PON1 activity levels, which can vary by over 40 fold between individuals, is through PON1 genetic polymorphisms. The coding region PON1-Q192R polymorphism determines a substrate dependent effect on activity. Some substrates e.g. paraoxon are hydrolysed faster by the R- isoform while others such as diazoxon and lipid-peroxides are hydrolysed more rapidly by the Q- isoform. Both the coding region PON1-L55M and the promoter region PON1-T-108C polymorphisms are associated with different serum concentrations and therefore activities. The 55L allele results in significantly higher PON1 mRNA and <b>serum</b> <b>protein</b> levels and therefore activity compared to the 55M allele. The -108C allele has greater promoter activity than the -108T allele which results in different serum activities.|$|E

Moreover, the porous structure of BCP ceramics had a strong impact on the elution of the adsorbed <b>serum</b> <b>proteins.</b> The microporous structure could promote the adsorption of <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> on BCP ceramics and slowed down their release rate, but the 3 D interconnected macropores were favorable for the elution and release of <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> from the BCP surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between {{three of the}} most abundant bovine <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> (<b>serum</b> albumin, transferrin and IgG) with Pb was investigated using electrochemistry. The data was used to construct a new theoretical model of Pb binding to the high-abundance <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> under non-ideal conditions. The binding constants (β) of Pb to the individual proteins and a mixture of proteins were measured according to a new theoretical equation (non-ideal state) as well as the McGhee-Von Hippel equation (ideal state). Differences between the models suggested that the β values obtained using the non-ideal state model was more realistic. Protein-protein interactions and micro-environmental influences affected binding between Pb and the high-abundance <b>serum</b> <b>proteins.</b> We included a micro-environmental influence factor for the model (F), which accurately quantified the effect of micro-environment of the proteome of Pb binding with the <b>serum</b> <b>proteins.</b> This research provides a useful reference of theoretical and experimental work regarding heavy-metal binding interactions with <b>serum</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Proteins {{are very}} large {{molecules}} – macro-biopolymers – made from monomers called amino acids. An amino acid {{consists of a}} carbon atom bound to four groups. One is an amino group, NH2, and one is a carboxylic acid group, COOH (although these exist as NH3+ and COO− under physiologic conditions). The third is a simple hydrogen atom. The fourth is commonly denoted [...] "R" [...] and is different for each amino acid. There are 20 standard amino acids, each containing a carboxyl group, an amino group, and a side-chain (known as an [...] "R" [...] group). [...] The [...] "R" [...] group is what makes each amino acid different, and {{the properties of the}} side-chains greatly influence the overall three-dimensional conformation of a protein. Some amino acids have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance, glutamate functions as an important neurotransmitter. Amino acids can be joined via a peptide bond. In this dehydration synthesis, a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid's amino group to the carbon of the other's carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is called a dipeptide, and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than thirty) are called peptides or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title proteins. As an example, the important blood <b>serum</b> <b>protein</b> albumin contains 585 amino acid residues.|$|E

At the respective doses, mean peak serum and plasma concentrations of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.4 μg/mL are attained approximately one hour after dosing. The effective half-life of norfloxacin in serum and plasma is 3–4 hours. Steady-state concentrations of norfloxacin will be attained {{within two days}} of dosing. [...] Renal excretion occurs by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion {{as evidenced by the}} high rate of renal clearance (approximately 275 mL/min). Within 24 hours of drug administration, 26 to 32% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as norfloxacin with an additional 5-8% being recovered in the urine as six active metabolites of lesser antimicrobial potency. Only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. Fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose. [...] Two to three hours after a single 400-mg dose, urinary concentrations of 200 μg/mL or more are attained in the urine. In healthy volunteers, mean urinary concentrations of norfloxacin remain above 30 μg/mL for at least 12 hours following a 400-mg dose. The urinary pH may affect the solubility of norfloxacin. Norfloxacin is least soluble at urinary pH of 7.5 with greater solubility occurring at pHs above and below this value.

40|$|Bacterial {{cell wall}} components, such LPS and LTA, are potent {{initiators}} of an inflammatory response {{that can lead}} to septic shock. The advances in the past were centered around membrane-bound receptors and intracellular events, but our understanding of the initial interactions of these bacterial components with <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> as they enter the bloodstream remain unclear. In this study we identified several <b>serum</b> <b>proteins,</b> which are involved in the innate recognition of bacterial products. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry we performed proteomic analysis of LPS- and LTA-binding <b>serum</b> <b>proteins.</b> We isolated <b>proteins</b> from normal <b>serum</b> that can interact with LPS and LTA. Fluorescent binding experiments and cytokine assays revealed that <b>serum</b> <b>proteins,</b> such as apolipoprotein, LDL, transferrin and holotransferrin could neutralize LPS/LTA binding as well as the subsequent inflammatory response, suggesting that <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> modulate LPS/LTA-induced responses. When compared with the proteomic profile of serum from septic patients it was shown that these proteins were in lower abundance. Investigation of <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> in 25 critically ill patients with a mortality rate of 40 % showed statistically higher levels of these proteins in survivors.

40|$|Abstract: Serum proteomic {{analysis}} {{can be a}} valuable approach for the discovery of protein biomarkers for early detection or monitoring of a disease. In this study, two analytical methods were compared for quantification of <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> in patients with oral cancer. In the first approach, we quantified <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> between oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and healthy control subjects by performing in-solution digestion of <b>serum</b> <b>proteins,</b> isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling of the resulting peptides, strong cation exchange (SCX) fractionation of labeled peptides and finally capillary liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the peptides. In the second approach, we first separated <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> with SDS-PAGE. The gel-separated proteins were then digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were labeled with iTRAQ and analyzed with LC-MS/MS for protein quantification. A total of 319 <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> were quantified with the first proteomic approach whereas a total of 281 proteins were quantified by the second proteomic approach.
