5|$|In 1988, the East German {{leadership}} considered {{proposals to}} replace the expensive and intrusive fortifications with a high-technology system codenamed Grenze 2000. Drawing on technology used by the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> during the Soviet–Afghan War, it would have replaced the fences with sensors and detectors. However, the plan was never implemented.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s old {{ammunition}} stocks for the D-1 {{were removed from}} the Soviet inventory. The only shells retained were the OF-530, O-530, G-530/G-530Sh, and possibly chemical shells. The <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> also possessed a 152mm nuclear shell, {{but it is not clear}} whether that shell could be used with the D-1.|$|E
5|$|A curiosity is the {{underground}} (formerly ground-level) restored {{portion of the}} Jewish cemetery where 19th-century Rabbi Moses Sofer is buried, located {{at the base of}} the castle hill near the entrance to a tram tunnel.

5|$|Although war pigeons {{and mobile}} dovecotes were used {{extensively}} during the Second World War, {{it is unclear}} to what extent, if any, they were employed for aerial photography. According {{to a report in}} 1942, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>army</b> discovered abandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-minute intervals, as well as dogs trained to carry pigeons in baskets. On the allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported that the American Signal Corps was aware of the possibility of adopting the technique.|$|E

5|$|From 1918–1940, when Estonia was independent, {{the small}} Swedish {{community}} was well treated. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, used Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden {{before the end}} of World War II, that is, before the invasion of Estonia by the <b>Soviet</b> <b>army</b> in 1944. Only a handful of speakers remain.|$|E
5|$|From 26 to 28 June 1944, Shanina {{participated in}} the {{elimination}} of the encircled German troops near Vitebsk during the Vitebsk–Orsha Offensive. As the <b>Soviet</b> <b>army</b> advanced further westward, from 8 to 13 July of the same year, Shanina and her sisters-in-arms took part in the struggle for Vilnius, which had been under German occupation since 24 June 1941. The Germans were finally driven out from Vilnius on 13 July 1944. During the Soviet summer offensives of that year Shanina managed to capture three Germans.|$|E
5|$|In {{answer to}} the Prague Spring, on 20 August 1968, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army,</b> {{together}} with most of their Warsaw Pact allies, invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion {{was followed by a}} wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs and Slovaks initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000. The invasion sparked intense protests from Yugoslavia, Romania, China, and from Western European communist parties.|$|E

5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
5|$|Lukashenko went to Alexandria {{secondary}} school. He {{graduated from}} the Mogilev Pedagogical Institute (now Mogilev State A. Kuleshov University) in 1975, after 4 years studying there and the Belarusian Agricultural Academy in Horki in 1985. He served in the Border Guard (frontier troops) from 1975 to 1977, where he was an instructor of the political department of military unit No. 2187 of the Western Frontier District in Brest and in the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> from 1980 to 1982. In addition, he led an All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) chapter in Mogilev from 1977 to 1978. While in the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army,</b> Lukashenko was a deputy political officer of the 120th Guards Motor Rifle Division, which was based in Minsk. In 1979, he {{joined the ranks of}} the CPSU. After leaving the military, he became the deputy chairman of a collective farm in 1982 and in 1985. He was promoted to the post of director of the Gorodets state farm and construction materials plant in the Shklov district. In 1987, he was appointed {{as the director of the}} Gorodets state farm in Shkloŭ district and in early 1988, was one of the first in Mogilev Region to introduce a leasing contract to a state farm.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{writes that}} as a result of Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>army,</b> but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E
50|$|Given {{the reduced}} {{manpower}} {{of their land}} forces at the time, the Germans believed {{the best way to}} seize the initiative would be to attack in the West against the smaller Allied forces rather than against the vast <b>Soviet</b> <b>armies.</b> Even the encirclement and destruction of multiple <b>Soviet</b> <b>armies,</b> as in 1941, would still have left the Soviets with a numerical superiority.|$|R
50|$|By {{the third}} week of August <b>Soviet</b> <b>armies</b> east of Bogodukov had begun to {{encircle}} Kharkov from the west and south, and off 6th Guards <b>Army’s</b> other flank <b>Soviet</b> <b>armies</b> were advancing far to the west of Akhtyrka. These advances left 6th Guards Army on a somewhat secondary sector of the frontline. At the end of September Chistiakov’s army was withdrawn from Voronezh Front into the High Command Reserve.|$|R
5000|$|Differences between Bock's {{strategic}} {{intent and}} {{the intent of}} High Command repeatedly surfaced. Bock continued to favor a direct drive toward Moscow, bypassing <b>Soviet</b> <b>armies</b> and leaving them to be destroyed by infantry, which advanced on foot well behind tank columns. Bock argued that if encirclement was truly necessary then instead of diverting his tanks north and south to encircle and destroy smaller <b>Soviet</b> <b>armies,</b> a larger encirclement should be made eastward toward the Dvina-Dnieper River basins. Hitler decided against this plan, and insisted that the pockets containing <b>Soviet</b> <b>armies</b> must be destroyed before advancing deeper into Russia. Bock, enraged by this decision, was quoted as saying: [...] "We are permitting our greatest chance of success to escape us by this restriction placed on our armor!" ...|$|R
5|$|The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 {{occurred}} {{shortly after}} Khrushchev arranged {{the removal of}} Hungary's Stalinist leader Mátyás Rákosi. In response to a popular uprising, the new regime formally disbanded the secret police, declared its intention {{to withdraw from the}} Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. The <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> invaded. Thousands of Hungarians were arrested, imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union, and approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary in the chaos. Hungarian leader Imre Nagy and others were executed following secret trials.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> {{captured}} {{large numbers}} of German armored vehicles, including Panzer IVs (Russian designation T-4). Some of them were pressed into temporary service and some others were used for training. Sometimes, captured tanks were used in different temporary units or as single tanks. While captured Tigers and Panthers were only permitted to be used until they broke down, {{the simplicity of the}} Panzer IV and the large number of captured parts allowed for repair and continued use.|$|E
5|$|The ghetto was {{liquidated}} between 22 and 24 September 1943. Three thousand {{six hundred}} residents went to labor camps (including 2,000 sent to labor camps in Vilnius); 5,000 {{women and children}} went to Majdanek, where they were gassed to death; and a few hundred elderly and sick were sent to Ponary and shot. The few Jews who remained in Vilnius were shot just before the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> arrived. A few FPO members escaped to the nearby forests.|$|E

5|$|Vazgen Sargsyan {{was born}} in Ararat village, Soviet Armenia, near the Turkish border, on 5 March 1959, to Greta and Zaven Sargsyan. After {{finishing}} secondary school in his village, he attended the Yerevan Institute of Physical Culture from 1976 to 1979. He worked as a physical education teacher at the secondary school in Ararat from 1979 to 1983. Therefore, he was exempt from conscription in the <b>Soviet</b> <b>army.</b> From 1983 to 1986, he was the Young Communist League (Komsomol) leader at the Ararat Cement Factory.|$|E
5|$|Activated in 1921, the {{division}} was created as an infantry unit {{with a focus}} on nighttime combat operations. Deployed during World War II, {{the division}} saw almost 200 days of fighting in northwestern Europe as it fought through France, Belgium, and western Germany, fighting back several fierce German counterattacks as it advanced through the theater throughout late 1944 and 1945. This was the only combat duty that the 104th Infantry Division has served during its history. At the end of the fighting on 7 May 1945 (V-E Day), this division was in central Germany opposite the troops of its allies from the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army.</b>|$|E
