5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E
25|$|One famous Nixe {{of recent}} German folklore, {{deriving}} from 19th-century literature, was Lorelei; {{according to the}} legend, {{she sat on the}} rock at the Rhine which now bears her name, and lured fishermen and boatmen to the dangers of the reefs with the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> In Switzerland there is a legend (myth) of a sea-maid or Nixe that lived in lake Zug (the lake is in the Canton of Zug).|$|E
500|$|On 16 May 2011, Bush {{released}} the album, Director's Cut. The album, which Bush has {{described as an}} entirely new project rather than a collection of mere remixes, contains 11 tracks of substantially reworked material from her earlier albums, The Sensual World and The Red Shoes, {{all of which have}} been recorded using analogue, rather than digital, equipment to create [...] "a warmer sound". All the tracks have new lead vocals, new drums, and radically reworked instrumentation. Some of them have been transposed to a lower key to accommodate her lowering voice. Three of the songs, including [...] "This Woman's Work", have been completely re-recorded, with lyrics often changed in places. The album has been met {{with a wide range of}} reviews with most reviewers a bit confused about the concept of the album itself, while responding with varying degrees of enthusiasm about its revamped tracks. Of particular note is the warmer, more intimate tone of the songs and the richer, more mature <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> This is the first album on her new label, Fish People, a division of EMI Records, with whom she's had a relationship since she started recording. In addition to the album, Director's Cut in both its single CD form and in a box-set with The Sensual World and the analogue re-mastered The Red Shoes, Fish People re-issued the original versions of Hounds of Love and The Dreaming. The album debuted at number-two on the United Kingdom chart.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see no difference," [...] {{returned}} the dear girl, laughing. How musical and cheering to me were the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{in that little}} burst of sweet, feminine merriment. [...] "Indeed, indeed, I do not think even Martha could know you now, for the person you the moment before seemed." ...|$|R
60|$|At the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> {{the rage}} <b>of</b> the mastiff, {{instead of being}} at all diminished, was very sensibly increased. He stalked {{in front of the}} ladies, and seated himself at the feet of his mistress, {{growling}} louder than before, and occasionally giving vent to his ire by a short, surly barking.|$|R
60|$|As {{the idea}} passed through <b>her</b> mind, the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> daughter's <b>voice</b> startled <b>her</b> {{from the other}} side of the door.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the circle}} of her {{literary}} friends, Lokhvitskaya was surrounded by 'aura of adoration'; {{it seemed as if}} every man, according to a biographer, [...] "was a little in love with her." [...] Among them was Bunin. In a by and large grim gallery of his literary portraits (most of them crude caricatures), Lokhvitskaya was the only person whom he remembered fondly. [...] "Everything in her was charming: the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> the liveliness of her speech, the glitter of her eye, her wonderful facetiousness. The colour of her face was exceptionally beautiful: opaque and smooth, like that of a ripe Crimean apple," [...] Bunin wrote in his memoirs.|$|E
2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{appeared}} to anger the lion still more.|$|E
60|$|There was not {{a single}} feeling in the {{temperament}} of Elizabeth Temple that could prompt her to desert a companion in such an extremity. She fell on her knees {{by the side of the}} inanimate Louisa, tearing from the person <b>of</b> <b>her</b> friend, with instinctive readiness, such parts <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress as might obstruct her respiration, and encouraging their only safeguard, the dog, at the same time, by the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{anything}} the matter, my dear?" [...] Captain Bayley asked, opening his door, for the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> raised <b>voice</b> had reached him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a lugger, Signore," [...] {{returned}} the girl, drawing a long breath, as if relieved by hearing the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>voice.</b>|$|R
60|$|Startled by the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> Harburn {{jumped up}} and spun round towards it.|$|E
60|$|At the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> {{the burly}} negro turned and scowled viciously at her.|$|E
60|$|He started {{round at}} the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> then he laughed too, softly and gladly.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the article}} Composer’s Voice is fresh!, Brant Lyon {{describes}} a performance at Composer's Voice by composer and performer Gelsey Bell [...] "...like putting one’s {{ear to the}} ground to hear what’s coming in the distance or snuggling {{the side of your}} head against a pregnant woman’s belly—except in reverse—for the dissipation, not anticipation. The <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> resonating with the piano’s had the opposite effect in me: to inspire movement forward. I was hearing something new." ...|$|R
6000|$|At <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mistress' <b>voice</b> {{the slave}} maiden turned quickly, rising to her feet. [...] "Tarzan-jad-guru!" [...] she exclaimed in tones of mingled astonishment and relief.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the love}} of Heaven, Reuben, speak to me!" [...] cried Dorcas; and the strange <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>voice</b> affrighted <b>her</b> {{even more than the}} dead silence.|$|R
60|$|Dick was too {{thankful for}} the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> to resent the tone of it.|$|E
60|$|The very <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> was a tonic. He almost {{smiled as}} he {{answered}} her.|$|E
60|$|Wally Mason {{started at}} the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> He {{appeared}} to be deep in thoughts of his own.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know what}} it was, in <b>her</b> touch or <b>voice,</b> that made that song the most unearthly I have ever heard in my life, or can imagine. There was {{something}} fearful in the reality of it. It was {{as if it had}} never been written, or set to music, but sprung out of passion within her; which found imperfect utterance in the low <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> and crouched again when all was still. I was dumb when she leaned beside the harp again, playing it, but not sounding it, with her right hand.|$|R
60|$|He {{raised his}} head from its musing {{position}} at the first <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> and smiled faintly, and {{with an expression of}} anguish, as she proceeded; but when she had ended, and taken her seat near him, still keeping her eyes on his varying countenance, he took her hand into his own before he replied. A good deal surprised at his manner, and at this act, which exceeded the usual familiarity of even their affectionate intercourse, the colour, of which Miss Henley had been so playfully boasting, changed once or twice with rapid transitions.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{the landlady}} {{permitted}} other sounds to be audible, besides the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>voice.</b> It became possible {{to discover that}} Carmina was now awake. Teresa hurried into the bedroom.|$|R
60|$|There came a {{crackling}} <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> He {{knew she had}} consumption of the throat, and braced himself hard to bear the noise.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{showed her}} {{to be full of}} pretension,' said Blanche. 'Besides, Mrs. Ledwich's trumpeting would fix my opinion in a moment.' ...|$|E
60|$|Philip in his voluble anger stopped {{suddenly}} at the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> It was heart-broken. He had not realised what bitter {{things he}} was saying.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{although}} Mrs Marrot's {{ears were}} totally deaf to locomotives they were alert {{enough to the}} <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>voice.</b> When, therefore, he entered the kitchen, he found her standing {{on the floor with}} an ample shawl thrown round her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{seems to}} mean so much," [...] said Sandra. But with the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>voice</b> the spell was broken. She forgot the peasants. Only there {{remained}} with <b>her</b> a sense <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own beauty, and in front, luckily, {{there was a}} looking-glass.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>voice</b> {{seemed to}} awake her. She {{turned her head}} and her eyes opened wide while she gazed in {{his face with a}} steady stare. Uttering a sharp cry she seized him round the neck, exclaiming, [...] "Praise the Lord!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That Lupex {{has quite}} {{as much as he}} likes of Mrs L. The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{sometimes}} makes me shake in my shoes, I know." ...|$|E
60|$|He looked {{round in}} wonder. The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> was so {{completely}} altered that he almost fancied {{there must have}} been another woman in the room.|$|E
6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{started at}} the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> He looked intently {{into the face of}} the still fair speaker, before he answered; then he bowed, and replied-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was--" [...] and {{she grew}} bolder at the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>voice,</b> and more {{confident}} in the goodness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cause--"it was because Aunt Barbara said I must write what was not true, and--and I'll never tell a falsehood--never, for no one!" [...] and her eyes flashed.|$|R
60|$|But {{when the}} <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> companions' <b>voices</b> died away, and their figures were {{swallowed}} {{up in the}} darkness behind the snow, she forgot all this, and much else that was mundane and frivolous, in the impressive and majestic solitude which seemed to descend upon her from the obscurity above.|$|R
60|$|No {{sight of}} Istra, no scent <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair, no <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> always-changing <b>voice</b> for two days. Twice, seeing a sliver <b>of</b> light under <b>her</b> door {{as he came}} up the darkened stairs, he knocked, {{but there was no}} answer, and he marched into his room with the dignity of fury.|$|R
