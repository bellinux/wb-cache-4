5|$|The {{final element}} of the {{protection}} scheme of the first dreadnoughts was the subdivision of the ship below the waterline into several watertight compartments. If the hull were holed—by shellfire, mine, torpedo, or collision—then, in theory, only one area would flood and the ship could survive. To make this precaution even more effective, many dreadnoughts had no doors between different underwater sections, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> a surprise hole below the waterline need not sink the ship. There were still several instances where flooding spread between underwater compartments.|$|E
5|$|Truth (satya) implies love, and {{firmness}} (agraha) engenders {{and therefore}} {{serves as a}} synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up {{the use of the}} phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha”....|$|E

5|$|Sviatoslav {{retreated to}} Dorostolon, which the Byzantine armies besieged for sixty-five days. Cut off and surrounded, Sviatoslav came {{to terms with}} John and agreed to abandon the Balkans, renounce his claims to the {{southern}} Crimea, and return west of the Dnieper River. In return, the Byzantine emperor supplied the Rus' with food and safe passage home. Sviatoslav and his men set sail and landed on Berezan Island {{at the mouth of}} the Dnieper, where they made camp for the winter. Several months later, their camp was devastated by famine, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> a horse's head could not be bought for less than a half-grivna, reports the Kievan chronicler of the Primary Chronicle. While Sviatoslav's campaign brought no tangible results for the Rus', it weakened the Bulgarian statehood and left it vulnerable to the attacks of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer four decades later.|$|E
5|$|Saint Catherine's Monastery still {{maintains}} {{the importance of}} a letter, handwritten in 1844 with an original signature of Tischendorf confirming that he borrowed those leaves. However, recently published documents, including a deed of gift dated 11 September 1868 and signed by Archbishop Kallistratos and the monks of the monastery, indicate that the manuscript was acquired entirely legitimately. This deed, which agrees with a report by Kurt Aland on the matter, has now been published. Unfortunately this development is not widely known in the English-speaking world, as only German- and Russian-language media reported on it in 2009. Doubts as to the legality of the gift arose because when Tischendorf originally removed the manuscript from Saint Catherine's Monastery in September 1859, the monastery was without an archbishop, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though the intention to present the manuscript to the Tsar had been expressed, no legal gift could be made at the time. Resolution of the matter was delayed through the turbulent reign of Archbishop Cyril (consecrated 7 December 1859, deposed 24 August 1866), and the situation only formalised after the restoration of peace.|$|E

25|$|During 14th and 15th centuries, Indian {{shipbuilding}} {{skills and}} their maritime ability was sophisticated {{enough to produce}} ships with a capacity to carry over hundred men.

25|$|The “beautiful is good” {{effect is}} a very present {{phenomenon}} when dealing with first impressions of others. Targets who are attractive are rated more positively and as possessing more unique characteristics {{than those who are}} unattractive.

25|$|The Bush Company {{terminal}} business {{became the}} Bush Terminal Co. in 1902 when Irving T. Bush bought {{the land from}} the Standard Oil Co. The warehouses were built circa 1892–1910, the railroad from 1896 to 1915, and the factory lofts between 1905 and 1925. Together, Bush Terminal offered economies of scale for its tenants, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> the smallest interests had available to them the type of facilities normally only available to large, well-capitalized firms.|$|E
25|$|The fifth season (1988–1989) saw {{the show}} {{return to its}} {{original}} timeslot, 10PM on Friday nights and took the show on a yet more serious tone, with storylines becoming dark and gritty – enough <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> {{some of the most}} loyal fans were left perplexed. Tim Truman took over scoring the episodes {{for the remainder of the}} series' run and brought with him a style of instrumental synthesizer music that was markedly different from Jan Hammer's.|$|E
25|$|In {{the rest}} of the book Ehrlich {{discusses}} things which readers can do to help. This is focused primarily on changing public opinion to create pressure on politicians to enact the policies he suggests, which he believed were not politically possible in 1968. At {{the end of the book}} he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only be better off if it follows his prescriptions, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if he is incorrect it is the right course of action.|$|E

25|$|However, it is Penang Hokkien {{that serves}} as the lingua franca of George Town. Originally a variant of the Minnan dialect, over the centuries, Penang Hokkien has {{incorporated}} a large number of loanwords from Malay and English, yet another legacy of the Peranakan culture. It is spoken by many Penangites regardless of race for communication purposes, so much <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> police officers also take courses in Penang Hokkien. In recent years, there are more efforts to maintain the dialect's relevance {{in the face of the}} increasing influence of Mandarin and English among the younger populace, including through books, dictionaries and movies.|$|E
25|$|Already well-connected to {{a wealthy}} family and now well-educated in business, {{he built a}} {{personal}} fortune of 500,000 by 1899. The family was organized on patriarchal principles, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though young Francisco was wealthy in his own right, his father and especially his grandfather Evaristo viewed as someone who should be {{under the authority of}} his elders. As the eldest sibling, Francisco exercised authority over his younger brothers and sisters. In January 1903, he married Sara Pérez, first in a civil ceremony, and then a Catholic nuptial mass celebrated by the archbishop. From all accounts it was a happy marriage, but they had no children.|$|E
25|$|As Perak {{continued}} to increase its mining operations, it suffered a shortage of labour. Looking to solve the problem, Malay administrator Long Jaafar invited the Chinese in Penang to work in Perak, particularly at Larut. By the 1840s, Perak's Chinese population exploded. The new immigrants {{more often than not}} were members of Chinese secret societies. Two of the largest were Ghee Hin and Hai San. These two groups regularly tried to increase their influence in Perak and this resulted in frequent skirmishes. These skirmishes were getting out of hand, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> Ngah Ibrahim, the Menteri Besar, or chief minister, was unable to enforce the rule of law.|$|E
