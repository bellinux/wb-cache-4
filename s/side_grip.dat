5000|$|This is {{the type}} of grip used in the cable cars of San Francisco. The grip is {{attached}} to the lead truck of the car (or both trucks, in the case of double-ended cars), and is a field-replaceable unit. While there have also been <b>side</b> <b>grips</b> and even top grips, the sheer number of rope changes, crossings, and [...] "let-go" [...] curves make a bottom grip, i.e., one in which the jaws open directly downward, the most practical type of grip.|$|R
40|$|Pile {{sheeting}} operations need {{auxiliary equipment}} and personnel to complete, while contractors {{have been concerned}} in increasing safety for crews, saving money, and efficiency. Movax is a robotic excavator mounted hydraulic vibratory pile driver. Its unique robotic articulation and <b>side</b> <b>gripping</b> ability allows the operator not only to drive and extract sheet piles, but also to pick a sheet, move it, thread it, and place it. The Movax {{can pick up a}} 50 -foot sheet without releasing the sheet during these operations. This ability allows the Movax Robotic to help increasing crew safety by reducing the need of personnel in the job site...|$|R

The chair on which he sat was overturned. Captain Ward paused {{in the act of}} pouring himself a drink, and called encouragement. Worth pleaded with his assistants to hang on, and hung on himself, twisting the tooth till it crackled and then attempting a straightaway pull.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of its {{numerous}} portrayals in American film and television, the <b>side</b> <b>grip</b> is emulated in segments of American popular culture that value coolness and aggressiveness, such as hip hop music and the criminal subculture. As a result, the <b>side</b> <b>grip</b> has been increasingly used in violent armed crime in the United States.

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} devices which grip cylindrical structures and more particularly to a device which has three arcuate gripping members having frictional surfaces for gripping and compressing a bi-stem. The bi-stem gripping apparatus is constructed having {{a pair of}} <b>side</b> <b>gripping</b> members, and an intermediate gripping member disposed between them. Sheets of a gum stock silicone rubber with frictional gripping surfaces are bonded to the inner region of the gripping members and provide frictional engagement between the bi-stem and the apparatus. A latch secures the gripping apparatus to a bi-stem, and removable handles are attached, allowing an astronaut to pull the bi-stem from its cassette. A tethering ring {{on the outside of}} the gripping apparatus provides a convenient point to which a lanyard may be attached...|$|R

50|$|The <b>side</b> <b>grip</b> {{has been}} portrayed in movies {{since at least}} the 1960s, notably in the westerns One-Eyed Jacks (1961) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). The style's {{cinematic}} benefit is that it makes it easier to see both the weapon and the actor's face in a tight camera shot.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>side</b> <b>grip</b> {{found some}} use with early 20th century submachineguns, {{such as the}} Thompson M1 or the M3 [...] "grease gun". Because their heavy recoil made them tend to climb when fired in full {{automatic}} mode, soldiers would hold them sideways so that the bullets would spread in a horizontal rather than vertical arc, hitting more targets.|$|E
5000|$|Movax {{sheet piler}} is {{controlled}} by a cab-mounted automatic steering system;current model Auto C which allows the operator to select a precise angle to drive/extract piles, even horizontally. A skilled operator can pick up, position and drive a pile in one fluid motion. With computer-assisted automatic steering system and <b>side</b> <b>grip</b> ability, Movax sheet piler/excavator combination automatically corrects the straightness of the sheet pile during the driving and extracting. When Movax sheet piler drives the first pile into the ground, the distance is put into memory. Auto B takes the pile to the right distance near the guide and sets pile into the upright position, reducing the typical [...] "walking" [...] of the pile wall typical with other methods of installation.The other Movax roducst are; Soil Drills and Impact hammers.Movax products are manufactured by Movax Ltd Finland.

50|$|The <b>side</b> <b>grip</b> is a {{technique}} for shooting a handgun in which the weapon is rotated about ninety degrees and held horizontally instead of vertically (as is normally done). Shooting a gun in this way has no practical benefit under most circumstances and makes proper aiming very difficult, but the style has become somewhat popular in hip hop culture and among street criminals (who do not often use the gun sight) due to its portrayal in American film and television since the early 1990s.|$|E

The powerhouse {{was located}} on Bridge Road, at Hoddle Street, {{and has since}} been demolished to provide for a left-turn lane. The remains of the Richmond cable tram depot now form part of the Amora Hotel, near Hawthorn Bridge. The trams comprised a double-ended dummy and trailer, operated by a single-jaw <b>side</b> <b>grip</b> on a [...] gauge tram line.|$|E
50|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers will sometimes use the <b>side</b> <b>grip</b> to shoot while holding a riot shield or ballistic shield with their other hand. Because the shield limits {{the field of}} view, lifting and tilting the gun may make the sights more visible under these circumstances. Some shooters with issues of ocular dominance will tilt the gun at a 15 to 45 degree angle {{in order to take}} advantage of their better eye; the gun held in the left hand and the sights aligned to the right eye, for example.|$|E

5000|$|The {{paradox is}} that there is no {{supporting}} evidence of the use of the phalanx in Greece at that time. Anthony Snodgrass defined [...] "the hoplite revolution," [...] which included both the use of the phalanx in Greece and standardization of a [...] "hoplite panoply" [...] of arms and equipment. The panoply consisted of artifacts adapted from previous models: corselet, greaves, ankle guards, closed [...] "Corinthian" [...] helmet, large round shield with a band for the arm and a <b>side</b> <b>grip,</b> spear, long steel sword. Each element except the greaves is dated to 750-700 BC, perhaps earlier.|$|E
5000|$|The Beretta 21A Bobcat is {{available}} chambered for either [...]22 LR or [...]25 ACP (6.35 mm) ammunition.

It has a magazine release button {{in the left}} <b>side</b> <b>grip,</b> located between the grip retaining screws. The frame {{is made out of}} aluminum alloy; the slide and barrel are either carbon steel or stainless steel, depending on the model. Beretta claims that the pistol is intended for off duty police and pistol carry permit holders that seek a highly concealable, but reliable pistol. It is considered a [...] "woman's gun" [...] by most professional shooters. Thus in effect, the handgun is designed for self-defense.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>side</b> <b>grip</b> {{was highly}} popularized with the 1993 American hood film, Menace II Society, where this {{technique}} {{is shown in the}} film's opening scene during the armed robbery of a Los Angeles, California convenience store. According to the directors, they witnessed the technique themselves in a 1987 robbery in Detroit, Michigan and used it on film because it struck them as [...] "sloppy, edgy and realistic". Other filmmakers were fast to pick up the gesture, and it soon came to represent [...] "arrogance and cool power" [...] in Hollywood's visual shorthand, being used in a great number of 1990s action and gangster movies including Desperado, Payback, Seven, The Usual Suspects and Copycat.|$|E

She knows that the young pupils are growing discouraged, and that the time has come to hearten them. Chip, chip!--"watch, I'll show you," [...] she whistles--Cheeeep! with a sharp up-slide at the end, which I soon grow to recognize as the signal to strike. At the cry she sets her wings and shoots downward with strong, even plunge, strikes a wave squarely as it rises, passes under it, and is out on the other <b>side</b> <b>gripping</b> a big chub. The little ones follow her, whistling their delight, and telling her that perhaps now they will go back to the nest and take a look at the fish before they go on with their fishing. Which means, of course, that they will eat it and go to sleep perfectly satisfied with the good fun of fishing; and then lessons are over for the day.|$|R
