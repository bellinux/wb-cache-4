5|$|Situational {{awareness}} {{was also}} reduced because the pilots {{did not have}} a chart in front of them at all times. The crew was not aware that they could check the aircraft location in relation to the centerline with a VDF. The crew probably put too much emphasis on the indications displayed by the GPS. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain without control over the lateral navigation. Despite uncertainty and disagreement in the group, the approach was not abandoned, as the aircraft should have climbed to a <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> while the problem was solved.|$|E

25|$|Contributing to the {{accident}} was the Federal Aviation Administration’s intentional inhibition of the minimum <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> warning system at Guam and the agency’s failure to adequately manage the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{probable}} cause was {{the failure of}} the captain to maintain a <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> and airspeed when approaching to land on one engine after failure (or suspected failure) of the port engine.|$|E
25|$|The CAB {{concluded}} that the accident {{could have been avoided}} if the crew had held the plane straight and level when the misalignment was first noticed, then raised the flaps, climbed to a <b>safe</b> <b>altitude,</b> circled the airport, and attempted another landing.

50|$|In some {{countries}} VFR flight is permitted at night, {{and is known}} as Night VFR.

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, an accident investigation board recommended new procedures to scan more frequently for approaching high terrain and to climb to <b>safer</b> <b>altitudes</b> before approaching within 200 mi of a water-land boundary.

25|$|In his book, Steuart Campbell {{suggested}} that two errors by the pilots; failure {{to climb to}} a <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> upon entering cloud, and a navigational error made in the poor visibility (mistaking a fog signal station for a lighthouse), together caused the crash. The Board of Inquiry had identified that several factors may have sufficiently distracted the crew from {{turning away from the}} Mull, and upon entering cloud, failed to carry out the correct procedure for an emergency climb in a timely manner.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, {{the report}} into the crash was {{published}} by the Interstate Aviation Committee. According to the committee, {{the primary cause of}} the incident was the crew conducting the approach in worse than the minimum meteorological conditions for the airfield, aircraft, and aircraft commander. The failure of the crew to go-around and their descent below the minimum <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> in the absence of visual contact with the approach lights or ground references resulted in the collision with trees and controlled flight into terrain.|$|E
25|$|The {{final report}} into the {{accident}} was released in October 2010, concluding {{that the cause of}} the crash was attempting the landing approach in conditions worse than the meteorological minima of the airfield, the aircraft, and the commander. The crew failed to make a timely decision to go-around. They descended below the established minimum <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> in the absence of reliable visual contact with runway or approach lights, which led to a collision of the aircraft with trees and terrain. The MAK commented that had the recommendations following the crash of UTair Flight 471 been implemented, the accident may have been prevented. A total of 19 safety recommendations were made.|$|E
50|$|En route {{flight is}} {{described}} by IFR charts showing navigation aids, fixes, and standard routes called airways. Aircraft with appropriate navigational equipment such as GPS, are also often cleared for a direct-to routing, where only the destination, or a few navigational waypoints are {{used to describe the}} route that the flight will follow. ATC will assign altitudes in its initial clearance or amendments thereto, and navigational charts indicate minimum <b>safe</b> <b>altitudes</b> for airways.|$|R
50|$|While {{these tests}} were ongoing, a jet fighter {{happened}} to crash. The aircraft had no beacon, {{and thus the}} rescue plane sent to find the fighter was forced to fly low over wooded areas {{in an attempt to}} locate the wreck. The rescue plane's low flight led to its own crash in the bush. With a beacon, the rescue aircraft {{would have been able to}} stay at much higher, and <b>safer,</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Stevinson decided that the beacon was more important than glider research, and was able to convince the NRC to develop the concept.|$|R

25|$|Faced {{with the}} lack of {{reliable}} basic flight instrument readings, constant contradictory warnings from the aircraft's flight computer (some of which were valid and some of which were not) and believing that they were at a <b>safe</b> <b>altitude,</b> 58-year-old Captain Eric Schreiber Ladrón de Guevara, a veteran pilot who had logged almost 22,000 flight hours, and 42-year-old First Officer David Fernández Revoredo, who had logged almost 8,000 flight hours, decided to begin descent for the approach to the airport. Since the flight was at night over water, no visual references could be made to convey to the pilots their true altitude or aid their descent. As a consequence of the pilots' inability to precisely monitor the aircraft's airspeed or vertical speed, they experienced multiple stalls, resulting in rapid loss of altitude with no corresponding change on the altimeter. While the altimeter indicated an altitude of approximately 9,700 feet, the aircraft's true altitude was in fact much lower.|$|E
25|$|During {{his seven}} years in flight test, Chilstrom flew 147 {{different}} aircraft including X, Y, and production models from the United States, Germany, and Japan. Many German and Japanese aircraft captured during World War II were sent to Wright Field, and Chilstrom {{had the opportunity to}} fly and evaluate over twenty different models including the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the Messerschmitt Me 262, the A6M Zero, and the Kawasaki Ki-45 Nick. He flew the Fw 190 extensively and during his tenth flight on February 24, 1945, a malfunctioning trim switch nearly killed him. Chilstrom was landing at Wright Field when the elevator trim switch malfunctioned causing the nose to pitch up while the Fw 190 was dangerously close to the ground. After regaining control and climbing to a <b>safe</b> <b>altitude,</b> he identified the problem and determined the trim could also be driven to a full nose-down position. With full nose-down trim, Chilstrom had just enough control to successfully land the aircraft. Other Fw 190 pilots were not as fortunate as electrical problems in the trim switch caused or were suspected to have caused a number of crashes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a new danger-aware Operational Flight Program (OFP) for the unmanned helicopter&# 039;s auto-navigation based on the well-known time-triggered message-triggered object (TMO) model. Design/methodology/approach - In this design with the TMO, the danger-awareness means two things. First, an unmanned helicopter maneuvers on <b>safe</b> <b>altitudes</b> to avoid buildings or mountains when navigating to the target position. It is assumed that minimum <b>safe</b> <b>altitudes</b> are given on evenly spaced grids and on the center points of every four adjacent grids. A three-dimensional (3 D) path-finding algorithm using this safe-altitude information is proposed. Second, a helicopter automatically avoids a zone with very high temperature caused by a fire. Findings - Since the auto-flight control system requires componentized real-time processing of sensors and controllers, the TMO model that has periodic and sporadic threads as members, has been used in designing the OFP. It has been found that using the TMO scheme is a way to construct a very flexible, well-componentized and timeliness-guaranteed OFP. Practical implications - As the RTOS, RT-eCos has been used. It was developed a few years ago based on the eCos 3. 0 to support the real-time thread model of the TMO scheme. To verify this navigation system, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) system also has been developed. Originality/value - Designing an OFP by using the real-time object model TMO and the proposed 3 D safe path finding algorithm is a whole new effective deadline-based approach. And the developed OFP can be used intensively in the phase of disaster response and recovery...|$|R

500|$|A sudden {{reduction}} in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew.

Wurtsmith attended the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests on Bikini Atoll as an observer, and in September 1946, he was appointed commander of the Eighth Air Force, one of SAC's three numbered air forces.
