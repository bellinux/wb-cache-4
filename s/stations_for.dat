Ten bids were received and on February 8, 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation (TETCO) was declared successful.

5|$|About 100 {{separate}} <b>stations</b> <b>for</b> box huckleberry {{have been}} documented in the scientific literature. By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations of the plant had been lost to science, and his Pennsylvania colony {{was the only one}} known for some time.

Touring vehicles were powered by low-emissions renewable biodiesel, a fuel made partly from vegetable oil. Non-profit organizations Love Hope Strength and HeadCount joined the tour for select dates.|$|E
5|$|During its {{brief time}} in operation, the Pony Express {{delivered}} approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. Although the Pony Express {{proved that the}} central/northern mail route was viable, Russell, Majors and Waddell {{did not get the}} contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to Jeremy Dehut in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Line.

5|$|Mantas {{are found}} in warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters. Both species are pelagic; M. birostris migrates across open oceans, singly or in groups, while M. alfredi tends to be resident and coastal. They are filter feeders and eat large quantities of zooplankton, which they swallow with their open mouths as they swim. Gestation lasts over a year and mantas give birth to live pups. Mantas may visit cleaning <b>stations</b> <b>for</b> the removal of parasites. Like whales, they breach, for unknown reasons.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{reported}} <b>stations</b> <b>for</b> box huckleberry fall within the Appalachian Mountains, ranging from central Pennsylvania in the north to eastern Tennessee in the south. However, the specimens located in Maryland and Delaware {{were found on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain, and the single North Carolina station is in the Piedmont. Its scattered distribution suggests that the species once spread more broadly across North America, but was almost eradicated by glacial advances, surviving only where it escaped the ice in protected refugia.|$|E

5|$|The {{expected}} daily ridership of {{the whole}} network of all phases, ater the compleiton of Phase-II, is 4 million passengers.
