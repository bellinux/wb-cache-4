40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different kinds of masking noise and DAF, in order to identify the condition which would elicit the highest incidence of fluency in a group of stutterers. The study demonstrates that masking noise and DAF can be effectively applied as an aid in a therapy programme, viz. noise can effectively be put to use so as to encourage and reinforce <b>somesthesia.</b> Stuttering is viewed as defective functioning in the cybernetic system...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundInstability of the knee, {{related to}} {{anterior}} cruciate ligament injury, is treated by surgical reconstruction. During recovery, a loss of proprioceptive input can have a significant impact. Few studies have evaluated the benefits of rehabilitation of the knee in aquatic environment on functional outcomes. ObjectiveThis study aimed to compare an innovative rehabilitation protocol combining reduced conventional rehabilitation with aquatic rehabilitation, with a conventional rehabilitation, according to the National French Health Authority, in terms of kinetics, development of proprioceptive skills, and functional improvement of the knee. Methods 67 patients, who were amateur or professional athletes, were randomized into two groups: 35 patients followed the conventional rehabilitation protocol (Gr 1) and 32 patients followed the innovative rehabilitation protocol (Gr 2). Patients were evaluated before surgery, and at 2 [*]weeks, 1, 2, and 6 [*]months after surgery using posturography, and evaluation of muscular strength, walking performance and proprioception. This study is multicenter, prospective, randomized, and controlled {{with a group of}} patients following conventional rehabilitation (level of evidence I). ResultsFor the same quality of postural control, Gr 2 relied more on <b>somesthesia</b> than Gr 1 at 6 [*]months. The affected side had an impact on postural control and in particular on the preoperative lateralization, at 2 [*]weeks and at 1 [*]month. Lateralization depended on the affected knee, with less important lateralization in Gr 2 preoperatively and at 1 [*]month. The quadriceps muscular strength was higher in Gr 2 than in Gr 1 at 2 and 6 [*]months and muscle strength of the external hamstring was greater in Gr 2 than in Gr 1 at 6 [*]months. The isokinetic test showed a greater quadriceps muscular strength in Gr 2. Gr 2 showed a greater walking distance than Gr 1 at one month. Gr 2 showed an improvement in the proprioceptive capacities of the operated limb in flexion for the first 2 [*]months. ConclusionThe effectiveness of the innovative rehabilitation program permits faster recovery, allowing for an earlier return to social, sporting, and professional activities. Faster retrieval of knee function following aquatic rehabilitation would prevent both short-term risk of lesions of the contralateral limb due to overcompensation and long-term risk of surgery due to osteoarthritis.
