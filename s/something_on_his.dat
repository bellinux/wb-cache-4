25|$|Under the Invisibility Cloak, Harry, Ron, and Hermione follow Draco to Borgin and Burkes, a dark magic shop in Knockturn Alley. Draco threatens Mr. Borgin about {{repairing}} {{one item}} and keeping another safe for him. Draco shows Mr. Borgin <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> arm that Harry believes {{to be the}} Dark Mark, Voldemort's sign, though whether or not Harry is correct is never confirmed. (In the film version Draco Malfoy shows Dumbledore the Dark Mark on his arm.) On the Hogwarts Express, Harry invisibly spies on Draco and overhears him discussing Voldemort's task with several other Slytherins. Draco knows Harry is present and, once alone in the compartment, immobilises him and breaks his nose causing Harry to hate Draco even more. Harry is left stranded on the train until Nymphadora Tonks (Luna Lovegood in the film adaptation) rescues him. Harry spends {{much of the year}} trailing Draco's whereabouts on his Marauder's Map, but loses track of him once Draco enters the Room of Requirement. When Katie Bell is almost killed in Hogsmeade after handling a cursed necklace and Ron nearly dies by drinking poisoned mead, Harry suspects Draco is behind both attacks.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} I heard Chris Holtzmann at his safe, {{and then the}} rattle of <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> desk.|$|E
60|$|Smith, too, she noted, {{when they}} were back in the inner office, seemed to have <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind. He was strangely silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "He’d got <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>’is</b> {{mind what}} he wanted to tell you," [...] said a listener, severely; [...] "you ought to ’ave stopped, Joe, and asked ’im what it was." ...|$|R
60|$|Harry's face fell {{a little}} at this reply. Evidently <b>something</b> was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind, and this answer did not {{harmonize}} with it.|$|R
6000|$|Then he felt <b>something</b> cold <b>on</b> <b>his</b> scalp: {{they were}} taking his cap off and putting snow <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head; then the doctor--he knew him now--said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That boy has got <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind," [...] {{said the}} terrible Clemantiny, who, Chester felt convinced, {{could see through}} a stone wall.|$|E
60|$|Then Cousin Henry, {{remembering his}} last {{communication}} to Farmer Griffith, remembering also {{all that the}} two Cantors could prove, added <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own account.|$|E
60|$|As {{he passed}} along the street, {{he looked a}} little anxious. Sherlock Holmes--and {{possibly}} even Doctor Watson--would have deduced that he had <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> conscience.|$|E
60|$|When Smith {{had been}} digging for {{about twenty minutes}} <b>something</b> tinkled <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shovel with a noise which sounded loud in that silence.|$|R
6000|$|Then he felt <b>something</b> cold <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head: {{they were}} taking his cap off and putting snow <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head; then the doctor (he knew him now) said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's an odd case," [...] {{said the}} medical man. [...] "The fellow is {{suffering}} more mentally than physically. He must have <b>something</b> awful <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind." ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{course she}} {{saw that he had}} <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind. She knew those {{puckered}} eyes so well, and had so often smoothed them for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "What’s {{the matter}} with old Satan?" [...] said the mate, who had been let into the secret. [...] "He seems to have <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give me the glass," [...] said Al. [...] "Yes, I was right. Bill, {{the horse}} is not frightened. He's coming steadily; he's got <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{he became}} agitated. He kicked at <b>something</b> <b>on</b> the floor. <b>His</b> eyes gleamed angrily.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thy cousin's {{younger brother}} owes my father's cousin <b>something</b> yet <b>on</b> <b>his</b> daughter's marriage-feast,' {{said the woman}} crisply. 'Let him put their food to that account. The yogi will beg, I doubt not.' ...|$|R
60|$|Jerry {{began to}} reel in. That <b>something</b> big was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hook was certain.|$|R
6000|$|... "They might {{set fire}} to the cabins," [...] added Bill Isbel. He {{appeared}} to be the gloomiest of the Isbel faction. There was <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Boyne. His {{audience}} was apparently at an end, {{but he seemed}} still to have <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind. [...] "Momma," [...] he began afresh.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{certainly}} got <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind," [...] said Randy, {{in telling}} the {{others of the}} incident. [...] "And I must confess I'm growing really sorry for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And how're {{you going}} on, lad?' he said loudly. Berry {{noticed that his}} uncle was {{slightly}} uneasy of him. It made him also uncomfortable. The elder man had evidently <b>something</b> pressing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> soul.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He's {{been very}} queer to-day, madam, very queer,' another porter answered. 'He do hardly hear when he's spoken to, and d' seem giddy, {{or as if}} <b>something</b> was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind. He's been like it for this month past, but nothing so bad as he is to-day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a tap at the door; and a {{man came}} {{staggering}} in, without saying with your leave, or by your leave, with <b>something</b> heavy <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head. Setting this {{down in the middle}} of the table, symmetrically in the centre of the nuts and apples, he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is a man}} returning," [...] he said {{in about}} half an hour; [...] "he is {{carrying}} <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, but I cannot see what it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seems to have <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind," [...] {{continued}} Miss Jelks, with a toss of her head, as {{she placed}} the sugar-bowl and other articles on the table.|$|E
60|$|Grandfather Frog {{looked very}} solemn {{as he sat}} on his big green lily-pad in the Smiling Pool. He looked very much {{as if he had}} <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind. A foolish green fly {{actually}} brushed Grandfather Frog's nose and he didn't even notice it. The fact is he did have <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind. It had been there ever since his cousin, old Mr. Toad, had called the day before and they had quarreled as usual over the question whether it was best never to leave home or {{to go out into the}} Great World.|$|E
60|$|A sudden {{thought had}} {{occurred}} to him, and {{it was such a}} horrible one that he was inclined to force it from his mind. And yet it came bobbing up time and again until Fred, who was sitting beside his cousin, noticed that <b>something</b> was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} Archie that Nature, {{contrary}} to her usual custom of indifference to human suffering, was mourning with him. The sky was overcast, {{and the sun}} had ceased to shine. There {{was a sort of}} sombreness in the afternoon, which fitted in with his mood. And then <b>something</b> splashed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R
50|$|He {{assisted}} {{his father}} in his hobby of ornamental metalwork, with a Holtzapffel lathe, and in his late teenage, built a 4 in gauge model railway with a steam locomotive. Wanting <b>something</b> <b>on</b> which <b>his</b> younger siblings could ride, {{he went on to}} build a 9 in gauge locomotive and train, which gave him the experience for his later ventures.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{child has}} got <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind, Mrs. Dr. dear," [...] said Susan. [...] "He has et next to nothing. Do you suppose he is {{plotting}} another poem?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right. He's got <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind. You'd {{think that}} {{ten years in}} the British India boats would have knocked most of his {{religion}} out of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what do {{you want}} to see me about, then?" [...] {{questioned}} Dave. He could readily see that the bully had <b>something</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind which troubled him greatly.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank heaven, not my mother, Ethie," [...] he {{answered}} her, with <b>something</b> like pallor <b>on</b> <b>his</b> dark cheek, [...] "not my mother; but I remember the woman." ...|$|R
60|$|Ralph mumbled <b>something</b> {{about being}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> way home. They walked on together, though Rodney walked quick {{enough to make}} it plain that he had no wish for company.|$|R
50|$|Emily Starr and Teddy Kent {{have been}} friends since childhood, and as Teddy is about to leave to further his {{education}} as an artist, Emily believes that their friendship is blossoming into <b>something</b> more. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> last night at home, they vow to think of each other {{when they see the}} star Vega of the Lyre.|$|R
