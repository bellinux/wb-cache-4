5|$|Hyacinthoides non-scripta (formerly Endymion non-scriptus or <b>Scilla</b> non-scripta) is a bulbous {{perennial}} plant, {{found in}} Atlantic areas from north-western Spain to the British Isles, and also frequently {{used as a}} garden plant. It is known in English as the common bluebell or simply bluebell, a name which is used in Scotland {{to refer to the}} harebell, Campanula rotundifolia. In spring, H.non-scripta produces a nodding, one-sided inflorescence of 5–12 tubular, sweet-scented violet–blue flowers, with strongly recurved tepals, and 3–6 long, linear, basal leaves.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the estate}} had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the {{opportunity}} to plant drifts of <b>scilla,</b> cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On the edges, and in the cleared spaces in the woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house he had some flower beds; throughout he planted red valerian, which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from American friends John Singer Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled kitchen garden, a heather garden, and a water garden {{with one of the}} largest collections of water lilies in Europe.|$|E
25|$|On the 6th Stuart {{captured}} one-half {{battalion of}} Poles at Monteleone di Calabria. The next day, Captain Edward Fellowes of HMS Apollo (38) accepted {{the surrender of}} 370 Poles at Tropea Castle. On 9 July, 632 French troops at Reggio capitulated to General Broderick's 1,200 Anglo-Sicilians and Captain William Hoste in HMS Amphion (32). Broderick's force landed south of the town at 7:00 AM. Bombarded from the sea and attacked from the land, the garrison sent out a white flag that evening. <b>Scilla</b> Castle held out until 24 July when its 231-man garrison from the 23rd Light surrendered to Oswald's 2,600 soldiers. Oswald's command consisted of the 10th Foot, 21st Foot, and the Chasseurs Britanniques. On 28 July, Colonel Macleod's 78th Foot and Hoste's Amphion captured 500 men of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Polish-Italian Legion at Cotrone. Stuart's main body reached Reggio on 23 July. After placing garrisons in Reggio and <b>Scilla,</b> Stuart's troops quit the mainland as Smith's ships transported them to Sicily.|$|E

25|$|Ayscough, {{with two}} other frigates and several sloops under his command, was then {{assigned}} to patrol the Strait of Messina, to protect Sicily against a threatened invasion by Murat, who had concentrated about 40,000 troops and 200 gun-boats. Murat launched his attack early on 18 September, with troops sailing from <b>Scilla</b> and Reggio, landing on the Punta del Faro, and at Mili Marina, south of Messina. However British troops reacted swiftly, and neutralized the attempted incursion with little loss to themselves, taking most of the enemy prisoner. Ayscough was next employed, with seven vessels under his command, reconnoitring the coast between Naples and Civita Vecchia, near Rome, but Success was seriously damaged during a severe gale while off Crete, and was obliged to return to England in mid-1811 for repairs.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of limited introduction, more than 100 species of indigenous plants have been cataloged (most creeping plants and bushes). These plants are similar in many respects to indigenous species on the islands of Madeira and the Canaries, which are better suited to dry arid environments. Germination of these species occurs immediately and briefly after annual showers, and include: Erva-gelada, Lotus salvagensis and Lotus paicae (species of the Fabaceae family), Chrysanthemum sarmentoi, <b>Scilla</b> maderensis, Argyranthemum thalassophilum and the Lobularia canariensis. Selvagem Pequena and the Fora Islet are the richest floral repositories, since they were never populated by non-indigenous animals or plants. For a period, some indigenous plants (primarily Roccella tinctoria and other lichens of the family Nemari) were harvested from the islands to support the dye industry of Europe, primarily to England and Flanders in the 15th and 16th centuries, but these adventures were discontinued later.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} shell bioerosion in a {{population}} of Terebratula <b>scillae</b> SEGUENZA from the Lower Pleistocene in Lecce area, Southern Italy. The most important traces belong to shell breakage attributed to predatory activity; borings (Entobia isp., Maeandro-polydora isp.); drill holes (Oichnus simplex BROMLEY; Oichnus isp.); and etching scars (Centrichnus eccentricus BROMLEY and MARTINELL; Podichnus centrifugalis BROMLEY and SURLYK). The distribution analysis of the traces of epibiosis on the shells of T. <b>scillae</b> induces us {{to think that we}} are dealing with a pedicle-anchored form, living with completely raised valves. Besides, both percentage and nature of predation marks (probably due to gastro-pods or decapod crustaceans) do not depose for a very intense predation pressure...|$|R
25|$|Leaving garrisons at Reggio and <b>Scilla,</b> Reynier marched north, {{picking up}} troops as he went. By 3 July, he {{assembled}} 6,440 soldiers near Maida, south of Sant'Eufemia. Verdier's division was somewhere to the north, much {{too far away}} to reach the field. When Stuart got news of the French presence, he called in his outposts at Sant'Eufemia and Nicastro. The British general mistakenly believed that he outnumbered his adversary. Stuart's seaside camp was supported by Smith's warships anchored inshore. However, some British soldiers were already down with malaria. Leaving 16 officers and 271 men of de Watteville's Swiss Regiment to guard the camp, Stuart marched to the south down the beach. Spotting this maneuver from his hilltop position near Maida, Reynier set his force in motion to attack the British force. He gauged that his advance would strike his enemies {{at the mouth of the}} Amato River. Seeing the French approach, Stuart halted his column, faced his troops inland, and moved forward to meet the French. The battleground was in a scrub-covered plain on the north side of the swampy Amato River. Whereas Stuart's force was in echelon with his right leading, Reynier's division was in echelon with his left leading. Therefore, the British right and the French left became engaged first.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the carbon, oxygen, and magnesium isotope compositions of two modern brachiopods, Terebratalia transversa and Frieleia halli, and one fossil specimen (2. 3 Ma), Terebratula <b>scillae.</b> The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the variability of these isotopic compositions and to evaluate the potential of brachiopods as a proxy of past seawater d 26 Mg values. The two investigated brachiopod shells present the same range of d 26 Mg variation (up to 2 per mil). This variation cannot be ascribed to changes in environmental parameters (temperature or pH). As has been previously observed, the primary layer of calcite shows the largest degree of oxygen and carbon isotope disequilibrium relative to seawater. In contrast, the d 26 Mg value of the primary layer is comparable to that of the secondary calcite layer value. In both T. <b>scillae</b> and T. transversa, negative trends are observable between magnesium isotopic compositions and oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions. These trends can be explained by kinetic effects linked to changes in growth rate during the brachiopod life. The innermost calcite layer of T. transversa is in isotopic equilibrium for both oxygen and magnesium and could therefore be the best target for reconstructing past d 26 Mg values of seawater...|$|R

6000|$|... 9. Economy {{of time is}} very {{important}} both to the insects and the flowers, because the fine working days are comparatively few, and if no time is wasted the bees will get more honey, {{and in doing so}} will fertilise more flowers. Now, it has been ascertained by several observers that many insects, bees especially, keep to one kind of flower at a time, visiting hundreds of blossoms in succession, and passing over other species that may be mixed with them. They thus acquire quickness in going at once to the nectar, and the change of colour in the flower, or incipient withering when fertilised, enables them to avoid those flowers that have already had their honey exhausted. It is probably to assist the insects in keeping to one flower at a time, which is of vital importance to the perpetuation of the species, that the flowers which bloom intermingled at the same season are usually very distinct both in form and colour. In the sandy districts of Surrey, in the early spring, the copses are gay with three flowers--the primrose, the wood-anemone, and the lesser celandine, forming a beautiful contrast, {{while at the same time}} the purple and the white dead-nettles abound on hedge banks. A little later, in the same copses, we have the blue wild hyacinth (<b>Scilla</b> nutans), the red campion (Lychnis dioica), the pure white great starwort (Stellaria Holosteum), and the yellow dead-nettle (Lamium Galeobdolon), all distinct and well-contrasted flowers. In damp meadows in summer we have the ragged robin (Lychnis Floscuculi), the spotted orchis (O. maculata), and the yellow rattle (Rhinanthus Crista-galli); while in drier meadows we have cowslips, ox-eye daisies, and buttercups, all very distinct both in form and colour. So in cornfields we have the scarlet poppies, the purple corn-cockle, the yellow corn-marygold, and the blue cornflower; while on our moors the purple heath and the dwarf gorse make a gorgeous contrast. Thus the difference of colour which enables the insect to visit with rapidity and unerring aim a number of flowers of the same kind in succession, serves to adorn our meadows, banks, woods, and heaths with a charming variety of floral colour and form at each season of the year.[149] ...|$|E
