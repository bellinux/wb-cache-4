The effects of material properties (nucleation undercooling, density of nuclei in bulk liquid and alloy <b>solidification</b> <b>range)</b> on the CET are investigated. Simulated results reveal that: (1) equiaxed grains form at an earlier stage with a smaller critical nucleation undercooling; (2) CET is promoted if the density of nuclei in bulk liquid is increased; (3) extending the alloy <b>solidification</b> <b>range</b> promotes the CET. Finally, CET maps corresponding to different alloy concentrations are constructed, illustrating the relationship between processing conditions and the resulting grain structures for alloys with different solidification ranges...|$|E

This allows a continuous feed of liquid material to be present {{at the point of}} solidification to compensate for the shrinkage. Note that there is still a shrinkage void where the final material solidifies, but if designed properly this will be in the gating system or riser.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Thixoability of the ASTM A 536 {{nodular cast}} iron is analyzed, it meaning its ability to hold a {{thixotropic}} semi-solid state and to be formed as such. Thixoability can be characterized by the <b>solidification</b> <b>range,</b> fraction of primary phase and sensitiveness of liquid fraction with temperature (dfl/dT) within the <b>solidification</b> <b>range.</b> It is also investigated the effect of thixocasting in the microstructure of the considered alloy. Design/methodology/approach: Differential thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and thermodynamic calculation package THERMOCALC were used to predict transformations temperatures involving liquid formation and dfl/dT within the <b>solidification</b> <b>range.</b> Microstructures of thixotropic slurries produced by partial melting were observed. Findings: Thixoforming of ASTM A 536 nodular iron can be considered in a narrow window of about 28 °C, were some dissolution of graphite nodules can still be afforded; this window meaning the range of temperatures of co-existence of austenite + graphite + liquid were the eutectic transformation is taking place. At higher temperatures the dissolution of graphite nodules in liquid can be significant. Research limitations/implications: Thixoability prediction models rely on sensitive experiments as thermoanalysis, with results strongly dependent on experimental conditions; and on thermodynamic data, sometimes not available or reliable for a specific alloy composition. Practical implications: The prediction of the thixoability of a certain alloy can make it more effective its thixoprocessing, allows better control of processing parameters and quality of final product; can also subsidize modifications in the alloy {{to make it more}} suitable to semi-solid processing. Originality/value: The study of the thixoability of a nodular hypereutectic cast iron is an original subject, not available in the specialized literature, however absolutely necessary if thixoprocessing of this family of alloys is to be considered...|$|E

The solidification sequences in Allvac 718 Plus and alloy 718 were very similar to each other starting by an initial solidification of the gamma phase, gamma/MC reaction at around 1260 °C and then finally ending the sequence by gamma/Laves eutectic reaction at around 1150 °C. Waspaloy had the same solidification sequence, except no Laves phase formation takes place, and solidification started at a somewhat higher temperature as compared to alloy 718 and the solidification sequence ends by a gamma/MC reaction at around 1245 °C.

40|$|This work {{investigated}} the hot tearing susceptibility of TiB 2 reinforced Al– 5 Cu matrix composites. The {{results indicated that}} the hot tearing susceptibility of Al– 5 Cu alloy was significantly decreased when the TiB 2 content was less than 3 %. The improvement was attributed to the TiB 2 particles promoted the grain refinement. The hot tearing susceptibility of TiB 2 -reinforced Al– 5 Cu matrix composite decreased first and then increased with the increase of TiB 2 content. The 2 TiB 2 /Al– 5 Cu composite had the smallest hot tearing susceptibility value. It could be ascribed to the refined grain and shortened <b>solidification</b> temperature <b>range,</b> which contributed to the hot tearing susceptibility decrease. Nevertheless, the 4 TiB 2 /Al– 5 Cu and 6 TiB 2 /Al– 5 Cu composites had more severe hot tearing susceptibility than others. The reason was that the enlarged <b>solidification</b> temperature <b>range</b> increased the <b>solidification</b> shrinkage strain, which was adverse to the hot tearing susceptibility improvement.

50|$|Most {{materials}} shrink as they solidify, but, as {{the adjacent}} table shows, a few materials do not, such as gray cast iron. For the materials that do shrink upon solidification {{the type of}} shrinkage depends on how wide the freezing range is for the material. For materials with a narrow freezing range, less than 50 C, a cavity, known as a pipe, forms {{in the center of}} the casting, because the outer shell freezes first and progressively solidifies to the center. Pure and eutectic metals usually have narrow <b>solidification</b> <b>ranges.</b> These materials tend to form a skin in open air molds, therefore they are known as skin forming alloys. For materials with a wide freezing range, greater than 110 C, much more of the casting occupies the mushy or slushy zone (the temperature range between the solidus and the liquidus), which leads to small pockets of liquid trapped throughout and ultimately porosity. These castings tend to have poor ductility, toughness, and fatigue resistance. Moreover, for these types of materials to be fluid-tight a secondary operation is required to impregnate the casting with a lower melting point metal or resin.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh {{strength}} {{aluminum alloys}} {{are known as}} hard to weld alloys due to their high hot crack susceptibility. However, they have high potential for applications in light weight constructions of automotive industry and therefore it is needed to increase weldability. One major issue is the high hot cracking susceptibility. Vaporization during laser beam welding leads to a change of concentration of the volatile elements magnesium and zinc. Hence, <b>solidification</b> <b>range</b> of the weld and therefore hot cracking susceptibility changes. Additionally, different welding velocities lead to changed solidification conditions with certain influence on hot cracking. This paper discusses the influence of energy per unit length during laser beam welding of AA 7075 on the change of element concentration in the weld seam and the resulting influence on hot cracking susceptibility. Therefore EDS-measurements of weld seams generated with different velocities are performed to determine the change of element concentration. These quantitative data is used to numerically calculate the <b>solidification</b> <b>range</b> in order to evaluate its influence on the hot cracking susceptibility. Besides that, relative hot crack length and mechanical properties are measured. The results increase knowledge about welding of high strength aluminum alloy AA 7075 and hence support further developing of the welding process...|$|E

40|$|During direct-chill (DC) casting of {{aluminium}} alloys high temperature gradients are developed across the ingot such that stresses are generated. These stresses may induce cracks or even lead to ingot fracture. There {{are two types of}} cracks to consider: hot tears which are formed at temperatures above the solidus and cold cracks which appear at temperatures below the solidus and can damage the entire ingot. High-strength aluminium alloys are more vulnerable to cold cracking mainly because of the poor thermal and mechanical properties in the genuine as-cast condition. Low thermal conductivities and large solidification temperature range are the main thermal properties which make the alloy more prone to cracking. The temperature range between rigidity temperature, the temperature below which the material starts holding thermal strains, and non-equilibrium solidus determines the solidification contraction range, and is the crucial factor for hot cracking susceptibility. In this Master’s thesis this temperature was defined for a group of AA 7050 alloys with different chemical compositions and prepared under different casting process, to study the effect of grain refinement, impurities and cooling conditions. The temperatures when the tested alloys started to contract, Tth, were between 510 - 548 ºC. The <b>solidification</b> <b>range</b> over which the material changes from liquid state to the solid was in the range from 176 ºC to 161 ºC. Grain refinement decreased Tth and the <b>solidification</b> <b>range.</b> Numerical simulations have been run using the thermal properties of an AA 7050 grain refined aluminium alloy to determine the stress and strain state of a DC-cast billet. Simulation results showed that material is prone to yielding at temperatures ranging from 400 ºC to rigidity point (510 ºC) and hot cracks can probably form, especially in the centre of the billet, where the residual thermal stresses are all tensile.

40|$|Cold {{cracking}} is {{a potentially}} catastrophic phenomenon in direct chill (DC) casting of 7 xxx series aluminum alloys {{that leads to}} safety hazards and loss of production. The relatively low thermal conductivity and wide <b>solidification</b> temperature <b>range</b> in these alloys results in accumulation of residual thermal stress under nonuniform cooling conditions of the billets. In addition, such alloys show a severe loss in ductility below a critical temperature of 573 K (300 C). This brit-tleness along with high stress concentration at the tips of voids and microcracks can lead to catastrophic failure. Casting process parameters affect the magnitude and distribution of stresses in the billet and increase the susceptibility of the material to cold cracking. In order to investi-gate the effect of casting process parameters such as casting speed, billet size, and water flow rate, thermomechanical simulations were applied using ALSIM 5 casting simulation software. Among the studied casting process parameters, the increased billet size and high casting speed resulted in the most dramatic increase in residual stress level.
