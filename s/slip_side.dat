40|$|A novel model-based {{method for}} odometry {{calculation}} of all-terrain mobile robots is proposed in this paper. Using an all-terrain mobile robot with passively compliant mechanism as an instance, this paper grasps the wheel slip {{as a key}} factor affecting the accuracy of odometry calculation by investigating the physical contact relationship between the wheel and the terrain. Firstly, the wheel slip model involving rolling <b>slip,</b> <b>side</b> slip and turning slip is investigated. Then, the whole kinematics model of the robot is built considering the above wheel slips. Finally, the odometry information is achieved based on solving the kinematics model of the robot and the dead-reckon operation. Both theoretical analyses and experimental results testify the correctness and validity of this method. Moreover, the odometry calculation method proposed in this paper can be easily performed based on on-board sensors without taking extra hardware cost.

These panels are part of the thermal protection system that protects the Orbiter wings from extreme heating that take place on the reentry in to the earth atmosphere. On some panels that experience extreme heating, liberation of silicon carbon (SiC) coating was observed on the <b>slip</b> <b>side</b> regions of the panels. Global structural and local fracture mechanics analyses were performed on these panels as a part of the root cause investigation of this coating liberation anomaly. The wing-leading-edge reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panels, Panel 9, T-seal 10, and Panel 10, are shown in Figure 1 and the progression of the stress analysis models is presented in Figure 2. The global structural analyses showed minimal interaction between adjacent panels and the T-seal that bridges the gap between the panels. A bounding uniform temperature is applied to a representative panel and the resulting stress distribution is examined. For this loading condition, the interlaminar normal stresses showed negligible variation in the chord direction and increased values in the vicinity of the slip-side joggle shoulder. As such, a representative span wise slice on the panel can be taken and the cross section can be analyzed using plane strain analysis...|$|E

For the zero <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle case the surprising aspect of the flow is the non-uniform low velocity regions below the canopy that correspond to the separation bubbles, also a thick boundary layer follows {{all the way to}} the trailing edge. The lift coefficient increases linearly with the angle of attack up to 12 ?? with the lift curve slope of 0. 0302 (per deg) and zero lift angle of attack of - 4. 3 ??. The lowest drag coefficient occurs at an angle of attack range of 0 ?? to 2 ??. The largest lift-to-drag ratio is achieved at 10 ?? angle of attack. For the non-zero <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle case the side force coefficient decreases not quite linearly with the <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle; this linear shape is more visible until 10 ?? <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle with the side force curve slope of - 0. 0048 (per deg) and zero side force angle of 0. 15 ??.

Due to the practical difficulty in direct measurement of <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle, accurate estimation of vehicle <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle using available signals is becoming important. This paper presents a novel algorithm for estimating the <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle of a vehicle in real time using inertial motion sensors. The algorithm uses a J 48 decision tree classifier to assist the Extended Kaiman Filter (EKF) predictions of the vehicle <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle. The decision tree classifies the inertial data into classes based on the condition the slip angle {{is expected to be}} in. Using the class information asserted by the classifier, the error covariance parameter of the EKF is adjusted to compensate for changes in disturbances and nonlinearities.

Values less than one, where the front wheel <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> {{is greater than the}} rear wheel <b>side</b> <b>slip,</b> are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|R
40|$|Wheeled mobile robots are {{increasingly}} being utilized in unknown and dangerous situations such as lunar surface exploration. Velocity estimation is of importance for lunar rovers to autonomously navigate and successfully traverse on rough terrains. The dynamic effects occurring at the wheel-terrain interface such as wheel slips {{make it difficult to}} real-time estimate the rover&# 39;s velocity only by position-measurement sensors. Effective acceleration sensor data are hard to observe since lunar rovers usually move at a very slow speed. This paper proposes a kinematics-based method for velocity estimation of lunar rovers by using wheel encoders and gyro measurements. Treating the lunar rover with passively compliant mechanisms as a series-parallel multi-body system, we can directly build the whole kinematics model based on closed velocity chain theory. The wheel-terrain physical contact and wheel slips involving rolling <b>slip,</b> <b>side</b> slip and turning slip are also investigated. The forward velocity calculation is achieved based on solving kinematics of the rover. Low-accuracy gyro signals are modelled as a stochastic procedure and processed with the standard Kalman filter. Physical experimental results of gyro signals filtering and velocity estimation are given to show the validity and usefulness of the methods. This kinematics-based velocity estimation method can be easily performed based on on-board sensors with low system cost.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Slipped capital femoral {{epiphysis}} {{is known}} to produce characteristic deformities in the proximal femur, which affect hip motion and may cause a limp. This paper assessed the 3 D gait kinematics in adolescents after single screw fixation of moderate to severe, stable, unilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Our goals were to characterize the 3 D kinematic patterns and to investigate {{the correlation between the}} severity of radiological deformity and severity of gait disturbance. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients seen at our institution between 2000 and 2009. Antero-posterior and frog lateral X-rays were reviewed to measure: Southwick's lateral slip angle, the alpha angle of Notzli and Klein's line offset. Quantitative 3 D gait data was collected using a state of the art motion capture system. Kinematic waveforms were compared using a functional data analysis version of the t-test. FINDINGS: There were 30 patients with an average age at pinning of 13 y (10 - 17 y). Mean gait profile scores were significantly abnormal for <b>slipped</b> <b>side</b> (10. 8 °) versus sound side (6. 8 °), <b>slipped</b> <b>side</b> versus normal (5. 6 °) and sound side versus normal. There was little statistically significant correlation between severity of radiographic deformity and degree of gait disturbance. INTERPRETATION: Major kinematic pattern deviations could be associated with (a) morphology of the proximal femur and potential femoral acetabular impingement problems and (b) leg length discrepancy. Gait analysis was able to quantify the kinematic deviations due to the anatomical deformities. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|The {{omni-directional}} {{vehicle is}} an innovative vehicle, {{in which the}} in-wheel steering motor and in-wheel driving motor are integrated into each wheel of the vehicle so that each wheel can be independently controlled to have traction, braking, and turning motions to improve the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s mobility, handling and stability. To realize good performance, various control strategies have been proposed, like the active steering control and the direct yaw moment control, where the accurate slip angle information is critical to these control strategies. However, in practice, the <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle is hard or expensive to be measured for a passenger vehicle, therefore, different estimation methods have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, a novel <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle estimation method is proposed for the omni-directional vehicle that has four independent steering motors. This method includes the estimation of total alignment torque and <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> angle, and only needs the measurements of steering angles and steering motor currents, which are available by using angle sensors and current sensors embedded with the in-wheel steering motors.
