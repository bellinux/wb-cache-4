50|$|Some {{implements}} do use plastic {{guards to}} try to keep a person from becoming entangled in a PTO shaft, but even with guards people need to exercise caution around PTO shafts when they are plugged into a tractor or truck. In some countries it is illegal to operate a PTO without the <b>shaft</b> <b>guard</b> correctly fastened. In the UK, Health and Safety Executive guidance is contained in a leaflet. The principle of how the guards work is that they are light and free-spinning over top of the shaft, so if a non-spinning object (such as a person's clothes or hair) comes into contact with them, they quickly stop spinning although the shaft keeps spinning underneath them.|$|E

40|$|The rate of {{occupational}} accidents in British agriculture {{is higher than}} in most other industries. The most common fatal accidents are those involving vehicles and machinery, falls from a height and electrocution. A substantial proportion of reported non-fatal injuries in agricultural employees is attributable to manual handling, but among self-employed farmers the contribution is much smaller. Few data are available on longer-term determinants of risk, but accidental deaths are most frequent in July, August and September. The main approaches to preventing agricultural accidents are through engineering improvements, and education and training of the workforce. The introduction of roll-over protection structures for tractors {{has been an important}} development in recent decades. Other engineering controls include guards for power take off <b>shafts,</b> <b>guard</b> rails to prevent falls, better handling facilities for animals and closed transfer systems for pesticides. Training on safety is available from several sources, but its effectiveness in reducing accidents is uncertain...|$|R
50|$|The Underearth is a {{place of}} fantastic, awful, sorcerous beauty and wonder. It is most often reached through the shaft of a {{gigantic}} extinct volcano; this <b>shaft</b> is <b>guarded</b> by three gates: the first is made of agate, the second is made of blue steel, and the third gate is made of black fire. There is only one city in the Underearth - Druhim Vanashta, the city of demons. It is made of precious minerals, gems, and metals and is beautiful, though its inhabitants are cruel and wicked.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of November 4, 2016, a {{returning}} US Humvee was fired upon as it approached the gates to Prince Faisal airbase, a Jordanian military training center. The lead vehicle cleared through the gate, but as the second vehicle approached, Jordanian Air Force Sgt. M'aarek Abu Tayeh (alt:al-Tuwayha), opened fire with a rifle from his camouflaged concrete <b>guard</b> <b>shaft</b> hitting the two occupants inside and killing them both. Two US soldiers leaped from other vehicles in the convoy to take cover behind a concrete blast wall. The soldiers called to the guard in both English and Arabic that they were friendly forces but he allegedly continued to shoot. The Jordanian NCO wearing body armor and wielding his assault rifle left his <b>guard</b> <b>shaft</b> to charge at the US soldiers, firing several bursts into one of them. A surviving fourth US soldier fired back at the guard with his pistol, hitting him several times. The 3 US Green Berets; Staff Sgt. Matthew Lewellen (3rd Battalion), Staff Sgt. Kevin McEnroe (3rd Battalion) and Staff Sgt. James Moriarty (1st Battalion) of the 5th Special Forces Group were shot and killed and Jordanian officer Abu Tayeh critically wounded in an induced coma.|$|R
40|$|Based on Cichlidogyrus sp. (Monogenea, Ancyrocephalidae) {{specimens}} from Hemichromis sp. hosts, {{we tested}} the influence of different methods to fix/preserve samples/specimens [frozen material, alcohol or formalin preserved, museum process for fish preservation (fixed in formalin and preserved in alcohol) ] and different media used to mount the slides [tap water, glycerin ammonium picrate (GAP), Hoyer's one (HM) ] on the size/shape of sclerotized parts of monogenean specimens. The {{results show that the}} use of HM significantly increases the size of haptoral sclerites [marginal hooks I, II, IV, V, and VI; dorsal bar length, width, distance between auricles and auricle length, ventral bar length and width], and changes their shape [angle opening between <b>shaft</b> and <b>guard</b> (outer and inner roots) in both ventral and dorsal anchors, ventral bar much wider, dorsal one less curved]. This influence seems to be reduced when specimens/samples are fixed in formalin. The systematics of Monogenea being based on {{the size and shape of}} their sclerotized parts, to prevent misidentifications or description of invalid new species, we recommend the use of GAP as mounting medium; Hoyer's one should be restricted to monogenean specimens fixed for a long time which are more shrunken...|$|R
50|$|Today, the {{district}} remains abandoned, though rumors of plans {{to reopen the}} Fourth Of July Mine have been circulated, though no real developments have occurred. What {{is left of the}} mines is unprotected, meaning they are still open. Although, the Peacock Mine is gated at both adits, and the <b>shafts</b> are <b>guarded</b> by chain link fencing. Other than the Peacock, the mines are left unregulated. Many of which have collapsed. Collapsed mines or mines with a caved entrance include {{but are not limited to}} the Kansas, Nevada, Arlington, and Idaho mines. Flooded mines include but are not limited to the Fourth Of July, Idaho, Poorman, and Last Chance mines. Due to infrequent inspection of the mines, there is no data of the status of most of the mines. We can only rely on ones who have explored these mines themselves. For instance, a recent expedition revealed the above data. The Poorman Mine is reported in good condition, besides high iron content water collecting on the floor of the mine, there is no evidence suggesting much has occurred within the mine. Water seepage can be responsible for structural weakening though, and oxygen deprivation. Water can also cover up a winze, which is a shaft within the mine, or entrap dangerous gases in which are released upon disturbing of the surface tension. Always use caution when exploring an abandoned mine.|$|R
