5000|$|A urokotori (Japanese: 鱗取 or うろことり, literally: <b>Scale</b> <b>Remover)</b> is a utensil used in Japanese cuisine {{to remove}} the scales from the skin of fish before cooking. Alternatively, it is {{possible}} {{to remove the}} scales with a knife, but this is more difficult and there is a higher risk of cutting the skin of the fish, especially with small fishes as well as one's own hand. The urokotori is pulled across the skin of the fish from the tail to the head repeatedly to remove the scales.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of high concentration metal ions such as Ca 2 + and Mg 2 together with carbonate and sulphate 'ions in industrial process always {{gave rise to}} scaling. The carbonate, and sulfate of calcium, strontium and barium {{are the most common}} scales formed. Scales are usually formed when salt water is saturated with the ions and exposed to drastic changes in temperature and pressures. The composition and forms of scales may vary dependent on industry such as the formation of calcium phosphate in sugar refineries while calcium carbonate scaling in boiler tube of steam generating facilities. The objectives of this research are to characterize the nature and component of CaCO 3 based scales, to establish the ability of commercial <b>scale</b> <b>remover</b> formulation in removing CaCO 3 scales and to study the impact of these commercial scale removers on pipe material. Sample of scale were collected at selected plant. The scale samples were analyzed using FourierTransform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique and Thermal Gravimetric analysis. FTIR analysis confirmed the dominance of carbonate phase in the samples while the XRD analyses confirmed the {{presence of}} CaCO 3 as calcite and aragonite. Thermal Gravimefric Analysis enables the determination of amount of carbonate present in the samples. The efficiencies of different commercial <b>scale</b> <b>remover</b> were compared based on their ability to dissolve the scale sample. The effects of <b>scale</b> <b>remover</b> towards carbon steel sample that are commonly used as pipe material were studied. Formulation AM 1082 was found to be the most efficient in dissolving the scale sample followed by formulation AM 1081, AJvI 1 O 8 O, sulfamic acid and last the sulfuric acid. Formulation AM 1082 has been found to cause minimal leaching of the piped material while sulfuric acid caused the worst effect. Overall AM 1 082 <b>scale</b> <b>remover</b> proved to be the best formulation and less harmful to the pipe material...|$|E

Chevron Pacific Indonesia {{has been}} periodically protected with scale inhibitor injection, <b>scale</b> <b>remover,</b> coating and pigging, however {{it was still}} found internal corrosion issues that caused by SRB (Sulfate Reducing Bacteria). In effort to control growth of SRB, the research was conducted to determine the correlation between temperature of crude oil {{to the growth of}} SRB population. Variations in crude oil samples from 20 production wells, which was the actual temperature directly measured in the field, then Bart Test was conducted in laboratory to measure SRB population in every day within 8 days. The results showed that SRB population was not found for crude oil sample from production well with temperature above 150 °F, while with temperature under 150 °F SRB population can be found in vary population. pH range of all samples was still stay in pH range for the SRB life...|$|E

30|$|Elkatatny (2016) {{stated that}} {{chelating}} agents were heavily used in oil industry as iron control agents, <b>scale</b> <b>removers,</b> and recently introduced as stand-alone stimulation fluids in sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. Mahmoud et al. (2011 a, 2014) performed several coreflooding experiments using {{different types of}} sandstone and limestone cores at high temperatures using chelating agents such as EDTA, GLDA, and HEDTA at different pH values and different concentrations. HEDTA and EDTA chelating agents are compatible with sandstone cores containing high percent of clay minerals such as illite and kaolinite. Chelating agents did not cause fines migration or clay swelling when injected through different types of sandstone cores (Mahmoud et al. 2011 b). Ali et al. (2005) concluded that HEDTA solutions (low pH) can stimulate sandstone and carbonate formations at high temperature.|$|R
40|$|Acute or {{subacute}} chemical-induced lung {{injury is}} rarely compound specific and {{is most often}} caused by an accidental occupational, domestic or environmental exposure to an inhaled chemical agent. The industrial disaster that happened in Bhopal in 1984, accidental poisoning with chlorine and petroleum hydrocarbons and also vesicant gases used during conflicts, are specific examples. Rarely, a chemical agent can cause lung damage by being ingested and reaching the lung through the systemic circulation (for example accidental or deliberate paraquat ingestion). Household accidents should not be underestimated. An important cause of household accidents is chlorine inhalation resulting from mixing bleach with acids such as the <b>scale</b> <b>removers</b> used to clean toilets. Chemical agents can provoke direct and/or indirect damage to the respiratory tract. The acute or subacute clinical manifestations resulting from inhalation of chemical agents are very varied and include inhalation fevers, acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and acute or subacute pneumonitis. The site and the severity of chemical-induced respiratory damage caused by inhaled chemical agents depend mainly on the nature {{and the amount of}} the agent inhaled. The immediate and long-term prognosis and possible sequelae are also variable. This review excludes infectious or immunologically induced acute respiratory diseases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Methanesulfonic acid (MSA) {{has been}} proven as a <b>scale</b> <b>remover</b> and, more recently, as a {{stand-alone}} stimulation fluid in carbonate acidizing. MSA is a strong alkyl sulfonic acid having a pK value of - 1. 9, and it dissolves carbonate and oxides with its calcium water-soluble salts. Although the acid has many promising results for acidizing, little is known in relation to its detailed kinetics. This study aims to understand the reaction profile of MSA to provide relevant information to scientists and engineers to design acidizing jobs with this improved fluid. The dissolution of calcite in MSA was studied {{with the aid of}} a rotating disk system at 1000 psig in the temperature range 73 - 250 ?F. As a result of this study, dissolution rate parameters for this system were reported for the first time. Details of the approach for this study include using marble disks of 1. 5 -in. diameter and 0. 7 -in. thickness. The dissolution rate was found by measuring the calcium concentration in the effluent as a function of time using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The effects of MSA concentrations (5 to 20 wt%), disk rotational speeds (100 to 1500 rpm), and temperature on the rate of dissolution were also investigated. Experimental results showed that, within the range of temperatures tested, the dissolution rate of MSA with calcite was mass-transfer limited, even at high disk rotation speeds and at high temperatures. At 5 wt% MSA concentration and at room temperature (73 ?F), the rate of reaction was controlled by both mass transfer and surface reaction regime. The diffusion coefficient of a 5 wt% MSA fluid at 150 ?F was found to be 3. 00 x 10 ^- 4 cm^ 2 /s, and at 250 ?F the diffusion coefficient was found to be 9. 76 x 10 ^- 4 cm^ 2 /s. The acid diffusivity increased with increasing system temperature. At 5 wt% MSA, the effect of diffusion on temperature followed the Arrhenius law and the activation energy and the pre-exponential constant for diffusion were found to be 30 KJ/mole K and 9. 485 cm^ 2 /s, respectively. Determination of the dissolution rate of MSA will increase the understanding of its performance as a stand-alone stimulation fluid. Its high acidity, high solubility of its calcium salts, and good thermal stability, along with its low corrosivity and readily biodegradable composition, makes this acid an attractive alternative to HCl in designing high-temperature acidizing applications...|$|E
40|$|Scale {{formation}} {{is recognized as}} one of the major problems affecting production in the oil and gas sector. There are many approaches to remove and prevent scaling with chemical inhibition, chemical <b>scale</b> <b>removers</b> and mechanical methods being the most prevalent ones. Recently the focus has shifted onto more environmentally friendly inhibitors that are less toxic to the environment, thus the development of green inhibitors. Another way forward is to turn to surface engineering - this is a very popular approach in the control of biofouling but only a few attempts have been made to use it for the purpose of scale inhibition. It is fair to say that there is a potential for more widespread study and exploitation of such systems. Biomimetics in surface engineering is receiving more attention as nature provides surfaces with a whole range of functionality. In the present work, microand nano-structured polymers surfaces with the self-cleaning Lotus and antireflective Moth-eye effects have been assessed as potential surfaces able to reduce mineral scale deposition. Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) was deposited onto them and their performance compared with reference stainless steel surfaces. In addition, the anti-scaling performance of three commercially available coatings – DLC, Tech 100 and Tech 23 was also investigated. The surfaces were tested in a rotating cylinder electrode (RCE) under different fluid hydrodynamic conditions i. e. both laminar to turbulent flow. Last but not least, micro-adhesion tests under water were conducted in an attempt to relate deposition tests to the adhesion properties of a single CaCO 3 crystal against a surface as a measure of anti-scaling performance. ...|$|R
