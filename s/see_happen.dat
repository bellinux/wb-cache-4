25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others.

With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be.

2500|$|While his {{intentions}} for publishing a fresh Latin translation are clear, {{it is less}} clear why he included the Greek text. Though some speculate that he intended on producing a critical Greek text or {{that he wanted to}} beat the Complutensian Polyglot into print, {{there is no evidence to}} support this. Rather his motivation may have been simpler: he included the Greek text to prove the superiority of his Latin version. He wrote, [...] "There remains the New Testament translated by me, with the Greek facing, and notes on it by me." [...] He further demonstrated the reason for the inclusion of the Greek text when defending his work: [...] "But one thing the facts cry out, and it can be clear, as they say, even to a blind man, that often through the translator’s clumsiness or inattention the Greek has been wrongly rendered; often the true and genuine reading has been corrupted by ignorant scribes, which we <b>see</b> <b>happen</b> every day, or altered by scribes who are half-taught and half-asleep." [...] Erasmus' new work was published by Froben of Basel in 1516, becoming the first published Greek New Testament, the Novum Instrumentum omne, diligenter ab Erasmo Rot. Recognitum et Emendatum. He used manuscripts: 1, 1rK, 2e, 2ap, 4ap, 7, 817.|$|E

60|$|And, I should say, I {{have come}} to this opinion mainly by {{comparing}} this psalm with the writings of heathens, even the wisest {{and the best of}} them. For the heathens, like all men, used to have their troubles, and to ask themselves, Who has sent this trouble? And why has he sent it? And their answers remain to us in their writings, some worse, some better, some very foolish, some tolerably wise. But when one compares the heathen writings with this psalm, or with any psalms or passages of the Old Testament which talk of God's dealings with man, then we shall be altogether astonished at the superiority of the Bible. The Bible will seem to us quite infinitely wiser than heathen books, on this matter, as on others-- so much more simple, and yet so much more deep; so much more rational also, and so much more true: agreeing so much more with the facts which we <b>see</b> <b>happen</b> round us: agreeing so much more with our own reason, experience, inward conscience, about what is just and unjust:--that we shall begin to see as much difference between heathen books and the Old Testament, as there is between the dim dawn of morning, and the full blaze of noonday light.|$|E
60|$|What {{would happen}} then, you may guess for yourself, {{from what you}} <b>see</b> <b>happen</b> {{whenever}} the land is left to itself, {{as it is in}} the wood above. In that wood you can still see the grass ridges and furrows which show that it was once ploughed and sown by man; perhaps as late as the time of Henry the Eighth, when a great deal of poor land, as you will read some day, was thrown out of tillage, to become forest and down once more. And what is the mount now? A jungle of oak and beech, cherry and holly, young and old all growing up together, with the mountain ash and bramble and furze coming up so fast beneath them, that we have to cut the paths clear again year by year. Why, even the little cow-wheat, a very old- world plant, which only grows in ancient woods, has found its way back again, I know not whence, and covers the open spaces with its pretty yellow and white flowers. Man had conquered this mount, you see, from Madam How, hundreds of years ago. And she always lets man conquer her, because Lady Why wishes man to conquer: only he must have a fair fight with Madam How first, and try his strength against hers to the utmost. So man conquered the wood for a while; and it became cornfield instead of forest: but he was not strong and wise enough three hundred years ago to keep what he had conquered; and back came Madam How, and took the place into her own hands, and bade the old forest trees and plants come back again--as they would come if they were not stopped year by year, down from the wood, over the pastures--killing the rich grasses as they went, till they met another forest coming up from below, and fought it for many a year, till both made peace, and lived quietly side by side for ages.|$|E
