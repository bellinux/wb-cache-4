5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed {{that he did not}} look like a military man, they felt he had the quality they were looking for in the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge was}} damaged during floods in March 1936 when water {{infiltrated}} and caused shorts in the bridge's electrical equipment. Repairs {{were made in}} late 1938 and early 1939. The Electrical Underground Construction Co. of New York City received $9,245 to replace damaged electrical equipment and wiring, install new electrical conduits, and install two <b>sump</b> <b>pumps.</b> In October 1936, a gear and a crankshaft in the drawbridge broke. The bridge was closed for nine hours while crews rushed to repair the span, which was open and unable to permit traffic. The closing, the Washington Post reported, was the longest since the bridge opened.|$|E
25|$|With the {{pilot-operated}} {{relief valve}} still open, the pressurizer relief tank that collected the {{discharge from the}} pilot-operated relief valve overfilled, causing the containment building sump to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated relief valve discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications {{that there was an}} ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators. At 4:15am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general containment building. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the containment building sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> were stopped at 4:39am.|$|E

5000|$|Automatic vs. manual {{operation}} - Selection of a manual <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> means that one will turn the pump {{on and off}} when appropriate. Selecting an automatic <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> means that a switch is wired to the <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> {{to turn it on}} or off at appropriate water levels. Automatic switches include pressure switches, low level pressure switches, float switches, and a solid state water sensor called field-effect.|$|R

25|$|In areas {{prone to}} urban flooding, one {{solution}} is the repair {{and expansion of}} man-made sewer systems and stormwater infrastructure. Another strategy is to reduce impervious surfaces in streets, parking lots and buildings through natural drainage channels, porous paving, and wetlands (collectively known as green infrastructure or sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS)). Areas identified as flood-prone can be converted into parks and playgrounds that can tolerate occasional flooding. Ordinances can be adopted to require developers to retain stormwater on site and require buildings to be elevated, protected by floodwalls and levees, or designed to withstand temporary inundation. Property owners can also invest in solutions themselves, such as re-landscaping their property to take {{the flow of water}} away from their building and installing rain barrels, <b>sump</b> <b>pumps,</b> and check valves.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, two reporters for the Niagara Falls Gazette, David Pollak and David Russell, tested several <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> near Love Canal {{and found}} toxic {{chemicals}} in them. The Gazette published reports, once in October 1976 {{and once in}} November 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal dumpsite indicated presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons. The matter went quiet {{for more than a}} year and was resurrected by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by carrying forth an informal door-to-door survey in early 1978, finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group, which was led by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a dozen) birth defects. The New York State Health Department followed suit and found an abnormal incidence of miscarriages.|$|E
2500|$|On August 7, 1978, United States President Jimmy Carter {{announced}} a federal health emergency, {{called for the}} allocation of federal funds, and ordered the Federal Disaster Assistance Agency to assist the City of Niagara Falls to remedy the Love Canal site. This {{was the first time}} in American history that emergency funds were used for a situation other than a natural disaster. [...] Carter had trenches built that would transport the wastes to sewers and had home <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> sealed off.|$|E

2500|$|Phi Tau Coeducational Fraternity at Dartmouth College {{was founded}} as the Tau Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa in 1905. [...] Phi Sigma Kappa was the sixteenth {{fraternity}} {{to open a}} chapter at Dartmouth. [...] Being a relatively late arrival on campus, prime lots on Webster Avenue, {{where most of the}} other fraternities were located, were unavailable. [...] With the help of the national organization, a house for the fraternity was purchased on what was then the northern edge of the college campus. [...] By the late 1920s, however, the house had begun to show its age, and a building campaign resulted in the demolition of the old building and {{the construction of a new}} building during the 1927-1928 academic year. [...] This new house was built with three stories above ground with a basement, and included living quarters for eighteen students (the maximum permitted by the College at the time.) [...] Although the new residence included a kitchen, fraternities at Dartmouth were not allowed to serve meals on a regular basis, and the kitchen was used primarily by the residents and during social functions. [...] Over the years, there were many changes to the building, including two different porches constructed on the south side of the building, the installation of <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> which allowed finishing of rooms in the basement, and the relocation of the boiler room, social areas, and even a staircase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} where {{basement}} flooding happens regularly and to solve dampness {{where the water}} table is above {{the foundation of a}} home. <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> send water away from a house to any place where it is no longer problematic, such as a municipal storm drain or a dry well.|$|E

50|$|Sump basins and <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> must be maintained. Typical {{recommendations}} suggest examining equipment every year. Pumps running frequently due {{to higher}} water table, water drainage, or weather conditions {{should be examined}} more frequently. <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps,</b> being mechanical devices, will fail eventually, {{which could lead to}} a flooded basement and costly repairs. Redundancy in the system (multiple/secondary pumps) can help to avoid problems when maintenance and repairs are needed on the primary system.|$|E
50|$|Interior French drain {{installation}} {{is an effective}} way to waterproof a basement but requires the use of a sump pump. Many contractors will install plastic <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> that can quickly break down or neglect to install a battery backup sump pump, making the basement vulnerable to flooding during power outages. <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> should be installed with a battery backup system in a proper sump liner of 20 gal size or larger to prevent the sump from having too little water and turning on and off continuously.|$|E
5000|$|Phase and voltage - <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> powered {{from the}} AC mains are {{available}} with single-phase or three-phase induction motors, rated for 110-120, 220-240, or 460 volts. Three-phase power is typically not available in residential locations.|$|E

50|$|Pumps may {{discharge}} to the {{sanitary sewer}} in older installations. Once considered acceptable, this practice may now violate the plumbing code or municipal bylaws, {{because it can}} overwhelm the municipal sewage treatment system. Municipalities urge homeowners to disconnect and reroute <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> discharge away from sanitary sewers. Fines may be imposed for noncompliance. Many homeowners have inherited their <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> configurations and do not realize that the pump discharges into the sewer.|$|R
50|$|A {{grinder pump}} is {{different}} from a <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> or effluent pump. There {{are two types of}} grinder pumps, semi-positive displacement (SPD) and centrifugal.|$|R
50|$|Basement {{waterproofing}} involves {{techniques and}} materials {{used to prevent}} water from penetrating {{the basement of a}} house or a building.

50|$|When {{examining}} a <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> and cleaning it, dirt, gravel, sand, and other debris {{should be removed}} to increase efficiency and {{extend the life of}} the pump. These obstructions can also decrease the pump's ability to drain the sump, and can allow the sump to overflow. The check valve can also jam from the debris. Examine the discharge line opening, when applicable, to ensure there are no obstructions in the line. Even a partially obstructed discharge line can force a <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> to work harder and increase its chance of overheating and failure.|$|R

5000|$|Head {{pressure}} - The {{head pressure}} of a <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> describes the maximum height that the pump will move water. For instance, a <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> with a 15 feet (4.6 m) maximum head (also called a shutoff head) will raise water up 15 feet (4.6 m) before it completely loses flow. Technically, head pressure {{is defined as}} an expression of a pressure in terms of the height of fluid; P = yρg, where y is the fluid column height, ρ is fluid density and g is the acceleration of gravity. Other considerations may be added to overall head pressure, including loss from elbows/bends and friction loss from long horizontal runs.|$|R
