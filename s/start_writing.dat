5|$|Norbert Jacques {{wrote the}} {{original}} Dr. Mabuse {{books in the}} style of other popular thrillers in Europe at the time, such as Nick Carter, Fantomas, and Fu Manchu. Jacques expanded the traits of these books to include critiques on Weimar Germany. In 1930, Jacques was approached by a film producer to develop a story for a new Dr. Mabuse film with a female villain.

In the novel, a character named Frau Kristine obtains a copy of Mabuse's testament which outlines plans for a future world of terrorism and crime that she uses.|$|E
5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to <b>start</b> <b>writing</b> the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.|$|E

25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{with tape}} leaders {{was that the}} sound recording or playback did not {{start at the beginning}} of the tape, forcing the user to cue forward to the start of the magnetic section. For certain applications, such as dictation, special cassettes containing leaderless tapes were made, typically with stronger material and for use in machines that had more sophisticated end-of-tape prediction. Home computers that made use of cassettes prior to the advent of floppy discs (i.e. Apple II, Commodore PET) were designed to not <b>start</b> <b>writing</b> or reading data until leaders had spooled past.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by the {{aspirations}} of Knowles's father Mathew, the album was titled after Hadley Street, a plot of land in downtown Houston: [...] "My father took me there one day {{and told me he}} was going to build a studio," [...] {{she said in an interview}} with the Daily Mail.

The band felt that it was foremost that the new songs worked on an emotional level with Manson's vocals and lyrics. The initial sessions ultimately led to around 32 song ideas to develop further.|$|E
