5000|$|Within {{a couple}} of years five of the {{original}} investors reorganized and refinanced the project, but since the Harvard telescope had been removed, and interest in Mt. Wilson had tailed off, they thought it better to downsize the project from a twelve-foot road to a four-foot road. By June 1891, after only five months work, a usable ten mile (16 km) trail was established. In July the new toll road was officially opened to the public and the toll fixed by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors at 25 cents for hikers (...) and 50 cents for horseback. The new road was called the [...] "New Mt. Wilson Trail", and it soon became more popular than the old Sierra Madre trail. Foot and pack animal traffic became so heavy that in June 1893 the trail was widened to <b>six</b> <b>feet,</b> making two <b>way</b> travel much easier.|$|R
60|$|The Temple {{occupied}} a square, <b>six</b> hundred <b>feet</b> every <b>way.</b> The lofty rock {{on which it}} stood had been cased with solid masonry, so that it rose perpendicularly from the plain. On {{the top of this}} massive foundation was built a strong and lofty wall, round the whole area. Within this wall was a spacious double cloister, fifty-two and one half feet broad, supported by one hundred and sixty-two columns. On the south side the cloister was one hundred and five feet wide--being a triple cloister--and was here called the King's Cloister. Within the area surrounded by the cloisters was an open court, paved with marble; this was the Court of the Gentiles, and was separated from the second court--that of the Jews--by a stone railing, five feet high.|$|R

5000|$|The message [...] "John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] is an {{assertion}} involving truth that commits the speaker to its factuality, whereas the reified statement [...] "Mary reports that John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] defers such commitment to Mary. In this way, the statements can be incompatible without creating contradictions in reasoning. For example, the statements [...] "John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] and [...] "John is five feet tall" [...] are mutually exclusive (and thus incompatible), but the statements [...] "Mary reports that John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] and [...] "Paul reports that John is five feet tall" [...] are not incompatible, {{as they are}} both governed by a conclusive rationale that either Mary or Paul is (or both are), in fact, incorrect.|$|R
