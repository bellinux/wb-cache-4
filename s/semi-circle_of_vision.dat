40|$|Purpose: A {{system to}} measure the {{visibility}} of agricultural tractor operators was designed and evaluated according to ISO standards, and a blind area diagram around the tested tractor was created based on the manual method recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Methods: A visibility measurement system was designed and evaluated based on the ISO 5006 and ISO 5721 - 1 standards. Two bulbs used to simulate the operator's eyes were mounted on a bar with a supporting frame. A wooden frame {{was used to determine}} the seat index point position. The 12 -m visibility test circle was divided into six sectors of vision, and the test tractor was placed {{at the center of the}} circle. Artificial light was supplied in the darkened environment, and shadow or masking effects were measured manually around the 12 -m circle. Results: When the bulbs were placed at the operator’s eye level, front visibility was good; no masking was found in the “A ” vision sector, but larger masking widths were found in the “B ” and “C ” vision sectors. Since the masking width exceeded 700 mm, additional tests, such as movement of the light sources to both sides of the operator’s eye level, were performed. Less than six masking effects were found in the <b>semi-circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> to the front, and more than one masking was found in the “B ” and “C ” visual fields. The minimum distance between the centers of two masking effects exceeded 2500 mm when measured as a chord on the <b>semi-circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> A blind area diagram was created to define the exact nature of the blind spots and mirror visibility. Conclusions: Visibility evaluation is an effective way to enable proper and safe operation for agricultural tractor operators. Inclusion of this visibility evaluation test in the general testing process might aid tracto...|$|E

60|$|At {{a motion}} from the commandant, {{the line of}} chieftains piled down to the level bench and formed a half-circle before the voyager.

Bedaubed and betrinketed, slouchy and slovenly, these low-statured chiefs belied in {{appearance}} their scorn-bright eyes and lofty mien. They made a sad group.|$|R

It states that in the circle (of houses) the left aspect {{is said to be}} very strong even as that from the 10th to the 4th, which means a planet in the visible semi-circle is more elevated, and therefore, stronger than a planet in the invisible <b>semi-circle.</b> <b>Of</b> course, the opposition and square aspects are not always evil.|$|R

6000|$|After halting {{for half}} an hour, ringed by a fence of blacks, we were summoned to the presence, where we found a small boy backed by a <b>semi-circle</b> <b>of</b> elders, and adorned with an old livery coat, made for a full-grown [...] "Jeames." [...] With immense dignity, and without deigning to look at us, he {{extended}} a small black paw like a Chimpanzee's, and received in return a promise of rum--the sole cause of our detention. And, as we departed through the euphorbia avenue, we were followed by the fastest trotters, the Flora Temples and the Ethan Allens, of the village.|$|R
60|$|The improvised divan was {{arranged}} in a wide <b>semi-circle,</b> <b>of</b> which the point most distant from the fire--some ten yards--was also the nearest to Lakamba's dwelling. As soon as the principal personages were seated, the verandah {{of the house was}} filled silently by the muffled-up forms of Lakamba's female belongings. They crowded close to the rail and looked down, whispering faintly. Below, the formal exchange of compliments went on for some time between Lakamba and Abdulla, who sat side by side. Babalatchi squatted humbly at his protector's feet, with nothing but a thin mat between himself and the hard ground.|$|R

Thus one {{part of it was}} called the Ironsmiths' Quarter; another the Soldiers' Quarter; another the Quarter of the Land-tillers; another that of the Skin-dressers, and so on. The king's dwelling and those of his women and dependents were near the North gate, and in front of these, surrounded by <b>semi-circles</b> <b>of</b> huts, was a wide space into which cattle could be driven if necessary. This, however, at the time of our visit, was used as a market and a drilling ground.|$|R
40|$|A {{thin film}} of FexCo(1 -x) has been {{produced}} with a linear compositional gradient ranging from x= 0. 67 to x= 0. 40 via an RF sputtering technique. The film was deposited onto a glass slide from a target consisting <b>of</b> two <b>semi-circles</b> <b>of</b> pure Fe and Co. We show {{that such a}} compositional gradient combined with local magnetic probes allows easy and quick characterisation of the magnetic properties {{as a function of}} composition. The composition dependence of the coercivity, anisotropy and magnetostriction of FexCo(1 -x) have been established using this method. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
