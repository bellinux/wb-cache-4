The structure of these fibres, however, is a pending research issue. Particularly, the process of fibrillation is still to be understood and a major issue for the optimisation of the production process. Now, first experiments with neutrons using USANS technique have revealed indications about the fibre structure in the micrometer range. We observed clear ultra-small-angle scattering patterns from even small numbers of fibres after spinning and even from inside the <b>spinning</b> <b>bath</b> during the spinning process. The outer diameter of the fibres is well reproduced in the scattering patterns which also indicate the presence of smaller internal structure.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006 A {{protocol}} {{already exists}} for fabrication of a capillary membrane having an internal ultrafiltration skin {{supported by a}} finger-like pore structure in the external capillary wall (Jacobs and Leukes, 1996; Jacobs and Sanderson, 1997). These membranes have been produced at the Institute of Polymer Science, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. Two major applications emerged from {{the development of these}} internally skinned membranes. One application was in the production of potable water by Ultra-filtration (UF) from sources containing coloured water. A second application was in the immobilization of a white rot fungus in a. "gradostat" membrane bioreactor. Here a nutrient gradient through the membrane wall and fungal mat can be established and manipulated in order to stimulate continuous production of secondary metabolites (extra-cellular enzymes). These enzymes are useful in the degradation of polycyclic aromatic compounds, notably PCB species in contaminated water and soils (Jacobs and Sanderson, 1997). Two objectives emerged from experiences with the above applications. The first objective was to improve membrane performance in UF applications. In this case a reduction was sought in trans-membrane pressure differential required to attain a desired flux without sacrificing rejection. The pressure required for a given desired flux across a membrane depends on the resistance of the membrane skin layer and of its supporting sub-layer which together comprises the capillary wall and defmes its overall structure. If any of these resistances could be reduced, the overall resistance to transport of water would be reduced. Then {{it would be possible to}} operate the membrane at lower trans-membrane pressure differences. On the other hand, operation with higher pressure would also increase flux but require a thicker capillary wall to resist this pressure. In the attempt to optimise these properties of the capillary membrane, capillary membranes produced in the study reported here were tested to find the relationship of flux performance with the structures that resulted from varying key parameters affecting structure and integrity. The objective in the case of immobilizing fungi in membrane bioreactor applications was to attain thicker walls thus providing better support for the fungal mass. The internally skinned capillary membrane has finger-like microvoids that start next to the UF skin layer and extend across the capillary membrane wall and open at the external membrane periphery, giving an ideal structure for retaining the fungal biomass. The idea of a membrane with this type of morphology to immobilize white rot fungi was to anchor the growing fungus within these microvoids which imitate the natural environment in which these organisms live, that is, in the fibrous structure of decaying wood. The requirement to inoculate the microvoids with fungal spores (reproductive cells), implies that they need to be accessible from the outside, requiring a membrane wall that is externally unskinned. In the formation ofthe capillary membrane the processes of formation of the porous UP skin and the finger-like microvoids are mainly governed by diffusion of solvent out of a polymer dope (gel phase) and of non-solvent into the dope phase. Such exchanges are of primary importance between the bore fluid (containing non-solvent) and dope (containing solvent) or between the external <b>spinning</b> <b>bath</b> (high in solvent content) and dope. Diffusion effects also occur between the nascent pore voids and the precipitating polymer matrix. There are also expected to be some convection effects due to shear between the bore fluid and the moving dope gel phase and due to shrinkage ofthe gel phase. The variables selected for experimentation m the study reported here were: the dope extrusion rate (DER); dope composition (viscosity effects); bore fluid flow rate (BFF); bore fluid composition and wall thickness and diameter effects (determined largely by spinneret dimensions). Each of these has an expected effect on membrane structure and its resulting performance. Most were varied over narrow ranges indicated in the literature and by experience to be effective and critical. In addition, the effects of altering the walI thickness were investigated by using two different spinneret sizes. The external <b>spinning</b> <b>bath</b> composition (solvent content) was reported in the literature to be a particularly important parameter in the formation of externally unskinned membranes. Maintaining a high content of solvent in the external <b>spinning</b> <b>bath</b> could prevent skin formation. Too high a solvent content could, however, prevent phase transition and lead to later precipitation ofa dense skin on contact with the non-solvent in the later (humidification and rinsing) steps in the fmishing of the capillary membrane product. The external bath composition was therefore varied so as to find the bath composition that would match the cloud point for the polymer dope employed. As expected, the thickness of the membranes increased with DER increase. However, it was found that there is a critical wall thickness where an external skin layer is formed as a result of increasing the DER. A certain volumetric ratio ofDER to BFF (1, 5 : 1 for this study) was therefore maintained in order to produce externally unskinned membranes. This shows that although the final membrane structure is detennined by the casting dope formulation, the fabrication protocol plays an equally important role in controlling structural properties and perfonnance. There was no significant change with the membrane thickness as a result of changing BFF but the voids became longer and more in number as the BFF was increased. Too high solvent content (99 % NMP in this study) resulted in an external skin layer being formed. According to Smolders et. al. (1992), when the solvent content in the external <b>spinning</b> <b>bath</b> is too high, the polymer at the surface of the newly fonned membrane slowly dissolves in the external <b>spinning</b> <b>bath</b> re-forming a dope-like solution. When the newly formed membrane passes through the humidifier, the dope-like solution solidifies to form an external skin. At the same instance, too low solvent (93 % for this study) resulted in external skin being fonned. Externally unskinned membranes were formed at 94 and 96 % NMP bath composition. The use of a small spinneret resulted in very thin walled externally unskinned membranes...|$|E

The saline solution was then concentrated, recycled and reused {{as many times as}} possible before cellulose dissolution was no longer possible. The chemical compositions of the ionic liquid and pulp were recorded throughout the experiments. The results of the experiments showed that [DBNH][OAc] can be recycled from aqueous media with an average recovery rate of 95. 6 wt% using basic laboratory equipment, without any further process intensification or optimisation. The recycling of the ionic liquid did not change the chemical composition or degree of polymerisation of the recovered pulp but the colour of the regenerated pulps gradually darkened as the recycling times increased. The ionic liquid was found to hydrolyse 6. 0 - 13. 6 mol% per cycle, under these conditions. The build-up of the hydrolysis product, 3 -(aminopropyl) - 2 -pyrrolidonium acetate, killed the dissolution feature at between 30. 6 - 45. 6 wt% hydrolysis product.

In this study various examples are presented, whereby chemical technology is of fundamental importance. It is well documented that under normal conditions the molten salt mixture from the kraft recovery boiler flows down into the dissolving tank without problems. However, in the case of  alternatives to the kraft recovery boiler, knowledge of more precise data of the molten salts is required for the design calculations. In this study the viscosity for the case of sodium carbonate and 30 mole% sulphide has been measured and is of the magnitude 2 – 3 cP at temperatures relevant for a recovery boiler, i. e. similar to water at room temperature. The presence of non-process elements (NPE) in a typical pulp mill has been investigated. The main input is with regards to the wood, and anticipated problems include; deposits in evaporators, high dead-load in liquor streams, plugging of the upper part of the recovery boiler and decreasing efficiency in the causticization department. Efficient green liquor clarification is of the greatest importance as an efficient kidney for many NPE. Mill data and calculations show that the magnesium added in the oxygen delignification does not form a closed loop. Integration of a prehydrolysis kraft pulp mill producing dissolving pulp with a plant producing viscose textile fiber could be highly beneficial. The prehydrolysis liquor will contain both sugars and acetic acid. It is however not possible to fully replace the sulphuric acid of the viscose <b>spinning</b> <b>bath</b> with acetic acid of own production. The sulphuric chemicals from the viscose plant can be partly taken care of in the kraft recovery area as well as the viscose plant which can be supplied with alkali and sulphuric acid. Zinc-containing effluents from the viscose plant can be treated with green liquor to precipitate zinc sulphide. Modern chemical technology is an extremely efficient tool for solving problems particularly in a complicated environment such as the pulp and paper industry. Here, examples are studied during which chemical technology is of fundamental importance. At normal conditions the molten salt mixture from the kraft recovery boiler flows down into the dissolving tank without hindrance.

40|$|The {{dissipative}} quantum {{dynamics of}} an anharmonic oscillator coupled to a bath is studied {{with the purpose}} of elucidating the differences between the relaxation to a <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> and to a harmonic bath. Converged results are obtained for the <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> by the Surrogate Hamiltonian approach. This method is based on constructing a system-bath Hamiltonian, with a finite but large number of <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> modes, that mimics exactly a bath with an infinite number of modes for a finite time interval. Convergence with respect to the number of simultaneous excitations of bath modes can be checked. The results are compared to calculations that include a finite number of harmonic modes carried out by using the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method of Nest and Meyer, [J. Chem. Phys. 119, 24 (2003) ]. In the weak coupling regime, at zero temperature and for small excitations of the primary system, both methods converge to the Markovian limit. When initially the primary system is significantly excited, the <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> can saturate restricting the energy acceptance. An interaction term between bath modes that spreads the excitation eliminates the saturation. The loss of phase between two cat states has been analyzed and the results for the <b>spin</b> and harmonic <b>baths</b> are almost identical.

40|$|The quantum {{dynamics}} of mesoscopic or macroscopic systems is always complicated by their coupling to many `environmental 2 ̆ 7 modes.

Here, taking a phosphorus donor electron spin in a natural-abundance 29 Si nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> as our model system, we discover both theoretically and experimentally that many-body correlations in nanoscale nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>baths</b> produce identifiable signatures in the decoherence of the central spin under multiple-pulse dynamical decoupling control. We find that when the number of decoupling -pulses is odd, central spin decoherence is primarily driven by second-order nuclear spin correlations (pairwise flip-flop processes). In contrast, when the number of -pulses is even, fourth-order nuclear spin correlations (diagonal interaction renormalized pairwise flip-flop processes) are principally responsible for the central spin decoherence. Many-body correlations of different orders can thus be selectively detected by central spin decoherence under different dynamical decoupling controls, providing a useful approach to probing many-body processes in nanoscale nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>baths...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} protection of electron spin coherence of nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond by dynamical nuclear polarization. The electron spin decoherence of an NV center {{is caused by the}} magnetic ield fluctuation of the $^{ 13 }$C nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath,</b> which contributes large thermal fluctuation to the center electron spin when it is in equilibrium state at room temperature. To address this issue, we continuously transfer the angular momentum from electron spin to nuclear spins, and pump the nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> to a polarized state under Hartman-Hahn condition. The bath polarization effect is verified by the observation of prolongation of the electron spin coherence time ($T_ 2 ^*$). Optimal conditions for the dynamical nuclear polarization (DNP) process, including the pumping pulse duration and depolarization effect of laser pulses, are studied. Our experimental results provide strong support for quantum information processing and quantum simulation using polarized nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> in solid state systems.

Through dynamic nuclear spin polarization driven by an oscillating electric field, we show that feedback controls can be implemented on the nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> of a single hole spin. The feedback controls utilize the anisotropic hyperfine interaction between the hole spin and the nuclear spins. The negative feedback can suppress the statistical fluctuations of the nuclear hyperfine field and lead to longer coherence time of the hole spin. Positive feedback can possibly lead to cat like state of nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath.</b> The efficiency of the controls schemes is investigated under different parameters and control strategies.

The decoherence is formulated as the entanglement between the electron spin {{and the nuclear}} spins, which is induced by nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> evolution conditioned on the electron spin state. The nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> evolution is driven by elementary processes such as single spin precession and pairwise flip-flops.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} a central spin coupled to a <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> without internal dynamics. We compare the cases where the bath couples to one or two components of the spin. It is found that the central spin dynamics is enhanced in the latter case, which may be interpreted as a frustration of dissipation. However, the quantum purity of the spin decays fast in both scenarios. We conclude that symmetric coupling of the bath to two orthogonal components of the spin inhibits dissipation but not decoherence.

40|$|A single-molecule magnet {{placed in}} a {{magnetic}} field perpendicular to its anisotropy axis can be truncated to an effective two-level system, with easily tunable energy splitting. The quantum coherence of the molecular spin is largely determined by {{the dynamics of the}} surrounding nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath.</b> Here we report the measurement of the nuclear spin [...] lattice relaxation in a single crystal of the single-molecule magnet Mn_ 12 -ac, at T ≈ 30 mK in perpendicular fields B_ up to 9 T. Although the molecular spin is in its ground state, we observe an increase of the nuclear relaxation rates by several orders of magnitude up to the highest B_. This unique finding is a consequence of the zero-point quantum fluctuations of the Mn_ 12 -ac spin, which allow it to efficiently transfer energy from the excited nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> to the lattice.

40|$|To perform quantum {{information}} processing using electron spin states {{can be done}} with localized spin states. In donor doped semiconductors electrons are localized in donor bound electron and bound exciton systems. With the help of polarized optical transitions there can be coherent electron spin states created. The big disadvantage of using donor doped semiconductors is that the decoherence time of the electron spin is very short. So information stored in the electron spin is easily lost. Because of thermal fluctuations of the nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>bath</b> the nuclear forms an important dephasing source. Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) can be used to reduce these fluctuations of nuclear spins in the <b>spin</b> <b>bath.</b> DNP is the mechanism were electron spin polarization is induced, which leads to nuclear polarization. Therefore understanding the mechanisms that lead to loss of quantum information and controlling these processes is crucial. A Hydrogen model is used to calculate the energy levels of a donor system coupled with multiple nuclei.
