5|$|On 1 January 1945 {{he became}} Professor of Physics at the University of Melbourne vice Laby, a {{position}} he held until 1959. He built up a nuclear physics research school {{at a time when}} Australian universities were only just beginning to award PhDs, and most research students went abroad to pursue their studies. He attempted to equip it as best as his limited funds would allow. Wherever possible, equipment and parts were built by staff and students. His cosmic ray group participated in the 1947–48 Antarctic expedition of , and he designed and built a 200 kV neutron generator and a 1 MeV Van de Graaff generator. A 3 MeV betatron was converted an 18 MeV electron synchrotron in 1948. A 5 to 12 MeV cyclotron was the largest machine built at the University up to that time. Design work began in 1953, and it commenced operation in 1957, running until 1976. Martin did not have the money to build it, but managed to <b>scrounge</b> funding and components from various sources. Although he was an experimental physicist, he created a theoretical physics group under Courtney Mohr. He also managed to persuade the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to transfer CSIRAC, Australia's first digital electronic computer, to the School of Physics in 1955, creating the first academic computing facility in Australia, and the beginning of computer science at the University of Melbourne.|$|E

40|$|When problem based {{learning}} {{occurs in}} a social context it is open to a common social behaviour, <b>scrounging.</b> In the animal behaviour literature, scroungers do not attempt to find resources themselves but rather exploit resources found by other group members (referred to as producers). We know from studies of animal behaviour (including humans) that <b>scrounging</b> can be expected whenever animals exploit resources in groups. We also know that <b>scrounging</b> can have deleterious effects on the group. We can expect <b>scrounging</b> to occur during social learning because the exchange of information (which I will consider here as a resource) is essential to social learning. This exchange {{can be seen as}} each individual <b>scrounging</b> from {{the other members of the}} group whenever the individual learns from the work of others. However, there is a danger if some individuals learn mostly through their own efforts while others indulge in “social loafing ” relying heavily on colleagues to provide knowledge. Here I propose that game theory models developed to analyse feeding in animal societies may also apply to socia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Living {{in groups}} should promote the {{cultural}} transmission {{of a novel}} behaviour because opportunities for observing knowledgeable individuals {{are likely to be}} more numerous in this condition. However, in this study pigeons who shared the food discoveries of others (scroungers) did not learn the food-finding technique used by the discoverers (producers). Individually-caged pigeons prevented from <b>scrounging</b> easily learned the technique from a conspecific tutor. When caged pigeons obtained food from the tutor's performance, most nai've observers failed to learn. In a flock, scroungers selectively followed producers. In individual cages, <b>scrounging</b> during the tutor's demonstration was equivalent to getting no demonstration at all. This effect of <b>scrounging</b> did not interfere with subsequent acquisition of the foodfinding behaviour when <b>scrounging</b> was no longer possible. Many animals are known to adopt a novel behaviour as a result of observing others performing it (see Galef 1976; Bonner 1980; Mainardi 1981 for reviews). This type of learning has been variously labelled cultural transmission, social learning, imitation, observational learning, etc. One consequenc...|$|R

25|$|The story then {{follows the}} doctor's wife, her husband, and their impromptu “family” {{as they attempt}} to survive outside, cared for largely by the doctor’s wife, who can still see (though she must hide this fact at first). The {{breakdown}} of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot find each other. People squat in abandoned buildings and <b>scrounge</b> for food. Violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new “family” eventually make a permanent home in the doctor's house and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse just as suddenly and inexplicably as it struck.|$|E
25|$|Though Rushmore thought {{himself a}} hero for exposing Confidential, {{he became a}} pariah in the {{publishing}} world. He {{was no longer an}} editor at the Police Gazette, though he would stop by to <b>scrounge</b> up work. By 1957, he was reduced to writing occasional articles on hunting for outdoors magazines. His last known assignments were for True War magazine. In December 1957, Rushmore chased his wife and teenaged step-daughter Lynn out of their Manhattan home with a shotgun. Two days before Christmas, Frances and her daughter left their home on the advice of her psychiatrist and stayed with Frances' eldest daughter, 20-year-old Jean Dobbins of Greenwich Village. Mother and daughter later took over a friend's apartment. While Frances was under psychiatric care since the East River incident, Howard himself was now under psychiatric care.|$|E

25|$|The {{emergence}} of cooking in early Homo may have created problems of food theft from women while food was being cooked. As a result, females would recruit male partners {{to protect them}} and their resources from others. This concept, known as the theft hypothesis, accommodates an explanation {{as to why the}} labor of cooking is strongly associated with the status of women. Women are forced to gather and cook foods because they will not acquire food otherwise and access to resources is critical for their reproductive success. On the contrary, men do not gather because their physical dominance allows them to <b>scrounge</b> cooked foods from women. Thus, women's foraging and food preparation efforts allow men to participate in the high-risk, high-reward activities of hunting. Females, in turn, become increasingly sexually attractive as a means to exploit male interest in investing in her protection.|$|E

Spalko arrives and presents the skull to its skeleton, whereupon the aliens reanimate and telepathically offer a reward in ancient Mayan through Oxley. A portal to their dimension becomes activated, and the other remaining Soviets are drawn into the portal. As Jones, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley–who has regained his sanity–escape, the thirteen beings fuse into one, and in the process of receiving the overwhelming knowledge, Spalko is disintegrated and sucked into the portal. Mac is caught in the vortex while trying to <b>scrounge</b> some of the treasure, and even though Jones offers him his whip to pull him to safety, he willingly lets go and is sucked in. Jones and the others escape and watch as the city crumbles, revealing a flying saucer rising from under the ground and vanishing, while the hollow in the valley floor left by its departure is flooded by the waters of the Amazon.|$|E

40|$|Social {{foraging}} {{strategies and}} {{their association with}} learning and innovation abilities have been studied extensively in flocking birds, but their importance for cooperatively breeding birds has remained relatively unexplored. The high degree of sociality typical of cooperative societies may indicate an important role of social foraging for learning and innovation. We studied 1) social foraging strategies and 2) the acquisition of a novel foraging skill in 16 groups of wild, cooperatively breeding Arabian babblers (Turdoides squamiceps). In Experiment 1, we provided a foraging grid of 96 feeding wells to each group, allowing them either to search for food individually (producer) or to join other birds (scrounger). Subordinates <b>scrounged</b> significantly more than dominant individuals, spent longer on the foraging grid, and had {{a higher proportion of}} their foraging steps rewarded (due to the effect of successful <b>scrounging).</b> However, <b>scrounging</b> was not related to poor learning ability because almost all the individuals that learned the novel foraging skill in Experiment 2 (removing a rubber lid to reach food) were scroungers. These findings suggest that group members differ in their foraging strategies and learning abilities according to their rank and that subordinate group members may be more opportunistic and flexible in their behavior than dominants, making use of both <b>scrounging</b> and novel foraging opportunities. 8 page(s...|$|R

500|$|During the war, a unit {{known as}} the Croatian Naval Legion (...) fought {{as part of the}} German Navy in the Black Sea {{campaign}} under the command of Kapetan korvete (Commander) Andro Vrkljan and later Kapetan fregate (Captain) Stjepan Rumenović. The purpose of posting a naval contingent on the Black Sea was to evade the prohibitions imposed on the RMNDH by the Treaty of Rome. The unit did not have any ships upon its arrival in the Sea of Azov. It managed to <b>scrounge</b> up 47 damaged or abandoned fishing vessels, mostly sailing ships, and hired local Russian and Ukrainian sailors to help man them. They patrolled a coastal sector of the Sea of Azov, and the Legion eventually reached a strength of 1,000 officers and men as the 23rd Minesweeping Flotilla. On 24 September 1942, the Poglavnik (leader) of the NDH, Ante Pavelić, visited Legion headquarters, where he reached an agreement with the Germans to train and equip a flotilla that would undertake anti-submarine patrols. In 1943, a coastal artillery battery was added to the Legion. Following the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, and Axis reverses on the Eastern Front, the Croatian Naval Legion returned to the NDH in May 1944 as a Trieste-based torpedo boat flotilla, part of the German 11th Escort Flotilla. The Germans disbanded the Legion {{at the same time as}} the RMNDH to prevent the crews from defecting with their vessels to the Partisans.|$|E

The remaining individuals exhibited fluctuating preferences and switched between showing a preference or no preference, but never switched between preferences. This instability might have been due to the low level of difficulty and/or the low object specificity of the task.
