40|$|Phlebotomine <b>sandflies</b> are blood sucking Dipteran and {{important}} vectors of various patogens, especially leishmania parasites (Trypanosomatida, Leishmaniinae). Apart from the genus Leishmania they also transmit {{variety of other}} parasites and they {{are considered to be}} vectors of trypanosomes (genus Trypanosoma) and hosts of some monoxenous trypanosomatids. This Master thesis is focused on the occurrence and development of mono- and dixenous trypanosomatids (other than the genus Leishmania) in <b>sandflies.</b> We studied experimental infections of various species of <b>sandflies</b> and mosquitoes by two species of trypanosomes and one species of monoxenous parasite (Strigomonas galati). All three studied trypanosomatid species were isolated from <b>sandflies.</b> Further concern of the thesis is the transmission of both species of trypanosomes from <b>sandflies</b> to vertebrate hosts and the transmission of monoxenous parasite between insect hosts and also morphological changes of parasite cells during the development in a culture and in the insect and vertebrate hosts...|$|R
50|$|Leishmaniasis is {{transmitted}} by {{the bite of}} infected female phlebotomine <b>sandflies</b> which can transmit the protozoa Leishmania. The <b>sandflies</b> inject the infective stage, metacyclic promastigotes, during blood meals (1). Metacyclic promastigotes that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages (2) and transform into amastigotes (3). Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues, depending in part on which Leishmania species is involved (4). These differing tissue specificities cause the differing clinical manifestations of {{the various forms of}} leishmaniasis. <b>Sandflies</b> become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes (5,6). In the <b>sandfly's</b> midgut, the parasites differentiate into promastigotes (7), which multiply, differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes, and migrate to the proboscis (8).|$|R

25|$|In humans the metacyclic promastigotes are {{injected}} by <b>sandfly</b> {{through the}} skin during its blood meal. When <b>sandfly</b> bites using its proboscis it ejects the parasites that are stored inside the hollow tube. Some promastigotes may enter the blood stream directly where some are destroyed by macrophagic cytolysis. But many are also taken up through phagocytosis by mononuclear phagocytes in liver, spleen and bone marrow. Inside the cells they undergo spontaneous transformation into oval-shaped amastigotes. Granulocytes selectively kill the promastigotes by oxidative mechanism, while amastigotes are resistant. Then the surviving amastigotes undergo cell division using simple binary fission. Multiplication continues until the host cell can no longer hold and ruptures. In a fully congested cell there can {{be as many as}} 50 to 200 amastigotes, which are released into tissue cavities. Each individual amastigote is then capable of invading fresh cells. As a result, the entire tissue is progressively infected and destroyed. A number of free amastigotes then enters the blood stream where many are phagocytosed by macrophages. These free and phagocytosed amastigotes in peripheral blood are then sucked up by blood-feeding <b>sandfly.</b>|$|E

25|$|Cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} (also {{known as}} oriental sore, tropical sore, chiclero ulcer, chiclero's ulcer or Aleppo boil) {{is the most}} common form of leishmaniasis affecting humans. It is a skin infection caused by a single-celled parasite that is transmitted by the bite of a phlebotomine <b>sandfly.</b> There are about twenty species of Leishmania that may cause cutaneous leishmaniasis.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Leishmania is {{completed}} in two hosts, humans and sandflies. The adult female <b>sandfly</b> is a bloodsucker, usually feeding at night on sleeping prey. When the fly bites an individual infected with Leishmania, the pathogen is ingested along with the prey's blood. The protozoan is in the smaller of its two forms, called an amastigote, which is round, non-motile, and only 3–7 micrometers in diameter. Inside the stomach of the <b>sandfly,</b> the amastigotes quickly transform into elongated and motile forms called the promastigotes. Promastigote is spindle-shaped, triple {{the size of the}} amastigote, and has a single flagellum that allows mobility. The promastigotes live extracellularly in the alimentary canal, reproducing asexually, then migrate to the proximal end of the gut where they become poised for a regurgitational transmission. As the fly bites, the promastigotes are released from the proboscis and introduced locally at the bite site.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to verify the {{occurrence}} of Leishmania in naturally infected <b>sandflies.</b> The insects were collected with Falcão, Shannon and HP light-traps, in Doutor Camargo and Maringá municipalities between November 2004 and October 2005. Of the 11, 033 <b>sandflies</b> collected in Doutor Camargo, 2, 133 surviving females were dissected, particularly those of the Nyssomyia neivai species (86. 87 %). In Maringá, 136 <b>sandflies</b> were collected, of which 79 N. whitmani females and 1 Migonemyia migonei female were dissected.

40|$|Compounds {{from the}} odour-producing glands of the fox Vulpes vulpes were collected. This complex mixture of {{compounds}} {{was used to}} stimulate the 'ascoid' olfactory organs of female <b>sandflies</b> in single sensillum and gas chromatography-linked single sensillum recordings. Sixteen of these compounds were identified using gas chromatography-linked mass spectrometry and amounts present were determined. The compounds fell into four organic classes: ketones, carboxylic acids, alcohols and aldehydes. Specific neurones present in the ascoid sensillum that responded {{to each of these}} classes of compound were characterized. A bioassay chamber was developed that gave female <b>sandflies</b> the choice of two odour sources. Female <b>sandflies</b> were attracted upwind by fox odour and were trapped in closer proximity to the fox odour port than the control port. Synthetic compounds were recombined in appropriate quantities to mimic the fox odour. In this bioassay, the synthetic blend attracted <b>sandflies</b> upwind, and again they were caught closer to the test port than the control port. Furthermore, the synthetic fox odour induced an electrophysiological response from neurones in the ascoid sensillum that was very similar to that induced by natural fox odour. No synthetic compound alone induced the same behavioural response from <b>sandflies</b> as did whole fox odour.

25|$|The insect vectors are {{species of}} <b>sandfly</b> {{of the genus}} Phlebotomus in the Old World, and of Lutzomyia in the New World. Sandflies are tiny flies, {{measuring}} 3–6mm long by 1.5–3mm in diameter, and are found in tropical or temperate regions throughout the world. The larvae grow in warm, moist organic matter (such as old trees, house walls, or waste) making them hard to eradicate.|$|E

DNA sequencing of different geographical strains indicates that the protozoan complex can be classified into two valid taxons, L. donovani and L. infantum. The genus Leishmania most likely originated in South America, from where it migrated to Asia. L. donovani and L. infantum diverged ~1 Mya, with further divergence of infraspecific genetic groups between 0.4 and 0.8 Mya.|$|E

25|$|Promastigotes of Leishmania are {{transmitted}} to human skin by {{the bite of}} a <b>sandfly.</b> Leishmania then invades human macrophages and replicates intracellularly. A raised, red lesion develops {{at the site of}} the bite (often weeks or sometimes years afterwards). The lesion then ulcerates and may become secondarily infected with bacteria. In many species (for example, L. major) the lesion often spontaneously heals with atrophic scarring. In some species (for example, L. braziliensis) the lesion may spontaneously heal with scarring, but then reappear elsewhere (especially as destructive mucocutaneous lesions). Lesions of other Leishmania species may spontaneously heal and then reappear as satellite lesions around the site of the original lesion, or along the route of lymphatic drainage.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inside the}} human host, promastigotes invade macrophages. Inside the cells they {{transform}} {{back into the}} smaller amastigote form. The amastigotes replicate in the most hostile part of the macrophage cell, inside the phagolysosome, whose normal defensive response {{they are able to}} prevent. After repeated multiplication, they break down their host cell by sheer pressure of mass, but there is some recent speculation that they are able to leave the cell by triggering the exocytosis response of the macrophage. The daughter cells protozoans then migrate to fresh cells or through the bloodstream to find new hosts. In this way the infection is progressive, spreading to the host's mononuclear phagocyte system, particularly the spleen and liver. The free amastigotes in peripheral tissues are then ingested by <b>sandfly</b> to enter another cycle.|$|E
25|$|Leishmania donovani is {{a species}} of {{intracellular}} parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania, a group of haemoflagellate kinetoplastids that cause the disease leishmaniasis.

It infects the mononuclear phagocyte system including spleen, liver and bone marrow. Infection is transmitted by species of <b>sandfly</b> belonging to the genus Phlebotomus in Old World and Lutzomyia in New World. Therefore, the parasite is prevalent throughout tropical and temperate regions including Africa (mostly in Sudan), China, India, Nepal, southern Europe, Russia and South America.
