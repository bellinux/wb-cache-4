2500|$|Mackworth's widow, Mary, {{was in some}} {{difficulty}} because of his intestacy. On 14 March 1655 her mews home was assigned to Major-General Philip Skippon, pending her vacating the premises. Edmund King, who acted {{as an assistant to}} Mackworth in his work for the State, also seems to have suffered financially and was given £30 by the Council in June 1655, with the recommendation that Cromwell find him a suitable post, possibly in the customs service. Johnstone <b>says</b> <b>Mrs</b> Mackworth was allowed £300 for funeral expenses, and Coulton follows, stating that [...] "his burial was paid for by the state at a cost of £300." [...] The State Papers seem to show that only in March 1657 did the Protector's Council did give his widow £300 towards the funeral costs. Moreover, this was not a grant but part of Mackworth's pay arrears, which appear to have been considerable, as a further £300 was paid to his son and executor at the same time, using Walter Strickland as intermediary. In May 1658 Mackworth's daughter Anne petitioned the Council: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{may think}} we are partisans de l'autre," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Pendennis, with a smile first, and a sigh afterwards, as she said [...] "poor Clive!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lawsy!" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Sampson. [...] "It {{sounds like}} an {{irrigation}} ditch you was describing, Mr. Pratt. How do you get all this knowledge of information?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then Mrs. Veal {{mentioned}} Dr. Kenrick's Ascetick, {{at the end}} {{of which}} he gives an account of the lives of the primitive Christians. Their pattern she recommended to our imitation, and said, their conversation was not like this of our age: For now, says she, there is nothing but frothy, vain discourse, which is far different from theirs. Theirs was to edification, and to build one another up in faith; so that they were not as we are, nor are we as they were: but, says she, we ought to do as they did. There was an hearty friendship among them; but where is it now to be found? <b>Says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bargrave, It is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days. <b>Says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Veal, Mr. Norris has a fine copy of verses, called Friendship in Perfection, which I wonderfully admire. Have you seen the book? <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Veal. No, <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bargrave, but I have the verses of my own writing out. Have you? <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Veal, then fetch them. Which she did from above stairs, and offered them to Mrs. Veal to read, who refused, and waived the thing, saying, holding down her head would make it ache; and then desired Mrs. Bargrave to read them to her, which she did. As they were admiring friendship, Mrs. Veal said, Dear Mrs. Bargrave, I shall love you for ever. In these verses there is twice used the word Elysian, Ah! <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Veal, these poets have such names for heaven. She would often draw her hand across her own eyes, and say, Mrs. Bargrave, do not you think I am mightily impaired by my fits? No, <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bargrave, I think you look as well as ever I knew you. After all this discourse, which the apparition put in much finer words than Mrs. Bargrave said she could pretend to, and as much more than she can remember, (for it cannot be thought, that an hour and three quarters' conversation could all be retained, though the main of it she thinks she does,) she said to Mrs. Bargrave, she would have her write a letter to her brother, and tell him, she would have him give rings to such and such; and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet, and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin Watson.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> L. to the Duke, [...] "Your Grace, it is A PRINCE." [...] And at that nuss's bold rebuke, [...] He did both {{laugh and}} wince.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, {{then you}} may go {{as soon as you}} like,' <b>says</b> <b>Mrs</b> Pipchin. 'The sooner the better; and I hope I shall never see your face again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on, Mr. Pratt," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Sampson. [...] "Them {{ideas is}} so {{original}} and soothing. I think statistics {{are just as}} lovely as they can be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Did ye?" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Privett. [...] "Old Midsummer {{yesterday}} was it? Faith I didn't think whe'r 'twas Midsummer or Michaelmas; I'd {{too much work}} to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Only {{he would}} never succeed," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Harold Smith. [...] "But perhaps, Mr. Robarts, you are {{as bad as the}} rest; perhaps you, too, will be hunting to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Could it be, I asked myself,' <b>says</b> <b>Mrs</b> Veneering, looking {{about her}} for her pocket-handkerchief, 'that the Fairies were telling Baby that her papa would shortly be an M. P.?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Pratt," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Sampson, [...] "it's such {{a comfort}} {{to hear you}} say them {{beautiful}} facts after getting such a jar from that minx of a Ruby's poetry!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nancy {{always makes}} out things {{a good deal}} worse than they are," [...] said Mrs. Archibald, [...] "but there's truth in what she <b>says.</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Cliff is failing; {{everybody}} can see that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An egg," [...] says Jimmy Skunk, [...] "is good; [...] It's {{very good}} indeed to eat." [...] "An egg," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Grouse, [...] "is dear; [...] 'Twill hatch into a baby sweet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "His present address, sir, is THE GRAVE," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Threadgall, {{suddenly}} {{losing her}} temper, and speaking {{with an emphasis}} and fury that made the glasses ring again. [...] "The Professor has been dead these ten years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{call her}} Esther Summerson," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Chadband with austerity. [...] "There was no Miss-ing {{of the girl}} in my time. It was Esther. 'Esther, do this! Esther, do that!' and she was made to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{were not}} forsaken utterly, Arthur," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Laura, gravely: but rather declines {{to argue the}} point raised by me; namely, that the {{selection}} of that especial thirty-seventh psalm was not complimentary to those decayed old gentlemen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Morpher, with a {{significant}} sigh, [...] "I hope it's so; but bless us, where's Clytie? You mustn't go without saying 'good-by' to her" [...] and Mrs. Morpher starts away in search of her daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A most {{excellent}} worthy creature,' <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> P. saved Maria's life--really {{a learned}} man; {{but what can}} one do in one's position? One may ask one's medical man to one's table certainly: but his family, my dear Mr. Snob!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We can't in our {{position}} of life--we can't well {{associate with the}} attorney's family, as I leave you to suppose,' <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Ponto, confidentially. 'Of course not,' I answered, though I didn't know why. 'And the Doctor?' said I.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have endeavoured by assiduity {{to make up}} {{for time}} lost, and an early {{imperfect}} education," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Newcome. [...] "You married a poor country lawyer's daughter. You did not seek a partner in the Peerage, Mr. Newcome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} glad," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Snagsby after contemplating his {{increased}} confusion {{with a severe}} and sinister smile, [...] "if you would come home with me; I think you may be safer there, Mr. Snagsby, than anywhere else." ...|$|E
60|$|Madam, <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bargrave, I am {{surprised}} to see you, you have been so long a stranger; but told her, {{she was glad to}} see her, and offered to salute her; which Mrs. Veal complied with, till their lips almost touched; and then Mrs. Veal drew her hand across her own eyes, and said, I am not very well; and so waived it. She told Mrs. Bargrave, she was going a journey, and had a great mind to see her first. But, <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bargrave, how came you to take a journey alone? I am amazed at it, because I know you have a fond brother. Oh! <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Veal, I gave my brother the slip, and came away because I had so great a desire to see you before I took my journey. So Mrs. Bargrave went in with her, into another room within the first, and Mrs. Veal sat her down in an elbow-chair, in which Mrs. Bargrave was sitting when she heard Mrs. Veal knock. Then <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Veal, My dear friend, I am come to renew our old friendship again, and beg your pardon for my breach of it; and if you can forgive me, you are the best of women. O, <b>says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bargrave, do not mention such a thing; I have not had an uneasy thought about it; I can easily forgive it. What did you think of me? said Mrs. Veal. <b>Says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bargrave, I thought you were {{like the rest of the}} world, and that prosperity had made you forget yourself and me. Then Mrs. Veal reminded Mrs. Bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days, and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity; what books they read, and what comfort, in particular, they received from Drelincourt's Book of Death, which was the best, she said, on that subject ever written. She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock, the two Dutch books which were translated, written upon death, and several others. But Drelincourt, she said, had the clearest notions of death, and of the future state, of any who had handled that subject. Then she asked Mrs. Bargrave, whether she had Drelincourt. She said, Yes. <b>Says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Veal, Fetch it. And so Mrs. Bargrave goes up stairs and brings it down. <b>Says</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Veal, Dear Mrs. Bargrave, if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body, we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard. The notions we have of heaven now, are nothing like what it is, as Drelincourt says; therefore be comforted under your afflictions, and believe that the Almighty has a particular regard to you; and that your afflictions are marks of God's favour; and when they have done the business they are sent for, they shall be removed from you. And, believe me, my dear friend, believe what I say to you, one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings. For, I can never believe, (and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness, which indeed ran through most of her discourse,) that ever God will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state; but be assured, that your afflictions shall leave you, or you them, in a short time. She spake in that pathetical and heavenly manner, that Mrs. Bargrave wept several times, she was so deeply affected with it.|$|E
