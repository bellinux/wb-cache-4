It {{is also about}} being strong, which Madonna recalled {{in an interview that}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> her relationship with her parents, while writing the lyrics. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair, conservative wardrobe and subtle make-up. This toned down blond appearance was again inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E

After searchers had spent five months in an unsuccessful quest to find Natalee, her attorney John Q. Kelly took over the case and she spent the next two years traveling to various high schools and colleges to present messages about personal safety. When <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> reaching more travelers with her story, Twitty said that her efforts evolved into writing a book.|$|E

25|$|Mortimer and Isabella {{landed in}} England {{two months later}} in September 1326, and they joined forces with Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster. On 16 November, King Edward was taken {{prisoner}} and eventually murdered at Berkeley Castle, presumably by Mortimer's hired assassins. From 1327 to 1330, Mortimer and Isabella jointly held the Office of Regent for her son, King Edward III who was duly crowned following his father's death. Mortimer was made constable of Wallingford Castle; in September 1328, Mortimer was created Earl of March. This made Joan henceforth, the Countess of March; {{although it is not}} known what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> her husband's illegal assumption of power and flagrant affair with the Queen. What has been established is that Joan was never an active participant in her husband's insurrection against King Edward.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Real Sound, Suzuki related her experiences working on her single [...] "Redo". She describes the title song as difficult but fun and exciting to sing live. Having watched Re:Zero, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the series' world view and the character Subaru, and sang the song to fit that worldview. She wanted to put [...] "50% of the anime's worldview" [...] and [...] "50% her own feelings" [...] into the song. She describes the single's coupling song [...] "Moebius" [...] as stemming from a policy where she was not to lie to anyone, and how she reflected on that four years after her debut. She mentioned how the song represents {{that she wants to}} establish a relationship of trust with her fans. In {{an interview}} with Eplus, she mentions that the name of her 20th birthday live, [...] "Cheers", is meant to convey a message of [...] "thank you" [...] to the people who had supported her career up to that point.|$|E
500|$|Lopez {{stars in}} Enough as Slim, a {{waitress}} whose life is severely altered after she marries Mitch, a wealthy contractor portrayed by Billy Campbell. Slim flees her increasingly abusive husband with their newborn daughter following her birth. She soon discovers {{that she is}} being followed by Mitch. While on the run, Slim [...] "trains herself for a final, violent confrontation" [...] with her husband. For the final act, which required Lopez to [...] "become a believable lean, mean fighting machine", <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> learning t'ai chi or taekwondo, but was worried about learning it at an expert level {{in a short period}} of time. Her personal trainer then suggested that she study Krav Maga, the [...] "official self-defense system of the Israeli Defense Forces which has recently become trendy in the States", according to MTV News. Enough was initially scheduled to be released in September, but was later pushed back to [...] "early 2002" [...] and eventually saw a release on May 24, 2002.|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The Secret River is Rawlings' only book {{intended}} for children. According to Murray Laurie, {{the idea for}} the book came from something Rawlings had written in Cross Creek: “some day a poet will write a sad and lovely story of a Negro child.” She discussed the idea with her Scribner's editor, Maxwell Perkins, who encouraged her to follow it up. While working on the manuscript she told Perkins she [...] "deliberately avoided Negro dialect. 'No Uncle Remus or Little Black Sambo sort of stuff. At one point <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> making the story into a full-length novel. Helen Masten, writing for The Saturday Review, commented [...] "Had this happened this little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood might never have reached children, to whom it rightly belongs." [...] Rawlings also talked about her ideas with Bob Camp, an illustrator and friend. From that conversation, Camp produced a series of paintings to illustrate the idea. In 1947 Rawlings sent The Secret Rivers manuscript to Perkins, and Camp visited his office in New York with the paintings. When Perkins responded with suggestions, Rawlings confessed to him that she was not completely pleased with Camp's illustrations. By June of that year, Perkins' death from pneumonia and Rawlings' own personal problems had derailed the project. After Rawlings' death in 1953, the manuscript for The Secret River was the only complete manuscript found among her papers.|$|E
500|$|By 1968, Smith {{began to}} feel large amounts of {{pressure}} from the music business. The stress of touring, recording, promoting, {{and trying to keep}} a personal life led Smith to contemplate the possibility of suicide. Although <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> suicide, Smith later clarified that she never saw the idea as an actual possibility. These pressures eventually led Smith to seek solace in both her family life and religion, becoming a Born Again Christian in the spring of 1968. Although she did not give up her music career completely, Smith did balance it with a lighter schedule in order to avoid stress. In 1968 and 1969, Smith also began to record darker songs, including the single [...] "Ribbon of Darkness", among others. Smith stated that it was reflection on her personal life, after recently divorcing her first husband Jerry Smith. Despite her recent personal troubles, Smith continued to enjoy the same commercial success she had before. In 1969 her next single [...] "You and Your Sweet Love" [...] (written by Bill Anderson) reached No.6 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. This was followed by another top ten single in 1970, entitled [...] "I Never Once Stopped Loving You", which reached No.5 on the same singles chart. Between 1969 and 1970, Smith released two collaborative albums with American country artist Nat Stuckey called Young Love and Sunday Morning with Nat Stuckey and Connie Smith, the latter of which was a gospel album.|$|E
500|$|One of Lois's key {{relationships}} is with Clark, who is {{her husband in}} the comics. For Smallville, the characters' relationship is in constant development. Darren Swimmer describes the relationship between Lois and Clark in season five as [...] "a bit of a melting of the ice". The two characters continue to [...] "butt heads", but the audience can see where there is a growing attraction and that either would be there for the other in a time of need. According to Erica Durance, in season five it is not yet clear if either character realizes the attraction, but the joking between the two characters represents a foreshadowing of a greater relationship. Durance believes that because of Lois's self-imposed walls, even if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> Clark in a romantic notion for just an instant she would immediately make it out to be a joke because she is not ready for that type of closeness, yet. The actress sees season five as being too soon for the characters to be [...] "in-love" [...] because they are still getting to know each other. Writer Brian Peterson describes Lois's relationship with Oliver Queen in season six as a precursor to her future relationship with Clark. As Peterson sees it, it is the dynamic between her and Oliver, with her willingness to accept Oliver's secret identity as Green Arrow as mirroring the relationship she will have with Clark. As far as season six is concerned, the relationship between Lois and Clark is still undefined for the audience. As Durance describes it, neither character is willing to put an official label on their relationship. The pair has learned to deal with each other's [...] "quirks", but there are still moments that both feel uncomfortable with. Instead at this point, Durance believes that Clark and Lois are satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother-sister friendship" [...] label, than trying to discover how they both truly feel about each other.|$|E

I could barely function." [...] Later that year she reconsidered her words and went back into performing after being asked by friends to sing David Bowie's [...] "Life on Mars?" [...] at their son's memorial. According to Manson, [...] "we were all in so much pain, but it {{meant so much to}} them that I could sing that song and so much to me that I was able to do something.

2500|$|Mrs. Mary Wylie King {{was active}} in women's {{organizations}} of the church. She worked for many years as an enthusiastic member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She was {{an active member of}} Eastern Star, being chaplain of that order for many years. She did not like staying home while Ward travelled, a fact which she mentioned repeatedly in her letters to him. Even so, she did serve as his [...] "manager" [...] under one spelling of her maiden name of [...] "M.B. Wylie". She served as the practice audience for his speeches. She edited and typed his letters, often serving as his [...] "emergency secretary". Some called her the [...] "Mother of Good Roads." [...] By all accounts, she was a very strong-willed woman, with a flair for the dramatic. Family members point to the photo she had taken of herself in [...] "widow's weeds" [...] as an example of her endearing way of dramatizing events—in that case, the recent death of her husband. She also never lost her staunch devotion to the cause of temperance, which the repeal of Prohibition did nothing to dampen. One family member reported that {{there was a time when}} she came upon another family member having a beer. After she finished telling him in no uncertain terms what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> that, the two of them remained thereafter permanently estranged.
