These factors are price, reputation, service quality, effective advertising competition, involuntary switching, distance and switching cost. Two major objectives were fulfilled {{in the study}} and for this purpose, in first objective seven hypotheses were tested and for second objective marginal effects of seven factors were analyze. Zheng (2009) study questionnaire tool were employed and 196 respondents were take part in survey. Positive relationship found in unfavorable perception of price/ reputation/ service quality/ effective advertising/ distance and customers’ switching banks and negative relationship established in involuntary switching and switching cost and customers’ switching banks.

By generating Ras nanoclusters {{in direct proportion to}} ligand input, cells build an analogue-digital analogue circuit relay that transmits a signal across the plasma membrane with high fidelity.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} bachelor’s {{thesis is}} to inform about {{conditions}} of running and the character of running of the wind power plants and about the suitable storage systems for the possibilities of time invariableness of power supply. For these reasons is immediately in {{the first chapter of}} the thesis described state of using wind power plants in The Czech republic and other countries in Europe which produce electric power. Description of individual functional parts is important mainly from the point of electrician conversion of kinetic energy of wind to electric energy with help of the electric power generator with the highest efficiency and without need for maintenance. It is necessary to know those functional parts of the power wind to be able to design appropriate storage system. The output electric power is very variable at time, mainly output voltage, because wind energy is variable too. The characteristics of the wind power plants as output voltage, frequency and their <b>switching</b> <b>graded</b> at time have to in accordance with requirements of the electricity supply systems not to disturb the stability or even collapse of the electricity supply system which would lead to serious economic consequences. These predicaments can be prevented with precise meteorological forecast or by using the acceptable storage system with small acquisition and operating costs, requirements to safeness and long service life, low weight and high efficiency of conversion of energy. The storage systems are classified into centralized and decentralizing systems with requirements to dynamic running and running time. To fulfil these conditions it is essential to choose acceptable and accessible locations with year lasting qualities of wind, which are being checked in advance using measurement and mathematical calculations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper gives {{analytical}} expressions for {{the class}} disruptive effect (DE) amplifier with nonlinear shunt capacitances at any grading coefficient m of the MOSFET body junction diode at a high value of the loaded quality factor Q of the output resonant circuit, zero equivalent series resistance of all the components, and switch-on duty ratio D = 0. 25. No external shunt capacitance {{is used in the}} analysis of the class DE amplifier. The grading coeffi-cient determines the degree of nonlinearity of the MOSFET shunt capacitances. When the grading coefficient is different from the design specifications, the waveforms of the switch voltages do not satisfy the class E switching conditions, reducing the power conver-sion efficiency. Therefore, the grading coefficient m is an important parameter to satisfy the class E switching conditions. It is shown analytically that the dc supply voltage and current are always pro-portional to the amplitude of the output voltage and current. The output power capability is never affected by any nonlinearity of the shunt capacitances. We obtain analytical design equations, which are validated by PSPICE simulations and laboratory experiments considered with the gate-drain capacitance effect.

However, whether switching schools actually puts youth at risk for dropout is uncertain, since youth who switch schools are similar to dropouts in their levels of prior school achievement and engagement, which suggests that switching schools may be part of the same long-term developmental pro-cess of disengagement that leads to dropping out. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, this study uses propensity score matching to pair youth who switched high schools with similar youth who stayed in the same school. We find that while over half the association between switching schools and dropout is explained by observed character-istics prior to ninth <b>grade,</b> <b>switching</b> schools is still associated with dropout.

It consists of ordering a naive S to administer increasingly more severe punishment to a victim {{in the context of a}} learning experiment. Punishment is administered by means of a shock generator with 30 <b>graded</b> <b>switches</b> ranging from Slight Shock to Danger: Severe Shock. The victim is a confederate of the E. The primary dependent variable is the maximum shock the S is willing to administer before he refuses to continue further. 26 Ss obeyed the experimental commands fully, and administered the highest shock on the generator. 14 Ss broke off the experiment at some point after the victim protested and refused to provide further answers. The procedure created extreme levels of nervous tension in some Ss. Profuse sweating, trembling, and stuttering were typical expressions of this emotional disturbance. One un-expected sign of tension—yet to be explained—was the regular occurrence of nervous laughter, which in some Ss developed into uncontrollable seizures.

Overall, the children in 5 th grade code-switched more than children in 3 rd grade, however this was mainly due to the many switches made by the boys in 5 th grade. The fact that overall the 5 th graders code-switched more than the 3 rd graders indicate that code-switching becomes more usual during the course of elementary school.

30|$|There are {{a growing}} number of {{problems}} in cell biology that involve the coupling between a piecewise deterministic differential equation and a time-homogeneous Markov chain on some discrete space Γ, resulting in a stochastic hybrid system, also known as a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) [37]. Typically, the phase space of the dynamical system is taken to be R^d for finite d. One important example at the single-cell level is the occurrence of membrane voltage fluctuations in neurons due to the stochastic opening and closing of ion channels [2, 25, 30, 32, 54, 64, 80, 109, 114, 117]. Here the discrete states of the ion channels evolve according to a continuous-time Markov process with voltage-dependent transition rates and, in-between discrete jumps in the ion channel states, the membrane voltage evolves according to a deterministic equation that depends on {{the current state of the}} ion channels. In the limit that the number of ion channels goes to infinity, we can apply the law of large numbers and recover classical Hodgkin–Huxley-type equations. However, finite-size effects can result in the noise-induced spontaneous firing of a neuron due to channel fluctuations. Another important example is a gene regulatory network, where the continuous variable is the concentration of a protein product, and the discrete variable represents the activation state of the gene [79, 83, 108, 110, 131]. Stochastic switching between active and inactive gene states can allow a gene regulatory network to <b>switch</b> between <b>graded</b> and binary responses, exhibit translational/transcriptional bursting, and support metastability (noise-induced switching between states that are stable in the deterministic limit). If random switching persists at the phenotypic level, then this can confer certain advantages to cell populations growing in a changing environment, as exemplified by bacterial persistence in response to antibiotics. A third example occurs within the context of motor-driven intracellular transport [23]. One often finds that motor-cargo complexes randomly switch between different velocity states such as anterograde versus retrograde motion, which can be modeled in terms of a special type of stochastic hybrid system known as a velocity jump process.|$|R
