50|$|The optimum {{time for}} {{receiving}} RF reflections off sporadic meteors {{is the early}} morning period, when the velocity of earth relative to the velocity of the particles is greatest which also increases the number of meteors occurring on the morning-side of the earth, but some <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteor</b> reflections can received {{at any time of}} the day, least in the early evening.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecent {{measurements}} {{conducted at}} the Arecibo Observatory report high-speed <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> having velocities near 50 km/s. The results seem to indicate a bimodal velocity distribution in the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> (maxima at ~ 20 km/s and ~ 50 km/s). The particles have a maximum mass of ~ 1 ?g. This paper will present {{an analysis of the}} ablation of 1 ?g meteoroids having velocities of 20, 30, 50, and 70 km/s. The calculations show that there is fractionation even for the fast meteoroids, the effect being particularly noticeable for the 1 ?g sporadic particles, and less so for the heavier particles. The relevance of the calculations to the radar observations of the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Meteors can be {{classified}} into either <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> or showery meteors. We compile the meteor records in the astronomical archives in the Chronicle of the Koryo dynasty (918 - 1392), and investigate the spatial distribution of meteor streams along the orbit of the Earth from the 10 th century to the 14 th century. We see that meteors from meteor streams signalize themselves over noisy <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors,</b> and that the seasonal activity of <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> was apparently regular. We discover {{the presence of a}} few meteor streams by analysing about 700 meteors in the Koryo period. We also compile the records of meteor showers and storms in the chronicles of Korea, Japan, China, Arab, and Europe, and compare their appearance dates with those of showers obtained above, {{as well as with the}} modern observations. We confirm that the three sets of data are in agreement with each other. The representative meteor showers are the Perseids, the Leonids, and the η-Aquarids/Orionids pair formed by Halley’s comet. The other weak or relic meteor streams are also observable but uncertain. Hence, we witness the regularity of meteor activity, which is seen to persist for a millennium. ...|$|R
40|$|Reduced {{trajectory}} {{data and}} orbital elements are reported for 20 double-station meteors photographed at the NASA-NMSU meteor observatory {{during the winter}} of 1974 / 75. The objects photographed include 10 <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> and 10 members of the Geminid shower. The data for the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> indicate that their magnitudes range from 0 to - 4, all have eccentricities greater than 0. 4, all but three are in direct orbits, and one is probably a member of the Coma Berenicid shower. The elements for the Geminids are obtained using times of appearance chosen by adopting 34. 6 km/s as the heliocentric velocity of the shower. The results are compared with previous orbital determinations, and it is concluded that there is no evidence for significant evolution of the Geminid-stream orbit {{over a period of several}} decades...|$|R

Instead, these streaks of light are the glow of interplanetary debris crashing into Earth's atmosphere. This animated video introduces students to shooting stars and the reasons behind annual meteor showers. Topics include the difference between <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> and meteor showers, how comets release debris that enter our atmosphere when Earth crosses the path of a comet's orbit, and when is the best time of night to see a meteor display.

While the interplanetary flux was extensively studied, lunar ejecta created by {{the impact of this}} material on the lunar surface is only now being studied. Two recently reported flux models are employed to calculate the total mass impacting the lunar surface due to <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteor</b> flux. There is ample evidence to support the contention that the sporadic interplanetary meteoroid flux enhances the meteroid flux of cislunar space through the creation of micron and submicron lunar ejecta with lunar escape velocity...|$|E
40|$|Data of Pioneer 10 {{meteoroid}} penetration detectors were revised {{taking into}} account the orientation of detectors and the spacecraft velocity relative to the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteor</b> flux. The meteor flux density increases as an exponent to the orbit of Mars for two times for the particles with masses greater than 10 (exp - 6) g and six times for the particles with masses greater than 10 (exp - 12) - 10 (exp - 9) g then decreases after the orbit. Ejections of secondary meteoroid particles from surfaces of Phobos and Deimos are a possible explanation for the increase in meteoroid flux...|$|E

The - 6 mag meteor occurred on January 5, 1976, over southern New Mexico. Fifty features {{have been identified in}} the spectrum. The spectrum is essentially identical to that of Perseid meteors of similar brightness. It is shown that heavy-particle collisions do not dominate bright meteor spectra lacking time resolution. Low-energy electron excitation of Ca II is strongly indicated in the wake to such an extent as to strongly affect spectra of this type lacking time resolution...|$|E
40|$|We have {{compiled}} {{and analyzed}} historical Korean meteor and meteor shower records in three Korean official history books, Samguksagi which covers the three Kingdoms period (57 B. C [...] A. D. 935), Goryeosa of Goryeo dynasty (A. D. 918 [...] 1392), and Joseonwangjosillok of Joseon dynasty (A. D. 1392 [...] 1910). We have found 3861 meteor and 31 meteor shower records. We have confirmed {{the peaks of}} Perseids and an excess due to the mixture of Orionids, north-Taurids, or Leonids through the Monte-Carlo test. The peaks persist from the period of Goryeo dynasty to that of Joseon dynasty, for almost one thousand years. Korean records show a decrease of Perseids activity and an increase of Orionids/north-Taurids/Leonids activity. We have also analyzed seasonal variation of <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> from Korean records. We confirm the seasonal variation of <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> from the records of Joseon dynasty with {{the maximum number of}} events being roughly 1. 7 times the minimum. The Korean records are compared with Chinese and Japanese records for the same periods. Major features in Chinese meteor shower records are quite consistent with those of Korean records, particularly for the last millennium. Japanese records also show Perseids feature and Orionids/north-Taurids/Leonids feature, although they are less prominent compared to those of Korean or Chinese records. Comment: 29 pages, 7 figures.

40|$|Meteor {{detection}} and analysis {{is an essential}} topic {{in the field of}} astronomy. In this paper, a high-sensitivity and high-time-resolution imaging device for the detection of faint meteoric events is presented. The instrument is based on a fast CCD camera and an image intensifier. Two such instruments form a double-station observation network. The MAIA (Meteor Automatic Imager and Analyzer) system has been in continuous operation since 2013 and has successfully captured hundreds of meteors belonging to different meteor showers, as well as <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors.</b> A data processing pipeline for the efficient processing and evaluation of the massive amount of video sequences is also introduced in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of pulse dye lasers tuned to resonant line of meteor produced admixtures of atmospheric constituents {{has made it}} possible to begin lidar investigations of the vertical distribution of mesospheric sodium concentration and its dynamics in the upper atmosphere. The observed morning increase of sodium concentration in the vertical column is probably caused by diurnal variations of <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors.</b> The study of the dynamics of the sodium column concentration in the period of meteor streams activity confirms the suggestion of cosmic origin of these atoms. The short lived increase of sodium concentration brought about by a meteor stream, however, exceeds by one order the level of the sporadic background...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of a diurnal variation in meteor activity is well established. The <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteor</b> count rates are higher on the local dawn side and lower on the local dusk side.

Meteor radar measurements have been compared from Esrange, Kiruna, Sweden, at 68 degrees N, from Juliusruh, Germany, at 55 degrees N, and from Ascension Island, at 8 degrees S, to investigate how the diurnal variation depends on season at different latitudes. Data have been used from vernal and autumnal equinoxes and summer and winter solstices to locate the largest seasonal differences...|$|E
40|$|While much {{progress}} has been made in understanding the radio science and meteor physics implications of meteor “head-echoes ” observed with high power, large aperture (HPLA) radars, issues remain due to different analysis techniques employed. We address these issues via employing the same analysis technique to meteor observations from the Poker Flat, Sondrestrom, and Arecibo radars. We present and compare <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteor</b> parameters and in so doing observe an altitude “ceiling effect ” in the 1290 MHz results relative to the 430 / 449. 3 MHz results.

40|$|We {{developed}} a parametric {{model of the}} spatial distribution of sporadic meteoroids by taking their primary source to be short-period comets with aphelia less than 7 AU which showed to be {{the major source of}} dust released through the sublimation of cometary ices. We constrained the model to fit the observed distribution of particles deduced from the zodiacal light measurements of Helios I and II as well as Earth-based radio-meteor observations. We also considered the contribution to the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteor</b> complex from long-period comets. An origin for the North and South Toroidal source of sporadic meteors is proposed and the results of calculations for the likely characteristics of asteroidal meteors are also presented. Predicted fluxes and radiant distributions of sporadic meteors in the region between Mercury and Mars are shown as well. We have also included the effects of the gravitational shielding and focussing of the planets and shown that flux enhancements of up to 70 % are possible at some locations...|$|E
40|$|We have {{constructed}} {{an artificial}} meteor database resembling in all details the real sample {{collected by the}} observers of the Comets and Meteors Workshop in the years 1996 - 1999. The artificial database includes the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> and also events from the following showers: Perseids, Aquarid complex, Alpha Capricornids, July Pegasids and Sagittarids. This database was searched {{for the presence of}} the radiants of two weak showers: Alpha Cygnids and Delphinids. The lack of these radiants in the artificial database and their existence in the real observations suggests that Alpha Cygnids and Delphinids are the real showers and their radiants could not be formed as an effect of intersections of back prolongated paths of meteors belonging to other showers.

40|$|During {{the flight}} of a {{meteoroid}} through the neutral atmosphere, the high kinetic energy is sufficient to ionize the meteoric constituents. Radar echoes coming from plasma irregularities surrounding the meteoroids are called meteor-head echoes, and can be detected by HPLA radar systems. Measurements of these echoes were conducted with MAARSY (Middle Atmosphere Alomar Radar System) in December 2010. The interferometric capabilities of the radar system permit {{the determination of the}} meteor trajectories within the radar beam with high accuracy. The received data are used to gain information about entry velocities, source radiants, observation heights and other meteoroid parameters. Our preliminary results indicate that the majority of meteors have masses between 10 − 10 and 10 − 3 kg and the mean masses of the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> and Gemenids meteors are ∼ 10 − 8 kg...|$|R
40|$|The intense {{activity}} of cratering on the Moon {{and in the}} inner regions {{of the solar system}} was accomplished during the first 10 ^ 9 years [1]. Occasionally, some impact events occur even nowadays. In Section 1, we treat, from a historical point of view, the Earth-based observation of lunar impacts. In Section 2, we consider the visibility conditions of such events evaluating the luminosity of the background upon which an impact shines. In Section~ 3, the luminosity of an impact is discussed. The occurrence of lunar impact events outside of meteor shower periods is calculated using the hourly rate of the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> and their population index. The evidence of a larger rate of impacts of meteoroids in the past under these hypotheses is presentend in the last section...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} {{to draw a}} division between meteor showers and the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteor</b> complex in order to study these components of the meteoroid environment. Meteor showers persist {{for less than a}} season and are composed of members with a greater-than-average degree of orbital similarity. The level of orbital similarity is often quantified using so-called D-parameters; a D-parameter cutoff may be employed to define or extract a shower. Depending on the study, this cutoff value may be chosen based {{on the size of the}} data-set, the percentage of sporadic meteors within the data-set, or the inclination of the shower in question. We argue that the cutoff value should also reject the strength of the shower compared to the local sporadic background. We therefore present a method for determining, on a per-shower basis, the D-parameter cutoff that limits the false-positive rate to an acceptable percentage. If the false-positive rate exceeds this percentage regardless of cutoff value, we deem the shower to be undetectable in our data. We apply this method to optical meteor observations from the NASA All-Sky and Southern Ontario Meteor Networks and present the detectable meteor showers and their characteristics...|$|E
40|$|In this {{advanced}} {{physics and}} astronomy lesson, students measure <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteor</b> activity (SMA) with a laptop computer. Students construct dipole antennae, and build, test and wire a full-wave diode rectifier between the dipole antenna and the laptop. A voltage program measures voltage across the rectifier output to detect radio waves scattered off meteor trails. Students use a histograph {{to verify that}} they are measuring SMA. SMA is applied to mobile communications equipment, and the “meteor channel ” is {{explained in terms of}} an ellipsoid. Students use their SMA data to calculate how many words per minute the meteor channel can support as a function of keying speed. TIES TO CURRICULUM Meteor Monitor has ties to both math and science curricula. Students use a mathematical model to explain a physical phenomenon, apply formulae in metric to antenna construction, and use field data for graphical verification. Students use principles of science when they describe wave phenomena (particularly electromagnetic [EM] waves); use gravity and celestial motion to explain meteor trails; and classify meteors as “under-dense ” or “over-dense. ” Meteor Monitor addresses the National Science Education Standards call to integrate technology in scientific study...|$|E
40|$|Our current {{knowledge}} of the Solar System, with a particular emphasis on the systems of interplanetary objects, is reviewed, and the theory of meteors and the reflection of radio waves from meteoric ionization is then discussed. A description of the meteor radar is given and a method of calibrating the antenna beam is developed. The main project comprises two parts: (a) A general survey of the radar echorate for 20 major and minor meteor streams and the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteor</b> background, conducted from Grahamstown over the period 1986 April to 1988 January, is described. Definite shower activity was observed {{for all of the}} major and some of the minor showers. (b) Based on a scheme proposed by previous workers (Morton & Jones), a method of recovering meteor radiant distributions from the distribution of echo directions is developed. We devise a technique of compensating for possible distortions of the resulting radiant maps, which may arise due to the arisotropic antenna beam. This involves a system of echo-weighting. Radiant maps which showed considerably less distortion than those of the above workers were obtained without the weighting procedure. It is concluded that, although the method in its present form introduces spurious features into the maps, the principle is sound and should eventually be refined to produce the desired compensatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{meteoroid}} {{population in}} near-Earth space is typically {{broken down into}} two components: shower meteoroids which orbit in collimated streams, and the older sporadic meteoroids which have been dispersed into a much broader uncollimated distribution of orbits. The <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> dominate the meteoroid flux at Earth in the size range of those particles of {{the most of the}} risk to spacecraft (approximately 100 microns to 1 cm). We describe the results of numerical simulations of the sporadic meteoroid complex by full physical modeling of meteoroids from ejection from their parent body through their perturbation by planets and radiation forces though the end of their lives through collision or ejection from the solar system. This model together with comparison with optical and radar measurements of meteoroid fluxes in near Earth space will allow improved assessment of the risk to spacecraft in near-Earth space from the sporadic complex...|$|R
40|$|Resources {{studies for}} asteroidal mining {{evaluation}} have depended historically on remote sensing analysis for chemical elements. During the November 1998 Leonids meteor shower, a stratospheric balloon and various low-density capture media {{were used to}} sample fragments from Comet Tempel-Tuttle debris during a peak Earth crossing. The analysis not only demonstrates how potential sampling strategies may improve the projections for metals or rare elements in astromining, but also benchmarks materials during low temperature (- 60 F), high dessication environments as seen during atmospheric exposure. The results indicate high aluminum, magnesium and iron content for various sampled particles recovered, but generalization to the <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors</b> expected from asteroidal sources will require future improvements in larger sampling volumes before a broad-use strategy for chemical analysis can be described. A repeat of the experimental procedure is planned for the November 1999 Leonids' shower, and various improvements for atmospheric sampling will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Eighteen Fe {{ablation}} trails {{were observed}} during the 17 / 18 Nov 1998 Leonid meteor shower with an airborne Fe lidar aboard the National Simulation Facility/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF/NCAR) Electra aircraft over Okinawa. The average altitude of the 18 trails {{from the high}} velocity (72 km/s) Leonid meteors, 95. 67 +/- 0. 93 km, is approximately 6. 7 km higher than previously observed for slower (approx. 30 km/s) <b>sporadic</b> <b>meteors.</b> This height difference {{is consistent with the}} assumption that meteors ablate when the kinetic energy imparted to the atmosphere reaches a critical threshold. The average age of the Fe trails, determined by a diffusion model, is 10. 1 min. The youngest ages were observed below 92 km and above 98 km where chemistry and diffusion dominate, respectively. The average abundance of the trails is ten percent of the abundance of the background Fe layer. Observations suggest that the 1998 Leonid shower did not {{have a significant impact on}} the abundance of the background Fe layer...|$|R
