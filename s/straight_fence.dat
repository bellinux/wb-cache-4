40|$|Prawn is {{the major}} fishery in the Rekawa lagoon and "Kraal " is the ma-jor fishing gear, which is a {{built-in}} fishing-trap made of plant materials operated in the shallow regions of the lagoon. The Kraals are of different types. Their structure, distribution and method of operation are given in the note. The Rekawa lagoon is a coastal lagoon, which has an area of about 197 ha. A belt of mangroves encircles the lagoon almost completely. Prawn fishery {{is the major}} fishery in the lagoon and 'Kraal', * a built-in fish-trap, is the major gear employed in the fishery. A map of the lagoon (Fig. 1) having been prepared based on aerial photographs provided by the Survey Dept (1982, 1983), the distribution of Kraals was marked based on actual measurements. Approximate duration of operation of each Kraal was recorded by observation. Information on raw material, building, operation and reparation of Kraals was collected. Catches were sampled on the spot and were later analysed in the laboratory. Prawns were identified following Kurian and Sebastian (1982) and fishes were identified following Munro (1955), and their lengths and weights were measured. Structure of the Kraal: Kraal is an unbailed fishing trap built in shallow areas of the lagoon. The major parts of the Kraal are the fencing portion and the enclosure; the fencing diverting the animals to the enclosure, where they are trapped. Different types of Kraals are reported {{from different parts of}} the world (Day 1981, Kurian and Sebastian 1982, Zaouali 1984). Kraals in the Rekawa lagoon has three major components, namely guides, walls and skeletal poles. Walls supported by skeletal poles form the basic structure of the Kraal and they do most of the fencing and trapping of animals. Guides, besides doing the function of fencing, expand the size'of the Kraal (Fig. 2). Guide is a long <b>straight</b> <b>fence</b> made of mangrove twigs implanted in the shallow regions of the lagoon (Fig. 2). It is built either perpendicular to th...|$|E

50|$|He {{then changed}} yards {{again in the}} summer of 1999, as he joined the yard of Nicky Henderson. He was sent <b>straight</b> over <b>fences,</b> and it was here under Henderson that Tiutchev really excelled and proved himself to be the Champion Novice Chaser in the 1999/00 season. Although he only gained 4 more successes after that season, he ran creditably in {{numerous}} Grade 1 Chases including for Martin Pipe, who he joined in 2003. After a distinguished racing career, Tiutchev was finally retired after being pulled up in the 2005 Betfair Bowl at Aintree.|$|R

50|$|The Havana World championships {{were the}} third <b>straight</b> major <b>fencing</b> event {{held in the}} Americas after the 1967 edition in Montreal and the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico. Cuba gave the {{competition}} political overtones, including it in the celebrations for the ten years of the Cuban Revolution. Fencing was also stopped on 8 October for a commemoration of the anniversary of Che Guevara's death. The United States, {{who do not have}} formal diplomatic relations with Cuba, sent a restricted delegation of 25 fencers. The competition was also marred by numerous failures of the electrical apparatus to the heat and humidity.|$|R
50|$|As in {{the earlier}} Starčevo occupation, the Vinča houses at Belo Brdo were {{constructed}} primarily from wood and clay, but they also made use of levelled foundations, insulation and decoration with paint and wall coverings. In later phases large (40 x 60 m2) rectangular buildings with internal divisions and fixed furniture (benches, braziers, waterwheels, tables, etc.) appeared alongside the predominant one-roomed dwellings. The Vinča settlement was arranged on <b>straight</b> streets, <b>fenced</b> and considerably larger {{than that of the}} Starčevo period. The inhabitants' subsisted based both on the cultivation of grains (einkorn, emmer and barley) and husbandry of domesticated animals (primarily cattle, but also goats, sheep and pigs). These agricultural practices probably continued to be supplemented by hunting and fishing in the surrounding environs.|$|R
25|$|The {{first major}} show jumping {{competition}} held in England was at Olympia in 1907. Most of the competitors {{were members of}} the military and it became clear at this competition and in the subsequent years, that there was no uniformity of rules for the sport. Judges marked on their own opinions. Some marked according to the severity of the obstacle and others marked according to style. Before 1907 there were no penalties for a refusal and the competitor was sometimes asked to miss the fence to please the spectators. The first courses were built with little imagination, many consisting of only a <b>straight</b> bar <b>fence</b> and a water jump. A meeting was arranged in 1923 which {{led to the formation of}} the BSJA in 1925. In the United States, a similar need for national rules for jumping and other equestrian activities led to the formation of the American Horse Shows Association in 1917, which now is known as the United States Equestrian Federation.|$|R

Mullins sent {{him into the}} lead after a furlong and held off several challengers to win by one and a quarter lengths from the favourite New Year's Eve. The New One and Jezki finished sixth and eighth respectively. After the race, Mullins said that [...] "Champagne Fever has a huge cruising speed {{and that is where}} we went wrong with him first time out. Last time we made all and we decided to do the same today". In the following month, Champagne Fever started 11/4 favourite for the Grade I Champion INH Flat Race at the Punchestown Festival. As at Cheltenham, he led throughout the race, and after being challenged on the final turn, he drew away to win by seven and a half lengths from Melodic Rendezvous. Mullin described the winner as [...] "a super horse. He just gallops all day, he obviously stays well, he jumps well so he's one we're really looking forward to. He has huge ability and I have considered going <b>straight</b> over <b>fences</b> with him. We could do what we did with Florida Pearl".|$|R
50|$|A {{good show}} hunter must possess an {{excellent}} jumping form. The forearm should be parallel or higher with the ground, and the knees and lower legs should be even. The horse {{should not be}} lazy with its lower legs, but should tuck them under its forearm as it clears the fence, clearly bending its fetlocks and knees. The horse should not throw its body or legs to one side, but should stay perfectly <b>straight</b> over the <b>fence.</b> A good show hunter should show a great bascule, or roundness over a jump. This {{is often described as}} the horse taking the shape of a dolphin jumping out of the water, with the horse's back up, and its head reaching forward and down over the fence.|$|R

2500|$|Promptly upon {{joining the}} Bisons, Smith {{impressed}} observers with his defensive play. [...] In April 1940, during a Florida exhibition {{game against the}} Detroit Tigers, Smith made a catch that Buffalo sports writer Cy Kritzer later called the greatest catch he had ever seen, including [...] "The Catch" [...] made by Willie Mays in 1954. [...] With the bases loaded in the ninth inning, Hank Greenberg hit the ball better than 475 feet into dead center.

[...] He appears on a list of Portsmouth freemen in 1655, and the following year became active in civic affairs when he was selected as a juryman and as a Commissioner. In 1657 he was one of seven men who bought a large tract of land in the Narraganset country, called the Pettaquamscutt Purchase, which would later become South Kingstown, Rhode Island. For more than 20 years, Wilbur held important positions within the colony, serving not only as a Commissioner, but also as a Deputy and an Assistant. In 1667, he enlisted in a Troop of Horse, and nine years later, in 1676, during King Philip's War, he held the title of Captain. That same year {{he was a member of}} a Court Martial held at Newport where certain Indians were charged with complicity in King Philip's designs.|$|R

"This {{horse is}} worth three hundred dollars, and he's either going through or over," [...] {{the answer came}} back; and I shouted in warning, for it {{appeared}} impossible to clear that fence, though the beast, which was not of common bronco stock, had good imported blood in him. Then there was a yell from the foreman as he recklessly shot forward <b>straight</b> at the <b>fence.</b> The horse was ready to face anything {{so long as he}} could keep the fire behind him, and I held my breath as he rose at the wire. Our horses are not good jumpers, and the result seemed certain. His knees struck the topmost wire; there was a heavy crash; and the man, shooting forward as from a catapult, alighted with a sickening thud, while the poor brute rolled over and lay still {{on the wrong side of}} the fence. Thorn rose, but very shakily, and I was thankful I had lost only some three hundred dollars, which I could very badly spare.|$|R
40|$|Fencing {{costs are}} one of the most {{expensive}} aspects of livestock grazing. The type of fence constructed greatly impacts the cost per foot, total cost, and annual ownership cost. In addition, the shape of the paddocks affects the amount of materials needed and labor required for construction of the fence. This publication compares the costs of building a quarter-mile (1, 320 feet) <b>straight</b> perimeter <b>fence</b> with four different types of permanent fencing plus temporary interior fencing. These are: woven wire, barbed wire, high-tensile non-electric, high-tensile electrifi ed and temporary interior fencing. The type of fencing selected varies by personal choice and the species of livestock to be confi ned. In general all confi gurations shown can be used with cattle, woven wire and high-tensile electrifi ed can be used with sheep, and woven wire can be used with hogs. The list of materials needed for each type of fenc-ing is from Costs of Cattle Fencing for Grazing Areas (see references at the end of the article). Costs were adjusted to 2011 prices provided by a number of Iowa retailers, although prices may vary. Labor was valued at $ 15. 05 per hour for wo-ven wire and $ 16. 25 per hour for barbed wire, the average fence building custom charges reported in AgDM File A 3 - 10, 2011 Iowa Farm Custom Rate Survey. These charges include the cost of equipment and tools for building fence, as well as labor. Gates are not included in the estimates. Fencing can be confi gured in many different ways, using various types of fencing materials. The ex-amples in this publication provide a general com-parison between the following fi ve confi gurations. Woven Wire Fence The woven wire fence (see Table 1) employs a brace that uses two 8 -inch diameter posts an...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Blunt {{realized}} that Hindman had gotten past his flank and intercepted Herron. Furious, he ordered {{his men to}} march {{to the sound of}} the guns. Not knowing the precise location of the fighting, the Federal troops ignored roads and traversed through farm fields and over <b>fences</b> <b>straight</b> toward the sound of battle at the double quick. This movement was probably initiated by Col. Thomas Ewing and the 11th Kansas Infantry. While Blunt did not order the maneuver he quickly endorsed it, even chastising a regimental commander for not showing enough initiative when he failed to follow the unorthodox procedure. Blunt's forces arrived on the field just as Hindman was ordering another attack on Herron's forces. Blunt's division slammed into the surprised Confederates and drove them back onto the hill. During this attack, the heaviest casualties of the battle were felt by the 10th Missouri Confederate Infantry, which was caught in the open, at the flank of the Confederate forces. Blunt aligned his two brigades and sent them forward toward the Morton house on the same ridge to the west of the Borden house. Blunt's forces fought somewhat sporadically until being recalled off the ridge. Brig. Gen. Mosby M. Parsons' Confederate brigade swept across the farm fields of prairie toward Blunt's artillery. Once again the Union soldiers and artillery repulsed the attack and darkness put an end to the fighting.|$|R
30|$|When a {{farm animal}} is {{killed by a}} predator, the Swedish {{authorities}} provide a set sum of compensation {{for the value of}} the animal. However, the greatest costs caused by predators to farms practising forest pasturing are not animals killed, but changes in animal behaviour, which farmers claim as threat to the basis of their farming practices. These include animals not returning home at night, decreasing milk production and occasionally, although more frequently in sheep than cows, spontaneous abortion or infertility during the following insemination season. All these effects are said {{to be the result of}} stress but are inherently difficult to account for. In most cases, farmers notice that predators have come close to their cattle when they find their herd has scattered. This is usually not noticed until it is time for the cattle to come home to their stalls in the evening and they fail to do so. Cattle can also hurt themselves as they flee from predators, even when they are fenced in, as they run <b>straight</b> through the <b>fence.</b> After being collected and put back in their stalls they can become unmanageable or prove to be less trustworthy during daily routines such as milking or being sent out to graze in the forest. In one such case when cows showed increasing aggression after having been in contact with bears, a local official recommended that the cows be put down, as they had become afraid of predators. The farmer was also recommended to place bear skins in the stall to get the animals used to their smell, supposedly making them less afraid. The farmer told me that he did not agree with this advice, as he thought that, if anything, cows with an instinct to flee predators would have a better chance of surviving predator attacks, but complied anyway as he was worried that not complying would damage his relationship with the authorities.|$|R
