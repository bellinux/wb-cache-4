25|$|The {{governor}} {{could not}} actually hold a set speed; the engine would assume a new constant speed {{in response to}} load changes. The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a <b>speed</b> <b>change.</b> As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.|$|E
25|$|As the {{remaining}} propellant decreases, rocket vehicles become lighter and their acceleration tends to increase until the propellant is exhausted. This means {{that much of}} the <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> occurs {{towards the end of the}} burn when the vehicle is much lighter. However, the thrust can be throttled to offset or vary this if needed. Discontinuities in acceleration also occur when stages burn out, often starting at a lower acceleration with each new stage firing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the basic rule of diamond wire saw slicing SiCp-Al composites, the {{theoretical}} analysis and experiments were carried out. The influences of diamond wire saw slicing speed and workpiece feed speed on surface quality and machining efficiency were discussed. The analysis {{results show that the}} machined surface gets smoother when diamond wire saw slicing <b>speed</b> <b>changes</b> from 2 m/s to 3. 5 m/s, but gets rougher when diamond wire saw slicing <b>speed</b> <b>changes</b> from 3. 5 m/s to 4 m/s. And the surface gets rougher when workpiece feed <b>speed</b> <b>changes</b> from 0. 5 m/s to 1 m/s. The machining efficiency gets higher when diamond wire saw slicing speed and workpiece feed speed increase. These results provide guidance for selecting reasonable parameters in future research...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we analyse the {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) signal {{associated with}} gait <b>speed</b> <b>changes</b> (i. e. acceleration or deceleration). For data acquisition, healthy {{subjects were asked}} to perform volitional <b>speed</b> <b>changes</b> between 0, 1, and 2 Km/h, during treadmill walk. Simultaneously, the treadmill controller modified the speed of the belt according to the subject’s linear speed. A classifier is trained to distinguish between the EEG signal associ-ated with constant speed gait and with gait <b>speed</b> <b>changes,</b> respectively. Results indicate that the classification performance is fair to good {{for the majority of the}} subjects, with accu-racies always above chance level, in both batch and pseudo-online approaches. Feature vi-sualisation and equivalent dipole localisation suggest that the information used by the classifier is associated with increased activity in parietal areas, where mu and beta rhythms are suppressed during gait <b>speed</b> <b>changes.</b> Specifically, the parietal cortex may be involved in motor planning and visuomotor transformations throughout the online gait adaptation, which is in agreement with previous research. The findings of this study may help to shed light on the cortical involvement in human gait control, and represent a step towards a BMI for applications in post-stroke gait rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{enhancements}} to {{the classical}} Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add (WSOLA) algorithm are proposed. As a time-domain approach, it works best for small <b>speed</b> <b>changes</b> and quasi-periodic, monophonic signals. Some of our enhancements are especially effective for small, others for large <b>speed</b> <b>changes.</b> As a consequence, significant improvements for all scaling factors are achieved extending the usability of the new scheme to larger <b>speed</b> <b>changes</b> and more complex signal characteristics. The reduction in computational complexity is analyzed by comparing the number of splice points needed to time-scale the input signal. As will be shown, these are the only points where real signal processing is performed. Therefore, a reduction in their number results in an equivalent decrease in computational demand. Additionally, {{they are also the}} only points where artifacts may arise so that, in many cases, a reduction in their number can serve as an indicator for improvements in the signal quality, too...|$|R
