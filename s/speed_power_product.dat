40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{proposal}} {{of a new}} dual stack approach for reducing both leakage and dynamic powers. The development of digital integrated circuits is challenged by higher power consumption. Thecombination of higher clock speeds, greater functional integration, and smaller process geometries has contributed to significant growth in power density. Scaling improves transistor density and functionality ona chip. Scaling helps to increase speed and frequency of operation and hence higher performance. As voltages scale downward with the geometries threshold voltages must also decrease to gain the performance advantages of the new technology but leakage current increases exponentially. Today leakage power has become anincreasingly important issue in processor hardware and software design. It {{can be used in}} various applications like digital VLSI clocking system, buffers, registers, microprocessors etc. The leakage power increases astechnology is scaled down. In this paper, we propose a new dual stack approach for reducing both leakage and dynamic powers. Moreover, the novel dual stack approach shows the least <b>speed</b> <b>power</b> <b>product</b> whencompared to the existing methods. All well known approach is “Sleep” in this method we reduce leakage power. The proposed Dual Stack approach we reduce more power leakage. Dual Stack approach uses theadvantage of using the two extra pull-up and two extra pull-down transistors in sleep mode either in OFF state or in ON state. Since the Dual Stack portion can be made common to all logic circuitry, less number of transistors is needed to apply a certain logic circuit. The dual stack approach shows the least <b>speed</b> <b>power</b> <b>product</b> among all methods. The Dual Stack technique provides new ways to designers who require ultra-low leakage power consumption with much less speedpower product...|$|E

Threshold logic is a computational model widely used in the design of MOBILE circuits, i. e., these circuits are built from threshold gates (TGs). This paper describes the design of full adders (FAs), using TG-based circuit topologies. Both the selection of different MOBILE TG networks and the use of gates that can be considered extensions of the MOBILE TG are addressed.

Many {{logic circuit}} {{applications}} of Resonant Tunneling Diodes {{are based on}} the MOnostable-BIstable Logic Element (MOBILE). Threshold logic is a computational model widely used in the design of MOBILE circuits, i. e. these circuits are built from threshold gates (TGs). The MOBILE realization of generalized threshold gates is being investigated. Multi-Threshold Threshold Gates (MTTGs) have been proposed which further increase the functionality of the original TGs. Recently, we have proposed a novel MOBILE circuit topology obtained by fundamental properties of threshold functions. This paper describes the design of n-bit adders using these novel MOBILE circuit topologies.

40|$|Significant {{characteristic}} of any VLSI design circuit is its power, reliability, operating frequency and implementation cost. Dynamic CMOS designs provide high operating speeds compared to static CMOS designs combined with low silicon area requirement. This thesis describes {{the design and}} the optimization of high performance carry select adder. Previous researchers believed that existing CSA designs has reached theoretical speed bound. But, only a considerable portion of hardware resources of traditional adders are used in worst case scenario. Based on this observation our proposed design will improve on theoretical limit. The major scope of this proposed design {{is to increase the}} speed of carry generation between intermediate blocks of Carry select Adder (CSA) by introducing fast multiple clock Domino Manchester carry chain (MCC) that generates carry outputs.
