5000|$|Phosphonates are {{effective}} chelating agents. That is, they bind tightly to di- and trivalent metal ions, which {{is useful in}} water softening. In this way, they prevent formation of insoluble precipitates (scale). The binding of these ligands also suppresses the catalytic properties of metal ions. They are stable under harsh conditions. For these reasons, an important industrial use of phosphonates is in cooling waters, desalination systems, and in oil fields to inhibit scale formation. Phosphonates are also regularly used in reverse osmosis systems as anti-scalants. Phosphonates in cooling water systems also serve to control corrosion of iron and steel. In pulp and paper manufacturing and in textile industry they serve as [...] "peroxide bleach stabilizers", by chelating metals that could inactivate the peroxide. In detergents they are used as a combination of chelating agent, <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> and bleach stabilizer. Phosphonates are also increasingly used in medicine to treat disorders associated with bone formation and calcium metabolism. Furthermore, they serve as carriers for radionuclides in bone cancer treatments (see samarium-153-ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate).|$|E

30|$|Scale prevention, in principle, can be {{achieved}} by use of <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are chemicals that delay, reduce, or prevent scale formation when added into scaling water. Most of the <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitors</b> work by absorbing onto the crystal surface to prevent further growth of precipitate or by preventing the precipitate from adhering to solid surfaces such as pipes and vessels. The most common <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitors</b> used in the oil industry are inorganic phosphates, organophosphorous compounds, and organic polymers. Unfortunately, these “traditional” scale control methods applied to crystalline mineral salt precipitates do not apply to silica because it is amorphous (Ehrlich et al. 2010). In addition, the inherent and consequent environmental hazards of using toxic and non-biodegradable <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have hindered the use of phosphonates due to their poor ecotoxicity. Moreover, many polymers fail to meet minimum biodegradation requirements (Holt et al. 2009). Therefore, the call for going green with <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitors</b> has become necessary. Though the use of green <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to inhibit <b>scale</b> in oil and gas wells is relatively an unexplored area (Kumar et al. 2010), there have been several works on this “promising alternative” (Kohler et al. 2004).|$|R

40|$|Oilfield {{scale has}} long been {{recognized}} as one of the major problems of the oil production industry with the most common scales being calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and barium sulphate (BaSO 4). The most common remedy is to treat the formation with <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitor</b> chemicals. The phosphonate <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitor</b> DETPMP is known to be amongst the strongest adsorbing scale inhibitors onto carbonate substrates. This paper presents the results of corefloods using long (12 ") carbonate cores where less than 1 pore volume of DETPMP <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitor</b> is injected at the inlet and then back produced. In these floods, the core is never fully saturated and these floods are referred to as "contained" core floods. Very extensive data on SI, cation (Ca, Mg and Li) and pH effluents are collected. This study showed that the higher the concentration of SI and lower the pH, the more calcium dissolution is observed (from the [Ca 2 +] effluents); In all treatments there is a decrease in the [Mg 2 +] effluent corresponding directly to the increase in calcium; The effluent cation results in the long corefloods strongly support the view that both magnesium and calcium are binding quite strongly to the DETPMP <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> These observations lead us to a number of conclusions on the factors that must be included in a full carbonate model.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the static batch test, the tube blocking test is carried out under dynamic conditions by pumping continuously freshly mixed fluid through a tube (Bazin et al. 2005) where HPHT conditions can be adjusted. Quantification of the precipitation is realized by measuring the differential pressure over the tube. Both tests enable the quantification of the inhibitory effect by measuring the scaling related change of a physical or chemical quantity over a certain time. The inhibitor effectivity can be transformed into an efficiency by relating it {{to the amount of}} inhibitor necessary for the effect. Ranking of <b>scaling</b> <b>inhibitors</b> is realized by comparing the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC), which is defined as the concentration of inhibitor required to obtain an inhibitory effect of predefined extent (Graham et al. 2006). Applying a given test procedure, the lower the MIC for a <b>scaling</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> the higher is the inhibition performance.

30|$|Temperature and {{pressure}} changes during production of geothermal fluids {{can lead to}} oversaturation of dissolved minerals and thus to mineral precipitation. Scaling can severely damage geothermal installations or decrease the injectivity of the reservoir (Gallup 2009; Regenspurg et al. 2010; Tomaszewska and Pająk 2012; Wanner et al. 2017; Boch et al. 2017). Over many years, <b>scale</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have been applied to overcome this problem. Such inhibitors {{have been developed for}} application in oil field production, water heating facilities, industrial waste water disposal, and circulating cooling systems, effectively preventing the formation of mineral scales such as calcite or barite (Amro 2005; Graham et al. 2003; Collins et al. 2004; Sullivan et al. 1996; Choi et al. 2002). However, when applied in geothermal installations, the effectivity of these commonly used inhibitors can decrease considerably due to the special physico-chemical conditions of geothermal fluids such as high pressure, high temperature, high salinity or content of corrosive or scale-forming chemicals. These conditions have {{to be taken into account}} when the efficiency of <b>scaling</b> <b>inhibitors</b> for geothermal application is tested. Furthermore, established <b>scaling</b> <b>inhibitors</b> based on phosphates or phosphonates are known to have toxic effects on aquatic organisms or cause eutrophication problems (Hasson et al. 2011; Lattemann and Höpner 2008). Based on their chemical composition, some inhibitors are expected to be persistent or even cumulative in the reservoir. Environmental concerns of the governmental authorities are increasing and enforce the usage of “green” inhibitors that are non-toxic and biodegradable (Chaussemier et al. 2015; Popov et al. 2016). New <b>scaling</b> <b>inhibitors</b> meeting these requirements were lately tested with regard to their inhibitory efficiency (Reddy and Hoch 2001; Baraka-Lokmane et al. 2008; Kavitha et al. 2011; Choi et al. 2002) but scarcely at elevated temperatures such as occurring in geothermal fluids (Topçu et al. 2017; Ketrane et al. 2009).|$|R
30|$|Due to high {{temperatures}} in geothermal fluids above ground {{as well as}} in the reservoir, <b>scaling</b> <b>inhibitors</b> might also be subject to thermal decomposition. Thermal stability of <b>scaling</b> <b>inhibitors</b> plays a crucial role in geothermal applications. It has to be guaranteed over a certain timeframe until the inhibitor-containing fluid in the reservoir has distributed away from the injection bore hole far enough that the fluid comes close to the reservoir equilibrium and failing of the inhibitory capability does not lead to scaling and injectivity reduction any more. However, since the chemical behaviour of inhibitors in the reservoir over long time periods is mostly unknown, a delayed degradation of the inhibitors is intended to avoid their persistence or accumulation in the reservoir. Besides non-toxicity, this is a characteristic feature of “green” inhibitors (Chaussemier et al. 2015).|$|R
