50|$|The <b>swan</b> <b>mussel,</b> Anodonta cygnea, {{is a large}} {{species of}} {{freshwater}} mussel, an aquatic bivalve mollusc in the family Unionidae, the river mussels.|$|E
50|$|More than 50% of {{the fish}} that live here are {{threatened}} or at least endangered in Bavaria or in this stock, such as the Wels catfish or Rutilus meidingerii. The <b>Swan</b> <b>mussel</b> {{is also on the}} red list of endangered plant and animals.|$|E
40|$|Characterization of {{asymptomatic}} KHV carriers {{may help}} understand virus transmission and storage. Such information allows farmers to minimize KHV on farms where this virus is present, also in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) monocultures. As asymptomatic KHV carriers, freshwater mollusks from the Unionidae family (<b>swan</b> <b>mussels,</b> Anodonta cygnea) and crustaceans from the Gammaridae family (scud, Gammarus pulex) were studied {{because of their}} unique method of feeding by accumulating bacterial and viral particles. The KHV genome was detected by nested PCR and confirmed by PCR recognizing the KHV glycoprotein gene in ORF 56 (KHV-U). Both PCR and nested PCR, which recognize the KHV thymidine kinase gene, always produced negative results in the <b>swan</b> <b>mussels</b> and scud samples...|$|R
25|$|Colliery pond {{was created}} when the National Coal Board {{constructed}} a concrete road to facilitate tipping. The road is concealed beneath {{the grass and}} acts as a dam. Water plants include water forget-me-not, bogbean and purple loosestrife. Large numbers of creatures are attracted to the pond, such as toads, moorhens, smooth newts, <b>swan</b> <b>mussels</b> plus varieties of damselfly and dragonfly.|$|R
50|$|The Aschau {{originates}} in Loher Ponds (Loher Teiche), artificially-created in the 1890s. These ponds are fed by a headstream, the Drellebach. In 1903 more ponds {{were added to}} the south and designated as the Aschau Ponds (Aschau Teiche). The entire area today consists of about 50 artificial ponds where trout, carp, tench, pike, ide, signal crayfish and noble crayfish are extensively farmed. The area is also a habitat for gudgeon, roach, stickleback, bitterling and <b>swan</b> <b>mussels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Species in the {{two groups}} vary greatly in size. Some of the pea clams (Pisidium species) have an adult size of only 3 mm. In contrast, one of the largest species of {{freshwater}} bivalves is the <b>swan</b> <b>mussel,</b> in the family Unionidae; it can grow to a length of 20 cm, and usually lives in lakes or slow rivers.|$|E
50|$|The sparse fauna {{before the}} {{dredging}} of the lake, after 1995 {{evolved into a}} pretty considerable variety of species typical for shallow lakes rich in nutrients. Two species of freshwater snails, Bithynia leachii and Gyraulus crista, were earlier considered as endangered. Noteworthy is also the population of several freshwater mussels, duck mussel and <b>swan</b> <b>mussel,</b> and Hippeutis complanatus, the latter two declining. A species of Oligochaeta new in Sweden {{has been reported in}} the lake just like did the rare hairy dragonfly. An inventory of dragonfly larvae in 2000 unveiled several other species (mostly red-eyed damselfly but also common blue damselfly, azure damselfly, variable damselfly, and northern damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum). Fish population reflects the shortage of oxygen with an absence of carp bream and silver bream and an abundance of perch, roach, and crucian carp dating back to before the dredging. The outlet forms a threshold for migrating species.|$|E
40|$|Heavy metals are {{the most}} {{important}} pollutants in aquatic ecosystems that may cause adverse effects on its biota. In this study, histopathological effects of zinc (Zn) and their incidence time on <b>swan</b> <b>mussel,</b> Anodonta cygnea, were studied. Exposure to Zn was done during 18 days and histopathological investigations were conducted in mantle, digestive gland and foot in days 0, 4, 9, and 18. Histopathological changes observed were: damages of epithelium cells with increasing mucous cells (in mantle), atrophy of digestive tubules and haemocyte aggregation (in digestive gland), and hypoplasia, increasing mucous cells and myocyte swelling (in foot). Moreover, granuloma and tissue rupture were found in all organs. Primary histopathological changes were observed in fourth day of examination in all of studied organs. Results showed that sensitivity of digestive gland is lesser than mantle and foot in exposure to Zn. Also the results indicated the histopathological alterations in the organs of <b>swan</b> <b>mussel</b> can be considered as reliable biomarkers in biomonitoring of heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on almost}} 80, 000 records for Ireland, 150 native species of non-marine mollusc are {{evaluated}} for their conservation status using International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria (IUCN, 2001, 2003). Two {{are considered to}} be regionally extinct, five critically endangered, fourteen endangered, twenty-six vulnerable, six near threatened, and the rest of least concern, or data deficient. Ireland’s non-marine molluscan fauna is of international importance. Ten species have populations of significant international worth, having large proportions of their global population in Ireland. Ashfordia granulata and Leisotyla anglica are two examples of such species; both are near endemics to Britain and Ireland, with Ireland having at least a fifth of their global populations. Seven species have been listed on the global IUCN red list, for example Myxas glutinosa and Quickella arenaria, both of which are endangered species in Ireland. Six species are legally protected under European legislation. Of these legally protected species, only the Kerry slug, Geomalacus maculosus, is not considered threatened in Ireland. However, the Irish population of this species is of particular international importance as the species is restricted to south-west Ireland and northern Iberia, and the Iberian populations are severely threatened. Some species are rare in Ireland as they are at the edge of their range or climatic tolerances (e. g. Pomatias elegans). For species that are declining in Ireland there are multiple drivers of population loss. Species declines are primarily driven by habitat loss (e. g. loss of marginal agricultural wetlands through drainage impacting species such as Vertigo antivertigo), habitat change (e. g. reduced water quality impacting species such as Pisidium pseudosphaerium and Margaritifera margaritifera) and habitat management (e. g. woodland management practices impacting species such as Spermodea lamellata). To a lesser extent species may be declining due to climate change (e. g. Pisidium conventus, a cold, deep water, montane species) and the impact of invasive species (Anodonta cygnea and A. anatina, the <b>swan</b> and duck <b>mussels,</b> are being severely impacted by the invasive species Dreissena polymorpha, the zebra mussel). The importance of water quality and the reduction of habitat loss and change across a spectrum of habitats are identified as important components in conserving the non-marine molluscan fauna on the island of Ireland...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{occurrence}} of the Chinese mussel Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea) was discovered in June and July 2011 in a fish pond located about 15 km north-west of Rzeszów (Subcarpathian region). Thirty six specimens (6 dead and 30 live) of the species were found. The Chinese mussel was absent in two other fish ponds in the same area, however the <b>swan</b> <b>mussel</b> Anodonta cygnea (L.) was found in these ponds (80 individuals: 45 dead and 35 live). At {{the time when the}} survey was conducted the ponds had already been drained for 3 to 8 months, so both populations will probably disappear from the locality. Nevertheless the new finding of the Chinese mussel in fish ponds confirms the possibility of {{occurrence of}} the species also in the waters with natu-ral thermal regime...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the abundance and composition of bacteria in the digestive system {{of a total of}} 35 specimens, including bivalve molluscs, i. e. <b>swan</b> <b>mussel</b> Anodonta cygnea (Linnaeus, 1758) from Lake Spėra (Širvintos district) and swollen river mussel Unio tumidus (Philipson, 1788) from the Curonian Lagoon near Juodkrantė, zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) from the Curonian Lagoon near Juodkrantė and an anostracan – Chirocephalus josephinae (Grube, 1853) from a pond in Ilčiukai village, Utena district, and in the water of related water bodies. Studies on bivalve molluscs (<b>swan</b> <b>mussel</b> and swollen river mussel), zebra mussel and an anostracan – Chirocephalus josephinae, as well as microbiological investigation of water demonstrated that the number of microorganisms in the digestive system of mollusc and anostracan species fluctuated and varied between different species and water bodies. The greatest percentage of HDB among total heterotrophic bacteria was found in the digestive system of swollen river mussels (21. 53 %) and in zebra mussels (19. 99 %) caught in the Curonian Lagoon and in the water of the lagoon (24 %). A considerably smaller percentage of HDB was detected in the digestive system of swan mussels from Lake Spėra (17. 6 %) and in the water of the lake (16. 66 %). The smallest percentage of HDB was found in the digestive system of Chirocephalus josephinae (6. 63 %) and in the water of the Ilčiukai pond (2. 72 %). According to the values of abundance of petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (HDB) and total coliform bacteria (TCFB) in the digestive system of aquatic organisms we can state that the water ecosystem of Ilčiukai pond was the least contaminated with petroleum, its products and sewage water, and the Curonian Lagoon water ecosystem was the most contaminated. Abundance of petroleum hydrocarbons degrading bacteria {{could be used as a}} bioindicator reflecting the level of ecosystem pollution petroleum and its products. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on anatomy and {{implementation}} of dissections of 4 selected model invertebrates in school practice. The selected model species include <b>swan</b> <b>mussel</b> (Anodonta cygnea), stick insect (Medauroidea extradentata), cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha) and sea urchin (Echinus esculentus). In case of the cockchafer, the text is based on this model species, but the supporting photographs of dissection are taken from the tropical cetoniid beetle Pachnoda, which has very similar internal anatomy with the cockchafer. For all selected animals, I describe external and internal morphology as well as recommended methods of obtaining the material, proper killing of specimens, and dissection techniques. The text is supplemented with original digital macrophotographs. The thesis includes also an overview of primary and secondary school textbooks with focus on anatomy of the selected animals. The text is supplemented by a glossary of morphological terminology used in this thesis. Attached is a photographic atlas of dissections, which {{is a combination of}} this master thesis and my bachelor thesis (defended in 2010), in which I dealt with five model invertebrates in the same way. This is Ascaris suum, Lumbricus terrestris, Helix pomatia, Procambarus aff. fallax and Archimandrita tesselata. The complete [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Larvae of the {{freshwater}} <b>swan</b> <b>mussel,</b> Anodonta cygnea, were cultured in artificial {{media at}} the controlled temperature of 231721 C, with successful metamorphosis {{for the first}} time. The artificial medium contained a mixture of M 199, common carp plasma, and anti-biotics/antimycotics. Glochidia were reared to the juvenile stage in the medium after 10 – 11 d of culture. After 15 d of controlled feeding with phytoplankton, the juveniles showed an elongated shell with several growth lines. Larval survival was 34. 379. 3 %, whereas the pro-portion undergoing metamorphosis wasr 60. 874. 2 %. The ultrastructure of early develop-mental stages was observed by scanning electron microscopy, from the glochidial to the juvenile stage. Glochidia had a hooked shell, with two equal triangular valves formed by a calcareous layer with numerous pores and covered by a thin cuticle of chitin–keratin. The appearance of the complete foot within 11 d of in vitro culture was considered the final feature of metamorphosis to the juvenile stage. The main alteration during juvenile development was the formation, under the glochidial shell, of a new periostracum with growth lines. The prominent foot, gradually covered by long, dense cilia, showed rhythmical movements in-volved in the capture of particulate matter. Similarly, cilia andmicrovilli present in the mantl...|$|E
40|$|Electron {{backscatter}} diffraction is used {{to characterize}} the transition interface between aragonite prisms and nacre in two species of freshwater molluscs, Anodonta anatina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Anodonta cygnea (L. 1758). In the duck mussel, Anodonta anatina, the shell thickness is comprised mainly of nacre with only a thin outer prismatic layer, whereas in the <b>swan</b> <b>mussel,</b> A. cygnea, the shell comprises a greater thickness of aragonite prisms relative to the nacreous layer. In A. anatina, the prism−nacre interface is flat and featureless. In A. cygnea, the nacre below {{the base of the}} prisms is characterized by distinct concave footholds. In both species, the c-axis of aragonite nanogranules comprising the prisms is parallel with the prism length. This crystallographic orientation, with the c-axis perpendicular to the shell exterior, occurs in the nacreous layer and thus is conserved throughout the shell thickness. In A. cygnea alternate prisms have a crystallographic orientation with the c-axis deviating from the prism long axis by approximately 20 deg. The initial nacreous layer adopts the crystallographic orientation of the preceding prisms and subsequent nacreous laminae are oriented in register with the bulk nacre. This is consistent with the hypothesis that nacre evolved through horizontal partitioning of prisms. ...|$|E
40|$|Silver Lake (―Silbersee‖) is {{situated}} in the sandy Saalian moraine landscape east of Bremerhaven (Northern Germany), is about 8. 0 m deep, and covers approximately 6. 5 hectares. The lake is a nature reserve but, a part is nevertheless used for bathing and angling. In {{order to understand the}} water and sediment chemistry of the lake water samples were collected monthly from three different sites, while sediment samples were collected once from three other sites in the central deep area of the lake. During the summer, surface water is warmer than the bottom water, thus a thermocline with steep temperature changes is created. Water analysis indicated that P and N concentrations are too high to classify the lake as ―oligotrophic‖ as it was in former times. This is further supported by the oxygen depletion in the deep water body during summer. The pH of the lake water is weakly acidic (about 6. 5). The source of the water is only precipitation, and almost no water comes from outside the lake. Even in shallow waters the brownish colorations of the water and its increased turbidity by phytoplankton provide light conditions that are disadvantageous to rare primary plants of the Littorelletea-community with the exclusive occurrence of Isoetes lacustris in Lower Saxonia (northwestern Germany). These plants are further endangered by the accelerated eutrophication process reflected in the increased competition of the emergent vegetation as well the coverage (overgrowth) by filamentous algae. Sediment analyses indicate that C, N and P contents are high in the near-the-surface layer but decline downwards in the sediment. The sediments are to be regarded as potential sources especially of P for the water nutrient regime. To evaluate the effect of filter-feeding bivalves on water quality, measurements were taken to estimate the respiration and ingestion rates of the <b>swan</b> <b>mussel</b> Anodonta cygnea, which is now abundant in Silver Lake. The result of the respiration rate experiment had a low, stable rate at about 3. 07 mg O 2 d- 1 per average individual at a temperature of 10 °C and ingestion rates were calculated at 47. 5 μg Chl-a d- 1. They can ingest only 1. 9...|$|E
40|$|Chapter One {{describes}} {{nitrogen and}} phosphorus species in the aquatic environment, their role in eutrophication, current legislation relevant to nutrient water quality and catchment management {{and the role of}} predictive modelling of nutrient export with respect to the management of river catchments. It also summarises analytical techniques for the determination of {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} species in natural waters and the use of generic ecotoxicological assays to link nutrient water quality and organism health. Data integrity is essential to biogeochemical studies that inform scientific research and environmental management. Reliable, accurate data permit valid conclusions to be drawn. The quality assurance and quality control measures undertaken to ensure good analytical data in this study, including participation in the certification of a seawater certified reference material for nutrients (MOOS- 1), are discussed in Chapter Two. In Chapter Three, the nutrient biogeochemistry of the waters leaving the Tamar catchment and entering the Tamar estuary is discussed. Historical nutrient and physico-chemical data for the Tamar River at Gunnislake were used to identify long-term environmental trends (1974 to 2004) and nutrient and physico-chemical data collected in this study between May 2003 and May 2004 was used to identify short-term trends over the study period. The nutrient export coefficient modelling approach was used to model phosphorus and nitrogen export from the Tamar catchment (Chapter Four). A TP export model from the Tamar catchment was successfully constructed using historical land use data and catchment demographics, calibrated with hindcasted water quality data, and validated with TP field data (May 2003 and May 2004) collected in this study. Modelled P (43. 5 tonnes P yˉ¹) export agreed within 8 % with the measured P load (40. 1 tonnes P yˉ¹). An annual TN model was also constructed and calibrated for the Tamar catchment using the May 2003 to May 2004 field data. The calibrated model agreed within I % of the measured TN export (2053 tonnes N yˉ¹). The development and deployment of a portable Fl analyser for continuous, real-time monitoring of FRP in the Tamar catchment is discussed in Chapter Five. The optimised method can be used for the determination of FRP in freshwater systems (4 - 150 µg Lˉ¹ P) and in coastal waters (10 - 150 µg Lˉ¹ P) and is capable of sampling with high temporal resolution (up to 15 samples hˉ¹). The analyser was used in situ (bank-side and shipboard deployment) to provide real-time FRP data and in the laboratory to determine FRP in freshwater samples. All data were in good agreement with values obtained using a validated air-segmented, continuous flow laboratory reference method The acute toxicity of nitrate and nitrite on the freshwater <b>swan</b> <b>mussel,</b> Anodonta cygnea, was investigated (Chapter Six). A 96 h LC 50 value of 222 mg Lˉ¹ N for the exposure of A. cygnea to nitrite was established in this study. Toxicity studies indicated that nitrate was not toxic to A. cygnea. Established indicators of physiological stress were used to determine the effect of environmentally high and extreme levels of nitrite on A. cygnea. There {{was no significant difference in}} cardiac activity, condition index or lysosomal stability between control organisms (0 mg Lˉ¹ N) and organisms exposed to sub-lethal nitrite concentrations (0. 1, 1. 0, 22. 2 mg Lˉ¹ N). Therefore, nitrite concentrations encountered in typical freshwater catchments such as the Tamar catchment are unlikely to induce physiological stress in A. cygnea.
