5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on the gay community. A very <b>strong</b> <b>voice</b> in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the gay community itself.|$|E

5|$|The Missing Link {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Destructoid's Maurice Tan enjoyed the story despite it not adding {{anything to the}} overall experience of Human Revolution and noted that the major choices lacked impact. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more to plug the main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive moments and <b>strong</b> <b>voice</b> acting. Official Xbox Magazines Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found the plot undermined by the villain and some poor dialogue. Tom Francis of PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the story as a whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Having {{overcome}} {{the disadvantage of}} providing its own financing, the Lutheran Hour was now the largest religious broadcast in radio. But the Federal Council sought to end all such endeavours, allowing no viewpoint except its own. Championing the cause of religious freedom and freedom of speech, Maier was a <b>strong</b> <b>voice</b> against such “totalitarian tendencies.” As portrayed in a 1938 article by Time magazine, Maier’s pulpit helped to preserve the heritage of liberty enjoyed by citizens of the United States.|$|E
25|$|The shanty genre was {{typified by}} {{flexible}} lyrical forms, which in practice provided for much improvisation {{and the ability}} to lengthen or shorten a song to match the circumstances. Its hallmark was call and response, performed between a soloist {{and the rest of the}} workers in chorus. The leader, called the shantyman, was appreciated for his piquant language, lyrical wit, and <b>strong</b> <b>voice.</b> Shanties were sung without instrumental accompaniment and, historically speaking, they were only sung in work-based rather than entertainment-oriented contexts. Although most prominent in English, shanties have been created in or translated into other European languages.|$|E

25|$|However, Mayer {{has written}} that it was {{precisely}} unions' opposition to NAFTA overall that jeopardized organized labor's ability to influence the debate on labor standards in a significant way.

Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade representative, had strong ties to organized labor and believed that he could get unions to come along with the agreement, particularly if they were given a <b>strong</b> <b>voice</b> in the negotiation process.|$|E

Other contenders included Mrs Uche Ekwunife, Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu and many others. Altogether, there were twenty-five contestants for the office. Peter Obi was named the winner of the election, with more than 30% votes above the immediate runner-up. Presently, chief Willie Obiano was sworn in on the 17th of March, 2014 as the new governor after the expiration of the Peter Obi second term, having won the November 16th, 2013 election.|$|E
25|$|The {{interview}} {{and the book}} caused critics to accuse him of hypocrisy for having hidden this part of his past, while simultaneously being a <b>strong</b> <b>voice</b> for ethics and morality in the public debate. The book itself was also praised for its depictions of the German postwar generation and the social and moral development of a nation burdened simultaneously by destruction and {{a deep sense of}} guilt. Throughout the memoir Grass plays with the frailty of memory, for which the layers of the onion are a metaphor. Grass second-guesses his own memories, throws his own autobiographical statements into doubt and questions whether the person inhabiting his past was really him. This struggle with memory comes to represent the struggle of the German people during the same period with Germany's Nazi past.|$|E

25|$|Despite her {{multiple}} {{arrests and}} constant surveillance, civil disobedience is Ding Zilin’s daily choice, she never stops using {{her voice to}} speak out in non-violent ways against the {{violations of human rights}} committed by the Chinese government. On April 5, 2004 Time magazine said that Ding Zilin is “the symbolic leader for many people in China who want the government to account for its actions that night. She is a small woman with a <b>strong</b> <b>voice.</b> Her bereavement makes her powerful”. Author of Beijing Coma, Ma Jian also discusses her civil disobedience in a June 4, 2008 New York Times article. He describes how she will once again defy authorities and lay a memorial off Chang'an Avenue. He suggests “behind the bravado, the party is as fearful as a deer in the headlights,” of displays of support that show that despite government efforts to erase history many refuse to forget.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{she became}} one of four judges for the current hot show in Vietnam The Voice of Vietnam. Thu Minh truly found her {{explosive}} fame and success through her talented mentoring, a sane judgment and a sensible art instinct. Through each round, she proved strongly to be more brilliant with her mentoring position since Thu Minh's team is still anticipated {{to be at the}} top {{at the end of this}} year. She is claimed to be the most favourite judge by contestants and audiences due to her <b>strong</b> <b>voice</b> and notable experiences throughout the show. The reality show presented another aspects of Thu Minh in terms of bold multi-talent, being sensitive, loving, sincere, skillful and witty without aggressiveness. With tactful sanity from setting up the place – at the castle of Khai Silk – to directly mentoring and inviting selectively elite support from musician Nguyen Hai Phong and Vietnam's diva Hồng Nhung in order to fulfill all students with skillful and advantageous performance and tutorials, Thu Minh's team was expected to be a prosperous package of surprises and marvellous creativity each night.|$|E
25|$|Lowther {{first entered}} Parliament in 1865, as Member of Parliament for York. His maiden speech {{was against the}} Reform Bill of 1866, the failure of which brought down the {{ministry}} of Lord Russell. He also vehemently opposed the Reform Act 1867, brought forward by Disraeli and Lord Derby, but Disraeli nonetheless appointed him Parliamentary Secretary to the Poor Law Board the same year. He was a <b>strong</b> <b>voice</b> in the opposition to Gladstone, particularly to the Irish Land Bill of 1870. With the return to power of Disraeli in 1874, he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1878, he was further advanced to become Chief Secretary for Ireland and sworn of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and of Ireland. However, he was beset with difficulties during his tenure in the secretaryship. His opposition to the Land Bill was held against him, and he treated with contempt the agitation of the Land League, which would soon break out in the Land War. He went out of office with Disraeli's government in 1880, and lost his seat at York as well.|$|E

25|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to convince Cassie that his claims are sincere, Azazeal kills Thelma before Cassie's eyes as a sacrifice to increase his power and prove that he is truly who he says he is. This act has two unintentional consequences: his power over Cassie is initially weakened by the shock, and Thelma thereafter continues to share Cassie's room as a ghost that only Cassie, Azazeal and other ghosts can see. Thelma never forgives Azazeal for her own death, and is a <b>strong</b> <b>voice</b> against him to Cassie, who has grown to have feelings for him. Thelma is unable to touch the living, but she can touch other ghosts and presumably manipulate inanimate objects (including clothing, artifacts, books, doors, window sashes, and vending machines) and eat, which she does constantly (since ghosts cannot gain weight). Thelma works {{behind the scenes to}} spy on Azazeal and gather evidence from places where Cassie cannot enter. Cassie, while horrified by some of Azazeal's behaviour, ultimately finds herself drawn into his power. Azazeal possesses Cassie, and while under his power, she gives herself to him and they conceive a child.|$|E
25|$|Street {{performers}} {{existed in}} Japan {{for a long}} time. However, the connection with advertising forming a chindon'ya first appeared in Osaka during the 19th century (Late Edo period and early Meiji period) {{at the beginning of}} industrialization. The first known chindon'ya is generally considered to be a candy seller in Osaka named Amekatsu, who around 1845 used singing and a noise making toy to attract attention to his own portable candy stall, as many other salespeople, especially candy sellers. Due to his <b>strong</b> <b>voice</b> he was well known in Osaka, and hence tried to sell not candy but rather advertise for other stores and a theater, wearing a large hat and straw sandals, and small bells at his belt, and used a wooden hyogoshi noisemaker. He was succeeded by a former bath attendant Isamikame, who also used to shout tozai (Literally East-West, equivalent to Listen up or welcome (come one come all)). Subsequently, such advertising street performers were called tozaiya in Osaka up to World War II. He soon received competition from another advertiser called Matemoto, and they split their business, with one covering the Uemachi region and the other covering the Shinmachi region of Osaka. After Maemoto died in 1891, his brother, also called Maemoto took over the business, and he was soon joined by his son and daughter, probably the first female chindon'ya. Maemoto is also famous as being the first person in Osaka to die from electric shock in 1893. Other well-known performers from this time are Tanbataya Kurimaru, a former Sweet Chestnut seller, and Satsumaya Imosuke, a former bean seller. These two also occasionally added a second performer to their band.|$|E
