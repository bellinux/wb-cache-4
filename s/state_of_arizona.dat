5|$|There are 15 {{counties}} in the U.S. <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona.</b> Four counties (Mohave, Pima, Yavapai and Yuma) were created in 1864 following {{the organization of the}} Arizona Territory in 1862. The now defunct Pah-Ute County was split from Mohave County in 1865, but merged back in 1871. All but La Paz County were created by the time Arizona was granted statehood in 1912.|$|E

5|$|Arizona {{is a state}} {{located in}} the Western United States. There are 91 {{incorporated}} cities and towns in the U.S. <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona</b> as of 2010. Incorporated places in Arizona are {{those that have been}} granted home rule, possessing a local government {{in the form of a}} city or town council. The 2010 census put 5,021,810 of the state's 6,392,017 residents within these cities and towns, accounting for 78.56% of the population. Most of the population is concentrated within the Phoenix metropolitan area, with an 2010 census population of 4,192,887 (65.60% of the state population).|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} first filling of the reservoir, around 80 {{hairline}} cracks were observed in the dam's structure. The submerged spillway gates of the dam might pose a risk of cavitation, similar to that which severely damaged the poorly designed and cavitating spillways of the Glen Canyon Dam in the US <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona,</b> which was unable to properly withstand the Colorado river floods of 1983. However 163,000 concrete units of the Three Gorges dam all passed quality testing and the deformation was within design limits. An experts group gave the project overall a good quality rating.|$|E
5|$|On Election Day, Goldwater {{lost the}} {{election}} to Johnson by {{what was then the}} largest margin in history. Goldwater accumulated 52 electoral votes to Johnson's 486 and 39% of the popular vote (27,178,188) to Johnson's 61% (43,129,566). Goldwater carried six states: Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and his home <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona.</b> Goldwater's strong showing in the south is largely due to his support of the white southern view on civil rights: that states should be able to control their own laws without federal intervention.|$|E

It is the thirty-ninth most populous city in the United States and the third most populous city in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona</b> (after Phoenix and Tucson) according to 2010 United States Census Bureau estimates. It is the largest of seven incorporated areas with populations of 100,000 or more (followed by Glendale, Chandler, Scottsdale, Gilbert, Tempe and Peoria) that surround Phoenix in its metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, the Bureau of Reclamation and the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona</b> {{agreed on}} an {{alternative}} to Orme. This was known as Plan 6, and it recommended four projects: a reconstruction of the Stewart Mountain Dam, a new or larger Roosevelt Dam, the Cliff Dam on the Verde River and finally, the New Waddell Dam on the Agua Fria River (a tributary of the Gila River). On November 6, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt recommended Plan 6. In April 1984, it was approved {{with the exception of}} the Cliff Dam, which needed further study and would eventually be removed from CAP.|$|E
5|$|To {{encourage}} tourism, the town's leaders sought National Historic Landmark {{status for}} Jerome; it was {{granted by the}} federal government in 1967. In 1962, the heirs of James Douglas donated the Douglas mansion, above the UVX mine site, to the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona,</b> which used it to create Jerome State Historic Park. By sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community succeeded in attracting visitors and new businesses, which in the 21stcentury include art galleries, craft stores, wineries, coffee houses, and restaurants.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s the {{downtown}} area experienced a resurgence, {{with a level of}} construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. Originally, there were nine villages, but this has been expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The Phoenix Symphony Hall opened in 1972; other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the First National Bank Plaza, the Valley Center (the tallest building in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona)</b> and the Arizona Bank building.|$|E
5|$|Late in its duration, Hurricane Olivia brought {{increased}} moisture {{into the}} southwest United States. More than 2inches (50mm) of rainfall were reported across Arizona and New Mexico. Light precipitation was also reported in western Texas and southeastern California. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings throughout the region. Near Yuma, Arizona, thunderstorms caused three major power outages and produced flooding {{that resulted in}} the closure of a portion of U.S. Route 95. In Navajo and Pinal counties, the rainfall damaged roads, bridges, sewers, and homes, which amounted to about $250,000 in repair work for the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona.</b> The storm's moisture also produced locally heavy snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Most copper is mined or {{extracted}} as copper sulfides {{from large}} open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Sites include Chuquicamata in Chile, Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, United States and El Chino Mine in New Mexico, United States. According to the British Geological Survey in 2005, Chile {{was the top}} producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona</b> are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.|$|E
