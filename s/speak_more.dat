The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics.

5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other languages {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently <b>speak</b> <b>more</b> than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E

As she sits outside the hospital on a bench, Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again, but {{it turns out to be}} Mulder. Later, the two agents sit in Mulder's apartment talking about the events of the last few days. Mulder begins to <b>speak</b> <b>more</b> existentially about what transpired, implying that fate has brought them together but, when he turns to look at Scully, he sees that she has fallen asleep.|$|E
5|$|While {{some see}} {{speaking}} {{their native language}} as {{an important part of}} their identity, and can <b>speak</b> <b>more</b> fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by Alexander Stubb MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from €118,000 per day (for 21 languages then—Romanian, Bulgarian and Croatian having not yet been included) to €8,900 per day. Some see the ideal single language as being English due to its widespread usage, although there has been a small-scale campaign to make French the reference language for all legal texts, {{due to the fact that}} it is more clear and precise for legal purposes.|$|E

25|$|Two {{languages}} are official and widely used today in Galicia: the native Galician, a Romance language {{closely related to}} Portuguese, with which it shares Galician-Portuguese medieval literature, and the Spanish language, usually known locally as Castilian. 56% of the Galician population speak Galician as their first language, while 43% <b>speak</b> <b>more</b> in Castilian.|$|E
25|$|In any case, implant-supported {{dentures}} {{have several}} advantages over conventional dentures. They offer improved comfort due to less irritation of the gums, confidence due to less risk of slipping out, and appearance due to less plastic required for retention purposes.

25|$|An {{independent}} census {{has yet to}} be conducted, but the Tigrinya {{people make}} up about 55% and Tigre people make up about 30% of the population. A majority of these ethnic groups belong to Afroasiatic-speaking communities of the Cushitic branch, such as the Saho, Hedareb, Afar and Bilen. There are also a number of Nilotic ethnic minorities, who are represented in Eritrea by the Kunama and Nara. Each ethnicity speaks a different native tongue but, typically, many of the minorities <b>speak</b> <b>more</b> than one language.|$|E

25|$|The defense {{tried to}} get {{surviving}} members of the crew to admit they were in Kentucky only to photograph poor people, asking if they intended to photograph more prosperous parts of the state. The defense also {{wanted to know how}} much money they had been paid from the filming. Ison's lawyer used his closing statement to <b>speak</b> <b>more</b> about the intrusiveness of reporters than his client's actions. Nevertheless, the only legal issue was Ison's sanity. A psychiatrist testifying for the defense identified Ison as a paranoid schizophrenic, but a prosecution psychiatrist contradicted this.|$|E

She sent a {{security}} expert to eyewitness that Gordon had not faked his death a second time. In 2005 she appeared on ABC News to recant her previous allegations and defend brother Michael against new charges of child abuse. VH1 described Jackson {{as a role model}} having weathered various successes and setbacks. The perception of Jackson as an underdog and her support for LGBT rights has led her to be declared a gay icon.|$|E
25|$|The Isleños in Louisiana make up four {{communities}} that speak dialects of Spanish, {{these include the}} Isleños of Saint Bernard Parish who have managed to preserve their culture {{as well as their}} dialect of Canarian Spanish, although none of the younger generation <b>speak</b> <b>more</b> than a few words; the Brulis, who live in scattered households in southern Louisiana and speak a dialect with French loan words; and the Adaeseños in the Natchitoches and Sabine parishes who speak a very similar dialect with loan words from the Nahuatl language of Mexico. The Isleño communities of Saint Bernard parish have also preserved the Spanish Canarian dialect spoken from the 18th century to present times, although it is in danger of dying out with the last speakers among the elderly segment of the population.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the early}} work using {{statistical}} learning paradigms focused on the ability for children or adults to learn a single language, consistent {{with the process of}} language acquisition for monolingual speakers or learners. However, it is estimated that approximately 60-75% of people in the world are bilingual. More recently, researchers have begun looking at the role of statistical learning for those who <b>speak</b> <b>more</b> than one language. Although there are no reviews on this topic yet, Weiss, Gerfen, and Mitchel examined how hearing input from multiple artificial languages simultaneously can affect the ability to learn either or both languages. Over four experiments, Weiss et al. found that, after exposure to two artificial languages, adult learners are capable of determining word boundaries in both languages when each language is spoken by a different speaker. However, when the two languages were spoken by the same speaker, participants were able learn both languages only when they were “congruent”—when the word boundaries of one language matched the word boundaries of the other. When the languages were incongruent—a syllable that appeared {{in the middle of a}} word in one language appeared at the end of the word in the other language—and spoken by a single speaker, participants were able to learn, at best, one of the two languages. A final experiment showed that the inability to learn incongruent languages spoken in the same voice was not due to syllable overlap between the languages but due to differing word boundaries.|$|E

Despite the talk of Lennon being working class—as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—he later refuted the idea by saying, [...] "I was a nice clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our own garden. They didn't have anything like that".|$|E

500|$|Carson {{then moved}} to the factual {{evidence}} and questioned Wilde about his acquaintances with younger, lower-class men. Wilde admitted being {{on a first-name basis}} and lavishing gifts upon them, but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that the men were merely good friends of his. Carson repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of these relationships and insinuated that the men were prostitutes. Wilde replied that he did not believe in social barriers, and simply enjoyed the society of young men. Then Carson asked Wilde directly whether he had ever kissed a certain servant boy, Wilde responded, [...] "Oh, dear no. He was a particularly plain boy– unfortunately ugly– I pitied him for it." [...] Carson pressed him on the answer, repeatedly asking why the boy's ugliness was relevant. Wilde hesitated, then for the first time became flustered: [...] "You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to <b>speak</b> <b>more</b> seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{prominent}} example of globalization {{in the first}} world is the European Union (EU). The European Union is an agreement in which countries voluntarily decide to build common governmental institutions to which they delegate some individual national sovereignty so that decisions can be made democratically on a higher level of common interest for Europe as a whole. The result is a union of 28 Member States covering [...] with roughly half a billion people. In total, the European Union produces almost a third of the world’s gross national product and the member states <b>speak</b> <b>more</b> than 23 languages. All of the European Union countries are joined together by a hope to promote and extend peace, democracy, cooperativeness, stability, prosperity, and the rule of law. In a 2007 speech, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European Commissioner for External Relations, said herself: [...] "The future of the EU is linked to globalization...the EU has a crucial role to play in making globalization work properly...". In a 2014 speech at the European Parliament, the Italian PM Matteo Renzi said: [...] "we are the ones who can bring civilization to globalization".|$|E
