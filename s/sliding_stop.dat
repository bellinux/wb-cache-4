2500|$|Reining - {{considered}} by some the [...] "dressage" [...] of the western riding world, with FEI-recognized status as a new international discipline at the World Equestrian Games, reining requires horse and rider to perform a precise pattern consisting of circles at a lope and gallop with flying changes of lead, rapid [...] "spins" [...] (a turn in one spot on the haunches), [...] "rollbacks" [...] (a rapid turn immediately followed by a gallop in the opposite direction) and the crowd-pleasing <b>sliding</b> <b>stop</b> (executed from a full gallop).|$|E

50|$|On most designs, {{once the}} {{magazine}} and chamber both are empty, the slide will lock back, released only when the <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> is depressed; if a new magazine is inserted before the <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> is depressed then a new cartridge will be chambered.|$|R
50|$|The US Army's first {{instructional}} manual {{on the use}} of the Model 1911 pistol specifically mentions it, but in {{a cautionary}} way due to the design of the <b>slide</b> <b>stop.</b> The <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> pin protrudes out from the right side of the pistol, and if depressed when the gun is fired, the M1911 can jam.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: A proper <b>sliding</b> <b>stop</b> {{requires}} a horse {{to keep its}} head down, back rounded, hindquarters well underneath the body, and to [...] "walk" [...] with the front legs as the hind legs slide.|$|E
50|$|Walther {{modified}} the <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> lever and an accompanying spring on the PPS pistols to improve reliability. Early PPS pistols {{can be modified}} but need an enlargement of {{a hole in the}} pistol gripframe before the new style <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> and spring can be installed. For this the pistol has to be sent in to the Walther customer service.|$|R
50|$|The FNS {{series of}} the pistols all include ambidextrous {{magazine}} releases, and <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> release levers.|$|R
50|$|The USP is {{composed}} {{of a total of}} 54 parts and is broken down into 7 major components for maintenance and cleaning: the barrel, slide, recoil spring, recoil spring guide rod, the frame, <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> and magazine. This is done by retracting the slide back to align the <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> axis pin with the disassembly notch {{on the left side of}} the slide and withdrawing the axis pin.|$|R
50|$|Rollback: {{the horse}} immediately, without hesitation, {{performs}} a 180-degree turn after halting from a <b>sliding</b> <b>stop,</b> and immediately goes forward again into a lope. The horse must turn on its hindquarters, bringing its hocks well under, and the motion should be continuous with no hesitation.|$|E
5000|$|Rundown: {{the horse}} gallops or [...] "runs" [...] along the long {{side of the}} arena, at least 20 ft from the fence or rail. A rundown is a {{required}} movement prior to a <b>sliding</b> <b>stop</b> and a rollback to the designated direction (either towards the judge or towards the nearest wall depending on the pattern).|$|E
50|$|Skid {{boots are}} used to protect a horse's hind legs during {{exercise}} and competition, protecting the fetlocks, pasterns, {{and other parts of}} the lower leg from injury that may occur from a <b>sliding</b> <b>stop.</b> Taller varieties may also provide protection if one leg or hoof strikes the opposite leg. They are commonly seen on horses in western riding sports such as cutting, reining and other events where quick stops and fact turns on the hindquarters may be required.|$|E

50|$|Reining may be {{performed}} by any horse, but the Stock horse breeds, particularly the American Quarter Horse, dominate the field. The reining horse must be agile, quick, and very responsive to the rider's commands. Powerful hindquarters are required to hold position in a <b>sliding</b> <b>stop</b> or a rollback, excellent coordination is required for proper spins and flying lead changes. Correct leg conformation is essential, as the limbs and joints are often under considerable stress in competition. The horse must also have an excellent temperament to perform with both speed and precision.|$|E
50|$|Reining {{horses are}} usually fitted with special horseshoes on the hind feet called slide plates. Slide plates have wider bar steel and are {{smoother}} than regular horseshoes, with even the nail heads filed to {{be flush with}} the shoe. When the horse plants its hind feet for a <b>sliding</b> <b>stop,</b> the shoes allow the hind legs to slide along the ground with less resistance. Slide plates often have long trailers to help the horse's hind legs slide in a straight path {{as well as a}} rolled toe so that the front of the hoof does not accidentally catch the ground.|$|E
50|$|The {{overall design}} is {{slightly}} different from earlier SIG Sauer pistols such as P220 or P226, {{as there is}} no separate disassembly lever on the frame and the <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> lever looks quite different.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{replacement}} for the M1934/5 in Beretta's compact/medium pistol line, the Model 70 integrated the M1951's takedown lever, guide rod system, <b>slide</b> <b>stop,</b> and magazine release button in {{the lower part of}} the grip. The M1934/5 would hold open on empty due to the magazine follower blocking the slide, but removing the magazine would cause the slide to be released unless its safety was subsequently engaged (which would lock the gun open until switched back to Fire mode); this process was slow and cumbersome, which is why the <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> improvement was implemented in the M1951 and later models of service pistols. [...] The <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> changed partway through the production run of the pistol from the same [...] "pedal" [...] style release as the M1951 to a round button at the end of the lever. A softer, longer curve that tapered up to the front of the gun was also added to make the trigger guard more sleek. Near the end of its production, the same thumb shelf of the 76W's left grip panel was added to the 70S.|$|R
25|$|The Glock 17 feeds from staggered-column or {{double stack}} {{magazines}} {{that have a}} 17-round capacity (which can be extended to 19 with an optional floor plate) or optional 33-round high-capacity magazines. For jurisdictions which restrict magazine capacity to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the <b>slide</b> <b>stop.</b> The <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> release lever {{is located on the}} left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.|$|R
50|$|In {{the bottom}} of the 7th, Moustakas reached base on a broken bat blooper to center-field. Salvador Pérez next hit a deep fly ball to left field. Left fielder Ben Revere then one-upped Moustakas’ earlier catch with a leaping catch {{at the top of the}} left-field wall. Revere then tried to double up Moustakas at 1st, but Moustakas got back in time to leave it at one out. Ryan Goins then kept the good defense going by making a <b>sliding</b> <b>stop</b> on a hard Alex Gordon {{grounder}} to get Gordon out at 1st, to make it two outs, but Moustakas reached 2nd on the play. At this point David Price was taken out of the game in favor of right hander Aaron Sanchez to face Alex Ríos. On a 1-2 pitch, Rios hammered a ball to left field for a single that drove in Moustakas to give Kansas City a 3-1 lead.|$|E
40|$|The <b>sliding</b> <b>stop</b> {{method of}} fielding in cricket is gaining {{popularity}} {{in schools and}} club cricket through its frequent exposure on television. The case history is reported of a cricketer who suffered a torn medial meniscus in his knee, a rare cricketing injury, while performing this technique incorrectly in a club game. The correct method of performing the technique is described in coaching manuals but is not commonly instructed at club or school level. The <b>sliding</b> <b>stop</b> should be discouraged in school and for club cricketers unless appropriately coached...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{deals with}} the {{utilization}} of the finite element method (FEM) in development of computational model. Subject of the computational model is the <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> pin of the pistol CZ 75, designed and manufactured in Czech Republic by Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod. The computational model describes strain stress analysis of the <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> pin. The results of the analysis are subject to difficult sourcing of relevant and reliable input information. Based on stress strain analysis results, the safety factor of the pin was determined. However, the results are influenced a lot by input parameters selection. At the conclusion the summary of proposed further steps for computational model accuracy increase is proposed...|$|R

50|$|The PSM is a blowback-operated handgun with a {{double-action}} {{trigger and}} slide-mounted manual safety without a <b>slide</b> <b>stop.</b> The grip panels {{are made from}} thin aluminum and new model with hard plastic. The weapon is made from steel.|$|R
50|$|Colt resumed {{production}} of the Woodsman in 1947. The three Models remained the same, but were built on a longer heavier frame and had a magazine safety, automatic <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> and magazine release located {{at the rear of}} the trigger guard.|$|R
50|$|The trigger {{should be}} pulled with the {{forefinger}}. If the trigger is pulled {{with the second}} finger, the forefinger extending {{along the side of}} the receiver is apt to press against the projecting pin of the <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> and cause a jam when the slide recoils.|$|R
50|$|A <b>slide</b> <b>stop,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as a slide lock or (dubiously) a slide release on a semi-automatic handgun is a function that visually indicates when a handgun has expended all loaded ammunition and facilitates faster re-loading by pulling back the slide to advance the first round of a new magazine.|$|R
50|$|Field {{stripping}} {{is accomplished}} by locking the slide to the rear, rotating the takedown lever clockwise ninety degrees and releasing the <b>slide</b> <b>stop</b> while carefully allowing the slide to be pushed forward out of the frame. The barrel and recoil spring then separate from the slide to complete the disassembly procedure.|$|R
