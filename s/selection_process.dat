In the USA, the tests include the American Mathematics Competitions, the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, and the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, each of which is a competition in its own right.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} academic <b>selection</b> <b>processes,</b> socioeconomic factors, and school resources on the distribution and level {{of knowledge and skills}} of 15 -year old students in countries that participated in the 2000 cycle of the OECD’s Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). It does so by estimating a parsimonious model of educational performance at the country-level and expands on the findings with an analysis of subnational results in Germany and Canada. Academic <b>selection</b> <b>processes</b> segregate students into separate and distinct programs that are often closely linked to labor markets.
