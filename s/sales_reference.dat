I devised the name as a shorthand sales term.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of endogenously driven multi-attribute reference effects in a revenue management setting based on data of individual level purchases over a series of concert perfor-mances. The reference dependence that drives consumer choice is not only based on the price but also on observed sales (as {{a fraction of the}} seating capacity). We show that consumers set their own internal price and <b>sales</b> <b>reference</b> levels through observations during their past visits. We find that consumers also suffer from loss aversion on both prices and seats sold: consumers incur significant utility loss when prices are above their references or when the actual seat sales are lower than their references. We provide insights into pricing policies that can address con-sumer decisions driven by multi-attribute reference dependence and loss aversion. We show it may be better to discount prices for sections with high sales than sections with low sales par-ticularly for concerts with relatively low sales. Overall event popularity dampens loss aversion on seat sales, but reference-dependent behavior persists...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we support}} the {{argument}} that {{a focus on the}} spatiality of economic mechanisms can be a valuable way {{to address the issue of}} inter-urban housing markets, a theme which has not yet been adequately addressed by academic research. Our developments are based on a theoretical framework in which two factors are considered central to the structuring of markets: (i) the possibility for the demand to choose between substitutable supplies (spatially related to the territory prospected by the demand), and (ii) the availability of information on the state of the market (spatially related to the use of local <b>sales</b> <b>references</b> when market participants prepare their negotiations). This theoretical framework is empirically applied to the case of building sites prepared for self-provided housing, with a modelling methodology elaborated for Belgium. The modelling methodology, based on cross-sectional regressions, develops a spatial autoregressive specification and incorporates a multi-scale comparison. By highlighting the importance of information and demand substitutability, this exercise confirms that a focus on inter-urban market spatiality can be helpful to housing researchers. In fact, our results suggest that such a focus is particularly appropriate to analysing the impact of planning regulations on market outcomes. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Other plantations included George Richard Lee Turberville's [...] "Leeton Grove" [...] (originally a 5,000+ acre plantation, the main house of which still stands at 4619 Walney Rd.), the John Hutchison Farm, and the Chantilly Plantation, after which Chantilly is named. Cornelia Lee Turberville Stuart, who was born at Leeton and was the daughter of George Richard Lee Turberville and Henrietta Lee, inherited a portion of Leeton in 1817 from her father. Stuart and her husband Charles Calvert Stuart, whom she had married in 1816, constructed the Chantilly Plantation and named it after the Westmoreland County plantation owned by her grandfather, Richard Henry Lee, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. During the Civil War, federal troops destroyed by fire the Chantilly Plantation manor house. One building remains, a stone house across Route 50 from the Greenbriar Shopping Center. While {{it is not clear what}} this stone house was used for, most historical evidence suggests it was probably a plantation overseer's quarters during the antebellum period, and a tavern or boarding house following the war.

Especially, integrated marketing communication (IMC) and customer-oriented approach are universally regarded fundamental developments {{in the field of}} marketing. Secondly, Finnish companies’ marketing competences are commonly considered insufficient in general. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe how Finnish industrial companies execute their marketing communication. In addition, the study examines the marketing communication’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, and targets for development; how different marketing communication instruments are utilised; and how marketing communication and its instruments are integrated. The study was executed with action-oriented research method and used research strategy was case study. Hence, empirical part of this study focused to examine marketing communication in six Finnish industrial companies. Empirical data of the study was gathered within six individual workshops organised for each case company during the research process. According to the study’s results, Finnish industrial companies brands and images are strong, and they are highly appreciated actors in their own field of business. The most commonly utilised marketing communication instruments are personal selling, trade shows, public relations, e-communication, and direct marketing. Whereas advertising, sales promotion, sponsoring, after <b>sales,</b> <b>references,</b> and word of mouth communication are not equally commonly utilised. Secondly, Finnish industrial companies’ marketing communication is not integrated, they have deficiencies with their internal communication and co-operation, marketing strategies are unclear, marketing resources are rather small, and status of marketing is weak. In addition to these findings, the study offers a research model of development process toward integrated marketing communication as a contribution for academic research...|$|R

40|$|When {{calibrating}} spatial partial equilibrium {{models with}} conjectural variations, some modelers fit the suppliers' {{sales to the}} available data in addition to total consumption and price levels. While this certainly enhances {{the quality of the}} calibration, it makes it difficult to accommodate user-imposed bounds on the model parameters such as restricting the market power parameters to the interval [0, 1], which is a common requirement in conjectural variations approaches. We propose an algorithm to calibrate the suppliers' sales and simultaneously deal with user-defined bounds on parameters. To this end, we fix the suppliers' <b>sales</b> at <b>reference</b> values and obtain the marginal costs for each supplier and market. We then limit the market power parameters to the interval [0, 1], and calculate intervals of anchor prices and price elasticities that reproduce the <b>reference</b> supplier <b>sales</b> in the state of equilibrium. If these intervals do not contain the reference price elasticities and prices, we face a mismatch between reality and the model mechanics. We resolve this by altering the <b>reference</b> <b>sales</b> for the critical suppliers, and iterate. Thereby, the user controls whether price elasticities and anchor prices should be close to their reference values, or the suppliers' sales. The algorithm is tested on data from the European gas market, and required less than one minute to identify calibrated parameters. Our algorithm is widely applicable, since it is based on mild (and common) underlying assumptions and can be configured to suit a specific purpose thanks to the inclusion of user-defined bounds on all relevant parameters...|$|R

Challenges speci¯c to that environment include very short product life-cycles, and store policies whereby a reference is removed from display whenever one of its key sizes stocks out. We ¯rst formulate and analyze a stochastic model predicting the <b>sales</b> of a <b>reference</b> in a single store during a replenishment period as a function of demand forecasts, the inventory of each size initially available and the store inventory management policy just stated.
