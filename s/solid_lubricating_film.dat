40|$|A {{compound}} <b>solid</b> <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> {{containing a}} MoS 2 top layer deposited on DLC interlayer by UBM sputtering technique was investigated for its tribological applications in humid environments. TEM, Raman and XRD analysis revealed the amorphous {{nature of the}} MoS 2 film which contains only short-range order in its lattice structure. The as-deposited MoS 2 compound films showed well-bonded interfaces. The MoS 2, however, is very susceptible to humidity and oxidation, which resulted in higher friction coefficients and lower wear life. A friction coefficient of 0. 05 was measured between steel balls and MoS 2 in atmosphere of 90 % RH. Excessive abrasive wear was identified, {{as a result of}} the wear debris and the oxidized transfer layers between MoS 2 and its counterpart. The inclusion of a supportive DLC interlayer has effectively improved the wear behavior of MoS 2 films under various loading conditions. The overall wear mechanism of MoS 2 was complicated due to its oxidation problem which needs to be resolved for successful usage of MoS 2 in humid environments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A.

For simplicity, discussion of the tribological properties of concern is separated into two parts. The {{first part of the}} chapter discusses the different <b>solid</b> <b>lubricating</b> <b>films</b> selected for study including commercially developed solid film lubricants: (1) bonded molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2), (2) magnetron-sputtered MoS 2, (3) ion-plated silver, (4) ion-plated lead, (5) magnetron-sputtered diamondlike carbon (MS DLC), and (6) plasma-assisted, chemical-vapor-deposited diamondlike carbon (PACVD DEC) films.

With {{the advancement of}} space age transportation systems, the tribological requirements have dramatically increased. This {{is due to the}} optimized design, precision tolerance requirements, and high reliability expected for <b>solid</b> <b>lubricating</b> <b>films</b> in order to withstand hostile operating conditions (vacuum, high-low temperatures, high loads, and space radiation). For these problem areas the ion-assisted deposition/modification processes (plasma-based and ion beam techniques) offer the greatest potential for the synthesis of thin films and the tailoring of adherence and chemical and structural properties for optimized tribological performance.

30|$|Despite {{continuous}} {{improvements in}} machine elements {{over the past}} few decades, lubrication issues have impeded human exploration of the universe because single solid or liquid lubrication systems have been unable to satisfy the ever-increasing performance requirements of space tribology. In this study, we present an overview of the development of carbon-based films as protective coatings, with reference to their high hardness, low friction, and chemical inertness, and with a particular focus on diamond-like carbon (DLC) films. We also discuss the design of carbon-based solid-liquid synergy lubricating coatings with regards to their physicochemical properties and tribological performance. Solid-liquid composite coatings are fabricated via spinning liquid lubricants on <b>solid</b> <b>lubricating</b> <b>films.</b> Such duplex <b>lubricating</b> coatings are considered the most ideal lubrication choice for moving mechanical systems in space as they can overcome the drawback of adhesion and cold-welding associated with solid films under harsh space conditions and can minimize the crosslinking or chain scission of liquid lubricants under space irradiation. State of the art carbon-based solid-liquid synergy lubricating systems therefore holds great promise for space applications due to solid/liquid synergies resulting in superior qualities including excellent friction reduction and anti-wear properties as well as strong anti-irradiation capacities, thereby meeting the requirements of high reliability, high precision, high efficiency, and long lifetime for space drive mechanisms.|$|R

The sliding mode is typically unidirectional at a constant rotating speed. The second part of this paper presents some representative friction and endurance life data for magnetron sputtered MoS(x) films (110 nm thick) deposited on sputter-cleaned 440 C stainless-steel disk substrates, which were slid against a 6 -mm-diameter 440 C stainless-steel bearing ball. All experiments were conducted with loads of 0. 49 to 3. 6 N (average Hertzian contact pressure, 0. 33 to 0. 69 GPa), at a constant rotating speed of 120 rpm (sliding velocity ranging from 31 to 107 mm/s due to the range of wear track radii involved in the experiments), in a vacuum of 7 x 10 exp - 7 Pa and at room temperature. The results indicate that there are similarities in friction behavior of MoS(x) films overs their life cycles regardless of load applied. The coefficient of friction (mu) decreases as load W increases according to mu = kW exp - 1 / 3. The endurance life E of MoS(x) films decreases as the load W increases according to E = KW exp - 1. 4 for the load range. The load- (or contract-pressure-) dependent endurance life allows us to reduce the time for wear experiments and to accelerate endurance life testing of MoS(x) films.

This was done so that a lower, less variable contact stress could be achieved. Two stages of lubrication occurred. In the first, the film supported the load. The lubricating mechanism consisted of the shear of a thin surface layer (of the film) between the rider and the bulk of the film.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is {{turbulent}} flow in a lubricated plane channel. This flow is mainly studied by direct numerical simulations (DNS). Both the <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> and the bulk-fluid velocity and pressure fields are computed within the DNS approach. The very thin <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> is more viscous than the bulk-fluid and is present at both channel walls. The bulk-fluid is no longer exposed to the no-slip condition at the channel walls, and is instead influenced by the dynamic interface between the <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> and the bulk-fluid. Despite the rather large interfacial motions the bulk-flow does in many aspects perceive the interface as a solid wall, except {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> where the interfacial motions heavily influence the bulk-flow. The coherent structures in the near interface region, which are responsible for {{a major part of the}} turbulence production, resemble those close to solid walls. The thin <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> shows a high degree of anisotropy, and the only major component is the streamwise velocity fluctuations. The interface reduces the interaction between the bulk-flow and the solid wall by preventing inrush of high momentum fluid towards the wall. This leads to a reduction of Reynolds shear stress in this region, and inside the film the Reynolds shear stress is vanishing. This observation suggests that a thin <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> can be used for drag reduction purposes. Simulations, using turbulence modelling, show that drag reduction is possible to achieve in high Reynolds number gas-pipelines if the film remains stable. The thin <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> can also be replaced by a set of simplified slip- flow boundary conditions applied at the film bulk-fluid interface. By replacing the <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> with slip-flow conditions, both turbulence statistics as well as the coherent near-interface structures are surprisingly well reproduced. In this approach the need to resolve the flow within the <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> is eliminated and the computational efforts are therefore reduced. A direct numerical simulation of a conventional channel flow is also performed. A generic model for the skin-friction pattern associated with the near wall coherent structures is deduced. The generic model of the footprint of the coherent structures shows that high-skin friction occurs just aside of the tip of the vortex tail due to the downwash of high-speed fluid induced by the vortex. Solid spherical particles injected into a turbulent channel flow are studied by DNS. The focus is on the interaction between the particles and the near wall coherent structures. The accumulation of particles in the very near wall region is thought to be an effect of an imbalance between the efficiency of sweeps and ejections in transporting particles. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey is}} given of the {{synthesis}} methods for preparation of nanostructured materials focussing on the inert gas condensation and mechanical alloying technique. The first method allows {{the preparation of}} highly porous materials by consolidation of metal nanopowders into disk shaped filter components. The mechanical alloying technique allows the preparation of <b>solid</b> <b>lubricating</b> materials for reduction of sliding wear in under dry wear condition. The mechanical properties of densified nanomaterials are characterized by high hardnes...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} compare {{effectiveness}} of adding <b>solid</b> <b>lubricating</b> fillers for polymeric composites based on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) with graphite, molybdenum disulfide and polytetrafluoroethylene, their tribotechnical characteristics under dry friction, boundary lubrication and abrasive wearing were investigated. The optimal weight fractions of fillers {{in terms of}} improving wear resistance have been determined. The supramolecular structure and topography of wear track surfaces of UHMWPE-based composites with different content of fillers have been studied...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{motor oils}} {{are made from}} a heavier, thicker {{petroleum}} hydrocarbon base stock derived from crude oil, with additives to improve certain properties. The bulk of a typical motor oil consists of hydrocarbons with between 18 and 34 carbon atoms per molecule. One {{of the most important}} properties of motor oil in maintaining a <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> between moving parts is its viscosity. The viscosity of a liquid {{can be thought of as}} its [...] "thickness" [...] or a measure of its resistance to flow. The viscosity must be high enough to maintain a <b>lubricating</b> <b>film,</b> but low enough that the oil can flow around the engine parts under all conditions. The viscosity index is a measure of how much the oil's viscosity changes as temperature changes. A higher viscosity index indicates the viscosity changes less with temperature than a lower viscosity index.|$|R
