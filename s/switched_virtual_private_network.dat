The analysis shows that the network with simple IP network will have more delay, jitter and packet loss. Without QOS model in MPLS VPN network the delay, jitter and packet loss are rising with increase of traffic on the network. With the QoS model it provides almost constant delay, jitter and packet loss.

This is increasingly becoming less than ideal solution. The ideal solution is to use A MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS). The implementation of VPN using MPLS has several advantages like making routes faster, combining the flexibility of routers with the speed of switches, enabling Quality of Service (QoS) in IP networks, higher scalability and more flexibility. MPLS-based VPN connects the geographically different branches of <b>private</b> <b>network</b> by using Label Switched Path (LSP), forming a united network.

This network is based on the traditional Frame Relay backbone provided by the service provider (Sudatel). After optimizing the current network to MPLS-based VPNs, it is found that most of the problems were solved.

40|$|Enterprise {{customers}} are increasingly adopting MPLS (Multiprotocol Label <b>Switching)</b> VPN (<b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Network)</b> service that offers direct any-to-any reachability among the customer sites via a provider network. Unfortunately this direct reachability model makes the service provider’s routing tables grow very {{large as the}} number of VPNs and the number of routes per customer increase.

This paper proposes Relaying, a scalable VPN routing architecture that the provider can implement simply by modifying the configuration of routers in the provider network, without requiring changes to the router hardware and software. Relaying substantially reduces the memory footprint of VPNs by choosing a small number of hub routers in each VPN that maintain full reachability information, and by allowing nonhu...|$|R

Named the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the Internet 2 ̆ 7 s routing protocol has been a huge success in terms of efficiency, reliability, and scalability. However, BGP has not had the same success when dealing with security. In August of 2008, two researchers demonstrated a man-in-the-middle attack on the Internet by exploiting an inherent weakness in BGP.

Nevertheless, this has not only exposed NCIs to typical ICT systems attacks, but also to a new breed of cyber-physical attacks. To alleviate these issues, in this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting cyber-physical anomalies in NCIs using the concept of cyber-physical data fusion. By employing Dempster-Shafer’s “Theory of Evidence ” we combine knowledge from the cyber and physical dimension of NCIs in order to achieve an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) capable to detect even small disturbances that are not detected by traditional approaches.

40|$|The Multi-protocol Label Switching {{is one of}} the {{proposed}} technologies useful for traffic engineering in the specific aspects of measurement and control of Internet traffic and <b>virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) is a concept that significant on the future of business communication, it replace existing <b>private</b> <b>network</b> with flexible architecture that is easily manage and at a same time it provide enhanced service. The Multi-protocol Label <b>Switching</b> (MPLS) <b>virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) is a popular IP VPN service based on RFC 2547 and its successor documents (dubbed 2547 bis). The main importance of MPLS is that it integrates the key features of both Layer 2 and Layer 3. Most importantly, it is not limited to any Layer 2 or Layer 3 protocol. In particular, MPLS has several applications and can be extended across multiple products segments (such as an MPLS router, an IP services switch/router, a multi service switch, an Optical Ethernet switch, as well as optical switches). Many service providers offer MPLS VPN to their large enterprise customers, who need only attach their local, customer edge (CE) site routers to the nearest service provider edge (PE) router and exchange routing information. MPLS reduces the complexity of forwarding using encapsulated fixedlength labels for making high speed forwarding decisions. The service provider distributes customer IP routing information to other customer sites and uses its backbone to forward customer IP packets from one customer site to another. This is done by very new concept which is called multicast <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> (mVPNs) ...|$|R

VPNs often carry applications, such as VoIP, data replication, and financial transactions {{that do not}} react well to even the smallest disruptions in connectivity. From previous studies performed on data from the public Internet, it is well-known that BGP can have significant traffic disruptions due to its slow convergence. However, {{despite the fact that}} BGP is a key component of MPLS VPNs, the use of BGP in MPLS VPNs has been largely been unexplored by the research community. In particular, BGP convergence properties in MPLS VPNs has not been studied. In this paper we present the first systematic study of BGP convergence in MPLS VPNs using data collected from a large tier- 1 ISP. For our analysis we combine several data sources to produce a methodology to accurately estimate routing convergence delays. Despite VPN’s obvious smaller scale than the public Internet, we found that BGP convergence in VPNs suffer from many of the same ill effects as BGP in the public Internet. Specifically, we discovered an iBGP version of the BGP path exploration, and showed that the route invisibility problem occur frequently {{and is one of the}} most significant contributing factors to BGP convergence delay in VPNs.

An analytical model is developed to evaluate the round-trip delay of a packet with respect to these three implementations. These implementations are used to provide MPLS L 3 VPN between Internet Service Providers (ISP) or between different backbone networks within an enterprise. A testbed consisting of Cisco routers and switches is {{used to evaluate the}} three implementations in terms of impact of the design of these three implementation implementations on the round-trip delay. Priority queue is used on all routers in the testbed and the background traffic is assigned with the best-effort service. Priority traffic is marked CE routers.

40|$|MPLS (Multiprotocol Label <b>Switching)</b> VPNs (<b>Virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>network)</b> are new {{alternatives}} to private WANs (Wide area network). They are gaining popularity in industry day by day. Enterprise customers {{are moving to}} service providers that offer MPLS VPNs. The main reason for this shifting is the capability of MPLS VPN to provide built in security features and any-to-any connectivity. QoS (Quality of service) {{is the most important}} element for enterprise networks. Enterprise network have video, audio and data traffic over a single network infrastructure. In this thesis we will investigate QoS parameters (e. g. delay, jitter and packet loss) over MPLS VPNs environment. It will help the service providers and enterprise network customers to maintain QoS for voice, video and data traffic over MPLS VPNs environment. To achieve consistent end-to-end QoS, the service provider and the enterprise customer must work closely together and share the same policies to implement because service provider participates in customer routing in MPLS VPN environment. We will use the DiffServ (Differentiated services) QoS model over MPLS VPN network. We will use a six class model for service provider network and enterprise customer network to achieve end-to- end service quality. In the last part we will make tests of end-to-end traffic delay, jitter and packet loss. We will compare the results of delay, jitter and packet loss with and without the DiffServ QoS model in an MPLS VPNs environment. It will be clear in the results that without using DiffServ QoS model delay, jitter and packet loss are increasing as the traffic increases on the network. With a DiffServ enabled network, the increase of traffic over network will not affect delay, jitter and packet loss and provide constant level of service quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In certain {{models of}} inter-provider Multi-Protocol Label <b>Switching</b> (MPLS) based <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> (VPNs), {{spoofing}} and replay attacks against VPN sites are two key concerns. MPLS VPN model “C ” can scale well {{with respect to}} maintenance of routing state when compared with models “A” and “B”. But this deployment model is not favoured due to the aforementioned security concerns in the data-plane. The inner labels associated with VPN sites are not encrypted during data transmission. Therefore {{it is possible for}} an attacker to spoof or replay data packets to a specific VPN site. We propose a label-hopping technique which uses a set of randomised labels and a method for hopping amongst these labels to address these type of attacks. To reduce the computation time complexity for such algorithms, we propose the use of Timing over Internet Protocol connection and Transfer of Clock (TicToc) based Precision Time Protocol. Simulations show that by using the TicToc protocol, along with the label-hopping technique, we can mitigate spoofing and replay attacks at line-rate. As we address key security and performance concerns, we make a plausible case for the deployment of MPLS based VPN inter-provider model “C”.

Out of these, the <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>network</b> plays {{a vital role in}} preventing hackers from accessing the <b>networks.</b> A <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> (VPN) provides end users with a way to privately access information on their network over a public network infrastructure such as the internet. Using a technique called “Tunneling”, data packets are transmitted across a public routed network, such as the internet that simulates a point-to-point connection. <b>Virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> provide customers with a secure and low-cost communication environment. The basic structure of the virtual circuit is to create a logical path from the source port to the destination port.
