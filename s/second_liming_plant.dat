40|$|Liming is {{considered}} normal agricultural practise for remediating soil acidity and improving crop productivity; however recommended lime applications can reduce yield. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} elevated xylem sap Ca 2 + limited gas exchange of Phaseolus vulgaris L. and Pisum sativum L. plants that exhibited reduced shoot biomass and leaf area when limed. We used Scholander and whole-plant pressure chamber techniques to collect root and leaf xylem sap, a calcium-specific ion-selective electrode to measure xylem sap Ca 2 +, infra-red gas analysis to measure gas exchange of limed and unlimed (control) plants, and a detached leaf transpiration bioassay to determine stomatal sensitivity to Ca 2 +. Liming reduced shoot biomass, leaf area and leaf gas exchange in both species. Root xylem sap Ca 2 + concentration was only increased in P. vulgaris and not in P. sativum. Detached leaves of both species required 5 mM Ca 2 + supplied to via the transpiration stream to induce stomatal closure, however, maximum in vivo xylem sap Ca 2 + concentrations of <b>limed</b> <b>plants</b> was only 1. 7 mM and thus not high enough to influence stomata. We conclude that an alternative xylem-borne antitranspirant other than Ca 2 + decreases gas exchange of <b>limed</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. Water is {{essential}} to life on our planet (Miller, 1999) because no living organism can survive without it (Kupchella & Hyland, 1993). Thus there is a demand for clean, unpolluted water to be in substantial supply. There is growing awareness worldwide of the environmental legacy of coal mining activities that have been undertaken with little {{concern for the environment}} (EMCBC, 2001). Coal mining by its nature consumes, diverts and can seriously pollute water resources (Miller, 1999). Acid mine drainage is a major problem on coalmines throughout the world (Kupchella & Hyland, 1993), and South Witbank Colliery, the main focus of this study, is no exception. Various studies that have been undertaken at South Witbank Colliery have shown that the water decanting from the mine is highly acidic (pH 2 – pH 4), and as such cannot be released into the natural watercourse (streams). Some form of water treatment to nullify or neutralise the acid levels of the mine water is necessary. Currently a temporary <b>liming</b> <b>plant</b> is being utilised to treat the water and to reduce its acidity levels to between pH 5. 0 – pH 9. 5, however, this plant is seen as a limited treatment option as it does not guarantee that the acidic nature of the water will be sufficiently nullified. This study endeavours to identify and analyse a variety of permanent, long-term water treatment methods relevant to acid mine water mitigation at South Witbank Colliery. Four long-term water treatment methods, namely artificial wetlands, anoxic limestone drains, transfer of water to a water treatment plant, and construction of a permanent liming facility at South Witbank Colliery, were identified and discussed. Artificial wetland technology has not been proven for treatment on such variable pollutant loads as present in the South Witbank Colliery mine water decant. A constraint to this technology also lies in its necessity for large surface area requirements, which is restricted due to site subsidence and sinkhole formation (as a result of shallow mining). This technology is also known to increase water evaporation rates, which may result in additional water removal from an already stressed resource. The anoxic limestone drain water treatment technology is considered unsuitable for the study area, ultimately due to it having more a pre-treatment functionality than a total treatment one. It is also limited due to its ability to address only certain water quality variables. If considered for use in a partnership with other acid mine drainage water treatment technologies, its use might be more viable than when considered as a stand-alone treatment technology. Transferring of the acid mine drainage water decant from South Witbank Colliery to a water treatment plant is a feasible option. The Brugspruit Water Pollution Control Works, operated by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, is the most likely option. The water treatment would become the responsibility of DWAF, thereby ensuring that the treated water is compliant with specified water quality standards and requirements. The attractiveness of this option is that it minimizes the short and long term water management requirements for South Witbank Colliery, but is ultimately dependant on a formal contract being negotiated between the relevant parties. Construction of a permanent liming facility at South Witbank Colliery is possible and, in comparison to the current temporary <b>liming</b> <b>plant,</b> is likely to treat the water adequately so as to comply with specified water quality standards and requirements. A permanent facility would allow for more water to be treated than is currently possible at the temporary <b>liming</b> <b>plant.</b> Due to this option being based on proven technology increases its feasibility in terms of use at South Witbank Colliery. Given that water is a scarce resource in South Africa, the implementation of these water treatment options is dependent on the acceptability of each option by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. Of the four treatment options identified the latter two, namely transfer of water to a water treatment facility and construction of a permanent <b>liming</b> <b>plant,</b> are considered to be the most suitable solutions for the treatment of acid mine drainage at South Witbank Colliery...|$|R

In the September issue of The Plant Cell, we have provided evidence that the tobacco WLIM 1 is able to bind actin filaments in a direct manner, to stabilize them and to trigger actin bundling both in vitro and in vivo. These data, together with recent reports on animal CRPs, strongly suggest that these proteins represent a novel class of actin cytoskeleton regulators.

40|$|Considerations on the {{interactions}} of P in the soil-plant system have a long history, but are still topical and not yet satisfactorily understood. One concern {{is the effect of}} liming before or after application of soluble sources on the crop yield and efficiency of available P under these conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of soil acidity on availability of P from a soluble source, based on plant growth and chemical extractants. Nine soil samples were incubated with a dose of 200 mg kg- 1 P in soil with different levels of previously adjusted acidity (pH H 2 O 4. 5; 5. 0; 5. 5; 6. 0 and 6. 5) and compared to soils without P application. After 40 days of soil incubation with a P source, each treatment was limed again so that all pH values were adjusted to 6. 5 and then sorghum was planted. After the first and <b>second</b> <b>liming</b> the P levels were determined by the extractants Mehlich- 1, Bray- 1 and Resin, and the fractionated inorganic P forms. In general, the different acidity levels did not influence the P availability measured by plant growth and P uptake at the studied P dose. For some soils however these values increased or decreased according to the initial soil pH (from 4. 5 to 6. 5). Plant growth, P uptake and P extractable by Mehlich- 1 and Bray- 1 were significantly correlated, unlike resin-extractable P, at pH values raised to 6. 5. These latter correlations were however significant before the <b>second</b> <b>liming.</b> The P contents extracted by Mehlich- 1 and Bray- 1 were significantly correlated with each other in the entire test range of soil acidity, even after adjusting pH to 6. 5, besides depending on the soil buffering capacity for P. Resin was also sensitive to the properties that express the soil buffering capacity for P, but less clearly than Mehlich- 1 and Bray- 1. The application of triple superphosphate tended to increase the levels of P-Al, P-Fe and P-Ca and the highest P levels extracted by Bray- 1 were due to a higher occurrence of P-Al and P-Fe in the soils...|$|R

The mutations detected in FHL 1 affected highly conserved zinc coordinating residues within the <b>second</b> <b>LIM</b> domain and lead to the formation of aggregates when transfected into cells. Our aim was to define the clinical and morphological phenotype of this myopathy and to assess the mutational spectrum of FHL 1 mutations in reducing body myopathy in a larger cohort of patients. Patients were ascertained via the detection of reducing bodies in muscle biopsy sections stained with menadione-NBT followed by clinical, histological, ultrastructural and molecular genetic analysis. A total of 11 patients from nine families were included in this study, including seven sporadic patients with early childhood onset disease and four familial cases with later onset. Weakness in all patients was progressive, sometimes rapidly so. Respiratory failure was common and scoliosis and spinal rigidity were significant in some of the patients. Analysis of muscle biopsies confirmed the presence of aggregates of FHL 1 positive material in all biopsies. In two patients in whom sequential biopsies were available the aggregate load in muscle sections appeared to increase over time. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that cytoplasmic bodies were regularly seen in conjunction with the reducing bodies. The mutations detected were exclusive to the <b>second</b> <b>LIM</b> domain of FHL 1 and were found in both sporadic as well as familial cases of reducing body myopathy. Six of the nine mutations affected the crucial zinc coordinating residue histidine 123. All mutations in this residue were de novo and were associated with a severe clinical course, in particular in one male patient (H 123 Q). Mutations in the zinc coordinating residue cysteine 153 were associated with a milder phenotype and were seen in the familial cases in which the boys were still more severely affected compared to their mothers. We expect the mild end of the spectrum to significantly expand in the future. On the severe end of the spectrum we define reducing body myopathy as a progressive disease with early, but not necessarily congenital onset, distinguishing this condition from the classic essentially non-progressive congenital myopathies...|$|R

Lower δ 13 C‰ values in limed roots compared with unlimed roots were found, whereas no significant difference was detected between soil samples. Extrapolation of our results indicated that more C has been lost through the soil than has been gained via photosynthetic assimilation because of pasture liming in Scotland during the period 1990 – 1998.

After cell–cell or cell–substratum contact, cytosolic proteins are recruited to clustered adhesion receptor complexes.

Ajuba contained a functional nuclear export signal and shuttled into the nucleus. Importantly, accumulation of the LIM domains of Ajuba in the nucleus of P 19 embryonal cells resulted in growth inhibition and spontaneous endodermal differentiation. The differentiating effect of Ajuba mapped to the third LIM domain, whereas regulation of proliferation mapped to the first and <b>second</b> <b>LIM</b> domains.

LMO 2 functions in transcription complexes via protein-protein interactions involving two LIM domains and causes a preleukemic T-cell development blockade followed by clonal tumors. Therefore, LMO 2 is necessary but not sufficient for overt neoplasias, which must undergo additional mutations before frank malignancy.

Lmo 2 is, therefore, required for sustained T-cell tumor growth, in addition to its preleukemic effect.

The LIM-homeodomain protein Lmx 1 cooperates {{with the basic}} helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein E 47 /Pan- 1 to activate the insulin promoter in transfected fibroblasts. In this study, we show that two proteins originally called Lmx 1 are the closely related products of two distinct vertebrate genes, Lmx 1. 1 and Lmx 1. 2. We have used yeast genetic systems to delineate the functional domains of the Lmx 1 proteins and to characterize the physical interactions between Lmx 1 proteins and E 47 /Pan- 1 that produce synergistic transcriptional activation.

40|$|LIM domain {{proteins}} {{are found}} to be important regulators in cell growth, cell fate determination, cell differentiation, and remodeling of the cell cytoskeleton. Human Four-and-a-half LIM-only protein 2 (FHL 2) is expressed predominantly in human heart and is only slightly expressed in skeletal muscle. Since FHL 2 is an abundant protein in human heart, it may {{play an important role in}} the regulation of cell differentiation and myofibrillogenesis of heart at defined subcellular compartment. Therefore, we hypothesized that FHL 2 act as a multi-functional protein by the specific arrangement of the LIM domains of FHL 2 and that one of the LIM domains of FHL 2 can function as an anchor and localizes it into a specific subcellular compartment in a cell type specific manner to regulate myofibrillogenesis. From our reuslts, we observed that FHL 2 is localized at the focal adhesions of the C 2 C 12, H 9 C 2 myoblast as well as a nonmyogenic cell line, HepG 2 cells. Colocalization of vinculin-CFP and FHL 2 -GFP at focal adhesions was also observed in cell lines. Site-directed mutagenesis, in turn, suggested that the <b>second</b> <b>LIM</b> domain-LIM 2 is essential for its specific localization to focal adhesions. Moreover, FHL 2 was observed along with F-actin and focal adhesion of C 2 C 12 and H 9 C 2 myotubes. Finally, we believe that FHL 2 moves from focal adhesions and then stays at the Z-discs of terminally differentiated heart muscle. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{soils are}} usually highly acidic {{and this may}} hamper mango trees {{nutrition}} and production. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of lime doses applied to the soil surface on the plant nutritional status, the production, and the technological quality of mango fruits. The study was carried out at Selviria, {{in the state of}} Mato Grosso, Brazil, in a Typic Haplustox. Thirteen year old producing mango plants of the “Heden ” variety, grafted on rootstock of the “Coquinho ” variety, were used in this experiment. Lime doses of 0, 1. 55, 3. 10, 4. 655, and 6. 20 t·ha– 1 were applied to the soil. Each treatment was replicated 4 times and the experimental units distributed according to a randomized com-plete block design. Lime (CaO: 390 g·kg– 1; MgO: 130 g·kg– 1) was superficially applied to the soil and then incorpo-rated at depths between 0 and 5 cm in the total area of the orchard. The soil chemical characteristics pH, Ca, Mg, K, sum of bases, and bases saturation, in the 0 - 20 cm layer, were evaluated 16 and 28 months after soil <b>liming.</b> <b>Plant</b> nu-tritional status was evaluated 12 months after soil liming. Fruit production and technological quality were evaluated during the cropping years of 2006 and 2007. Soil liming had a positive effect on the evaluated soil chemical characteris-tics and this improved plant nutritional status and fruit technological quality as well as increased fruit production. These beneficial effects though were observed only in the second year after soil liming. The highest fruit production was veri-fied when soil bases saturation was of 72 % and the contents of Ca and Mg were of 32 and 8 g·kg– 1, respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMutations in the four-and-a-half LIM domain 1 (FHL 1) gene, which encodes a 280 {{amino acid}} protein {{containing}} 4 LIM domains {{and a single}} zinc finger domain in the N-terminal region, {{have been associated with}} a broad clinical spectrum of X-linked muscle diseases encompassing a variety of different phenotypes. Patients might either present with a scapuloperoneal myopathy, a myopathy with postural muscle atrophy and generalized hypertrophy, an Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy or an early-onset myopathy with reducing bodies. It has been proposed that the phenotypic variability is related to the position of the mutation within the FHL 1 gene. Here we report on 3 British families with a heterogeneous clinical presentation segregating a single FHL 1 gene mutation and haplotype, suggesting that this represents a founder mutation. The underlying FHL 1 gene mutation was detected by direct sequencing and the founder effect was verified by haplotype analysis of the FHL 1 gene locus. A 3 bp insertion mutation (p. Phe 127 _Thr 128 insIle) within the <b>second</b> <b>LIM</b> domain of the FHL 1 gene was identified in all available affected family members of the three families. Haplotype analysis of the FHL 1 region on Xq 26 revealed that the families shared a common haplotype. The p.

40|$|The LIM motif {{defines a}} double zinc finger {{structure}} found in proteins involved in {{cell fate determination}} and growth control. LIM proteins, which include LIM homeo domain, LIM kinase, focal adhesion, and LIM-only proteins, usually contain two or more LIM motifs clustered at their amino- or carboxy-terminal end. At present, the mode of action of the LIM domain is not clear. In this study we have analyzed the binding properties of LIM motifs in the cellular environment. We show that MLP, CRP, and betaCRP define a subclass of LIM-only proteins with unique dual subcellular localization in the nucleus and along actin-based filaments in the cytosol. A double MLP construct that accumulated nearly exclusively along actin filaments promoted myogenic differentiation efficiently, arguing for a functional role of cytoskeleton-associated MLP. Binding of MLP to the actin cytoskeleton is specifically attributable to its <b>second</b> <b>LIM</b> motif. An additional LIM motif potentiates binding. Potentiating LIM motifs can be interchanged, resulting in differential targeting of interacting proteins. To analyze LIM-LIM interactions in situ, this property was exploited to develop a hybrid interaction approach based on the relocalization of LIM-containing constructs to the actin cytoskeleton. These experiments revealed the existence of marked selectivity in the interactions of single LIM motifs, and among LIM domains from different LIM-homeo domain and LIM-only proteins. Furthermore, the analysis suggested that the LIM motif has two interacting interfaces. On {{the basis of these}} findings, we propose that LIM motifs function as specific adapter elements to promote the assembly and targeting of multiprotein complexes...|$|R
