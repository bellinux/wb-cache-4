25|$|The main {{criticism}} {{applied to}} the yeast two-hybrid screen of protein–protein interactions are {{the possibility of a}} high number of false positive (and false negative) identifications. The exact rate of false positive results is not known, but earlier estimates were as high as 70%. This also, partly, explains the often found very <b>small</b> <b>overlap</b> in results when using a (high throughput) two-hybrid screening, especially when using different experimental systems.|$|E
25|$|Band gaps are {{essentially}} leftover ranges of energy {{not covered by}} any band, {{a result of the}} finite widths of the energy bands. The bands have different widths, with the widths depending upon the degree of overlap in the atomic orbitals from which they arise. Two adjacent bands may simply not be wide enough to fully cover the range of energy. For example, the bands associated with core orbitals (such as 1s electrons) are extremely narrow due to the <b>small</b> <b>overlap</b> between adjacent atoms. As a result, there tend to be large band gaps between the core bands. Higher bands involve comparatively larger orbitals with more overlap, becoming progressively wider at higher energies so that there are no band gaps at higher energies.|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{registration}} of multimodal images {{has proven to}} be a difficult task. Most existing techniques have difficulty dealing with situations involving highly non-homogeneous image contrast and a <b>small</b> initial <b>overlapping</b> region between the images. This paper presents a robust multi-resolution method for registering multimodal images using local phase-coherence representations. The proposed method finds the transformation that minimizes the error residual between the local phase-coherence representations of the two multimodal images. The error residual can be minimized using a combination of efficient globally exhaustive optimization techniques and subpixel-level local optimization techniques to further improve robustness in situations with <b>small</b> initial <b>overlap.</b> The proposed method has been tested on various medical images acquired using different modalities and evaluated based on its registration accuracy. The results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving better accuracy than existing multimodal registration techniques when handling situations where image non-homogeneity and <b>small</b> <b>overlapping</b> regions exist...|$|R

30|$|AB methods {{choose a}} {{similarity}} metric and maximize {{it to find}} parameters of transformation function. Most common similarity measures {{in the context of}} multimodal RIR are mutual information (MI) [11, 12], entropy correlation coefficient (ECC) [13], and phase correlation [14]. However, MI performance degrades when faced with a large amount of changes in the texture of retinal image and changes in scale [15]. There may be many local maxima in the MI function, which cause problems with optimization methods and lead to misalignment. MI is also weak in registering image pairs with too <b>small</b> <b>overlaps.</b> Therefore, ECC, a normalized measure of MI, was used on the vascular tree to register <b>small</b> <b>overlapping</b> images [13]. Its dependency on vessels restricts the efficiency of registration techniques for low-quality images. Phase-based methods are robust to lighting variations [16]. However, they fail to register images with high translation and content changes [11]. AB methods are computationally intensive because of using the entire content of images.|$|R
