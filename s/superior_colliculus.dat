5|$|The optic tectum allows {{actions to}} be {{directed}} toward points in space, most commonly in response to visual input. In mammals it is usually {{referred to as the}} <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus,</b> and its best-studied function is to direct eye movements. It also directs reaching movements and other object-directed actions. It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys, this region is the largest part of the brain. The <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus</b> is part of the midbrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{elaboration}} of the cerebral cortex {{carries with it}} changes to other brain areas. The <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus,</b> which {{plays a major role}} in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex. The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex, which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Superior</b> <b>colliculus</b> {{receives}} IC’s input, integrates visual orienting info, {{and uses}} the balance topographical map to orient the body to the pain stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Suppression of {{recently}} inspected stimuli for both attention and oculomotor saccade is usually measured using attentional and oculomotor inhibition of return tests. The <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus</b> and the midbrain, oculomotor pathway {{are involved in}} suppression of stimuli.|$|E
25|$|The reticulospinal tracts {{are mostly}} {{inhibited}} by the corticospinal tract; if damage {{occurs at the}} level of or below the red nucleus (e.g. to the <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus),</b> it is called decerebration, and causes decerebrate rigidity: an unopposed extension of the head and limbs. The reticulospinal tracts also provide a pathway by which the hypothalamus can control sympathetic thoracolumbar outflow and parasympathetic sacral outflow.|$|E
25|$|Note that {{up until}} now much of the above {{paragraph}} could apply to octopuses, mollusks, worms, insects and things more primitive; anything with a more concentrated nervous system and better eyes than say a jellyfish. However, the following applies to mammals generally and birds (in modified form): The retina in these more complex animals sends fibers (the optic nerve) to the lateral geniculate nucleus, to the primary and secondary visual cortex of the brain. Signals from the retina can also travel directly from the retina to the <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Acknowledging these variations, many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} established to reflect why these observations are task-dependent. Given that different senses develop at different rates, it has been proposed that cross-modal integration does not appear until both modalities have reached maturity. The human body undergoes significant physical transformation throughout childhood. Not only is there growth in size and stature (affecting viewing height), {{but there is also}} change in inter-ocular distance and eyeball length. Therefore, sensory signals need to be constantly re-evaluated to appreciate these various physiological changes. Some support comes from animal studies that explore the neurobiology behind integration. Adult monkeys have deep inter-neuronal connections within the <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus</b> providing strong, accelerated visuo-auditory integration. Young animals conversely, do not have this enhancement until unimodal properties are fully developed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>{{superior}}</b> <b>colliculus</b> (SC) or optic tectum (OT) {{is part of}} the tectum, {{located in}} the midbrain, superior to the brainstem and inferior to the thalamus. It contains seven layers of alternating white and grey matter, of which the superficial contain topographic maps of the visual field; and deeper layers contain overlapping spatial maps of the visual, auditory and somatosensory modalities. The structure receives afferents directly from the retina, as well as from various regions of the cortex (primarily the occipital lobe), the spinal cord and the inferior colliculus. It sends efferents to the spinal cord, cerebellum, thalamus and occipital lobe via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The structure contains a high proportion of multisensory neurons and plays a role in the motor control of orientation behaviours of the eyes, ears and head.|$|E
25|$|The nigral afferences {{come from}} the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. The axons do not {{constitute}} a conspicuous bundle. They are placed medially to the pallidal and ascend almost vertically. A part of the territory is posterior and inferior {{going up to the}} anterior pole of the central complex. This part sometimes designated as VM is simply the posterior continuation of the nigral territory. There is indeed no more VM in the upper primates where the pallidal and nigral territories are everywhere separated. In the whole territory axons expand widely (François et al., 2002) allowing no precise map, which is confirmed by physiology (Wichemann and Kliem, 2004). VA is crossed by the mammillothalamic bundle. The mediator of the nigro-thalamic connection is, as for the pallido-thalamic the inhibitor GABA. In addition to nigral, VA receives amygdalar and tectal (<b>superior</b> <b>colliculus)</b> axons. The thalamo-cortical axons go to the frontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the premotor cortex and the oculomotor fields FEF and SEF. It is important to stress the necessity from now to clearly distinguish the pallidal VO and the nigral VA territories. The fact that they do not lead to the same cortical areas and systems is alone one reason for this. The physiology of the two territories is also different (van Donkelaar et al., 1999).|$|E
25|$|However, {{considerations}} of how unified conscious representations are formed {{are not the}} full focus of multisensory Integration research. It is obviously important for the senses to interact {{in order to maximize}} how efficiently people interact with the environment. For perceptual experience and behavior to benefit from the simultaneous stimulation of multiple sensory modalities, integration of the information from these modalities is necessary. Some of the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon and its subsequent effects on cognitive and behavioural processes will be examined hereafter. Perception is often defined as one's conscious experience, and thereby combines inputs from all relevant senses and prior knowledge. Perception is also defined and studied in terms of feature extraction, which is several hundred milliseconds away from conscious experience. Notwithstanding the existence of Gestalt psychology schools that advocate a holistic approach to the operation of the brain, the physiological processes underlying the formation of percepts and conscious experience have been vastly understudied. Nevertheless, burgeoning neuroscience research continues to enrich our understanding of the many details of the brain, including neural structures implicated in multisensory integration such as the <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus</b> (SC) and various cortical structures such as the superior temporal gyrus (GT) and visual and auditory association areas. Although the structure and function of the SC are well known, the cortex and the relationship between its constituent parts are presently the subject of much investigation. Concurrently, the recent impetus on integration has enabled investigation into perceptual phenomena such as the ventriloquism effect, rapid localization of stimuli and the McGurk effect; culminating in a more thorough understanding of the human brain and its functions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contributions}} of Barry Stein, Alex Meredith, {{and their colleagues}} (e.g."The merging of the senses" [...] 1993,) are widely {{considered to be the}} groundbreaking work in the modern field of multisensory integration. Through detailed long-term study of the neurophysiology of the <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus,</b> they distilled three general principles by which multisensory integration may best be described.|$|E
2500|$|A neural {{structure}} located {{behind the}} {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} that is understood to control eye movements. In particular, the deeper layers of the <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus,</b> known as lamina VI and VII, {{have been found to}} be involved in initiating and executing saccadic eye movements, which includes the desired speed and direction of the saccade. The cells in these layers are organized in a way that forms a map of the visual field. They are organized according to what direction each cell moves the eye. It has been found that activation of specific cells is directed by where objects in the environment are located in the visual field. [...] Once a new object is detected, the cells that fire the strongest to stimuli within this specific area of the visual field will fire, causing the eyes to move and focus on this object. Although the <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus</b> may not be directly related to memory for objects across saccades, it is directly related to the control of saccades and selection of fixation targets.|$|E
2500|$|One intensively studied {{function}} of the basal ganglia is its role in controlling eye movements. [...] Eye movement is influenced by an extensive network of brain regions that converges on a midbrain area called the <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus</b> (SC). [...] The SC is a layered structure whose layers form two-dimensional retinotopic maps of visual space. [...] A [...] "bump" [...] of neural activity in the deep layers of the SC drives an eye movement directed toward the corresponding point in space.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{simplest}} reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord, more complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain. For example, when {{an object in}} {{the periphery of the}} visual field moves, and a person looks toward it many stages of signal processing are initiated. [...] The initial sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the final motor response, in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem, are not all that different from those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are completely different. [...] Instead of a one or two step chain of processing, the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration, involving the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus,</b> cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei. [...] These areas perform signal-processing functions that include feature detection, perceptual analysis, memory recall, decision-making, and motor planning.|$|E
2500|$|A clear {{emergent}} {{issue in}} comparative {{anatomy of the}} basal ganglia {{is the development of}} this system through phylogeny as a convergent cortically re-entrant loop in conjunction with the development and expansion of the cortical mantle. There is controversy, however, regarding the extent to which convergent selective processing occurs versus segregated parallel processing within re-entrant closed loops of the basal ganglia. Regardless, the transformation of the basal ganglia into a cortically re-entrant system in mammalian evolution occurs through a re-direction of pallidal (or [...] "paleostriatum primitivum") output from midbrain targets such as the <b>superior</b> <b>colliculus,</b> as occurs in sauropsid brain, to specific regions of the ventral thalamus and from there back to specified regions of the cerebral cortex that form a subset of those cortical regions projecting into the striatum. The abrupt rostral re-direction of the pathway from the internal segment of the globus pallidus into the ventral thalamus—via the path of the ansa lenticularis—could be viewed as a footprint of this evolutionary transformation of basal ganglia outflow and targeted influence.|$|E
