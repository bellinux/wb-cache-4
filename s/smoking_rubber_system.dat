40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{in an attempt}} to investigate dithiocarbamic acid accelerated sulfur vulcanisation. This was, however, found impossible due to the innate instability of dithiocarbamic acids. The focus of the study was then shifted toward thiuram disulfide accelerated sulfur vulcanisation, with emphasis being placed on a rate comparison. Three groups of accelerators were investigated, namely the aromatic, linear aliphatic and cyclic aliphatic thiuram disulfide adducts. The analysis methods that were employed were conventional rubber (cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene) techniques coupled to model (squalene) compound investigations. The data that was collected consisted of rheometrical torque vs. time data in the <b>rubber</b> <b>system</b> while the data obtained in the model compound study consisted of sulfur and accelerator concentration data as determined by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aromatic accelerators were synthesised in our labs by means of an addition reaction between the aromatic amine and CS 2 in basic medium and subsequent oxidation with K 3 Fe(CN) 6, all in a 1 : 1 molar ratio. The reaction yield was low due to the instability of the dithiocarbamate intermediates and a sluggish oxidation reaction. In the rate constant determination a first order mathematical approach was used for the <b>rubber</b> <b>system</b> as crosslinking is considered to roughly obey first order kinetics. The model compound data was also found to more accurately fit the first order rate law, with an initial slopes method also being applied to the system to determine secondary rate constants and relative rates for the system. The determination of vulcanisation rate constants in the cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene system was a success, while the rate data determined by means of the squalene model was more related to the rate of accelerator and sulfur consumption as opposed to the rate of crosslinking {{as is the case with}} the rubber rate data. The sulfur first order rate data mirrored the rate data derived from the <b>rubber</b> <b>system</b> more closely than the corresponding accelerator rate data, the relative rate data determined by means of initial slopes method, proved that the homolytic cleavage of thiuram disulfides and the subsequent formation of accelerator polysulfides were not limiting steps. This is seen in the similar relative rate data derived from both the raw sulfur and accelerator data in systems that exhibit vastly different vulcanisation rates. Squalene was deemed a suitable model for the cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene system, although one should consider the extent of charring and solution effects in the individual systems to account for possible incongruities that may be observed between the <b>rubber</b> and simulated <b>system.</b> The lack of agreement between the rubber and model compound rate constant data lies in the fact that the rate of crosslinking is not simplistically related to the rate at which accelerator and sulfur is consumed, this being especially true for the rate at which the accelerator is consumed. Thus the discussion over the acceleratory rates in the various accelerator systems was limited to observations made in the <b>rubber</b> <b>system,</b> with the model compound data was used exclusively to elucidate mechanistic processes. It was discovered that the groups of accelerators examined, namely linear, cyclic and aromatic thiuram disulfide adducts, produced vastly varied rate data. The aromatic thiuram disulfide adducts had only a slight acceleratory effect on the rate of vulcanisation as compared to the unaccelerated sulfur system. The morpholine adduct had a moderately larger rate of acceleration followed by tetramethyl and tetrethylthiuram disulfide, with N’N-dicyclopentamethylenethiuram disulfide having the fastest rate of acceleratio...|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{description of}} multicomponent transport across nonporous polymeric membranes was investigated using two alternative frameworks; the phenomenological approach of irreversible thermodynamics and the mechanistic Stefan-Maxwell formulation. The transport models developed account for potential equilibrium and/or kinetic coupling of fluxes and {{the contribution of}} diffusion induced non-selective flow within the polymer. Transient measurements coupled with transient models enable a more detailed evaluation of the complex multicomponent transport phenomena occurring within the nonporous polymer. The models developed {{in this study were}} validated against transient dialysis and pervaporation data for (ethanol-water) /silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>system.</b> A critical assessment was obtained by recovering the model parameters from the dialysis data and using the same parameters to predict the transient pervaporation performance. Separate evaluation of the equilibrium and kinetic contributions requires a thermodynamic model to describe the non-ideality of the polymer solution. The uptake of small polar solutes by hydrophobic polymers is not well described by the classical Flory-Huggins model. An empirical modification was developed which retains the basic form of the Flory-Huggins model but allows the interaction parameters to be a simple function of activity. This modification provided a physically realistic description of the sorption equilibria for the {ethanol- water}/silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>system</b> over conditions ranging from a low pressure vapour to a saturated liquid. The phenomenological approach of irreversible thermodynamics was used to develop transient models of dialysis and pervaporation. The numerical solution of the model equations, which constitute a set of coupled partial differential equations, was accomplished by the application of the method of lines. Average phenomenological diffusion coefficients recovered from dialysis data can give a good qualitative prediction of pervaporation performance provided the diffusion coefficients satisfy the Onsagar reciprocal relationships. However, a quantitative prediction requires the explicit inclusion of the concentration dependence of the diffusivities, which is best achieved within the mechanistic Stefan-Maxwell formulation. A generic model of membrane transport was formulated using the mechanistic Stephan-Maxwell approach and generalised driving forces, which included the contribution from the various internal and external driving forces. Transient models of dialysis and pervaporation were developed which used exactly the same generic model to describe the transport through the membrane. A notable advantage of the generic model {{lies in the fact that}} the Stephan-Maxwell diffusivities retain their physical significance irrespective of the number of components present. This offers the opportunity of recovering many of the model parameters from relatively simple binary experiments. The results obtained indicate that the generic model is capable of describing the transient dialysis and pervaporation of the {ethanol-water}/silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>system</b> with an identical set of concentration dependent equilibrium and diffusive parameters. The generic model provides a solid framework for the theoretical description of diverse processes employing a nonporous polymer as the selective separation barrier...|$|R
