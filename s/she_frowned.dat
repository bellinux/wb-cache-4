500|$|Grant's biographer Graham McCann {{mentions}} that Maureen Donaldson, {{a lover of}} Grant in the 1970s, claimed in her book that his mother [...] "did {{not know how to}} give affection and {{did not know how to}} receive it either." [...] Another biographer, Geoffrey Wansell, notes that Elsie blamed herself bitterly for the death of Grant's older brother John, and never recovered from it. Grant later acknowledged that his negative experiences with his fiercely independent mother affected his relationships with women later in life. <b>She</b> <b>frowned</b> on alcohol and tobacco, and would reduce pocket money for minor mishaps. Grant later attributed her behaviour towards him as down to her being overprotective, fearing that she would lose him as she did John.|$|E
