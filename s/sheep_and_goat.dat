Aims: To examine the influence of the new measure for control and eradication of brucellosis in <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> on the incidence of human brucellosis before and after vaccination with B. melitensis Rev. 1. Material and methods: This is a retrospective study in which comparison of the incidence of human brucellosis in the three regions has been made depending on the vaccination procedure in <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> one year before the implementation of the vaccination (2007) and 4 years later. Data for the infected <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> were obtained from the Food and Veterinary Agency and data for human brucellosis were obtained from the Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Macedonia. Results: The greatest decrease in the incidence of human brucellosis (from 124. 3 to 19. 7 / 100, 000 inhabitants) was registered in the region 3 where mass vaccination of <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> was conducted.

25|$|The Euphrates {{flows through}} a number of {{distinct}} vegetation zones. Although millennia-long human occupation {{in most parts of the}} Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a xeric woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks, pistachio trees, and Rosaceae (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and Rosaceae. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, oat and rye. South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-steppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the Syro–Iraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba) and Chenopodiaceae. Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> pastoralism by its inhabitants. Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of Chenopodiaceae or Poa sinaica. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a riverine forest. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the Oriental plane, the Euphrates poplar, the tamarisk, the ash and various wetland plants.|$|E

Methods: Hearts of 47 <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> 44 <b>goats</b> that were seropositive in the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) were bioassayed in mice.

Radioactive CO was used to label CT in young growing desmodium plants, [C]CT was extracted, purified and infused intraruminally, and the metabolism of [C]CT was followed in the rumen and lower digestive tract of both species. Digestion of DM, organic matter (OM), cell-wall constituents (CWC), N and the efficiency of rumen microbial synthesis were determined using a continuous intraruminal infusion of Cr EDTA, YbCl and NaSO. The measurements taken for <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> respectively were: intake, 21 and 30 g/kg per d; digestibilities (g/g) of DM, 0. 566 and 0. 505; OM 0. 578 and 0. 508; neutral-detergent fibre, 0. 584 and 0. 532; and acid-detergent fibre, 0. 535 and 0. 435. None of these measurements was significantly different (P > 0. 05) between animal species. There was an apparent net gain in Lignin across the rumen and whole intestinal tract for both animal species (19 and 29 % for <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> respectively). There {{were no significant differences}} between <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> (P > 0. 05) detected for any measurements of N excretion and utilization.

The apparent losses of DCT across the rumen of <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> were 12 <b>and</b> 9 % whilst higher losses (49 and 42 % for <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> respectively) were observed for [C]CT. Losses of DCT in the lower intestinal tract accounted for 69 and 71 % of the total CT leaving the abomasum. By comparison, only 40 and 35 % of []CT was lost during intestinal passage in <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> respectively. It was concluded that the infused free [C]CT interacted with DCT and entered the protein and fibre-bound DCT pools. The loss of DCT during passage through the intestines was considered to be a consequence of either absorption of free CT or the degradation products of CT. It was assumed that free CT arose in the lower gastrointestinal tract from protein-CT and fibre-CT dissociation to be digested and/or absorbed. The higher recoveries of [C]CT in faeces (32 and 35 %) compared with DCT (27 and 26 %) for <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> respectively) were associated with the excretion of [C] degradation products or conjugates which were not reactive to butanol-HCl.
