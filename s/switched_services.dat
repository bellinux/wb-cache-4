40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{constant}} efforts to improve mobile system performance and spectral efficiency, the 3 GPP standardization forum is currently defining new architectural and functional requirements that hope to ensure long-term evolution (specifically defined as the “Long-Term Evolution (LTE) concept”) and general future competitiveness of the 2 G and 3 G radio access technologies. Previous discussions on LTE efficiency have been focused on general assumptions on signaling overhead and overall system capacity, based on experience from existing mobile systems. However, as 3 GPP standardization has become more mature (although not yet settled), {{there is a need to}} investigate how different potential LTE services will be affected by the use of available overhead information and basic scheduling algorithms.

40|$|TeraNet is an {{experimental}} optical network which offers user access rates {{as high as}} one Gigabit per second (Gbps). The network provides both circuit switching and ATM packet switching in a hierarchical fashion.

Circuit <b>switched</b> <b>services</b> interface to the passive optical `ether' through Media Interface Units (MIU). A 3 x 3 switching node called Network Interface Unit (NIU), with 1 Gbps capacity per port, is used as an ATM access port to the packet switching layer.

40|$|The {{security}} {{architecture of the}} 3 G-WLAN integrated networks specifies that a WLAN user, {{in order to get}} access to the 3 G packet <b>switched</b> <b>services</b> or the public internet through the 3 G PLMN, he must follow a two-pass EAP-AKA authentication procedure. This involves a double execution of EAP-AKA, which introduces a duplicated authentication overhead. This paper proposes a one-pass EAP-AKA authentication procedure for the 3 G-WLAN integrated networks that reduces significantly the authentication traffic, compared to the two-pass EAP-AKA authentication, without compromising the provided level of security. The proposed procedure has minimal impact on the existing 3 G-WLAN network infrastructure and functionality. A security analysis of the proposed authentication procedure is elaborated that identifies potential attacks and proposes possible countermeasures. In addition, a cost analysis is considered that compares the total number of messages required for user’s authentication using the two-pass EAP-AKA and the proposed one-pass EAP-AKA authentication.
