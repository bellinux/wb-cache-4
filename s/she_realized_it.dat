500|$|... "All Is Full of Love", {{the closing}} track of Homogenic, was the album's last song {{to be written}} and recorded. Produced by Björk, the {{original}} version of the song was replaced [...] "at the last minute" [...] by Howie B's version. It {{was inspired by the}} spring while producing the album in Málaga, Spain. After living in the mountains among other people for six months, Björk felt lonely, but a morning walk in April inspired her to write the track. She had a rough winter and then <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was spring after she could hear the birds singing. She wrote and recorded the song in half a day.|$|E
500|$|As {{members of}} the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City, inevitably the group drifted apart. By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken. Edna Ferber said <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> when {{she arrived at the}} Rose Room for lunch one day in 1932 and found the group's table {{occupied}} by a family from Kansas. Frank Case was asked what happened to the group. He shrugged and replied, [...] "What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second Street? These things do not last forever." [...] Some {{members of the}} group remained friends after its dissolution. Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945, although her political leanings did strain their relationship. Others, as the group itself would come to understand when it gathered following Woollcott's death in 1943, simply realized that they had nothing to say to one another.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{started to}} {{participate}} in climbing competitions in the mid-1980s, but {{one of her first}} significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to free climb Ophir Broke in Ophir, Colorado, which has a difficulty rating of 5.12d and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said [...] "that's when I knew for certain that this woman had extraordinary talent". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates {{the reason for this is}} that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: [...] "The big lesson for me... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't even imagine gripping... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first video showed Sherrod {{describing}} {{an experience}} of working with a white man seeking help to save his farm. She struggled with helping him {{at a time when}} many black people were losing their land. In the excerpt, she says [...] "So, I didn’t give him the full force of what I could do."

2500|$|An Nanba {{was born}} in Tokyo on March 7, 1984. She says she was very {{outgoing}} as a high-school student and looked much older than her age. She had met scouts from the AV industry often but only decided to begin an AV career after she was robbed and needed the money. She had done some gravure model work for Bejean {{a few months before}} and she thought she was again doing photographs for a magazine and was shocked when <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was a video shoot. The title of her debut video, Number.1!, released in October 2002 by Moodyz when she was 18, is a play on her name (in Japanese name order, Nanba An sounds close to English [...] "Number One").|$|E

2500|$|During {{appearances}} on 20/20 and The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive with Stephen Fry, Fisher publicly discussed her diagnosis of bipolar disorder and her addictions to cocaine and prescription medication. She said her drug use {{was a form}} of self-medication; she used pain medication such as Percodan to [...] "dial down" [...] the manic aspect of her bipolar disorder. She gave nicknames to her bipolar moods: Roy ("the wild ride of a mood") and Pam ("who stands on the shore and sobs"). [...] "Drugs made me feel more normal", she explained to Psychology Today in 2001. [...] "They contained me." [...] She discussed her 2008 memoir Wishful Drinking and various topics in it with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today that same year, and also revealed that she would have turned down the role of Princess Leia had <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> would give her the celebrity status that made her parents' lives difficult. This interview was followed by a similar appearance on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on December 12, 2008, where she discussed her electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments. At one point, she received ECT every six weeks to [...] "blow apart the cement" [...] in her brain. In 2014, she said she was no longer receiving the treatment.|$|E
