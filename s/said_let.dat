25|$|Under these {{circumstances}} any political bargaining {{might well have}} been disastrous to Home Rule. Redmond desperately wanted and needed a rapid enactment of the Home Rule Act, and undoubtedly his words were a means to that end. He called on the country to support the Allied and British war effort and Britain's commitment under the Triple Entente; this was a calculated response to the situation principally in the belief that the attained measure of self-government would be granted in full after the war and to be in a stronger position to stave off a final partition of Northern Ireland. His added hope was that the common sacrifice by Irish nationalists and Unionists would bring them closer together, but above all that nationalists could not afford to allow Ulster Unionists to reap the benefit of being the only Irish to support the war effort, when they spontaneously enlisted in their 36th (Ulster) Division. He <b>said</b> <b>Let</b> Irishmen come together in the trenches and risk their lives together and spill their blood together, and I say there is no power on earth that when they come home can induce them to turn as enemies upon one another.|$|E
500|$|... "I Stay in Love" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, {{taken from}} her {{eleventh}} studio album, E=MC² (2008). It was written by Carey, Bryan-Michael Cox, Adonis Shropshire and Kendrick Dean, and produced by the former two. [...] "I Stay in Love" [...] was released through Island Records on October 28, 2008, as the fourth and final single from the album. [...] Drawing influence from the [...] R music genre, the song features a piano and keyboard-driven melody, and a strong accompanying drum-beat. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting [...] "her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track." [...] She describes the old time she shared with her love interest. She narrates that even though they <b>said</b> <b>let</b> go, and that she is aware {{that there is nothing}} left in their relationship, she still [...] "stays in love with him".|$|E

What price did you put on rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling that being shaped by God? God <b>said,</b> <b>Let</b> us make man in our own image and likeness. If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, who is he that sets his own power above God's?" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Alkan's {{compositions}} {{from this period}} were never performed and have been lost. Among the missing works are some string sextets and a full-scale orchestral symphony in B minor, which was described {{in an article in}} 1846 by the critic Léon Kreutzer, to whom Alkan had shown the score. Kreutzer noted that the introductory adagio of the symphony was headed [...] "by Hebrew characters in red ink... This is no less than the verse from Genesis: And God <b>said,</b> <b>Let</b> there be light: and there was light." [...] Kreutzer opined that, set beside Alkan's conception, Joseph Haydn's Creation was a [...] "mere candle (lampion)." [...] A further missing work is a one-act opera, mentioned frequently in the French musical press of 1846-7 as being shortly to be produced at the Opéra-Comique, which however never materialized. Alkan also referred to this work in a letter of 1847 to the musicologist François-Joseph Fétis, stating that it had been written [...] "a few years ago." [...] Its subject, title and librettist remain unknown.|$|E
500|$|... "Cruise Control", {{featuring}} reggae artist Damian Marley, {{is influenced}} by R and reggae, and finds her adapting to the genre by imitating Jamaican phrases, accents and styles of singing. [...] "I Stay in Love" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from the album. Written by Carey and Bryan-Michael Cox, is a mid-tempo [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that {{is influenced by}} pop and RB& music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. Its lyrics find Carey as her most vulnerable; she describes old times she shared with her lover, and that even though [...] "we <b>said</b> <b>let</b> go", and [...] "inside she knows it's over", she still [...] "stays in love with him". Featuring American rapper Young Jeezy, [...] "Side Effects" [...] describes Carey's abusive relationship with Tommy Mottola, her ex-husband. During the first verse, she discusses the pair's background, and how {{she was young and}} naive, and believed everything he preached to her. The lyrics read [...] "Keepin' me there, under your thumb / Cause you were scared that I'd become much / More than you could handle," [...] she confesses, and refers to herself as [...] "Shining like a chandelier / That decorated every room inside / The private hell we built / And I dealt with it / Like a kid I wished / I could fly away." [...] Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe described it as [...] "another look at her fractious marriage to Mottola", and wrote [...] "Although the union ended in 1998, Carey is still suffering, including dreams of the 'violent times' and 'sleeping with the enemy'. Interestingly, her vocal approach here is almost emo, as she hits her rock-solid middle register and refuses to be held captive by the demons of her past."

2500|$|Creation {{science is}} based largely upon {{chapters}} 1–11 of the Book of Genesis. These describe how God calls {{the world into}} existence {{through the power of}} speech ("And God <b>said,</b> <b>Let</b> there be light," [...] etc.) in six days, calls all the animals and plants into existence, and molds the first man from clay and the first woman from a rib taken from the man's side; a worldwide flood destroys all life except for Noah and his family and representatives of the animals, and Noah becomes the ancestor of the 70 [...] "nations" [...] of the world; the nations live together until the incident of the Tower of Babel, when God disperses them and gives them their different languages. Creation science rarely goes beyond biblical stories in its study, and attempts to explain history and science within the span of Biblical chronology, which places the initial act of creation some six thousand years ago.|$|E

[...] "They have, {{in the same manner as}} Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long way, they have pierced deep into Africa, and have come a long way into Europe – and then we have to fight back." [...] He was because of the speech criticised by politicians and religious leaders within Norway. Some days later, the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco, and chargé d'affaires of Tunisia made an unusually strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper Aftenposten.|$|E
2500|$|I am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad, king of Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I have reigned {{after my}} father. And I have built this {{sanctuary}} for Chemosh in Karchah, a sanctuary of salvation, for he saved me from all aggressors, {{and made me}} look upon all mine enemies with contempt. Omri was king of Israel, and oppressed Moab during many days, and Chemosh was angry with his aggressions. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab. In my days he <b>said,</b> <b>Let</b> us go, and I will see my desire upon him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy it for ever. Now Omri took the land of Madeba, and occupied it in his day, and {{in the days of}} his son, forty years. And Chemosh had mercy on it in my time. And I built Baal-meon and made therein the ditch, and I built Kiriathaim. And the men of Gad dwelled in the country of Ataroth from ancient times, and the king of Israel fortified Ataroth. I assaulted the wall and captured it, and killed all the warriors of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and Moab, and I removed from it all the spoil, and offered it before Chemosh in Kirjath; and I placed therein the men of Siran, and the men of Mochrath. And Chemosh said to me, Go take Nebo against Israel, and I went in the night and I fought against it from the break of day till noon, and I took it: and I killed in all seven thousand men, but I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-Chemosh; and I took from it the vessels of Jehovah, and offered them before Chemosh. And the king of Israel fortified Jahaz, and occupied it, when he made war against me, and Chemosh drove him out before me, and I took from Moab two hundred men in all, and placed them in Jahaz, and took it to annex it to Dibon. I built Karchah the wall of the forest, and the wall of the Hill. I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel. I built Aroer, and I made the road across the Arnon. I took Beth-Bamoth for it was destroyed. I built Bezer for it was cut down by the armed men of Daybon, for all Daybon was now loyal; and I reigned from Bikran, which I added to my land. And I built Beth-Gamul, and Beth-Diblathaim, and Beth Baal-Meon, and I placed there the poor people of the land. And as to Horonaim, the men of Edom dwelt therein, on the descent from old.
