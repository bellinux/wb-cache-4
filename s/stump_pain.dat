40|$|AbstractBackgroundPain {{and other}} sensations from an amputated or absent limb, called phantom pain and phantom sensations, are {{well-known}} phenomena. ObjectiveThe {{aim of this}} retrospective study was to evaluate the effects of anesthetic techniques on phantom pain, phantom sensations, and <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> after lower limb amputation. MethodsNinety-two patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to III were analyzed for 1 to 24 months after lower limb amputation in this retrospective study. Patients received general, spinal, or epidural anesthesia or peripheral nerve block for their amputations. Standardized questions {{were used to assess}} phantom limb pain, phantom sensation, and <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> postoperatively. Pain intensity was assessed on a numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10. Patients' medical histories were determined from hospital records. ResultsPatients who received epidural anesthesia and peripheral nerve block perceived significantly less pain in the week after surgery compared with patients who received general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia (NRS [SD] values, 2. 68 [1. 0] and 2. 70 [1. 0], respectively). After approximately 14 to 17 months, {{there was no difference in}} phantom limb pain, phantom sensation, or <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> among the anesthetic techniques for amputation. ConclusionsIn patients undergoing lower limb amputation, performing epidural anesthesia or peripheral nerve block, instead of general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia, might attenuate phantom and <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> in the first week after operation. Anesthetic technique might not have an effect on phantom limb pain, phantom sensation, or <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> at 14 to 17 months after lower limb amputation...|$|E

Methods Thirteen patients (average age: 71 years ± 9), with unilateral vascular trans-tibial amputation since 10 months ago, used a shock absorber on the usual prosthesis. The patients were evaluated on a distance of 10 meters, on an outside walking track and on stairs with and without an absorber within an interval of one week. We measured oxygen consumption (VO 2) and heart rate. VO 2 was measured in environmental situations by portable system VmaxST sensor medic®. The evaluation of the prosthesis' comfort has been made with a questionnaire, the pain with a visual analogic rate scale. Results An overconsumption appeared during the test of the 10 meters for a patients fitted with a SACH foot. A significant decrease of the VO 2 was observed during the going up. Shock absorber allowed a comfort improvement notably during the going up and down stairs respectively for 78 and 67 % of the patients.

40|$|Phantom pain in {{subjects}} with an amputated limb is a well-known problem. However, estimates of the prevalence of phantom pain differ considerably in the literature. Various factors associated with phantom pain have been described including pain before the amputation, gender, dominance, and time elapsed since the amputation. The {{purposes of this study}} were to determine prevalence and factors associated with phantom pain and phantom sensations in upper limb amputees in The Netherlands. Additionally, the relationship between phantom pain, phantom sensations and prosthesis use in upper limb amputees was investigated. One hundred twenty-four upper Limb amputees participated in this study. Subjects were asked to fill out a self-developed questionnaire scoring the following items: date, side, level, and reason of amputation, duration of experienced pain before amputation, frequencies with which phantom sensations, phantom pain, and <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> are experienced, amount of trouble and suffering experienced, respectively, related to these sensations, type of phantom sensations, medical treatment received for phantom pain and/or <b>stump</b> <b>pain,</b> and the effects of the treatment, sc:lf medication, and prosthesis use. The response rate was 80 %. The prevalence of phantom pain was 51 %, of phantom sensations 76 % and of <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> 49 %; 48 % of the subjects experienced phantom pain a few times per day or more; 64 % experienced moderate to very much suffering from the phantom pain. A significant association was found between phantom pain and phantom sensations (relative risk 11. 3) and between phantom pain and <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> (relative risk 1. 9). No other factors associated with phantom pain or phantom sensations could be determined. Only four patients received medical treatment for their phantom pain.

5000|$|Until recently, the {{dominant}} hypothesis {{for the cause}} of phantom limbs was irritation in the severed nerve endings (called [...] "neuromas"). When a limb is amputated, many severed nerve endings are terminated at the residual limb. These nerve endings can become inflamed, and were thought to send anomalous signals to the brain. These signals, being functionally nonsense, were thought to be interpreted by the brain as pain. Treatments based on this hypothesis were generally failures. In extreme cases, surgeons would perform a second amputation, shortening the stump, with the hope of removing the inflamed nerve endings and causing temporary relief from the phantom pain. But instead, the patients' phantom pains increased, and many were left with the sensation of both the original phantom limb, as well as a new phantom <b>stump,</b> with a <b>pain</b> all its own. In some cases, surgeons even cut the sensory nerves leading into the spinal cord or in extreme cases, even removed the part of the thalamus that receives sensory signals from the body.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether a special prosthetic training in phantom limb pain patients aimed at increasing the functional use of the prosthesis leads to neural morphological plasticity of brain structures and a reduction in phantom limb pain. For chronic pain disorders, it was shown that morphological alterations due to pain might become at least partially reversed by pain therapies. Phantom limb pain is a chronic pain disorder that is frequently followed by neural plasticity of anatomical brain structures. In our study, 10 patients with amputation of the upper limb participated in a two-week training with a myoelectric prosthesis with somatosensory feedback. Grip strength was fed back with electrocutaneous stimulus patterns applied to the <b>stump.</b> Phantom limb <b>pain</b> was assessed before and after the two-week training. Similarly, two T 1 weighted MRI scans were conducted for longitudinal thickness analyses of cortical brain structures. As result of this treatment, patients experienced a reduction in phantom limb pain and a gain in prosthesis functionality.

40|$|Purpose : To analyse how {{decisions}} to dichotomise {{the frequency and}} impediment of phantom pain into absent and present influence the outcome of studies by performing a sensitivity analysis on an existing database. Method : Five hundred and thirty-six subjects were recruited from the database of an orthopaedic workshop and filled out a questionnaire in which the following items were assessed: demographics, side, date, level and reason of amputation, presence and frequency of phantom sensations, phantom pain and <b>stump</b> <b>pain,</b> and impediment due to phantom pain. Results : The prevalence of phantom pain ranged from 7 - 72 % when different cut off points for the frequency of phantom pain were applied. The significance of the various risk factors for the prevalence of phantom pain changed when different cut off points were applied. Only <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> and phantom sensations were significant risk factors for all cut off points.

40|$|Implication {{for health}} policy/practice/research/medical education: The {{phenomenon}} of {{phantom limb pain}} remains poorly understood. As of this writing, no successful treatment exists and these pa-tients continue to suffer from significant pain and disabilities. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of using pulsed radiofre-quency on the dorsal root ganglia at the L 4 and L 5 nerve roots to improve phantom pain. 3) Stump pain: localized pain in the amputated region (1). The location and characteristics of the sensation are important in controlling the pain. <b>Stump</b> <b>pain</b> usually coincides with the development of phantom limb pain (2). Phantom pain has intermittent quality, which demonstrates neuropathic features, such as gripping, burning, squeezing, and drilling, and can be more intense in the furtherest part of the phantom, such as fingers, hands, and toes (3). The incidence of phantom limb pain can be as high as 60 to 80 % (1). In a previous study, the visual analogue scale (VAS) of patients ranged from 2 to 7 on a 10 -point scale (4).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with lower}} {{extremity}} amputation frequently suffer from socket-related problems. This seriously limits prosthesis use, {{level of activity}} and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). An additional problem in patients with lower extremity amputation are asymmetries in gait kinematics possibly accounting for back pain. Bone-anchored prostheses (BAPs) are a possible solution for socket-related problems. Knowledge concerning the level of function, activity and HRQoL after surgery is limited. The aims of this ongoing study are to: a) describe changes {{in the level of}} function, activity, HRQoL and satisfaction over time compared to baseline before surgery; b) examine potential predictors for changes in kinematics, prosthetic use, walking ability, HRQoL, prosthesis comfort over time and level of <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> at follow-up; c) examine potential mechanisms for change of back pain over time by identifying determinants, moderators and mediators. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective 5 -year longitudinal study with multiple follow-ups. All adults, between May 2014 and May 2018, with lower extremity amputation receiving a press-fit BAP are enrolled consecutively. Patients with socket-related problems and trauma, tumour resection or stable vascular disease as cause of primary amputation will be included. Exclusion criteria are severe cognitive or psychiatric disorders. Follow-ups are planned at six-months, one-, two- and five-years after BAP surgery. The main study outcomes follow, in part, the ICF classification: a) level of function defined as kinematics in coronal plane, hip abductor strength, prosthetic use, back pain and stump pain; b) level of activity defined as mobility level and walking ability; c) HRQoL; d) satisfaction defined as prosthesis comfort and global perceived effect. Changes over time for the continuous outcomes and the dichotomized outcome (back pain) will be analysed using generalised estimating equations (GEE). Multivariate GEE will be used to identify potential predictors for change of coronal plane kinematics, prosthetic use, walking ability, HRQoL, prosthesis comfort and for the level of post-operative <b>stump</b> <b>pain.</b> Finally, potential mechanisms for change in back pain frequency will be explored using coronal plane kinematics as a potential determinant, <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> as moderator and hip abductor strength as mediator.

30|$|Generally, {{the quality}} of life of a lower-limb amputee with a {{functional}} stump is similar to that of an average person [6]. Consequently, a technically well-constructed stump must be the objective of the orthopaedic surgeon. Unfortunately, many amputations are delegated to less experienced orthopaedic surgeons or even to medical residents, which can lead to poor functional results, chronic <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> and prosthetisation difficulties. In the classical transtibial amputation, the fibula is osteotomised approximately 1  cm shorter than the tibia, avoiding an excessive concentration of pressure at this location during the gait after prosthetisation. The common complications with this technique may require stump revisions and result in high late-morbidity rates [7].|$|E

Many risk factors have been identified for phantom Pain in univariate analyses, including phantom sensations, <b>stump</b> <b>Pain,</b> pain prior to the amputation, cause of amputation, prosthesis use, and years elapsed since amputation. Multivariate analyses are lacking in the literature and, therefore, no estimation of an overall risk for phantom pain can be made The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze risk factors in a multivariate analysis in 536 Subjects (19 % upper limb amputees and 81 % lower limb amputees), These subjects filled out a questionnaire in which the following items were assessed; side, date, Level, and reason Of amputation, pre-amputation pain, presence or absence of phantom pain, phantom sensations and or <b>stump</b> <b>pain,</b> and prosthesis use.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to investigate the relationship between adjustments to amputation and artificial limb, and quality of life (QoL), and to analyse the influence of sociodemographic, medical and amputation-related factors on this relationship. Patients with unilateral and noncongenital lower limb amputation who were using artificial limb were interviewed (n= 368) using structured questionnaires. The Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales (TAPES) were used to assess adjustments to amputation and artificial limb and the MOS Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36) was used to assess the physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary of QoL. Absence of comorbidity and residual <b>stump</b> <b>pain,</b> being employed, young age, less functional restriction, being more adjusted to limitation, increased social adjustment and less restriction in athletic activity were related to better PCS scores. Absence of comorbidity and phantom limb pain, nonuse of assistive device, being more adjusted to limitation, increased social adjustment and being less functionally restricted were related to higher MCS scores. Comorbidity had a modifying effect on both PCS and MCS scores. In addition, age, being employed and residual <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> had a modifying influence on PCS, whereas assistive device use and phantom limb pain had a modifying influence on MCS. Our findings show that TAPES subscales have a modifying effect on the associations between several background (sociodemographic and amputation characteristics) and QoL (PCS and MCS).

40|$|Chronic pain is {{pain that}} has been present {{for more than three}} months. Chronic pain may affect all aspects of a person’s life. It is thought that there is no cure for chronic pain and that {{therefore}} chronic pain may only be managed. Within chronic pain, phantom limb pain is prevalent in individuals who have had amputations. Phantom limb phenomena includes phantom limb pain, phantom limb sensation and <b>stump</b> <b>pain.</b> Phantom limb pain differs from phantom limb sensation where sensations; such as itching and burning are experienced in the missing limb. Whereas with phantom limb pain, it is pain that is experienced in the missing limb. Phantom limb pain is often described as a shooting, burning or crushing pain. <b>Stump</b> <b>pain</b> is usually experienced at the point of amputation where nerves may have been severed as a result of trauma or an elected amputation. Occupational therapists use meaningful occupations in their occupational therapy interventions to enhance occupational performance. A meaningful occupation is a subjective activity that the individual participates in and is a unique experience to them. From the literature review many themes emerged on the relationship between chronic pain and participation in meaningful occupations. There was a lack of literature on occupational therapy and phantom limb pain. The role of the occupational therapist was looked at in relation to evidence based practice and education of phantom limb pain. The biopsychosocial model emerged and its link with the social environment and other factors of phantom limb pain management such as catastrophizing. In this research proposal 10 participants will be positively selected from an amputation clinic in Scotland and semi-structured interviews will be used to collect data on the experiences of amputees, who experience phantom limb pain which may affect meaningful occupations {{and the role of the}} occupational therapist will also be considered in the management of phantom limb pain...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the {{efficacy}} of a single 60 min application of capsaicin 8 % patch in reducing chronic amputation stump and phantom limb pain, associated hypersensitivity with quantitative sensory testing, and changes in brain cortical maps using functional MRI (fMRI) scans. Methods: A capsaicin 8 % patch (Qutenza) treatment study was conducted on 14 patients with single limb amputation, who reported pain intensity on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale ≥ 4 / 10 for chronic stump or phantom limb pain. Pain assessments, quantitative sensory testing, and fMRI (for the lip pursing task) were performed at baseline and 4 weeks after application of capsaicin 8 % patch to the amputation stump. The shift into the hand representation area of the cerebral cortex with the lip pursing task has been correlated with phantom limb pain intensity in previous studies, and was the fMRI clinical model for cortical plasticity used in this study. Results: The mean reduction in spontaneous amputation <b>stump</b> <b>pain,</b> phantom limb pain, and evoked <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> were − 1. 007 (p= 0. 028), − 1. 414 (p= 0. 018), and − 2. 029 (p= 0. 007), respectively. The areas of brush allodynia and pinprick hypersensitivity in the amputation stump showed marked decreases: − 165 cm 2, − 80 % (p= 0. 001) and − 132 cm 2, − 72 % (p= 0. 001), respectively. fMRI analyses provided objective evidence of the restoration of the brain map, that is, reversal of the shift into the hand representation of the cerebral cortex with the lip pursing task (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The results show that capsaicin 8 % patch treatment leads to significant reduction in chronic pain and, particularly, in the area of stump hypersensitivity, which may enable patients to wear prostheses, thereby improving mobility and rehabilitation.

40|$|Phantom limb pain is uncommon, with an {{incidence}} of 1 – 2 cases per 100, 000 individuals, but presents a significant burden to the patient, affecting up to 85 % of amputees. 19 <b>Stump</b> <b>pain</b> usually occurs {{at some time}} during the first month following amputation and resolves in many patients after 2 – 3 years without treat-ment, except in cases in which phantom pain develops. The {{incidence of}} phantom pain is variable but increases with more proximal amputations. The origin and patho-physiological mechanisms of phantom pain are not clear-ly defined. However, both peripheral and central neural mechanisms have been described, along with superim-posed psychological mechanisms. The management of phantom limb pain has little evidence base in the sci-entific literature; while numerous treatments have been described, there is little clinical evidence supporting any particular therapy.

40|$|A {{systematic}} descriptive {{survey was}} carried out on a clinic population with acquired upper limb amputation in which clear distinctions were made between phantom experiences, pre‐amputation pain and <b>stump</b> <b>pain.</b> It was found that of 76 participants 96 % reported phantom experiences and 84 % were currently experiencing phantom limb phenomena (PLP). Sixty‐nine percent (69 %) of those currently experiencing phantom phenomena stated that the phantoms were painful. Significant relationships were found between frequency of phantom experiences and side and level of amputation. In addition, the presence of ‘trigger’ points reported by a sub group of participants {{was found to be}} associated with the frequency of phantoms and painful phantoms. This finding could provide support for cortical reorganisation post amputation. It is suggested that detailed individual ‘profiling’ of phantom experiences is important and would have the following implications: it would contribute to existing knowledge and provide new insights into the central nervous system's reorganisation post‐amputation; it would provide an accurate way of representing amputees’ anomalous perceptions; it would alert health professionals to the presence, variety and extent of PLP following amputation...|$|E
40|$|Most amputees {{experience}} phantom limb sensations and/or {{phantom limb pain}} as well as {{residual limb}} (<b>stump)</b> <b>pain</b> that are resistant to treatment. Phantom phenomena are not homogeneous; each patient presents with a unique combination of spontaneous or evoked sensations, pain, and/or awareness. In an effort to understand the underlying mechanisms, postamputation pain has been subclassified based on the perceived sensory qualities reported by the individual. However, {{little is known about}} the relationship between subjective phantom phenomena and sensory function of the residual stump. The aim of the present study was to determine if sensory processing, as measured psychophysically, reflected subjective reports of specific qualities of phantom and/or stump sensory phenomena. Twelve individuals who had recently (within 6 months) undergone traumatic unilateral upper extremity amputation participated in the study. Limb temperature, thermal thresholds, tactile sensory thresholds and tactile spatial acuity were compared between the residual limb and the intact limb, and related to patient reports of specific stump and phantom sensory phenomena. All but one subject reported phantom sensations and/or phantom pain. The remaining subject reported only <b>stump</b> <b>pain.</b> Mean skin temperature of the residual limb was significantly lower than that of the intact contralateral limb by approximately 0. 9 °C in the proximal portion of the stump and 1. 7 °C at the stump tip. However, the temperature of the stump (compared with the intact limb) did not reflect subjective reports of stump or phantom limb thermal characteristics. Thermal threshold abnormalities differed among patients, and did not suggest any pattern of small fibre loss of function or generalized hyperexcitability. Other than within grafted tissue or near the scar area, skin areas that the patient described as abnormally sensitive or tender to touch were not accompanied by corresponding abnormalities in static tactile thresholds or tactile spatial acuity. Tactile spatial acuity was heightened near the scar area only. The proportion of subjects who had decreased two-point discrimination thresholds at the stump did not differ significantly according to the reporting or non-reporting of dual percepts. Thus, despite a common injury, the sensory abnormalities varied within this cohort of subjects. In addition, psychophysical threshold measures of sensory function did not reflect, in any simple way, subjective phantom phenomena. Therefore, classification of phantom phenomena based on peripheral sensory function may be a misleading step in the search for specific mechanisms underlying postamputation sensory phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Modern sockets {{for lower}} limb amputees utilize total contact and {{distribute}} some {{weight on the}} stump end. Its tolerance to bear weight varies but is better after joint disarticulation, however, systematic measures have been missing. Different levels, indications, shapes etc. were analysed with 102 measurements in 69 patients. The maximal-end-weight-bearing of the stump measured on a scale was much lower after transmedullar amputations than after disarticulations. Men had a mean tolerance more than 15 kg but women less than 10 kg. There was a positive correlation to body weight. Diabetics tolerated significantly more end-bearing and patients with phantom pain more than patients with <b>stump</b> <b>pain.</b> Within each category of stumps the range of maximal end-weight-bearing was large. Among all below-knee amputees the tolerance was between 2 to 55 kg or 3 to 79 per cent of body weight. Pointed stumps statistically tolerated {{about as much as}} rounded ones and the variability of contact surface was not measured as its sensitivity to pain must be unevenly distributed. It is concluded that this simplified method is helpful to analyse pain and to modify end-weight-bearing more individually...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Walking {{ability in}} general and {{specifically}} for lower limb amputees is of major importance for social mobility and ADL independence. Walking determines prosthesis prescription. The {{aim of this study}} was to mathematically analyse factors influencing claimed walking distance of lower limb amputees of 500 m or more. Method: A total of 437 patients returned two questionnaires: the Groningen Questionnaire Problems after Leg Amputation, in which walking distance was assessed, and the RAND 36. Results: The chance of walking 500 m or more reduced when a transfemoral amputation was performed. The chance reduced even more when phantom pain or stump pains were present. If the amputation was performed because of vascular disease or because of vascular problems because of diabetes the chance reduced again. Independently of these factors, age reduced the chance of walking 500 m or more. Conclusion: The chance of walking 500 m or more reduces with increase in age and a more proximal amputation. The chance reduces even further when the amputation is performed because of diabetes or a vascular disease and also if phantom pain and or <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> is present...|$|E

Methods: A capsaicin 8 % patch (Qutenza) treatment study was conducted on 14 patients with single limb amputation, who reported pain intensity on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale ≥ 4 / 10 for chronic stump or phantom limb pain. Pain assessments, quantitative sensory testing, and fMRI (for the lip pursing task) were performed at baseline and 4 weeks after application of capsaicin 8 % patch to the amputation stump. The shift into the hand representation area of the cerebral cortex with the lip pursing task has been correlated with phantom limb pain intensity in previous studies, and was the fMRI clinical model for cortical plasticity used in this study. Results: The mean reduction in spontaneous amputation <b>stump</b> <b>pain,</b> phantom limb pain, and evoked <b>stump</b> <b>pain</b> were − 1. 007 (p= 0. 028), − 1. 414 (p= 0. 018), and − 2. 029 (p= 0. 007), respectively. The areas of brush allodynia and pinprick hypersensitivity in the amputation stump showed marked decreases: − 165 cm 2, − 80 % (p= 0. 001) and − 132 cm 2, − 72 % (p= 0. 001), respectively. fMRI analyses provided objective evidence of the restoration of the brain map, that is, reversal of the shift into the hand representation of the cerebral cortex with the lip pursing task (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The results show that capsaicin 8 % patch treatment leads to significant reduction in chronic pain and, particularly, in the area of stump hypersensitivity, which may enable patients to wear prostheses, thereby improving mobility and rehabilitation. Phantom limb pain (“central” pain) and associated brain plasticity may be modulated by peripheral inputs, as they can be ameliorated by the peripherally restricted effect of the capsaicin 8 % patch.

40|$|Several {{postoperative}} complications {{associated with}} pain may {{develop in the}} stump of an amputated lower limb. Clinical findings are often nonspecific; however, radiologic evaluation, especially with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, is useful in the early diagnosis of these com-plications, thereby helping minimize physical disability with its psycho-logic and socioeconomic implications. Conventional radiography can demonstrate evidence of osseous origins of pain (eg, aggressive bone edge, heterotopic ossification, osteomyelitis) and {{should be the first}} imaging study performed after clinical examination. Videofluoroscopy can help evaluate improper prosthetic fit by demonstrating abnormal residual limb motion, piston action, rolling of soft tissues, and abnor-mal angle between the limb axis and the prosthesis during gait. Ultra-sonography can demonstrate inflammatory changes in the stump as well as soft-tissue fluid collections. However, MR imaging is the mo-dality of choice when clinical and other imaging findings are indeter-minate. Because of its high spatial and contrast resolution, MR imag-ing can demonstrate subtle inflammatory changes, fluid collections, cancers, neuromas, and subtle traumatic bone lesions. Knowledge of various surgical and rehabilitation techniques is required for accurate diagnosis of complications associated with <b>stump</b> <b>pain.</b> Correct diag-nosis allows choice of the most appropriate therapy, which may involve treating the stump, remodeling the prosthesis, or both...|$|E
