40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{control design}} for distributed systems, where the controller is to adopt {{and preserve the}} spatial structure of the <b>system.</b> Specifically <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> vary spatially <b>are</b> considered; namely those <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not shift invariant with respect to spatial variables. Operator theoretic tools for working with these systems are developed, and lead to convex conditions for analysis and synthesis {{with respect to the}} ` 2 -induced norm. 1. Introduction In this paper we consider controller synthesis for <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> distributed spatially and potentially time varying. Our general motivation is to develop tools for dealing with physical <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> inherently distributed, as well as the increasing number of <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> distributed because they are comprised of distributed interacting subsystems. The specific motivation for this paper is to develop synthesis methods which can <b>be</b> applied to <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> spatially varying.

5|$|A new county-designated highway {{appeared}} on maps {{for the first}} time in 1983, H-16; it was marked as running between US2 and M-28 only. This designation was removed in the 1985 edition of the map.

The roadway is part of the Forest Highway <b>System</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> funded and administered by the US Forest Service and the Federal Highway Administration; the system was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921.

They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E
5|$|Gunfights {{are a major}} {{gameplay}} mechanic in Red Dead Redemption. The {{player can}} take cover, target a specific person or animal, blindfire, and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, {{in order to take}} targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the AI reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player character can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted Gatling guns, and cannons. Duels utilize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> used in a bullet time-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.|$|E
