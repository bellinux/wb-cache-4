40|$|Regional {{climate changes}} are often {{associated}} with changes in <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> patterns. For example, an enhanced jet normally brings more precipitation to the region, and stationary troughs are often more cloudier than regions of stationary ridges. Therefore understanding the changes in <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> patterns due to greenhouse gas increases will help highlight the causes for the corresponding changes in local climate. Many previous studies found the El Niño type of response in the coupled Ocean-Atmosphere model due to the increases of green house gases (e. g., Meehl et. al. 2000 a). This raises an interesting {{question as to whether}} the <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> response to global warming is similar to that during an El Niño. Stephenson and Held (1993) have studied <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> changes in winter in the R 15 general circulation model (GCM). They found an El Niño-like response whose maintenance mechanism is very similar to that during El Niño. Due to the low-resolution of their model, they cautioned that the high-resolution results may differ due to differences in transient eddy activities. Using a higher resolution R 30 GFDL coupled ocean atmosphere model, we find that the seasonal <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> responses are indeed El Niño-like. However, using a linear baroclinic <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> model to understand the role of different forcing terms in maintaining the <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> changes, we find that unlike in an El Niño situation, where the heating and transient response act in phase to produce th...|$|R

The kinetic energy distribution of the associated wind field displays peaks in the tropics and northern mid-latitudes in January, but only a tropical peak in February. These analyses support the Eliassen-Palm relationship for latitudinal momentum and geopotential wave transport, particularly in the mid-latitudes.

40|$|The {{parameterization}} of orographic drag {{processes in}} atmospheric models remains uncertain {{due to a}} lack of observational and theoretical constraints on their formulation and free parameters. While previous studies have demonstrated that parameterized orographic drag acting near the surface has a significant impact on the atmospheric circulation, this work follows a more systematic approach to investigate its impacts on the large scale circulation and the circulation response to climate change. A set of experiments with a comprehensive atmospheric general circulation model is used to ascertain the range of climatological circulations that may arise from parameter uncertainty. It is found that the Northern Hemisphere (NH) wintertime <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> field is strongly damped over the North Pacific (NP) and amplified over the North Atlantic (NA) as a result of increased low-level parameterized orographic drag, both of which are shown to be conducive to higher-latitude westerlies. A comparison with the <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> field presented in other studies suggests that the too zonal NA jet and equatorward NP jet biases that are prevalent in climate models may be at least partly due to their representation of orographic drag. The amplitude of the <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> response to climate change across the experiments is shown to scale with the magnitude of low-level parameterized orographic drag through its influence on the present-day climatological <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> amplitudes over different sectors of the NH, which is consistent with linear <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> theory.

50|$|In 1891, at the Academie des Sciences in Paris, Gabriel Lippmann {{presented}} a colour {{photograph of the}} Sun’s spectrum obtained with his new photographic plate. Later, in 1894, he published an article on how his plate was able to record colour information in the depth of photographic grainless gelatin and how the same plate after processing could restore the original colour image merely through light reflection. He was thus the inventor of true interferential colour photography. He received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for this breakthrough.Unfortunately, this principle was too complex to use. The method was abandoned {{a few years after}} its discovery. One aspect of the Lippmann concept that was ignored at that time relates to spectroscopic applications. Early in 1933, Ives proposed to use a photoelectric device to probe <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> to make spectrometric measurements. In 1995, P. Connes proposed to use the emerging new technology of detectors for three-dimensional Lippmann-based spectrometry. Following this, a first realization of a very compact spectrometer based on a micro-opto-electromechanical system (MOEMS) was reported by Knipp et al. in 2005, but it had a very limited spectral resolution.In 2004, two French researchers, Etienne Le Coarer from Joseph Fourier University and Pierre Benech from INP Grenoble, coupled sensing elements to the evanescent part of <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> within a single-mode waveguide. In 2007, those two researchers reported a near-field method to probe the interferogram within a waveguide.

50|$|The {{technology}} {{works by}} probing an optical <b>stationary</b> <b>wave,</b> or {{the sum of}} the standing waves in the case of polychromatic light, created by a light to be analyzed. In a SWIFTS linear configuration (true Lippman configuration), the <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> is created by a single-mode waveguide ended by a fixed mirror. The <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> is regularly sampled on one side of a waveguide using nano-scattering dots. These dots are located in the evanescent field. These nanodots are characterized by an optical index difference with the medium in which the evanescent field is located. The light is then scattered around an axis perpendicular to the waveguide. For each dot, this scattered light is detected by a pixel aligned with this axis. The intensity detected is therefore proportional to the intensity inside the waveguide at the exact location of the dot. This results in a linear image of the interferogram. No moving parts are used. A mathematical function known as a Lippmann transform, similar to a Fourier transform, is then applied to this linear image and gives the spectrum of the light.|$|R
