5|$|The {{most common}} {{visitors}} to the island are the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica baueri), grey-tailed tattler (Tringa brevipes), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres interpres), red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis) and curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea). Other observed visitors include the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo novaehollandiae), nankeen kestrel (Falco cenchroides cenchroides), banded lapwing (Vanellus tricolor), greater sand plover (Charadrius leschenaultii), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus variegatus), greenshank (Tringa nebularia), <b>sanderling</b> (Calidris alba), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys) and brown songlark (Cincloramphus cruralis).|$|E
5|$|Various {{insects and}} arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the stonefly, the mayfly, the caddisfly, the simulium, the {{subfamily}} of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked tussock moth, and the mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the <b>sanderling,</b> and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E

25|$|The atoll {{supports}} {{a large population}} of sea and shorebirds, with up to 26 species present. Species breeding during 1988 included the brown booby, red-footed booby, great frigatebird, red-tailed tropicbird, sooty tern, white tern, brown noddy, and possibly the reef heron. Migratory birds present included the bristle-thighed curlew, turnstone, wandering tattler, golden plover, and the <b>sanderling.</b> The densest bird populations are on three islets {{to the north of}} Sibylla: North (Kita), Kamwome and an unnamed islet. Bokak is the only known breeding ground of Christmas shearwater and possibly Bulwer's petrel.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the creatures}} found on the island include several {{different}} varieties of lizard and land crab. Gulls, frigates, and <b>sanderlings</b> are the most prevalent bird species.|$|R

50|$|Territories can be linear. <b>Sanderlings</b> (Calidris alba) forage on {{beaches and}} sandflats. When on beaches, they feed either in flocks or {{individual}} territories of 10 to 120 metres of shoreline.|$|R
25|$|The {{realm of}} birds is {{particularly}} plentiful. Amrum counts {{among the most}} important hatching areas for seabirds in Germany. It is the only remaining hatching area for the Eurasian curlew in the Wadden Sea, and the main hatching region for the common eider, but also oystercatchers, shelducks, Arctic terns, seagulls like herring gulls, common gull and the lesser black-backed gull as well as many other species use to hatch there on the beach, in between the dunes or at the mud flats. Since the dunes of Amrum are a protected nature reserve, they are the only dunes along the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein where sea gulls and ducks are breeding. In other dune areas of the North Sea coast these birds are usually scared off by tourists. Additionally vast swarms of migratory birds will rest on Amrum during the season, e.g. red knot, brent goose or <b>sanderling,</b> all of whom are able to find sufficient food along the coasts of Amrum. Moreover, a number of songbirds can be found and pheasants which were equally introduced as game are common.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Fleischmann {{turned to}} André Previn with {{the hopes that}} his {{conducting}} credentials and time spent at Hollywood Studios would add a local flair and enhance the connection between conductor, orchestra, and city. While Previn's tenure was musically satisfactory, other conductors including Kurt <b>Sanderling,</b> Simon Rattle, and Esa-Pekka Salonen, fared better at the box office. Previn clashed frequently with Fleischmann; one such conflict occurred over Fleischmann's failure to consult Previn over the decision to name Salonen as [...] "Principal Guest Conductor", a move mirroring the prior Solti/Mehta controversy. Because of Previn's objections, the position and Japan tour offer made to Salonen were withdrawn; however, shortly thereafter in April 1989, Previn resigned, and four months later, Salonen was named Music Director Designate, officially taking the post in October 1992. Salonen's U.S. conducting debut with the orchestra had been in 1984.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sanderlings</b> on Bathurst Island in the Canadian arctic {{have two}} {{patterns}} of incubation. At some nests {{the eggs are}} covered soon after the fourth egg has been laid and at others incubation is delayed for 5 – 6 days. Because the delay {{is about the same}} time required to lay a second clutch and because a single individual alone incubates at any one nest, we suspected that <b>Sanderlings</b> might normally lay two clutches in a season, the male caring for one brood and the female for the other. Histological and gross examination of the ovaries of two females taken as the birds began incubation showed eight freshly ovulated follicles in each female. The size gradation and histological appearance of the follicles indicated that two clutches of four eggs each had been laid within 8 – 10 days by a single female. The ovary of one female had additional large yolky follicles, suggesting a physiological capability of further ovulations. Field conditions in the arctic summer are highly variable, and the small eggs and the rapid sequence of broods of <b>Sanderlings</b> may be breeding adaptations that permit them to multiply the traditional wader clutch of four eggs by 2 or 3 in favourable years. Selection for mating systems characterised by brief pair bonds and by polyandry is expected in precocial birds where some broods are incubated and cared for by the male, but further field work is required to determine the precise mating system of <b>Sanderlings...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Sanderlings</b> (Calidris alba) are long-distance migratory {{shorebirds}} with a non-breeding {{range that}} spans temperate and tropical coastal habitats. Breeding in the High Arctic combined with non-breeding {{seasons in the}} tropics necessitate long migrations, which are energetically demanding. On an annual basis, the higher energy expenditures during migration might pay off if food availability in the tropics is higher than at temperate latitudes. We compared foraging behaviour of birds at a north temperate and a tropical non-breeding site in the Netherlands and Ghana, respectively. In both cases the birds used similar habitats (open beaches), and experienced similar periods of daylight, which enabled us to compare food abundance and availability, and behavioural time budgets and food intake. During the non-breeding season, <b>Sanderlings</b> in the Netherlands spent 79 % of their day foraging; in Ghana birds spent only 38 % of the daytime period foraging and the largest proportion of their time resting (58 %). The main prey item in the Netherlands was the soft-bodied polychaete Scolelepis squamata, while <b>Sanderlings</b> in Ghana fed almost exclusively on the bivalve Donax pulchellus, which they swallowed whole and crushed internally. Average availability of polychaete worms in the Netherlands was 7. 4 g ash free dry mass (AFDM) m− 2, which was one tenth of the 77. 1 g AFDM m− 2 estimated for the beach in Ghana. In the tropical environment of Ghana the <b>Sanderlings</b> combined relatively low energy requirements with high prey intake rates (1. 64 mg opposed to 0. 13 mg AFDM s− 1 for Ghana and the Netherlands respectively). Although this may suggest that the Ghana beaches are the most favourable environment, processing the hard-shelled bivalve (D. pulchellus) which is the staple food could be costly. The large amount of daytime spent resting in Ghana may be indicative of {{the time needed to}} process the shell fragments, rather than indicate rest...|$|R
