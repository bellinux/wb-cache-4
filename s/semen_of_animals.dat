40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar o efeito da adição de fontes de óleo e dos níveis de suplementação de vitamina E na ração sobre as características do sêmen suíno resfriado a 17 ºC e 5 ºC. Foram utilizados 24 suínos machos reprodutores Dalboar 85 distribuídos em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em arranjo fatorial 2 x 3, com duas fontes de óleo (soja e salmão) e três níveis de antioxidantes (150, 300 e 450 mg de vitamina E/kg). Nos animais sob suplementação com óleo de salmão, a motilidade e o teste hiposmótico dos espermatozoides após 24, 48 e 72 horas foram superiores aos observados nos animais alimentados com a ração com óleo de soja. O óleo de salmão aumentou o vigor em ambas as temperaturas avaliadas após 24 e 48 horas. A ocorrência de anormalidades morfológicas totais foi maior no sêmen dos animais sob suplementação com óleo de soja e resfriado a 17 ºC, enquanto na menor temperatura de resfriamento (5 º) não houve diferença entre os animais sob suplementação. A morfologia anormal no sêmen a 5 ºC foi maior que no sêmen resfriado a 17 ºC. O óleo de salmão melhora as características espermáticas do sêmen suíno resfriado a 17 e 5 ºC durante 24 a 48 horas.

40|$|The <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> man and <b>animals</b> is {{delivered}} from the urethra in a liquid state but differs thereafter in its properties in three principal ways. In the guinea pig {{it becomes an}} elastic solid which is maintained in this condition both in vitro and in the vagina for many days. The <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> the dog remains liquid. The ejaculate of normal man solidifies but then liquefies {{in a few minutes}} at room temperature. The solidification <b>of</b> the <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> the guinea pig is due to the action of an enzyme, vesiculase (1, 2) derived from a special region of the prostate (3) on the proteins of the seminal vesicle. No experiments have been reported dealing with the solid-liquid phases <b>of</b> human <b>semen</b> or with the persistence of the liquid state <b>of</b> canine <b>semen,</b> matters with which the present paper is concerned.

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of the risk of}} germline transmission of vector-coded sequences is critical for clinical translation of gene transfer strategies. We used rabbit models to analyze the risk of germline transmission of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Intravenous injection of AAV- 2 or AAV- 8 resulted in liver-mediated, long-term expression of therapeutic levels of human factor IX (hFIX) in a dose-dependent manner. In high-dose cohorts, AAV- 8 resulted in twofold higher levels of circulating hFIX and of vector DNA in liver compared to AAV- 2. Vector sequences were found in the <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> all rabbits. The kinetics of vector clearance from semen was dose- and time-dependent but serotype-independent. No late recurrence of AAV- 8 sequences was found in the semen over several consecutive cycles of spermatogenesis. In a novel rabbit model, AAV- 2 or AAV- 8 sequences were detected in the <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> vasectomized <b>animals</b> that lack germ cells. Therefore, structures of the genitourinary (GU) tract, as well as the testis, contribute significantly to vector shedding in the semen. Collectively, data from these two models suggest that the risk of inadvertent germline transmission in males by AAV- 8 vectors is low, similar to that of AAV- 2, and that AAV dissemination to the semen is in part modulated by host-dependent factors...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} safety <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> two {{approaches}} can be applied: checking the end product, or continuous surveillance of the bulls {{before and after}} semen production. The first method is examination <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> {{for the presence of}} infectious agents. This method depends completely on a single investigation and therefore relies only on the sensitivity of the test method. The second method is testing the bulls for diseases before and after semen collection, based on sequential investigations for the absence of either pathogens or antibodies against infectious agents. The EU-Directive 88 / 407 prescribes that bulls in AI stations must be monitored for the absence of diseases, but only at 12 -monthly intervals, which is a severe disadvantage. Furthermore, the directive is specific neither in the tests to be carried out nor in the specification of some pathogens (e. g. Campylobacter foetus). A programme is presented based on monthly testing of a limited number of bulls for the absence of endemic diseases only, on the basis of Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP). This method only applies to diseases with high transmission rates. Testing some 20 % <b>of</b> the <b>animals</b> on a monthly basis can monitor these highly contagious diseases (e. g. IBR). To monitor BVDv infections, however, monthly testing <b>of</b> all negative <b>animals</b> and semen culture or <b>semen</b> PCR <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> that have seroconverted for this virus seems necessary. Endemic diseases with slow transmission rates in bulls do not suit such a system and can only be monitored on an individual basis...|$|R

Clinical, serological and parasitemia exams were realized. Parasite investigation by bioassay and PCR was realized on <b>semen</b> and fragments <b>of</b> skeletal musculature, lymph nodes, brain, retina, spleen, liver, lung, testicle, epididymis and seminal vesicle. Blood and semen samples were collected on days - 2, - 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and weekly thereafter, up to postinfection day (PID) 84. The inoculated steers (GI and GII) presented hyperthermia from PID 3 to 16. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected through the indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) on PID 5 (1 : 16) in both inoculated groups (oocysts and tachyzoites), reaching peaks of 1 : 4096 on PID 7. Parasitemia outbursts occurred in all infected bovines, principally from PID 7 to 28, independent of the strain and inoculate used. Bioassays revealed the presence <b>of</b> parasites in <b>semen</b> samples <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> infected with oocysts (GI) and tachyzoites (GII) on several experimental days between PID 7 and 84.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{specific}} method {{for the detection}} of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in bovine semen using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is described. The primers used were derived from an EcoR 1 /BamH 1 fragment that hybridized strongly to chromosomal DNA from the hardjobovis serovar. Three different extraction methods were evaluated in this study: phenol-chloroform extraction method, proteinase K (PK) in 1 % SDS, followed by phenol-chloroform, and phenol-chloroform followed by 1 % cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). A PCR product of approximately 500 base pairs (bp) in length was obtained when DNA from pure Leptospira culture was used as a template for PCR, regardless of the DNA extraction method used. The product was consistent with that predicted from the gene sequence. However, in semen seeded in vitro, as well as in semen from infected bulls, a PCR product was obtained only when the leptospiral DNA was extracted from the specimen using the CTAB method. In contrast, other methods used for DNA extraction did not generate suitable templates for the PCR procedure. This is the first PCR protocol developed to detect Leptospira in bovine semen. The PCR protocol provided a direct and unequivocal demonstration that Leptospira can be detected in <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> infected <b>animals.</b> The CTAB method was also used successfully in detecting Leptospira in the urine <b>of</b> infected <b>animals.</b> The PCR procedure was shown to be more sensitive than either the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) or culture for detecting the organism in urine...|$|R

40|$|A novel sperm-coating antigen {{from the}} human seminal vesicles was discovered. We {{identified}} a monoclonal antibody MHS- 5, recognizing an epitope with characteristics <b>of</b> a forensic <b>semen</b> marker: 1) conservation in all vasectomized or normal semen samples tested (421); 2) absence in all human tissues or biological fluids other than semen; and 3) immunolocalization {{on the surface of}} ejaculated sperm. Western blots of ejaculates allowed to liquefy for 5 mm demonstrated the MHS- 5 epitope to be located on peptides {{of a wide range of}} molecular masses from 69 to 8 kDa. After 15 h <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> liquefaction, immunoreaction peptides of higher molecular mass were un-detectable in <b>semen,</b> while peptides <b>of</b> lower molecular mass from 8 to 21 kDa retained antigenicity. Three peptides of 10, 11. 9, and 13. 7 kDa were the most immunoreactive species in semen liquified for 15 b. Using the MHS- 5 monoclonal, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed sensitive to 1 ng of seminal protein. This assay showed that the MHS- 5 antigen was undetectable in <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> common domestic <b>animals</b> and monkeys but was present in chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan <b>semen.</b> ELISA <b>of</b> homoge-nates from human organs and reproductive tissues demonstrated the antigen only in samples of seminal vesicles. Epididymal sperm obtained at vasovasostomy lacked the MHS- 5 epitope, a fact that, together with immuno-localization on ejaculated sperm, demonstrated that the MHS- 5 antigen functions as a “sperm-coating antigen. ” The MHS- 5 monoclonal detected semen in sexual-assault evidence obtained six months previously and in mixtures <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> with vaginal or cervical fluid. Assay systems employing the MJ-IS- 5 mono clonal may be useful for identification <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> in sexual-assault casework.

40|$|Site-specific {{shedding}} of cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{was assessed}} in {{a longitudinal study}} of homosexual and bisexual men. At initial testing, CMV was cultured from the <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> 33 % (19 of 58) of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic men who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) {{at the time of}} entry into the study, whereas it was cultured from the <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> 17 % (10 of 58) of the men who were HIV seronegative. CMV was isolated much more frequently from semen than from urine or throat washing specimens, and it was rarely recovered from stool or blood, regardless of the subject's HIV serostatus. CMV was cultured from the <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> 31 % (16 of 52) of the men relatively early after seroconversion to HIV (mean, 12. 8 months). CMV was persistently isolated from the <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> a greater proportion of the HIV-seropositive men than from the <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> the HIV-seronegative men during a 4. 5 -year follow-up period (52 of 110 - [47 %] and 15 of 58 [26 %] men, respectively).
