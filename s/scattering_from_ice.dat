25|$|Rain {{scattering}} {{is purely}} a microwave propagation mode and is best observed around 10GHz, but extends {{down to a}} few gigahertz—the limit being {{the size of the}} scattering particle size vs. wavelength. This mode scatters signals mostly forwards and backwards when using horizontal polarization and side-scattering with vertical polarization. Forward-scattering typically yields propagation ranges of 800km. Scattering from snowflakes and ice pellets also occurs, but <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> <b>ice</b> without watery surface is less effective. The most common application for this phenomenon is microwave rain radar, but rain scatter propagation can be a nuisance causing unwanted signals to intermittently propagate where they are not anticipated or desired. Similar reflections may also occur from insects though at lower altitudes and shorter range. Rain also causes attenuation of point-to-point and satellite microwave links. Attenuation values up to 30dB have been observed on 30GHz during heavy tropical rain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-We {{developed}} an tiltra-wideband radar operating over frequencies from 500 MHz to 18 Ghz {{and used it}} {{in conjunction with a}} plane-wave illuminator to perform radar backscatter measurements over pancake, bare and snowcovered saline ice. The ice was grown in an outdoor pond at the U. S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, Hanover, NH. Data were acquired over incidence angles from 0 ° to 50 ° with VV and HH polarizations. Data were also collected on surface roughness, snow properties and ice structure. The combination of wide bandwidth and p!ane-wave illumination allowed us uniquely to identi ~ returns from airsnow and snow-ice interfaces. Returns from the snow-ice interface were about 10 dB higher than those from the snowair interface. At 0 ° incidence scattering horn bare saline ice varied little with frequency over the frequency range from 5 to 18 GHL whereas <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> pancake <b>ice</b> increased <b>from</b> about 16 dB at 5 GHz to 27 dB at 18 GHz.

40|$|The {{goals of}} this project are to utilize {{shipborne}} remote sensing to understand the scattering and attenuation process of ocean waves interacting with ice. A dedicated nautical X-band radar on a vessel {{would be used to}} follow the propagation of waves into the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and observe the attenuation and scattering of wave modes from the floating ice as well as estimate surface wind and surface current speeds and directions. This measuring approach will provide a comprehensive local picture of wave scattering and boundary layer flows over floating ice in the MIZ. OBJECTIVES To determine the penetration distance of waves in the MIZ and correlate the MIZ width to the surface wave climatology that generated it. 1. To determine the density of ice floes in the MIZ similar to “void fraction ” and correlate this parameter to the surface wave climatology. 2. To describe the local momentum transfer during freezing and melting cycles and the transport patterns affected by wind and currents. 3. To follow ocean wave groups into the MIZ to estimate the damping of wave energy based on the ice density and <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> <b>ice</b> floes. 4. To correlate the open ocean wind and wave climate to the wind and wave climate within the MIZ using satellite SAR imagery and marine radar data. APPROACH Boundary layer flows and air-sea fluxes in ice infested waters like the MIZ are very complex compared to the open ocean where surface waves provide the only roughness at the interface. In addition freezing and melting cycles modify both the interface surface and the local transport of heat and mass which can readily be disturbed by the impact of surface waves penetrating the ice floes of different ice types.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increased}} interest in using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) to study and monitor glaciers and ice sheets for glaciological and climate change research. SAR is a powerful remote sensing tool due to its high spatial resolution and wide coverage, and its ability to penetrate beneath the ice's surface to observe sub-surface structures. However, SAR backscattering from ice and the inversion of geophysical parameters from SAR ice data remain poorly understood. The relative importance of scattering from the air/snow and snow/ice interfaces, from internal layers and structures in the firn, as well as the dependence of the land ice radar signatures on frequency and glacier facie, is unclear. Few models address the interferometric coherence as an observable, and the greatest focus to date has been on modelling single-polarisation backscattering coefficients. This paper augments the use of SAR backscattering coefficients with polarisation and baseline diversity (Polarimetric Interferometric SAR or Pol-InSAR) to provide additional information on the underlying glacial structure and more thorough validation criteria for evaluating the applicability of electromagnetic models. The backscatter and interferometric coherence from the ice is modelled as a coherent sum of slightly rough annual layers as well as volume <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> <b>ice</b> crystals between the layers. Validation is performed using a unique Pol-InSAR data set acquired over the Nordaustlandet sheet in Svalbard, Norway. The data were collected using DLR's airborne E-SAR (Experimental SAR) system as part of the SVALEX (April 2005) and ICESAR (March/April 2007) campaigns. Fully-polarised multi-baseline data at L- (1. 3 GHz) and P-band (0. 35 GHz) frequencies and single-pass VV data at X-band (9. 6 GHz) were obtained. For calibration purposes and to determine the penetration of the radar signals, corner reflectors and an approximately 200 -m-long wire were deployed directly {{on the surface of the}} ice. Backscatter and coherence at different frequencies and thus different depths of penetration, and at different polarisations and thus potentially different scattering mechanisms, are examined as a function of incidence angle, spatial baseline, and temporal baseline (a two year temporal baseline is available). Modelled results are compared with the quad-pol observed backscatter and complex coherences, providing insight on the electromagnetic interaction between the radar signal and the polythermal ice. The use of interferometry and surface reflectors enables measurement of the phase centre depth of the penetrating radar signal. Electromagnetic modelling of longer-wavelength Pol-InSAR observables over glaciers and ice sheets has relevance for future spaceborne SAR concepts. Potential satellite missions including a P-band sounder and the BIOMASS earth observation proposal would benefit from an increased understanding of long-wavelength SAR observables over land ice...|$|E
40|$|Retrievals {{of falling}} snow from space {{represent}} {{one of the}} next important challenges for the atmospheric, hydrological, and energy budget scientific communities. Historically, retrievals of falling snow have been difficult due to the relative insensitivity of satellite rain-based channels as used in the past. We emphasize the use of high frequency passive microwave channels (85 - 200 GHz) since these are {{more sensitive to the}} ice in clouds and have been used to estimate falling snow from space. While satellite-based remote sensing provides global coverage of falling snow events and the science is relatively new, retrievals are still undergoing development with challenges remaining. There are several current satellite sensors, though not specifically designed for estimating falling snow, are capable of measuring snow from space. These include NOAA's AMSU-B, the MHS sensors, and CloudSat radar. They use high frequency (greater than 85 GHz) passive and active microwave and millimeter-wave channels that are sensitive to the <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> <b>ice</b> and snow particles in the atmosphere. Sensors with water vapor channels near 183 GHz center line provide opaqueness to the Earth's surface features that can contaminate the falling snow signatures, especially over snow covered surface. In addition, the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission scheduled for launch in 2013 is specifically designed to measure both liquid rain and frozen snow precipitation. Since falling snow from space is the next precipitation measurement challenge from space, information must be determined in order to guide retrieval algorithm development for these current and future missions. This information includes thresholds of detection for various sensor channel configurations, snow event system characteristics, and surface types. For example, can a lake effect snow system with low cloud tops having an ice water content (IWC) at the surface of 1. 0 gram per cubic meter be detected? If this information is known, we can focus retrieval efforts on detectable storms and concentrate advances on achievable results. In this work, the focus is to determine thresholds of detection for falling snow for various snow conditions over land and lake surfaces. The results rely on simulated Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) simulations of falling snow cases [9] since simulations provide all the information to determine the measurements from space and the ground truth. This analysis relies on data from the Canadian CloudSat/CALIPSO Validation Program (C 3 VP) field campaign held from October 31, 2006 through March 1, 2007. In January 2012 GPM will return to the C 3 VP area for the GPM Cold Precipitation Experiment (GCPEx).

Experimental data was {{gathered in the}} form of <b>scattering</b> patterns <b>from</b> <b>ice</b> analogue crystals with similar optical properties and hexagonal symmetry to ice, yet stable at room temperature. A laboratory rig is described which images <b>scattering</b> patterns <b>from</b> single particles while allowing precise control over the orientation of the particle with respect to the incident beam. Images of scattering patterns were captured and compared to patterns from modelled crystals with similar geometry. Methods for introducing particles en-masse and individually to the Small Ice Detector (SID) instruments are discussed, with particular emphasis on the calibration of the gain of the SID- 2 instrument. The variation in gain between detector elements is found to be significant, variable {{over the life of the}} detector, and different for different detectors. Fitting was performed by comparison of test scattering patterns (either modelled or experimental) to the reference database. Representation of the two dimensional scattering patterns by asymmetry factor, moment invariants, azimuthal intensity patterns (AIP) and the Fourier transform of the AIP are compared for fitting accuracy. Direct comparison of the AIP is found to be the most accurate method. Increased resolution of the AIP is shown to improve the fitting substantially. Case studies are presented for the fitting of two ice analogue crystals to the modelled database. Fitting accuracy is found to be negatively influenced by small amounts of surface roughness and detail not currently considered by the RTDF model. Fitting of in-situ data gathered by the SID- 3 instrument during the HALO 02 campaign at the AIDA cloud chamber in Germany is presented and discussed. Saturation of detector pixels is shown to affect pattern fitting. In-flight operation of the instrument involves the variation of gain of the whole detector (as opposed to individual elements) in order to obtain unsaturated images of both large and small particles.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in January 1994 at the Geophysical Research Facility in the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory. To investigate effects on polarimetric scattering signatures of sea ice growth under diurnal temperature variations, an ice sheet was grown for 2. 5 days for the thickness of 10 cm and a polarimetric radar operating at C-band was used to obtain backscattering data in conjunction with ice-characterization measurements. The ice sheet was grown in the late morning of January 19, 1994. The initial growth rate was slow due to high insolation and temperature. As the air temperature dropped during the night, the growth rate increased significantly. The air temperature changed drastically from about - 10 (deg) C to - 35 (deg) C between day and night. The temperature cycle was repeated during the next day and the growth rate varied in the same manner. The surface of the ice was partially covered by frost flowers and the areal coverage increased as the ice became thicker. Throughout the ice growth duration of 2. 5 days, polarimetric backscatter data were collected at roughly every centimeter of ice growth. For each set of radar measurements of saline ice, a set of calibration measurements was carried out with trihedrial corner reflectors and a metallic sphere. Measured polarimetric backscattering coefficients of the ice sheet reveal a strong correlation between radar data and temperature variations. As the temperature increased (decreased), the backscatter increased (decreased) correspondingly. From the ice-characterization data, temperatures of the air, at the ice-air interface, and in the ice layer had the same variation trend. Another interesting experimental observation is that the salinity measured as a function of <b>ice</b> depth <b>from</b> a sample of 10 -cm thich ice indicated that the salinity variations had a similar cycle as the temperature; i. e., the salinity profile recorded the history of the temperature variations.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{recorded}} dose-fractionated electron cryo-microscope images of thin films of pure flash-frozen amorphous ice and pre-irradiated amorphous carbon on a Falcon II direct electron detector using 300 keV electrons. We observe Thon rings [1] {{in both the}} power spectrum of the summed frames and the sum of power spectra from the individual frames. The Thon rings from amorphous carbon images are always more visible in the power spectrum of the summed frames whereas those of amorphous ice are more visible in the sum of power spectra from the individual frames. This difference indicates that while pre-irradiated carbon behaves like a solid during the exposure, amorphous ice behaves like a fluid with the individual water molecules undergoing beam-induced motion. Using the measured variation in the power spectra amplitude with number of electrons per image we deduce that water molecules are randomly displaced by a mean squared distance of ∼ 1. 1 Å 2 for every incident 300 keV e−/Å 2. The induced motion leads to an optimal exposure with 300 keV electrons of 4. 0 e−/Å 2 per image with which to observe Thon rings centred around the strong 3. 7 Å <b>scattering</b> peak <b>from</b> amorphous <b>ice.</b> The beam-induced movement of the water molecules generates pseudo-Brownian motion of embedded macromolecules.

The peak due to electrons <b>scattered</b> <b>from</b> C, is again shifted compared to the peak of electrons <b>scattered</b> <b>from</b> Xe. The Xe, C and H peaks all have clearly different widths. The C and H peak areas are compared. Their relative intensity shows no substantial deviation (< 10 %) from what is expected based on either simple Rutherford cross sections, or state-of-the-art elastic scattering calculations. The latter observation is in strong contrast to electron <b>scattering</b> results <b>from</b> a gaseous equimolar H 2 –D 2 mixture and from electron and neutron <b>scattering</b> results <b>from</b> polymers at similar momentum transfer.

40|$|Abstract—The {{electromagnetic}} <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> a conducting object {{coated with}} metamaterials, which have both negative permittivity and permeability is derived rigorously by using finite difference frequency domain (FDFD). A formulation for the FDFD method is presented. The <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> circular and multilayers elliptic cylinder coated by metamaterial are investigated. Also, the <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> dielectric and metamaterial sphere is depicted. Numerical results are {{compared with the}} available data in the literature. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recently, dual {{wavelength}} radar {{measurements of}} smoke and developing cumulus clouds {{have appeared in the}} literature which show a puzzling correlation between the measured radar returns. This correlation cannot easily be explained in terms of the conventional scattering mechanisms: coherent (Bragg) <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> spatial fluctuations in clear-air refractive index and incoherent (Rayleigh) <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> particles. In this paper, a possible explanation of the measurements is presented in terms of coherent <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> the particles. It will also be argued that in clouds, Bragg <b>scatter</b> <b>from</b> fluctuations in water vapor content can be much smaller than from fluctuations in liquid water content, contrary to common belief...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of light <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> biological cells are investigated by using confocal microscopy and light scattering spectroscopy (LSS). The LSS system measures the light scattering in the visible wavelength range from 1. 1 ° to 165. 0 °. The {{results provide evidence}} that the small-sized subcellular structures are the major contributors to the backscattering signals. A unified Mie and fractal model is proposed to interpret light scattering by biological cells. The results demonstrate that Mie <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> bare cells and nuclei is dominant in small forward scattering angles. But Mie <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> bare cells and nuclei is found {{not to be able}} to provide a satisfactory interpretation of scattering spectral signals in the large angles, which is determined by fractal <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> the subcellular structures. The findings of the theoretical model are consistent with the results of experimental investigation on the light <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> biological cells...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedElectromagnetic <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> trees and vegetation is of prime importance in radar and remote sensing. The actual problem of <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> trees is rather complicated and involves three dimensional <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> lossy, electrically large, and randomly oriented objects. In this thesis, the {{radar cross section}} of a planar fractal tree is considered. Although a planar tree is far <b>from</b> being real, <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> it {{shed light on the}} <b>scattering</b> phenomenon <b>from</b> an actual tree. The planar tree is generated using fractal geometry and its branches are considered perfectly conducting. The tree is illuminated by a plane wave and the problem is solved using the moment method. Data is presented for the radar cross section for different branching angles of the tree and at different frequencies[URL] Hellenic Nav...|$|R
