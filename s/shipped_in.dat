5|$|Demand for the North American {{release of}} the Nintendo DS version was higher than expected, leading to the game being hard to find in stores shortly after its release; the third {{printing}} sold out in around a week. As of February 2007, 100,000 copies had been <b>shipped</b> <b>in</b> North America, which Capcom's vice-president of marketing found to be surprising.

5|$|Since the {{founding}} of Albany in 1624 as a trading post, shipping has been important to its growth and prosperity. Furs (especially beaver), timber, and farm produce were important exports while European people and goods were <b>shipped</b> <b>in.</b> The Dongan Charter, which established Albany as a city, made Albany the exclusive market town in the upper Hudson River Valley. From its beginning, the port consisted of hastily built docks built every spring and destroyed every winter by erosion, flooding, ice, and tidal action. Three city-owned docks were established in 1766, {{the northern and southern}} ones later being expanded into wharves.|$|E
