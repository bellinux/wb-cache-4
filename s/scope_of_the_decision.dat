40|$|During {{batch process}} scheduling, products' batch size, {{processing}} conditions {{as well as}} operating times are usually established offline and considered out of the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> making stage. In practice, process dynamics may vary from the ones forecasted, {{in such a manner}} that the predicted optimal conditions will not be the best in practice. As a result of this mismatch, the plant usually operates under sub-optimal conditions, but if the process is flexible, its processing conditions can still be adapted to the actual plant needs in order to improve the overall performance. Given this situation, there is a strong motivation for developing models and optimization tools to fully integrate process dynamics into batch scheduling. In this work, the potential of directly including control variables with time varying values and variable batch sizes in the scheduling of batch plants is explored. The optimization of process dynamics, which is time varying, along with scheduling tasks is accomplished using rigorous mixed-integer dynamic optimization techniques. Through several examples, we show that integrating both decision-making levels can lead to significant economic savings. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|FMS is new {{technology}} with many considerations {{that differ from}} those familiarly applied to job shop, flow shop and automated flow shop work configurations. A major obstacle to using FMS is that {{little is known about}} how to co-ordinate flexible work and transfer activities to obtain a relatively constant flow of marketable output. In the past year, articles on FMS have appeared with increasing frequency. Their emphasis highlights the reduction in variable production costs that FMS promises. This paper describes a different approach, namely, to uncover the effects of FMS technology on optimal organizational size. To achieve this end, we must consider factors other than variable production cost savings. This enlarges the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> model required to evaluate FMS configurations. The investigation proceeds along two diverse, but complementary paths. One is based on a theoretical model, using non-linear breakeven analysis. The second employs empirical data obtained from industrial users. The theoretical model indicates that FMS requires a larger total output than the system it replaces. Empirical results tend to confirm this finding. In addition, FMS alters other managerial considerations, including appropriate marketing strategies. ...|$|E

40|$|Judicial {{creation}} of a private cause of action under rule l 0 b- 5, which was promulgated pursuant to section 10 (b) 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, {{gave rise to a}} number of perplexing issues. One of the most formidable was whether proof of scienter was a necessary element for recovery. Lacking congressional direction, courts were free to fashion the state of mind standard flexibly, by pursuing what is recognized as the broad policy of section 10 (b) —the prevention of fraud on the public by persons connected with the purchase or sale of securities. Predictably, the standards adopted within the United States courts of appeals varied, depending upon such considerations as the type of relationship between the parties, the forseeability of injury to the plaintiff by the defendant, the ease with which such injury could have been avoided, the degree of culpability attending the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s act, and most important, the court 2 ̆ 7 s perception of congressional intent behind the language of section 10 (b). The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in Ernst 2 ̆ 6 Ernst v.

40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} relationship of ideology to public policy. The hypothesis it tests is that verbal adherence to an ideological orientation by a decision maker should translate into the implementation of related public policies. It is further posited that the intensity of adherence to that ideological orientation affects the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker's policy choices. The ideological orientations and policy decisions of thirteen of Mexico's postrevolutionary presidents from 1915 to 1965 were selected to test this relationship. Using content analysis of presidential addresses before Congress, {{a measure of the}} intensity of verbal ideological adherence to the revolutionary goal of land reform was assessed for each postrevolutionary administration during the time frame of this analysis. This information was then compared to actual policy choices and implemented programs to determine whether ideological identification influenced the selection and implementation of land reform policies. The results of this research show that verbal ideological orientation toward the revolutionary goal of land reform reflected the intensity of adherence to that ideological goal. But in the case of Mexico, two competing theories of appropriate governmental action in the land reform area developed out of the revolution of 1910. In most cases one of these orientations received greater governmental attention than the other and influenced the policies that were implemented. During six administrations, presidents verbally identified with a liberal land reform orientation that emphasized agricultural development, productivity, and the distribution of land into private properties. The policies implemented during these administrations were consistent with this orientation. During three administrations, the orientation was centered on social justice through land reform, and the policies which were implemented tended to be redistributive and collectivist. In the other three cases the role of ideology seemed to be more symbolic. Presidents employed popular revolutionary symbols relating to land reform to encourage support for the regime. The conclusions reached by this research suggest that {{the relationship of}} ideology to public policies needs to be explored rather than discounted as much of the contemporary public policy literature suggests...|$|E
30|$|Telecommunication carrier is by {{definition}} companies that are authorized by a regulatory agency to operate a telecommunications system. In the work of Ching-Ter et al. (2011), the problem of routing management still stands to confuse many telecommunication-related companies among which are: equipment manufacturers, platform vendors, service operators, and billing system. Through their study, they observed that routing control is dependent not only on equipment {{but also on the}} operational flow of the company. Unlike Internet Service Provider (ISP) where its providers often control the entire network topology; the same is not of telecommunication operators. A full range of service is only possible to the reach of its customers by contracting partners such as service carriers. In the case of customer calls or user calls, these operators provide service according to an internal and pre-deployed routing logic to its service providers or carriers depending upon the destination or the service traffic to available routes. That is, a clear guide is instituted for the engineering staff on path deploying for the next period (or billing cycle) to come while achieving multiple pre-defined goals automatically. In this instance, decision-making which is the science of recognizing and determining choices based on the values and partialities of the decision maker becomes necessary (Diaz et al. 2015; Caron and Daniels 2013; Anderson and Mansingh 2014). Making a choice implies that there are alternatives to be considered, and in such a case we do not only distinguish as many of these choices but also take the one that best fits with the objectives, values, goals, and desires. This process starts with the classification of the decision makers and stakeholders in the resolution and reducing the possible misunderstanding about problem definition, requirements, criteria, and goals (Majumder and Ghosh 2013; Al-Tarawneh 2012). According to Ignaccolo et al. (2017), Moffett and Sarkar (2006), to make a decision, one needs to understand the problem, the urgency, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision,</b> the criteria for the choice, their sub-criteria, stakeholders, and groups affected and the alternative steps to take. In the case of resource allocation, one requires the needed priorities to determine the best alternative to allocate the appropriate share of the resources. They also recommended that the decision-making process must distinguish causes, limiting assumptions, policy and organizational barriers and interfaces, and any stakeholder concerns. The aim is to reveal the issue in a fair and precise problem statement that represents both the first circumstances and the desired circumstances. The problem statement must nevertheless be a brief and unambiguous written material agreed upon by all decision-makers and stakeholders.|$|E
