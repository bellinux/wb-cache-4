5|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism {{from the time}} of David I, not only introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system on the English model impracticable. Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} c. 1150 to 1300, the warm dry summers and less severe winters of the Medieval Warm Period allowed {{cultivation}} at much greater heights {{above sea level}} and made land more productive. Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying {{areas such as the}} Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. The feudalism introduced under David I, particularly in the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships. Land was now held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. Barons, who held feudal tenures, had the right to hold baronial courts, which could deal with matters of land ownership.

5|$|The feudalism {{introduced}} under David I, {{particularly in}} the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships, often based on castles, and the creation of administrative sheriffdoms, which overlay the pattern of administration by local thanes. Land was now held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. It also saw the English earl and Latin comes begin to replace the mormaers in the records.

25|$|A clown is seen {{walking with}} Graziosa, the gypsy chief's daughter. A gypsy tells {{the chief of}} the {{approach}} of Don Quixote. The chief plans a trick for his benefit and, putting on a mantle crown, sits down as though he were a king on a throne. Don Quixote is deceived and kneels to the chief in homage. The chief bids that he <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> him and orders a festival to be given in his honor. This begins with Gypsy dances and is followed by a performance of the marionette theatre. Don Quixote is delighted with the entertainment but, mistaking the heroine for his Dulcinea and the marionettes for soldiers attacking her, he rises to assault them. The gypsies are terrified. At this moment the clown and Graziosa run away.|$|E
25|$|In June 2010, {{a statue}} of Captain Mainwaring was erected in the Norfolk town of Thetford {{where most of the}} exteriors for the TV series were filmed. The statue {{features}} Captain Mainwaring sitting to attention on a simple bench in Home Guard uniform, with his swagger stick across his knees. The statue is mounted {{at the end of a}} winding brick pathway with a Union Flag patterned arrow head to reflect the opening credits of the TV series and the sculpture has been designed so that members of the public can <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> Captain Mainwaring and have their photograph taken. The statue was vandalised not long after the unveiling by a 10-year-old boy, who kicked it for 10 minutes and broke off the statue's glasses, throwing them into a nearby river. The statue has since been fixed.|$|E
25|$|On 19 July, RIC Constable William Barrett {{refused to}} <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> the {{blackleg}} driver of a traction engine {{who had been}} promised personal police protection by his employer. After flatly refusing to obey District Inspector Thomas Keaveney when the latter ordered him to accompany the driver, he was promptly suspended. In response, 300 angry policemen attended a meeting at Musgrave Street Barracks and declared {{their support for the}} strike. A brawl instantly broke out inside the barracks when Barrett resisted attempts by RIC officers to arrest him. This led to another 800 policemen (about 70 per cent of the police force) joining the mutiny. They refused to offer any protection to the blacklegs, made no further attempts to disperse the strikers' pickets and Larkin persuaded them to carry out their own strike for higher wages and better pensions. In 1907, policemen's pay in Belfast ranged from £66, 16 shillings to £78 per annum. This was a wage just marginally above that earned by the best-paid dockers and carters.|$|E

500|$|The {{note was}} printed in neat, all-capital letters with a {{felt-tip}} pen. Its exact wording is unknown, because Cooper later reclaimed it, but Schaffner recalled that it indicated {{he had a}} bomb in his briefcase, and directed her to <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> him. Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper cracked open his briefcase long {{enough for her to}} glimpse eight red cylinders ("four on top of four") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he dictated his demands: $200,000 in [...] "negotiable American currency"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit: when she returned, he was wearing dark sunglasses.|$|E
500|$|A Free Rides opening intertitle {{denotes the}} film's setting as [...] "in the wide open spaces, where men are men and girls will be girls, the hills {{are full of}} romance and adventure". The film shows two women walking {{together}} alongside a road near their home. A wealthy male motorist in a right-hand-drive 1912 Haynes 50-60 Model Y Touring Car arrives and offers them a lift. After some hesitation, the women accept his offer and <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> him in the front seat. The man then kisses and fondles them. Later, as he urinates behind a tree, the women voyeuristically watch him. When {{he is about to}} finish, the women quickly return to the car. After his return, the women urinate behind the tree while the man secretly watches them and becomes sexually aroused. The women return to the car and the man offers them a drink.|$|E

500|$|Æthelbald's {{rebellion}} {{was supported}} by Ealhstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, ealdorman of Somerset, even though {{they appear to have}} been two of the king's most trusted advisers. According to Asser, the plot was concerted [...] "in the western part of Selwood", and western nobles may have backed Æthelbald because they resented the patronage Æthelwulf gave to eastern Wessex. Asser also stated that Æthelwulf agreed to give up the western part of his kingdom in order to avoid a civil war. Some historians such as Keynes and Abels think that his rule was then confined to the south-east, while others such as Kirby think {{it is more likely that}} it was Wessex itself which was divided, with Æthelbald keeping Wessex west of Selwood, Æthelwulf holding the centre and east, and Æthelberht keeping the south-east. Æthelwulf insisted that Judith should <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> him on the throne until the end of his life, and according to Asser this was [...] "without any disagreement or dissatisfaction on the part of his nobles".|$|E
500|$|The Royal Assent {{ceremony}} {{takes place}} in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the members of parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: [...] "in Her Majesty's name, His [...] Excellency the Governor General [...] doth assent to these bills." [...] If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites [...] "in Her Majesty's name, His [...] Excellency the Governor General [...] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills." [...] The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament.|$|E

2500|$|Reese being {{introduced}} as Bianca's love interest {{was the first}} time an American soap opera would showcase same-sex partners having decided to create a child together. Riegel set up the Reese and Bianca storyline and what the couple's introduction entailed to newspaper New York Daily News. [...] "Zach is looking for Kendall," [...] she said. [...] "He is shocked to find Bianca. Nobody knew she was coming to Pine Valley. Zach discovers Kendall's lifeless body and resuscitates her. Paramedics come, but they only have room in the vehicle for one person. Zach convinces them to take the kids, as well. He and Bianca wait." [...] This gave the series a chance to explain Bianca's return to the audience, as they saw Bianca, clearly pregnant, <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> Zach. [...] "Zach agreed to be Bianca's [...] donor, but she failed to tell him that the pregnancy took," [...] explained Riegel. [...] "The reason she was not forthcoming is that Kendall was not told. Bianca came halfway across the world from France in the Cambias private jet - the only jet that can fly into a tornado - and didn't even get to tell Kendall the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|De Valera's {{supporters}} and detractors argue about his bravery during the Easter Rising. His supporters claim he showed leadership skills and {{a capacity for}} meticulous planning. His detractors claim he suffered a nervous breakdown during the Rising. According to accounts from 1916, de Valera was seen running about, giving conflicting orders, refusing to sleep and on one occasion, having forgotten the password, almost getting himself shot in the dark by his own men. According to one account, de Valera, on being forced to sleep by one subordinate who promised to <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> him and wake {{him if he was}} needed, suddenly woke up, his eyes [...] "wild", screaming, [...] "Set fire to the railway! Set fire to the railway!" [...] Later in the Ballykinlar internment Camp, one de Valera loyalist approached another internee, a medical doctor, recounted the story, and asked for a medical opinion as to de Valera's condition. He also threatened to sue the doctor, future Fine Gael Teachta Dála (TD) and minister, Dr. Tom O'Higgins, if he ever repeated the story. The British reportedly, however, considered de Valera's forces the best-trained and best-led among the rebels. De Valera's latest biographer, Anthony J. Jordan, writes of this controversy, [...] "Whatever happened in Boland's Mills, or any other garrison, does not negate or undermine in any way the extraordinary heroism of [...] "Dev" [...] and his comrades".|$|E
2500|$|The Southern Christian Leadership Conference {{suspended}} King {{from the}} presidency in June 2001, concerned that he was letting the organization drift into inaction. The group's national chairman at the time, Claud Young, sent a June 25 letter to King that read, [...] "You have consistently been insubordinate and displayed inappropriate, obstinate behavior in the (negligent) carrying out of your duties as president of SCLC." [...] King was reinstated only one week later after promising {{to take a more}} active role. Young said of the suspension, [...] "I felt we had to use a two-by-four to get his attention. Well, it got his attention all right." [...] After he was reinstated, King prepared a four-year plan outlining a stronger direction for the organization, agreeing to dismiss McMorris and announcing plans to present a strong challenge to the Bush administration in an August convention in Montgomery, Alabama. In a rally on August 5, 2001, in Montgomery, SCLC leaders, including Rev. Joseph Lowery, former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and Rev. Jesse Jackson all pledged their support for King. [...] "I <b>sit</b> <b>beside</b> my successor, to assure him of my love and support," [...] said Rev. Lowery. King said he also planned to concentrate on racial profiling, prisoners' rights and closing the digital divide between whites and blacks. However, King also suggested the group needed a new approach, stating, [...] "We must not allow our lust for 'temporal gratification' to blind us from making difficult decisions to effect future generations." ...|$|E
