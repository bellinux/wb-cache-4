Finally, Maitreya sits atop a virtual tank and aims it at the agents. Phoebe admits there {{is one way to}} stop the game, but doing so will erase the entire program. Despite protests from Ivan, Phoebe gives Byers the kill command, effectively destroying Maitreya along with the game while saving Mulder and Scully. During Mulder's narration, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control room one of the monitors is still active. There, Ivan sees Maitreya's avatar, but with Scully's face.|$|E

[...] The first was held at Ripon, Yorkshire, 3–6 July 1914. [...] Foakes-Jackson and Lake delivered an attack on Liberal Protestantism. [...] Lake said that the task of the liberal Christian is [...] "not to go back upon the inherited Catholic doctrines of the Church, but to apply and to expand them, because we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end they are true so long as you do not limit them." [...] The most famous of the conferences was the one held at Girton College, Cambridge, 8–15 August 1921. [...] Its subject was [...] "Christ and the Creeds" [...] and it was planned as a response to Lake's publication of the first volume of The Beginnings of Christianity. [...] Lake did not attend, so it was left to Foakes-Jackson to defend their positions. [...] He explained that he and Lake believed that the Jesus whom the early Church preached was not [...] "a character of singular charm and beauty during his life on earth, but a Risen Saviour who was expected to come speedily to judge the quick and the dead." [...] Liberal Protestants, he argued, were preaching a Christ who had no historical foundation. [...] From 1915 to 1931 Lake served as one of vice presidents of the union; however, after 1927 he began to part company with English Modernism and in 1932 he wrote to have his name removed from the list of vice presidents.|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot and you can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I {{think a lot of people}} share that [...] with him. You want to see this type of game, where you set the tone, you control the game, you make it fast, you make it attractive and attacking. He's always been famous for his version of the 4–3–3 with the wide wingers, all technically highly gifted and fast. This is his mark." ...|$|E
