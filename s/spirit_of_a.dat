5|$|At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration {{among the}} {{teachers}} {{as well as}} students. He befriends an older student named Vetch, but generally remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges him to a duel. He casts a powerful spell intended to raise the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dead woman, but the spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature, which attacks Ged and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle banishes the shadow and saves Ged's life, although it costs Nemmerle his own.|$|E

25|$|University of the Philippines Diliman Campus: Its {{long history}} {{is said to}} be the reason of its alleged hauntings.

25|$|In Tring, Hertfordshire, a fierce-looking black hound {{with red}} eyes {{is said to}} haunt {{the middle of the}} road in the area where the gibbet once stood.

25|$|Another legend, {{based on}} the unusual ice {{patterns}} found on the northern cliff-face of the mountain, where a vaguely horse-shaped ice formation does not melt {{until late in the}} spring, state that the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local farmer's horse warns farmers against planting their crop so long as the ice formation remains on the mountain.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the University of California, Riverside, or UCR, started in 1907 when UCR was the University's Citrus Experiment Station. By the 1950s, the University had {{established}} a teaching-focused liberal arts curriculum at the site, in the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small liberal arts college, but California's rapidly growing population made it necessary for the Riverside campus to become a full-fledged general campus of the UC system, and was so designated in 1959.|$|E

25|$|Those {{in favor}} of {{retiring}} the Chief contended that the Chief misappropriates Native American culture and perpetuates harmful racial or ethnic stereotypes. They argued that this obstructed {{the creation of a}} diverse and tolerant learning community, harmed the reputation of the University, and promoted an inaccurate image of Native Americans. Those in support of the Chief claimed that he was a revered symbol representing not only a proud people but the great <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great university.|$|E
25|$|For the Akan culture {{originating}} from Western Africa, the name Wawa Aba {{is a symbol}} of persistence. People there particularly believe in the strength and team <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> community. The Wawa Aba is the seed of the Wawa tree, one of the strongest and most processible woods of Africa. For the population, the Wawa Aba mainly has mystical significance. These are people who don’t let failure discourage them, who seize all opportunities successfully and who are thus just as strong and adaptable as the Wawa Aba.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} 1803, {{a number}} of people claimed to have seen and even been {{attacked}} by a ghost in the Hammersmith area of London, a ghost believed by locals to be the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suicide victim. On 3 January 1804, a member of one of the armed patrols set up {{in the wake of the}} reports shot and killed a bricklayer, Thomas Millwood, mistaking the white clothes of Millwood's trade for a ghostly apparition. The culprit, a 29-year-old excise officer named Francis Smith, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, commuted to one year's hard labour.|$|E

25|$|Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848 as the {{beginning}} of their movement. On that date, Kate and Margaret Fox, of Hydesville, reported that they had made contact with the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> murdered peddler. What made this an extraordinary event was that the spirit communicated through audible rapping noises, rather than simply appearing to a person in a trance. The evidence of the senses appealed to practical Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. Demonstrations of mediumship (seances and automatic writing, for example) proved to be a profitable business, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Foxes earned a living this way, as did many others.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} their aunt in October {{of the same year}} forced them to return once more to Haworth. Aunt Branwell had left all her worldly goods in equal shares to her nieces and to Eliza Kingston, a cousin in Penzance, which had the {{immediate}} effect of purging all their debts and providing a small reserve of funds. Nevertheless, they were asked to return to Brussels as they were regarded as being competent and were needed. They were each offered teaching posts in the boarding school, still English for Charlotte and music for Emily. However, Charlotte returned alone to Belgium in January 1843, while Emily remained critical of Monsieur Heger, in spite of the excellent opinion he held of her. He later stated that she 'had the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man', and would probably become a great traveller due to her being gifted with a superior faculty of reason that allowed her to deduce ancient knowledge of new spheres of knowledge, and her unbending willpower would have triumphed over all obstacles.|$|E

He also had two specials published during his run on the title, the Hellblazer Special and Heartland, which follows Kit Ryan's return to Ireland.|$|E
500|$|The early {{operetta}} Paul Bunyan stands {{apart from}} Britten's later operatic works. Philip Brett, in Groves article on Britten, calls it [...] "a patronizing attempt by W H Auden {{to evoke the}} <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nation not his own in which Britten was a somewhat dazzled accomplice". The American public liked it, but the critics did not, and it fell into neglect until interest revived {{near the end of}} the composer's life.|$|E
500|$|The Final Cut is an anti-war concept album, whose lyrics {{explore what}} Waters regards as the {{betrayal}} of fallen British servicemen—such as his father—who during the Second World War sacrificed {{their lives in}} the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> post-war dream. [...] This post-war dream was that their victory would usher in a more peaceful world, whose leaders would no longer be so eager to resolve disputes by resorting to war. [...] The album's lyrics are critical of Thatcher, whose policies and decisions Waters regarded as an example of this betrayal. [...] She is referred to as [...] "Maggie" [...] throughout the album.|$|E
