However, education quality is weak, producing high rates of grade repetition and dropout. Education policy in Ravalomanana's second term focused on quality issues, including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle <b>school</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>certificate</b> (BEPC) to a high <b>school</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>certificate</b> (BAC), and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom.

Primary classrooms are crowded, with average pupil to teacher ratios of 47:1 in 2008.|$|E

25|$|High school diplomas {{received}} from countries outside of Germany are, in many cases, not considered {{equivalent to the}} Abitur, but rather to a Realschulabschluss and therefore do not qualify the bearer for admission to a German university.

These criteria depend on the <b>school</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>certificate</b> of the potential student and are agreed upon by the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs.

25|$|In post-independent India, {{schools for}} young {{children}} (16 months–5 years) are called nursery, kindergarten or play school which are broadly based on Montessori or multiple intelligence methodology of education. Primary and secondary education in Bangalore is offered by various schools which are affiliated {{to one of the}} boards of education, such as the Secondary <b>School</b> <b>Leaving</b> <b>Certificate</b> (SSLC), Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), International Baccalaureate (IB), International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) and National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). Schools in Bangalore are either government run or are private (both aided and un-aided by the government). Bangalore has a significant number of international schools due to expats and IT crowd. After completing their secondary education, students either attend Pre University (PUC) or continue High School in one of three streams– Arts, Commerce or Science. Alternatively, students may also enroll in Diploma courses. Upon completing the required coursework, students enroll in general or professional degrees in universities through lateral entry.|$|E
25|$|The {{courses that}} a student takes {{depending}} on program and orientation {{can be divided into}} four levels: core subjects, program-specific subjects, orientation subjects, and individually selected courses. Core courses are courses that everyone, regardless of program, must study to satisfy the requirements for a student degree. Program-specific courses are the additional courses {{that a student}} is required to take to fulfill the program requirements. If a student for some reason does not fulfill the requirements, for example, by electing to replace a program-specific course with another course, the student is considered to have attended a specially designed program, which has no bearing except for what's printed on the <b>school</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>certificate.</b> Orientation subjects are the courses that a student elects to take by selecting an orientation. Normally these courses take place {{in the second and third}} year, although in a few cases the courses start earlier. Finally, individually selected courses are courses that the student freely selects for herself/himself in the second and third year; specific slots have been set aside in the curriculum and the schedule for these.|$|E
25|$|The {{curriculum}} and system of graduation were reformed.

The crown established Regius chairs, all in the sciences, including medicine, chemistry, natural history and botany. The chair of Engineering at Glasgow was {{the first of its kind}} in the world. By the 1870s the physical sciences were well established in Scottish universities, whereas in England the battle to modernise the curriculum would not be complete until the end of the century. The new separate science faculties were able to move away from the compulsory Latin, Greek and philosophy of the old MA curriculum. Under the commissions, all the universities were restructured. They were given Courts, which included external members and who oversaw the finances of the institution. Students' Representative Councils were founded in 1884 and ratified under the 1889 act. Under this act new arts subjects were established, with chairs in Modern History, French, German and Political Economy.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Scottish universities had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and could leave without qualifications. After two commissions of enquiry in 1826 and 1876 and reforming acts of parliament in 1858 and 1889, the curriculum and system of graduation were reformed {{to meet the needs of}} the emerging middle classes and the professions. Entrance examinations equivalent to the <b>School</b> <b>Leaving</b> <b>Certificate</b> were introduced and average ages of entry rose to 17 or 18. Standard patterns of graduation in the arts curriculum offered 3-year ordinary and 4-year honours degrees and separate science faculties were able to move away from the compulsory Latin, Greek and philosophy of the old MA curriculum. The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes, as well as the upper class. It prepared students for non-commercial careers in government, the law, medicine, education, and the ministry and a smaller group for careers in science and engineering. St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities, creating the Lady Licentiate in Arts (LLA), which proved highly popular. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.|$|E

Correspondingly, ethnic minority students, on average, obtain better test scores in Mathematics, when the share of ethnic minority teachers increases. The positive same-gender effect on test scores is counteracted by a negative assessment effect.

In line with the argument of status reproduction we find that chances are higher when parents have an intermediate school certificate and are at occupational qualification level. In our second hypothesis we argue that the impact of unemployment on the chance of obtaining a training position is not equal to these personal variables.
