40|$|Multi-factor models provide {{considerable}} exibility {{in representing}} the dy-namic behavior of asset prices. European options {{can be written}} {{in terms of the}} prices of a set of (possibly articial) assets and probabilities that the op-tion expires in-the-money. The values of these terms must be evaluated with respect to appropriately transformed factor processes. For certain classes of models, all of the required terms can be computed by solving a system of or-dinary dierential equations, making the approach computationally tractable. The exibility of the framework is illustrated by providing explicit solutions for pricing options on dividend paying <b>spot</b> <b>assets,</b> on futures written on <b>spot</b> <b>assets,</b> on zero-coupon bonds and zero-coupon bond futures...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a closed-form option pricing formula for a <b>spot</b> <b>asset</b> whose variance follows a GARCH process. The model allows for correlation between returns of the <b>spot</b> <b>asset</b> and variance and also admits multiple lags in {{the dynamics of}} the GARCH process. The single-factor (one-lag) version of this model contains Heston’s (1993) stochastic volatility model as a diffusion limit and therefore unifies the discrete-time GARCH and continuous-time stochastic volatility literature of option pricing. The new model provides the first readily computed option formula for a random volatility model in which current volatility is easily estimated from historical asset prices observed at discrete intervals. Empirical analysis on S&P 500 index options shows the single-factor version of the GARCH model to be a substantial improvement over the Black-Scholes (1973) model. The GARCH model continues to substantially outperform the Black-Scholes model even when the Black-Scholes model is updated every period and uses implied volatilities from option prices, while the parameters of the GARCH model are held constant and volatility is filtered from the history of asset prices. The improvement is due largely to the ability of the GARCH model to describe the correlation of volatility with spot returns. This allows the GARCH model to capture strike-price biases in the Black-Scholes model that give rise to the skew in implied volatilities in the index options market...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} discuss a new {{technique}} to derive an good approximated solution {{for the price of}} a European call and put options, in a market model with stochastic volatility. In particular, the model that we have considered is the Heston's model. This allows arbitrary correlation between volatility and <b>spot</b> <b>asset</b> returns. We are able to write the price of European call and put, in the same form in which one can see in the Black-Scholes model. The solution technique is based upon coordinate transformations that reduce the initial PDE in a straightforward one-dimensional heat equation. ...|$|R

Fourteen of twenty-two experiments exhibit price bubbles. This tendency to bubble decreases with trader experience. The regression of changes in mean price on lagged excess bids (bids minus offers in the previous period) supports the hypothesis that the intercept is minus the one-period expected dividend value, and the slope is positive, where excess bids measures excess demand attributable to homegrown capital gains expectations.

40|$|The authors use {{the term}} {{structure}} of futures prices to test whether investors anticipate mean reversion in <b>spot</b> <b>asset</b> prices. The empirical results indicate mean reversion in each market they examine. For agricultural commodities and crude oil, {{the magnitude of the}} estimated mean reversion is large; for example, point estimates indicate that 44 percent of a typical spot oil price shock is expected to be reversed over the subsequent eight months. For metals, the degree of mean reversion is substantially less but still statistically significant. The authors detect only weak evidence of mean reversion in financial asset prices.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays with each essay forming a chapter. The regression models in these three chapters are different but share the same feature: the error terms of the models all follow ARMA-GARCH error processes generated either from normal or exponential power distributions. In the first chapter I present a <b>spot</b> <b>asset</b> pricing model that {{is known as the}} CKLS model. Two CKLS models are compared. In one model the ARMA-GARCH error process is generated by the exponential power distribution while in the other model the error process is generated by the normal distribution. Using monthly U. S. federal funds rate I estimate the parameters of the CKLS models. From the predictive densities I obtain the distributions of the mean squared errors of forecast (MSEF) and the predictive deviance information criterion (PDIC). In addition I use the Bayes factor and the deviance information criterion (DIC). Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which are stochastic numerical integration methods, are used. I find that in general the CKLS model with the error term generated by the exponential power distribution is chosen over the model with the normal error term...|$|R

A new approach is introduced for predicting future spot volatility and future volatility surface using a finite set of observed option prices. When the volatility parameter σ 2 in the Black-Scholes formula[image omitted]   is represented by the integrated volatility [image omitted]  , then the local volatility surface can be estimated. The main idea is to linearize the expressions for implied volatility by using a result on Normal correlation. This linearization is obtained by introducing various ad hoc approximations. ...|$|R
40|$|Asset exchanges, such as {{mergers and}} acquisitions, {{typically}} {{give rise to}} abnormal returns. This dissertation tests a fads hypothesis for abnormal returns on initial public offerings, an asset exchange in which traders exchange cash for issuers' new shares. Initial public offerings, or IPOs, exhibit positive abnormal returns on {{the date of the}} exchange when trading prices, on average, rise above offering prices. IPOs also exhibit negative abnormal returns after the exchange as trading prices, on average, fall relative to those on comparable-risk assets. In the fads hypothesis, IPOs occur when a fad, or mass psychogical movement, induces traders to bid the trading prices of certain types of assets up over their intrinsic prices. These high trading prices offer a quasi-arbitrage opportunity that motivates unaffected traders to short-sell seasoned shares affected by the fad or issue new shares based on like assets. For the fads hypothesis to explain abnormal returns on IPOs, fads among traders must allow price bubbles to persist long enough for rational traders to issue IPOs, and rational traders must actually do so. This dissertation's experimental <b>spot</b> <b>asset</b> double auction markets show that the duration of price booms, or rising differences between trading prices and intrinsic prices, significantly increases with an increase in asset life, suggesting that differences between trading prices and intrinsic prices can persist. This laboratory finding parallels field findings that closed-end fund trading prices only converge to net asset values (an intrinsic price proxy) when secondary trading ceases due to merger, liquidation or open-ending. This finding is consistent with bubbles persisting long enough for quasi-arbitrage responses. This dissertation also shows that an apparent fad in closed-end country funds led issuers and underwriters to organize an extraordinary number of IPOs in late 1989 and early 1990. These issuers profited by promising to purchase assets at net asset values and selling shares based on that promise at a premium. The shares issued during this apparent fad had positive abnormal returns in their initial rise from offering prices to trading prices, and subsequently had negative abnormal returns as their premium trading prices fell to discounts. This closed-end country fund findings are consistent with the fads hypothesis of abnormal returns on IPO asset exchanges...|$|R
40|$|Most {{models for}} barrier pricing are {{designed}} to let a market maker tune the model-implied covariance between moves in the <b>asset</b> <b>spot</b> price and moves in the implied volatility skew. This is often implemented with a local volatility/stochastic volatility mixture model, where the mixture parameter tunes that covariance. This paper defines an alternate model where the spot/volatility correlation is a separate mean-reverting stochastic variable which is itself correlated with spot. We also develop an efficient approximation for barrier option and one touch pricing in the model based on semi-static vega replication and compare it with Monte Carlo pricing. The approximation works well in markets where the risk neutral drift is modest. ...|$|R
40|$|Under {{departures from}} the cost-of-carry theory, traded spot prices and {{conditional}} volatility disturbed from futures market have significant impacts on futures price of emissions allowances, {{and then we}} propose time-varying hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness estimation using ECM-GARCH model. Our empirical results show that conditional variance, conditional covariance, and their correlation between between spot and futures prices exhibit time-varying trends. Conditional volatility of spot prices, conditional volatility disturbed from futures market, and conditional correlation of market noises implied from spot and futures markets have significant effects on time-varying hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness. In the immature emissions allowances market, market participants optimize portfolio sizes between <b>spot</b> and futures <b>assets</b> using historical market information and then achieve higher risk reduction of assets portfolio revenues; accordingly, we can obtain better hedging effectiveness through time-varying hedge ratios with departures from the cost-of-carry theory...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the volatility transmission mechanism between the futures and corresponding underlying <b>asset</b> <b>spot</b> markets, focusing on Turkish currency and stock index futures {{traded on the}} lately established Turkish Derivatives Exchange (TURKDEX). Employing multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity modeling, which allows for potential spillovers and asymmetries in the variance-covariance structure for the market returns, the paper investigates the volatility interactions among {{each of the three}} futures-spot market systems. For all market systems under study, the volatility spillovers are found to be important and bidirectional. For the stock index market system, in line with the previous literature, volatility shows asymmetric behavior and strong asymmetric shock transmission. The main implication is that investors need to account for volatility spillovers and asymmetries among the futures and the spot markets to correctly build hedging strategies. asymmetric volatility, futures market, multivariate GARCH, Turkish Derivatives Exchange, volatility transmission,...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} hedging and pricing claims for delivery of crude oil or natural gas to a given location. We work with a three factor model for the <b>asset</b> <b>spot,</b> the convenience yield and the locational basis. The convenience yield is taken to be unobserved and must be filtered. We study the value function corresponding to utility pricing with exponential utility. Assuming the basis is independent from the spot, the partially observed stochastic control problem can be expressed as a closed-form expectation. We show how to numerically compute this expectation using a Kalman or particle filter. The basic model may be generalized to include nonlinear dynamics and further dependencies. We compute a set of numerical statics and we compare our results in the partially observed case {{to those of the}} full information case. convenience yield, filtering, partial observations, stochastic control, utility pricing, HJB equation 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{drawdown}} of {{an asset}} {{is a risk}} measure {{defined in terms of}} the running maximum of the <b>asset’s</b> <b>spot</b> price over some period [0, T]. The asset price is said to have drawn down by at least $K over this period if there exists a time at which the underlying is at least $K below its maximum-to-date. We introduce insurance against a large realization of maximum drawdown and a novel way to hedge the liability incurred by underwriting this insurance. Our proposed insurance pays a fixed amount should the maximum drawdown exceed some fixed threshold over a specified period. The need for this drawdown insurance would diminish should markets rise before they fall. Consequently, we propose a second kind of cheaper maximum drawdown insurance that pays a fixed amount contingent on the drawdown preceding a drawup. We propose double barrier options as hedges for both kinds of insurance against large maximum drawdowns. In fact for the second kind of insurance we show that the hedge is model-free. Since double barrier options do not trade liquidly in all markets, we examine the assumptions under which alternative hedges using either single barrier options or standard vanilla options can be used...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} {{an investigation}} into the efficiency of the crude oil futures market and the forecasting accuracy of futures prices. Efficiency of the market is analysed in terms of the expected excess returns to speculation in the futures market. Accuracy of futures prices is compared with that of forecasts using alternative techniques, including time series and econometric models, as well as judgemental forecasts. The paper also explores the predictive power of futures prices by comparing the forecasting accuracy of end-of-month prices with weekly and monthly averages, using a variety of different weighting schemes. Finally, the paper investigates whether the forecasts from using futures prices can be improved by incorporating information from other forecasting techniques.

Contrary to what one might have expected given the alleged peso overvaluation, exporting firms outperformed the market beginning in late 1993. Although interest rates fail to show a clear confidence loss in the exchange rate regime, the relative performance of net exporters suggests that expectations of devaluation increased continuously. The methodology presented is relevant beyond the Mexican case: sectoral differences in stock market performance may constitute valuable leading indicators of exchange rate changes in emerging markets.
