40|$|The inverse {{relationship}} between stockholder concentration and executive compensation reflects the reduced asymmetry of information that accompanies greater stockholder concentration. Using a sample of firms with separate salary and bonus data for the CEO, we find stockholder control to be a highly significant determinant of bonus and simultaneously an insignificant determinant of <b>salary,</b> <b>supporting</b> the contention that stockholder monitoring and incentive contracts are alternate means of ensuring managerial compliance with stockholder objectives. This reconciles the "monopoly" view that managers of firms are able to exploit the information asymmetry, with the "competitive view" that the market for managers is efficient...|$|R

And he has served the Department and the University well in this capacity." [...] Further, [...] "...it is certainly justified for Dr. Chun to feel...he is being penalized for good performance," [...] and concluded [...] "In my judgment Dr. Chun has been exploited by the Department."

5000|$|After {{winning the}} Nobel Prize, Baltimore reorganized his laboratory, {{refocusing}} on immunology and virology, with immunoglobulin gene expression {{as a major}} area of interest. In 1973, he was awarded a prestigious American Cancer Society Professor of Microbiology that provided substantial <b>salary</b> <b>support.</b> Also in 1973, {{he became one of}} the early faculty members in the newly organized MIT Center for Cancer capping a creative and industrious period of his career with nearly fifty research publications including the paradigm-shifting paper on reverse transcriptase. The MIT CRC was led by Salvador E. Luria and quickly achieved pre-eminence with a remarkable group of faculty including Baltimore, Phillips Robbins, Herman Eisen, Philip Sharp, and Robert Weinberg, who all went on to illustrious research careers. Baltimore was honored as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974. He returned to New York City in 1975, for a year-long sabbatical at Rockefeller University working with Jim Darnell. In 1975, at the age of 37, he shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Howard Temin and Renato Dulbecco. The citation reads, [...] "for their discoveries concerning the interaction between tumor viruses and the genetic material of the cell." [...] At the time, Baltimore's greatest contribution to virology was his discovery of reverse transcriptase (Rtase or RT) which is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as HIV and was discovered independently, and at about the same time, by Mizutani and Temin. Following this, his lab and intellectual interests expanded tackling new problems such as the pathogenesis of Abelson murine leukemia virus (AMuLV), lymphocyte differentiation and related topic in immunology. In 1980, his group isolated the oncogene in AMuLV and showed it was a member of a new class of protein kinases that used the amino acid tyrosine as a phosphoacceptor. This type of enzymatic activity was also discovered by Tony Hunter, who has done extensive work in the area. He also continued to pursue fundamental questions in RNA viruses and in 1981, Baltimore and Vincent Racaniello, a post-doctoral fellow in his laboratory, used recombinant DNA technology to generate a plasmid encoding the genome of poliovirus, an animal RNA virus. The plasmid DNA was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced. The infectious clone, DNA encoding the genome of a virus, is a standard tool used today in virology.|$|E

A Harold Sterling Vanderbilt Scholarship provided partial <b>salary</b> <b>support</b> during the early stages of this effort. In terms of extramural financial support, the National Library of Medicine provided two years of <b>salary</b> <b>support</b> and equipment monies during early phases of this work through a pre-doctoral training grant (LM 00053 - 01 A 1). Funds provided by the National Science Foundation supported early equipment purchases (CDA- 9617519), and a contract from Suntory Pharmaceuticals funded expansion of SIMON to six additional ICU beds.
