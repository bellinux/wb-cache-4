50|$|A {{function}} key {{is a key}} on a computer or terminal keyboard which can be programmed so as to cause an operating system command interpreter or application program to perform certain actions, a form of <b>soft</b> <b>key.</b> On some keyboards/computers, {{function key}}s may have default actions, accessible on power-on.|$|E
50|$|The player uses a tilted {{scrolling}} {{effect for}} video and album art. The user navigates through the items stored on the Walkman by sliding the {{fingers over the}} screen and tapping to select an item. The separate buttons for volume, play and track navigation allow use in a pocket or by the visually impaired. The main functions are laid out as icons on the main screen. 'Music Menu' lists songs, artists, albums and genres. A <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> that {{at the bottom of}} all music screens allows selection of various sub-menus, including a folder browser option.|$|E
50|$|To {{make matters}} worse, some phones {{make it easier}} to call the {{emergency}} services when the keypad is locked than it would be otherwise. An example of this is a <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> programmed to make an emergency call when the keylock is set. On touch-screen phones, passcode screens often include a single button that, when touched for just a few seconds, will dial emergency services. The result is that it is often preferable to disable the passcode since, while doing so increases the likelihood of pocket dialing family and friends, it is considered a lesser evil than pocket dialing the emergency services.|$|E

5000|$|H-DOS was {{remarkable}} and is of historical significance because it featured a simple menu system. The [...] through [...] keys beneath the 7" [...] screen corresponded to five menu items {{displayed at the}} bottom of the screen. This menu was context sensitive and greatly facilitated entering DOS commands. All but the least frequently used commands were available as F-key menu selections, and this greatly reduced the amount of typing required. This user interface was comparable to the many DOS shell programs available at the time, but functioned much more smoothly because of the <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> concept.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{mobile phone}} with soft keys has them located beneath the bottom left and bottom {{right of the}} display; some, {{especially}} those made by Nokia, have an additional center <b>soft</b> <b>key,</b> activated by pressing {{on the center of}} the directional pad. Depending on the modality of the application, various functions can be mapped onto it. It can also bring up multiple functions listed on a pop-up expanded menu. Usually the prompt text on the display for the softkey is not allowed to be truncated or omitted with ellipsis. The softkey itself is usually not printed with a functional icon or text, but is often marked with a dot or short bar.|$|E
5000|$|Screen-labeled {{function}} keys are {{a special case}} of <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> ({{function keys}}) where keys are placed near a screen, which provides labels for them. These are today most commonly found in kiosk applications, such as automated teller machines and gas pumps. Screen-label function keys generally date to the late 1960s, and kiosk applications were particularly common in the 1990s and 2000s. Most recently, these keys have found use in point of sale systems; NCR Corporation claims that their DynaKey system [...] "has been proven to reduce training time and cashier errors". An alternative to screen-labeled function keys is buttons (virtual keys) on a touchscreen, where the label is directly pushable. The increased prevalence of touchscreens in the 2000s {{has led to a}} decrease in screen-labeled function keys. However, screen-labeled function keys are inexpensive and robust, and provide tactile feedback.|$|E

50|$|A softkey or <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> is {{a button}} {{flexibly}} programmable to invoke {{any of a}} number of functions rather than being associated with a single fixed function or a fixed set of functions. A softkey is often located alongside a display device of a portable device such as a cellular phone, where the button invokes a function described by the text at that moment shown adjacent to the button on the display. However, softkeys are also found away from the display device, for example on the sides of cellular phones, where they are typically programmed to invoke functions such as PTT, memo, or volume control. Softkeys are generally found on keyboards (e.g. the F keys), cellular phones, Automated Teller Machines, Primary Flight and Multi-Function Displays, although they are also found elsewhere. Hard key is the contrary term, which means a hard-coded key such as a number key pad or the Send/End key of a mobile phone. Depending on the development company, cellular phone softkeys are often called F1(Left), F2(Right).|$|E
5000|$|The K800i/K790 is a [...] "block" [...] (or [...] "candy bar") style {{phone that}} weighs 115 grams, with its buttons {{operated}} by the thumb. It has the [...] "dual-front" [...] design common to most Sony Ericsson mobile phones since the Sony Ericsson K700, {{with the back of}} the mobile phone designed like a digital camera and intended to be held sideways to take photographs. The central joystick button is used for selecting options and navigating menus, with the [...] "C" [...] button as an undo or delete key, and the arrow-labelled button as a [...] "back button". The two buttons labelled by white horizontal lines, known as hotkeys or soft keys perform the function of making decisions with only two choices. Such decisions are labelled on the phone's display. The button in between the right <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> and the [...] "C" [...] button acts as a shortcut key, which brings up a user-customisable shortcut menu when pressed. The two [...] "A/B" [...] buttons {{on either side of the}} earpiece are used for horizontal games support, as in the Sony Ericsson W550/W600. The on/off button is located on the top of the phone. The Memory Stick Micro M2 slot is located on the left-hand side of the phone. On the right-hand side of the phone there are three keys: two for controlling volume, skipping through tracks in the Media Player, changing radio channel, and zooming in and out when in camera mode. The third button on the right is the camera shutter button which operates the phone's key feature, a 3.2-megapixel Cyber-shot digital camera. In amongst the speaker at the top of the phone is a small camera used for video calls. Located next to this is the IrDA port.|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} {{research}} studies, Brain-Computer Interaction {{is considered a}} new research opportunity and novel way {{to interact with the}} game player in gaming and entertainment sector. There has been little academic research on players' attention and meditation with mobile input gaming devices. The research focuses on mobile interaction input for mobile games with the aim of study to examine how attention (e. g. focus, concentration) and meditation (e. g. calmness, stress) differs between mobile inputs. By comparing attention and meditation levels of players across mobile input, the research plans to achieve this by extracting information from mobile players using low cost electroencephalography headset to understand mobile input interaction and measure emotional states of users interacting with the mobile platform. Results showed that players have lower attention level on hard key than <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> while hard key meditation level is higher than <b>soft</b> <b>key...</b>|$|E

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{the importance of}} balanced management of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> success factors, combining the economic logic of corporate performance and human capital through an integrated approach to mergers and acquisitions. The study, based on a questionnaire and interviews, suggests that the achievement level ofmergers and acquisitions’ objectives of acquiring companies in Slovenia should be comparable to findings of similar studies; namely, the objectives that drove the deal were met only half the time. The results indicate that five hard success factors – a professional target search and due diligence, a realistic assessment of synergies, theright mix of financial sources, a detailed post-acquisition integration plan already prepared in the pre-deal phase and its speedy implementation – and five soft success factors – a new “combined” organizational culture, a competent management team, innovative employees, efficient and consistent communication and a creative business environment – are becoming increasingly relevant. Even though they differ in their importance for individual companies in the sample, they are all considered essential to increasing the success rate of corporate combination...|$|E

40|$|Received —; {{accepted}} — Aims. X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) {{are soft}} gamma-ray bursts whose nature is not clear. Their soft spectrum can {{be due to}} cosmological effects (high redshift), an off-axis view of the jet or can be intrinsic to the source. We use SWIFT observations to investigate different scenarios proposed to explain their origin. Methods. We have made a systematic analysis of the afterglows of XRFs with known redshift observed by SWIFT. We derive their redshift and luminosity distributions, and compare their properties {{with a sample of}} normal GRBs observed by the same instrument. Results. The high distance hypothesis is ruled out by the redshift distribution of our sample of XRFs, indicating that, at least for our sample, the off-axis and sub-energetic hypotheses are preferred. Of course, this does not exclude that some XRFs without known redshift could be at high distance. However we find that taking into account the sensitivity of the BAT instrument, SWIFT XRFs cannot be detected beyond redshift ≈ 3. The luminosity distribution of XRFs is similar to the GRB one. This would rule out most off-axis models, but for the homogeneous jet model. However this model predicts a GRB rate uncomfortably near the observed rate of supernovae. This may imply that XRFs, at least those of our sample, could be intrinsically <b>soft.</b> <b>Key</b> words. X-ray: flares—Gamma-ray: bursts 1...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Continuous {{improvement}} as {{a business}} philosophy and quality management strategy has become the choice of many organisations world-wide. It is a concept filled with the promise for excellence in quality, customer service distinction and business efficiencies. Continuous improvement philosophies like Lean Manufacturing, promote tools, techniques and a culture of quality values that {{have the potential to}} create a dynamic business environment, capable of seizing opportunity, predicting failures and surpassing competition. Why then, are these organisations that are so vehemently pursuing continuous improvement initiatives with concerted efforts not reaping the rewards that have been successfully achieved by a monumental few great organisations? According to the literature study, failure to implement continuous improvement (CI) programs successfully stems from a lack of focus on the soft side of continuous improvement efforts. The soft issues that are considered vital to successful implementation include an employee’s quality cultural values and an organisations <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> success factors for CI implementation. This study focused on how these soft variables have an impact on employee attitudes such as job satisfaction, employee commitment, intentions to quit and work success. The theoretical research conducted in this study focused on continuous improvement cultural values and the key soft success factors for CI implementation impact on work related attitudes like job satisfaction, employee commitment, intentions to quit and work success. The empirical study was conducted on 149 employees in a multi-national manufacturing company. A questionnaire was distributed throughout the entire company to verify how the theoretical and empirical data compared. The study concluded that the specific cultural value of shared vision and goals {{was a significant predictor of}} all four work related attitudes, whilst other cultural values of purpose and continuous improvement also proved to be significant predictors. The study concluded that key soft success factors like leadership, training and development and job security were significant predictors of employee commitment, whilst communication and job security were significant predictors of job satisfaction. Thus, work related attitudes like employee commitment is greater when employees identify and exhibit favourable quality cultural values and also when employees perceive that their organisation possess essential key soft factors for successful CI implementation. Incorporating these findings into recommendations will allow for organisations implementing CI programs, to develop the soft issues of CI that have a beneficial impact on work related attitudes that lead to successful and sustainable continuous improvement efforts.
