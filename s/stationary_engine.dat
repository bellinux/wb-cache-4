25|$|The Baldwin Locomotive Works had {{a humble}} beginning. Matthias W. Baldwin, the founder, was a {{jeweller}} and whitesmith, who, in 1825, formed {{a partnership with}} a machinist, and engaged {{in the manufacture of}} bookbinders' tools and cylinders for calico printing. Baldwin then designed and constructed for his own use a small <b>stationary</b> <b>engine,</b> the workmanship of which was so excellent and its efficiency so great that he was solicited to build others like it for various parties, and thus led to turn his attention to steam engineering. The original engine was in use and powered many departments of the works for well over 60 years, and is currently on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s Scott {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of stationary engines {{with the aim of}} raising funds following the decline in motorcycle sales. Some of these engines were derived from motorcycle units, for instance the DSE was a watercooled version of the Lightweight Squirrel engine and the SE had the same bore and stroke dimensions as the long stroke Flyers. It has come to light that the SE does not have the same bore size as the Long Stroke Flyer (73mm) but has a bore size of 78mm, this has been confirmed on two Scott SE engines. The PA <b>stationary</b> <b>engine</b> however was different. Designed to meet a Ministry requirement for a portable electrical generator for the Bofors anti-aircraft gun and its Kerrison Predictor, it was produced during the Second World War by both Scott and its former partners Jowett.|$|E

25|$|James Watt, a Scottish {{inventor}} {{and mechanical}} engineer, greatly improved the steam engine of Thomas Newcomen, hitherto used to pump {{water out of}} mines. Watt developed a reciprocating engine in 1769, capable of powering a wheel. Although the Watt engine powered cotton mills {{and a variety of}} machinery, it was a large <b>stationary</b> <b>engine.</b> It could not be otherwise: the state of boiler technology necessitated the use of low pressure steam acting upon a vacuum in the cylinder; this required a separate condenser and an air pump. Nevertheless, as the construction of boilers improved, Watt investigated the use of high-pressure steam acting directly upon a piston. This raised the possibility of a smaller engine, that might be used to power a vehicle and he patented a design for a steam locomotive in 1784. His employee William Murdoch produced a working model of a self-propelled steam carriage in that year.|$|E

[...] He built a steam-driven workshop in his garden, salvaging parts from various mills, including line shaft gear and a <b>stationary</b> <b>engine</b> from a mill in Oldham. [...] He gave a conservative estimate of four years to complete the work, but the restoration eventually took 27years. The engine was sold at auction in July 2010 for £240,000.|$|E

500|$|The cost of {{building}} the railway had greatly exceeded the estimates. By September 1825 the company had borrowed £60,000 in short-term loans and needed to start earning an income to ward of its creditors. A railway coach, named Experiment, arrived {{on the evening of}} 26 September 1825 and was attached to Locomotion No. 1, which had been placed on the rails {{for the first time at}} Aycliffe Lane station following the completion of its journey by road from Newcastle earlier that same day. Pease, Stephenson and other members of the committee then made an experimental journey to Darlington [...] before taking the locomotive and coach to Shildon in preparation for the opening day, with James Stephenson, George's elder brother, at the controls. On 27 September, between 7am and 8am, 12 waggons of coal were drawn up Etherley North Bank by a rope attached to the <b>stationary</b> <b>engine</b> at the top, and then let down the South Bank to St Helen's Auckland. A waggon of flour bags was attached and horses hauled the train across the Gaunless Bridge to the bottom of Brusselton West Bank, where thousands watched the second <b>stationary</b> <b>engine</b> draw the train up the incline. The train was let down the East Bank to Mason's Arms Crossing at Shildon Lane End, where Locomotion No. 1, Experiment and 21 new coal waggons fitted with seats were waiting.|$|E
500|$|James Beatty {{left the}} Crimea in November {{to return to}} England, a sick man, and Donald Campbell took over. Earlier in September Her Majesty's Floating Factory Chasseur arrived at Balaclava to provide an {{engineering}} service {{under the direction of}} Robert Frazer. A third <b>stationary</b> <b>engine</b> also arrived. Due to the haste in which the railway had been constructed, it was in danger of being severely damaged by the weather of the coming winter. William Doyne organised the building of new lines of a superior quality, again in a short time. By November 10, [...] of track had been laid between Balaclava and the British headquarters. The lines towards the Sardinian and French headquarters were also advancing.|$|E
500|$|A {{branch line}} was also [...] "to join and {{communicate}} with the... Bolton and Leigh Railway", at a junction near the Daubhill <b>Stationary</b> <b>Engine,</b> this line was however, not built. [...] The company later shared their railway, including their station at Salford, with the Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway Company (MB) and both worked together to construct a junction at Clifton Junction railway station. [...] In 1846 the company {{was taken over by}} the Manchester and Leeds Railway, which itself became the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway the following year. In 1922 it amalgamated into the London and North Western Railway, and in 1923 this company amalgamated into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. This company was nationalised in 1948 under the Transport Act 1947, and became part of British Railways.|$|E

500|$|That same day, Aide de Camp Maurice Baring {{was sent}} by Major General Hugh Trenchard to gather such {{military}} intelligence as he could about the dogfight. Baring interviewed McCudden, Maybery, Hoidge, and Rhys-Davids. McCudden laconically reported his observation of the crash location being near Zonnebeke. Maybery insisted he saw two triplanes in the fight, a grey one and a green one, {{in addition to a}} green German scout and a rednosed German scout. Hoidge never saw the rednosed Albatros. Rhys-Davids said the dogfight began when a red-nosed Albatros, a green German scout, and a grey and brown Triplane attacked an SE.5. He aso insisted that the triplane mounted four guns, and thought it had a <b>stationary</b> <b>engine</b> instead of a rotary engine. Subsequent accounts of Voss's last stand would partially depend on such [...] "facts" [...] drawn from Baring's inquiries.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, James Beatty, who {{had played}} an {{important}} part in working with Peto's partnership to build the European and North American Railway, was recruited as chief engineer. The line was surveyed by Donald Campbell, who had also worked on the European and North American Railway. Campbell's first task was to create a wharf at Balaclava where the railway materials could be unloaded, with a yard adjacent. He planned for the track to pass along the middle of the main street of the town. It then went through a gorge at the north of the town close to the water's edge and over swampy ground to the village of Kadikoi. From here, the railway had to rise some [...] {{to the top of the}} plateau. Of the routes available, Campbell chose to follow the existing road. Although at parts its gradient was as steep as 1 in 7, Campbell managed find a route with a maximum gradient of 1 in 14. [...] A <b>stationary</b> <b>engine</b> would be required at the top of this stretch to pull the railway carriages up the incline. Once on the plateau, the ground was rough but fairly level and here it presented fewer problems. Lord Raglan's headquarters were at the top of the col, and it was decided that a depot should be constructed here.|$|E
500|$|The Stanhope and Tyne Railway, a [...] {{line between}} South Shields and Stanhope had opened in 1834. Steam {{locomotives}} worked the section east of Annfield, {{and in the}} western section inclines were worked by stationary engines or gravity, with horses hauling waggons over level track. The lime kilns and the line between Stanhope and Carrhouse closed in 1840, and with the Stanhope to Annfield section losing money, the insolvent railway company was dissolved on 5 February 1841. The northern section became the Pontop and South Shields Railway and the southern section from Stanhope to Carrhouse was bought by the newly formed Derwent Iron Company at Consett, renamed the Wear & Derwent Railway, and used to transport limestone from quarries in the Stanhope area to its works at Consett. The Weardale Extension Railway ran from Waskerley on the Wear & Derwent to Crook on the BA and included the Sunniside Incline worked by a <b>stationary</b> <b>engine.</b> Sponsored by the Derwent Iron Company, the [...] line was built by the S and opened on 16 May 1845. A passenger service started to Hownes Gill and Stanhope (Crawley) on 1 September 1845; the Stanhope service was withdrawn {{at the end of}} 1846. Travelling north from Crook the carriages and waggons were drawn up the Sunniside Incline, a locomotive hauled the mixed train to Waskerley Park Junction, then they were let down Nanny Mayor's Incline and a locomotive took them forward. When returning, regulations required that the carriages run loose down the Sunniside Incline and they were let to run into Crook station, controlled by the guard using the carriage brakes. Later, a [...] viaduct replaced the two inclines at Hownes Gill ravine on 1 July 1858. A deviation replacing Nanny's Mayor's Incline and a curve that allowed trains from Crook direct access to Rowley opened for freight on 23 May 1859 and for passenger traffic on 4 July 1859.|$|E
