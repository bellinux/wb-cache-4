5000|$|The '8' in the car's name did not {{indicate}} an eight-cylinder engine; it had but four cylinders, and was officially rated as a 6CV vehicle for tax purposes. At launch the car featured a 1,089 cc engine with a claimed output of 32 hp at 4,000 rpm. [...] Fuel feed came via a Solex 30mm carburetor and overhead valves driven, using rods and rocker arms, by a <b>side-mounted</b> <b>camshaft.</b> [...] An unusual feature {{at the time was}} the use of aluminium for the cylinder head.|$|E
50|$|Claimed {{output from}} the 569 cm³ engine was boosted from 12 to 16.5 bhp {{achieved}} at 4,400 rpm. The engine employed overhead valves operated with a <b>side-mounted</b> <b>camshaft.</b> The light-weight 6 inherited its predecessor’s excellent fuel economy, with 5 litres of fuel propelling {{it over a}} distance of 108 km, equivalent to more than 61 mpg (UK gallons). The advertised maximum speed of 90 or 95 km/h (56 or 59 mph) also reflected the car’s light build, and was considered excellent for a car of this size and price.|$|E
50|$|The {{new engine}} {{was based on}} the unit that had {{originally}} been developed with a <b>side-mounted</b> <b>camshaft</b> for launch in the 1939 “Buckeltaunus”. Now, however, the originally planned side-valve configuration was replaced, {{for the first time on}} a German Ford, with an overhead camshaft. This reflected developments also underway in England where a new ohv-engined Ford Consul had appeared in 1951. The crankshaft on the new German Ford engine was formed from tube rather than from a solid casting, which was seen as a way to save weight.|$|E
5000|$|The Cléon-Alu engine, {{also known}} under the code [...] "A engine [...] " [...] or [...] "A-Type" [...] (A for aluminium) is an {{automotive}} internal combustion gasoline engine, developed and produced by Renault in 1960. A four-stroke inline four-cylinder design with aluminium-alloy block and cylinder-head, it was water cooled, with a five main-bearing crankshaft and a <b>side-mounted</b> chain-driven <b>camshaft</b> operating eight overhead valves via pushrods and rockers. It {{made its debut}} appearance on the Renault 16.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967 Ford added a 1.7-litre version {{to their}} Ford 12M/15M range. Both the Kadett and the Ford by now took up more road space than a typical European 1.1-litre small family sedan, and in September 1967 Opel added a 1,698 cc engine to the Kadett's range of {{available}} power units. A suitable unit already existed, having been fitted in the Opel Rekord since 1965. The engine in question {{had been the}} manufacturer's second all-new engine design since the war, although much of its underlying philosophy came from General Motors developments in Detroit and from experience with the new engine developed for the Kadett A earlier in the 1960s. Opel's so-called Camshaft in Head (CIH) engine followed the trends {{of the time in}} replacing side-valves with an overhead valvegear configuration, which was no doubt facilitated by the over-square architecture of the cylinder block: the engine also carried its camshaft directly above the cylinders. However, instead of operating directly on the cylinder valves, the camshaft still operated the valves using rods and rocker arms because, unusually (except within general Motors) the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves. One reason for this may have been cosmetic. Opel's Camshaft in Head (CIH) engine configuration enabled a succession of Opels to feature the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments favoured. As on the smaller Kadett engines with their <b>side-mounted</b> <b>camshafts,</b> the [...] "in head" [...] camshaft on the Opel CIH engine was chain driven, a weight-saving option which reduced lumpiness and friction at higher engine speeds when compared with the gear-cogs which had been used to drive camshafts in the previous generation of Opel engines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new vehicle}} used the petrol {{engine of the}} Fiat 132, but with a longer stroke which {{increased}} the capacity to 1,995 cc. - the same enlarged engine {{turned up in the}} Fiat 132 itself two years later, albeit with twin overhead camshafts. There was a light alloy cylinder head: instead of the twin overhead camshafts of the 132, the engine in the Campagnola had a single <b>side-mounted</b> <b>camshaft</b> driven by a toothed belt, the valve movement being driven by pushrods and rockers. The large square engine compartment gave easy access to the engine bay which was designed to permit [...] "wading" [...] up to 70 cm deep.|$|E
5000|$|The FN Typ 1250 was {{followed}} by the FN Typ 1300, available in 3 different version designated [...] "A", [...] "B" [...] or [...] "C". Technically all were identical, but with differing wheelbases and equipment levels. They were powered by a 4-cylinder 1327 cm³ engine with a <b>side-mounted</b> <b>camshaft</b> and overhead valves. The cars were delivered with wide low-pressure [...] "Balloon" [...] tyres, and four wheel brakes. The range was later broadened {{with the arrival of the}} FN Typ 1300D with four speed transmission, followed by the Typ 1300E with a widened track and the FN Typ 1300Sp developed for sports driving. The model was very successful.|$|E
50|$|The new four-cylinder, {{oversquare}} one-litre water-cooled Opel OHV engine weighed only 96 kg and was {{the first}} all-new engine developed by Opel since before the war. The <b>side-mounted</b> <b>camshaft</b> was driven not through gear-cogs but using a single chain with a hydraulic tensioner, the valve train employing rocker-arms and light-weight hollow rods. The arrangement was low on weight and on friction, permitting engine speeds above 6,000 rpm. The pistons were formed from an aluminium-alloy and incorporated a bimetal expansion strip to ensure uniform thermal expansion. The three-bearing forged crankshaft was of more traditional construction. The carefully designed aluminium inlet manifold provided for efficient feed of the fuel-mixture to the cylinders and helped provide the engine with good fuel economy characteristics.|$|E
