50|$|For 1961, DeSoto {{lost its}} <b>series</b> <b>designations</b> entirely, {{in a move}} {{reminiscent}} of Packard's final lineup. And, like the final Packards, the final DeSoto was of questionable design merit. Again, based on the shorter Chrysler Windsor wheelbase, the DeSoto featured a two-tiered grille (each tier with a different texture) and revised taillights. Only a two-door hardtop and a four-door hardtop were offered. The cars were trimmed similarly to the 1960 Fireflite.|$|R
5000|$|In 1911, Buick {{introduced}} its first closed-body car, four {{years ahead of}} Ford; the car was built at the all-new factory in Flint which later became {{to be known as}} Buick City. Buick during the 1920s made various sized vehicles, with <b>series</b> <b>designations</b> for different years, sometimes using numbers, while later years using lettered designations. One of the larger vehicles with straight-six and straight-eight engines was the Buick Master Six.|$|R
2500|$|The 1968 Chevelle {{received}} an all-new distinctly sculpted body with tapered front fenders and a rounded beltline. The car adopted a long-hood/short-deck profile {{with a high}} rear-quarter [...] "kick-up". While all 1967 Chevelle models rode a [...] wheelbase, the 1968 coupes and convertibles now rode a [...] wheelbase. The sedans and wagons turned to a [...] span. Tread width grew an inch front and rear. Hardtop coupes featured a semi-fastback, flowing roofline (with a long hood and short deck, mimicking the Camaro (which itself was {{an answer to the}} Ford Mustang). Top-trim models (including the SS 396 and new luxury Concours) featured GM's new Hide-A-Way wiper system. Lesser Chevelles would get that change later. The entry level Chevelle 300 (131 - 132 VIN prefix) was available as a pillared coupe and/or station wagon (Nomad) while the 300 Deluxe and Nomad Custom (133 or 134 VIN prefix) had a 2 door hardtop added to the lineup (fourth and fifth VIN characters will be 37; with the previous 300 Deluxe the hardtop was available with the Malibu and SS396 but not the base 300/Deluxe in the USA not counting those produced for the Canadian market). The Super Sport (SS396 sport coupe, convertible, and El Camino pickup) became series on its own. Chevrolet produced 60,499 SS 396 sport coupes, 2,286 convertibles, and 5,190 El Caminos; 1968 was the only year the El Camino body style would get its own SS396 <b>series</b> <b>designation</b> (13880). [...] Black-accented Super Sports had F70x14 red-stripe tires and a standard 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch Turbo-Jet V8 engine with the special twin-domed hood; 350 and 375-horsepower 396 engines were optional. The SS 396 sport coupe started at $2,899 - or $236 more than a comparable Malibu with its 307-cubic-inch V8. All-vinyl bucket seats and a console were optional. [...] Three luxury Concours options became available in March 1968 for the 4-door sedan, the 4-door sport sedan and consisted of special sound insulation, and a deep-padded instrument panel with simulated woodgrain accents and all-vinyl color-keyed interiors. [...] These Concours options (ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7) {{should not be confused with}} the two Concours station wagons. [...] Also new for 1968 was the elimination of the term [...] "sedan" [...] for the 2-door pillar body style. [...] This was now called a coupe (or pillar coupe) while the 2-door hardtop remained a sport coupe. [...] These coupe/sport coupe designations would continue into 1969 as well.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the years}} 2000 and 2001 the Speed Triple changed little other than cosmetically. The {{engine control unit}} was updated to the Sagem MC2000. Both the Speed Triple and the Daytona came to be {{referred}} to as 955i bikes (the Daytona adopting the 955i designation in 1999), which ended some confusion from the earlier T500 <b>series</b> <b>designations.</b> Other notable differences were silver wheels instead of black wheels, and the Speed Triple logo on the rear quarter panel was in print rather than cursive.|$|R

50|$|Starting in the 1930s, filters {{were also}} {{made in a}} sizing system known as a series mount. The filters {{themselves}} were round pieces of glass (or occasionally other materials) with no threads. Very early filters had no rims around the glass, but the more common later production filters had the glass mounted in metal rims. To mount the filters on a camera, the filter was placed between two rings; the mount ring either screwed into the lens threads or was slipped over the lens barrel and the retaining ring screws into the mounting ring to hold the filter in place. The <b>series</b> <b>designations</b> are generally written as Roman numerals, I to IX, though {{there are a few}} sizes not written that way, such as Series 4.5 and Series 5.5. Most Series filter sizes are now obsolete, production having ceased by the late 1970s.
