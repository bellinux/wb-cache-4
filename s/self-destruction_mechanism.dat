If they heard the bomb start to tick they would have to run for cover. The operation to neutralise the first three mines was successfully completed and Ryan formed two teams, each manned by an officer and a petty officer, to deal with the remainder.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{argue that}} studies {{based on the}} Israeli-made M-85, a {{different}} type of cluster munition, have indicated that items of unexploded ordnance, {{whether or not they are}} armed, remain a serious hazard to civilian populations. [...] However, this type of hazard does not apply to the MAT-120, as if in the rare instance the <b>self-destruction</b> <b>mechanism</b> fails, in approximately 15 minutes after impact the electrical charge in the capacitor bleeds out, therefore rendering the submunition's electronic fuse system inoperative, making the dud submunition totally inert, unless the capacitor is deliberately recharged from an outside source. Amended Protocol II relates to mines, booby traps and other devices and is not relevant to the legal status of cluster munitions. Instalaza may not sell any patents related to the bomb. Subsequently, the company managed to reorient its production and market new technology. As a result, Instalaza SA continues to produce military equipment for several countries around the world.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the Spanish firm Esperanza y Cia, which later {{became part of}} Instalaza SA, {{developed}} a 120mm caliber mortar bomb which contained 21 dual anti-armor/fragmentation submunitions, each of which weighs 275 grams and is 37 millimeters in diameter. What made the 120mm MAT-120s submunition unique is the electrical impact fusing system which {{for all practical purposes}} totally eliminated the risk of unexploded duds from subsequently detonating. In addition there is no electrical energy stored in the MAT-120 round during storage, transport and even at the time it is fired from the mortar tube, thus greatly reducing any risk of premature detonation. The MAT-120 submunition's electronic impact fuse operates on a capacitor power source located in each submunition which is charged in flight after being fired by a wind generator located in the nose of the projectile. If for what ever reason the electrical fuse fails to function on impact, approximately 35 seconds later a self-destruction feature causes the submunition to detonate; if the <b>self-destruction</b> <b>mechanism</b> fails, in approximately 15 minutes after impact the electrical charge in the capacitor bleeds out, therefore rendering the submunition's electronic fuse system inoperative, rendering the dud submunition inert, unless the capacitor is deliberately recharged from an outside source.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{microorganisms}} {{in the open}} environment would be of less concern if they were endowed with programmed <b>self-destruction</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Here, we propose a new genetic design to increase the effectiveness of cell suicide systems. It ensures very tight control of the derepression of cell death by {{the combination of the}} bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase-lysozyme system and an inducible synthesis of antisense RNA and the Escherichia coli LacI repressor. Functionality of this regulatory concept was tested by applying it to containment of Gram-negative bacteria, based on the conditional expression of the lethal Streptomyces avidinii streptavidin gene. Toxicity of streptavidin is derived from its exceptionally high binding affinity for an essential prosthetic group, d-biotin. The entire construct was designed to allow the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida to survive only in the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives which it can degrade. Under favorable growth conditions, clones escaping killing appeared at frequencies of only 10 − 7 – 10 − 8 per cell per generation. The general requirement for biotin through the living world should make streptavidin-based conditional lethal designs applicable to a broad range of containment strategies...|$|R
40|$|Transplantation {{tolerance}} can {{be induced}} by {{a range of}} agents that block T cell/antigen-presenting cell (APC) interactions known to be important for initiation of the adaptive immune response. Tolerance so induced {{has been shown to}} have a regulatory phenotype dependent on CD 4 + cells. This was first observed with nonlytic anti-CD 4 antibodies, and was recently demonstrated following other therapeutic approaches. Dominant tolerance also plays a role in natural regulation of the immune response, functioning to prevent autoaggressive cells mediating <b>self-destruction.</b> The <b>mechanism</b> by which dominant tolerance is established and maintained remains unclear, and the reported characteristics of regulatory cells in different experimental models vary widely. Here we review the evidence for potential mechanisms involved and propose that there is a common pathway by which dominant tolerance is mediated...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{it has been}} well {{established}} that programmed cell death (PCD) {{is not confined to}} apoptosis (type-I PCD) but cells may use different <b>mechanisms</b> of active <b>self-destruction.</b> One such <b>mechanism</b> is autophagy also called as type-II PCD, which is characterized by different morphological and biochemical features. It {{is not surprising that the}} demise of a cell either by PCD-I or by PCD-II is a well-controlled and complex process. The functional role of autophagy is not confined to the cell death through PCD-II, but interestingly it can also lead to cell death through apoptosis by enhancing the caspase activation. Autophagy may also act as a cell survival process by acting as a stress response, delaying caspase activation, and removing damaged organelles. Therefore, the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy is quite complex and sometimes contradictory as well, but unquestionably it is decisive to the overall fate of the cell. The molecular regulators of both pathways are inter-connected, and both share some factors that are critical for their respective execution. B-cell lymphoma- 2, which was well known as an anti-apoptotic protein is now also considered as an anti-autophagic. Beyond the simplistic view of caspases in apoptosis, recent studies have uncovered unexpected functions of caspases in the regulation of autophagy, indicative of the novel frontiers lying ahead in the science of autophagy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cloud {{computing}}, {{a recent}} computing technology entirely changed the IT industry. Large {{amount of data}} {{can be stored in}} cloud storage system. Security is the prime concern for this large amount of data. Without, knowledge of authorized client, data can be viewed by other user. This data contain personal information like, account number, password and notes. All the data and their copies become self-destructed after user specified time, without any user intervention. Fine grained approach is used for authorized data accessing, which provides high secured authorization for data accessing thus it achieves data confidentiality. Self-destruction method is consociated with time to live (TTL) property to specify the life time of the keys. After user specified time (TTL) data and its keys becomes destructed or unreadable. <b>Self-destruction</b> <b>mechanism</b> helps reducing overhead during upload and download process in cloud...|$|E
40|$|Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is a {{cellular}} <b>self-destruction</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{that is essential}} {{for a variety of}} biological events, such as developmental sculpturing, tissue homeostasis, and the removal of unwanted cells. Mitochondria {{play a crucial role in}} regulating cell death. Ca 2 + has long been recognized as a participant in apoptotic pathways. Mitochondria are known to modulate and synchronize Ca 2 + signaling. Massive accumulation of Ca 2 + in the mitochondria leads to apoptosis. The Ca 2 + dynamics of ER and mitochondria appear to be modulated by the Bcl- 2 family proteins, key factors involved in apoptosis. The number and morphology of mitochondria are precisely controlled through mitochondrial fusion and fission process by numerous mitochondria-shaping proteins. Mitochondrial fission accompanies apoptotic cell death and appears to be important for progression of the apoptotic pathway. Here, we highlight and discus...|$|E
40|$|Universally {{composable}} secure computation {{was assumed}} to require trusted setups, until it was realized that parties exchanging (untrusted) tamper-proof hardware tokens allow an alter-native approach (Katz; EUROCRYPT 2007). This discovery initialized a line of research dealing with {{two different types of}} tokens. Using only a single stateful token, one can implement general statistically secure two-party computation (Döttling, Kraschewski, Müller-Quade; TCC 2011); though all security is lost if an adversarial token receiver manages to physically reset and rerun the token. Stateless tokens, which are secure by definition against any such resetting-attacks, however, do provably not suffice for arbitrary secure computations (Goyal, Ishai, Mahmoody, Sahai; CRYPTO 2010). We investigate the natural question of what is possible if an adversary can reset a token at most a bounded number of times (e. g., because each resetting attempt imposes a significant risk to trigger a <b>self-destruction</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the token). Somewhat surprisingly, our results come close to the known positive results with respect to non-resettable stateful tokens. In particular, we construct polynomially many instances of statistically secure and universally composable similarities to previous solutions, which we grasp by defining a new security property for pro-tocols that use oracle access. Additionally, we apply our techniques to zero-knowledge proofs and obtain a protocol that achieves the same properties as bounded-query zero-knowledge PCPs (Kilian, Petrank, Tardos; STOC 1997), even if a malicious prover may issue stateful PCP oracles...|$|E
40|$|Restricted until 21 Apr. 2010. Advances in {{techniques}} for gene transfer and expression have made feasible {{the treatment of}} malignancies at the genetic level by introduction of exogenous genes into tumor cells. Numerous clinical trials of cancer gene therapy have been initiated utilizing replication defective vectors only to face limited success due to low, often undetectable, level of transduction efficiency. Replication competent vectors have been developed more recently demonstrating efficient transduction as well as tissue specific expression. These studies demonstrate {{the potential benefits of}} utilizing replication competent retrovirus as efficient gene delivery vehicles but undermine the potential risks in their innate tendency to mutate potentially resulting in an uncontrolled spread of replication-competent mutant virus with adverse effects on normal cells. To understand the potential risks in persistent long-term infection of replication competent retrovirus vectors (RCR), our study focused on the genomic stability of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of murine leukemia virus (MLV) responsible for driving the expression of viral genes for replication since our vector designs to date manipulate this region to drive selective replication of vectors. After long term propagation of various RCR vectors in various tumor cell lines, we demonstrate here that there are regions of instability in the LTR but very low risk in having a mutant virus with adverse effects as the very reason for utilizing RCR vector is for efficient spread and the vectors are normally equipped with a <b>self-destruction</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E
