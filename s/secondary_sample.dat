40|$|Practical STAP {{implementations}} rely on reduced-dimension processing, using {{techniques such}} as principle components or partially adaptive filters. The dimension reduction not only decreases the computational load, it also reduces the sample support required for estimating the interference statistics. This results because the clutter covariance is implicitly assumed to possess a certain (non-parametric) structure. In this paper, we demonstrate how imposing a parametric structure on the clutter and jamming {{can lead to a}} further reduction in both computation and <b>secondary</b> <b>sample</b> support. Our approach, referred to as Space-Time AutoRegressive (STAR) filtering, is applied in two steps: First, a structured subspace orthogonal to that in which the clutter and interference reside is found; Second, a detector matched to this subspace is used {{to determine whether or not}} a target is present. Using a realistic simulated data set for circular array STAP, we demonstrate that this approach achieves significantly lower SINR loss with a computational load that is less than that required by other popular approaches.

In this paper, a novel method is proposed to accurately estimate the clutter covariance matrix based on a small number of secondary samples by exploiting the common clutter support across nearby range cells in the angle-Doppler domain. By taking advantage of the intrinsic sparsity of the clutter in the angle-Doppler domain, the recently developed sparse Bayesian learning tech-nique is employed for high-resolution clutter profile estimation. The proposed method does not require the independent and identically distributed <b>secondary</b> <b>sample</b> assumption, and the required number of secondary data samples can be significantly reduced. In addition, we propose a sparse reconstruction based approach to acquire the two-dimensional motion parameters of moving targets by exploiting their group sparsity in the velocity domain in the multi-static passive radar systems.

Segments, the NHIS <b>secondary</b> <b>sampling</b> units, permit computation of <b>secondary</b> <b>sampling</b> characteristics by percentage Black, percentage Hispanic, percentage below poverty, percentage unemployed, median education, median income, median age, and percentage residing in the United States for 5 years or less.

RESULTS: Median education of areas was inversely related to never having mammograms. Areas with a high proportion (70 %- 100 %) of Hispanic respondents also were more likely not to have mammograms. Women residing in areas with moderate or high proportions of Hispanic respondents were more likely never to have clinical breast examinations and Pap tests, as were those in areas with low income, poverty, and respondents who had resided in the United States 5 years or less.

40|$|In {{the field}} of chemometrics, an {{important}} issue in multivariate calibration is model updating. Model updating is the adaption process in which a model obtained for a given set of samples and measurement conditions (primary) is updated to predict the analyte in new samples and measurement conditions (secondary). Primary and secondary conditions can be different due to variations in the geographical situation, instrumentation, or environment. Model updating can be performed using labeled data sets containing samples with reference analyte values for both conditions. A common approach is performed by sample augmenting the larger primary labeled sample set with a small weighted <b>secondary</b> labeled <b>sample</b> set. In this situation, only one updating model is obtained to predict the analyte amount in both primary and secondary conditions. The proposed new approach is similar to this common approach, but instead of one updated model, two models are formed simultaneously.

Our target selection criteria were developed while simultaneously optimizing the size distribution of the MaNGA integral field units (IFUs), the IFU allocation strategy, and the target density to produce a survey {{defined in terms of}} maximizing S/N, spatial resolution, and sample size. Our selection strategy makes use of redshift limits that only depend on i-band absolute magnitude (M_i), or, for a small subset of our sample, M_i and color (NUV-i). Such a strategy ensures that all galaxies span the same range in angular size irrespective of luminosity and are therefore covered evenly by the adopted range of IFU sizes. We define three samples: the Primary and <b>Secondary</b> <b>samples</b> are selected to have a flat number density with respect to M_i and are targeted to have spectroscopic coverage to 1. 5 and 2. 5 effective radii (Re), respectively.
