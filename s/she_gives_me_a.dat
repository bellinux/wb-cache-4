[...] "I do not think that she will disobey me," [...] continued Sir Harry. Still Lady Elizabeth said nothing. [...] "If <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> promise, she will keep it," [...] said Sir Harry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, as I told Glenn," [...] soliloquized Carley, [...] "every time I'm almost {{won over}} a little to Arizona <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> hard jolt. I'm getting near being mushy today. Now let's see what I'll get. I suppose that's my pessimism or materialism. Funny how Glenn keeps saying its the jolts, the hard knocks, the fights that are best to {{remember}} afterward. I don't get that at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Excuse {{me for a}} moment, please,' says Miss Willella, and <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> quick kind of {{sideways}} look, {{and slides}} off the stool. She ambled out into the other room, and directly Uncle Emsley comes in in his shirt sleeves, with a pitcher of water. He turns around to get a glass on the table, and I see a forty-five in his hip pocket. 'Great post- holes!' thinks I, 'but here's a family thinks a heap of cooking receipts, protecting it with firearms. I've known outfits that wouldn't do that much by a family feud.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{very long}} glance from beneath her eyelashes. I seized her hand.|$|R
60|$|But her ear {{had caught}} the flaw. She {{recognized}} a flight that midmost broke. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> quick look.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> look--all {{our long}} slow evening firelit talks {{together}} {{seemed to be}} swimming in its smile; and withdrew.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fact is, Ravvy," [...] he explained, as to a {{customer}} whose margin is exhausted, [...] "I didn't know I had it till I came. I'll tell you, old man--there's a dandy girl in that old house next door that I'm dead gone on. I put it straight--we're engaged. The old man says 'nit' but that don't go. He keeps her pretty close. I can see Edith's window from yours here. <b>She</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> tip when she's going shopping, and I meet her. It's 4:30 to-day. Maybe I ought to have explained sooner, but I know it's all right with you--so long." ...|$|E
6000|$|He looked {{surprised}} and grieved at the question. [...] "Yes, many times, senor," [...] he said. [...] "I {{should have been}} a poor Christian had I not mentioned it. But when I speak of it <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> look and is gone, and I see no more of her all day, and when I see her she refuses even to answer me--so perverse, so foolish is she in her ignorance; for, as you can see for yourself, she has no more sense or concern about what is most important than some little painted fly that flits about all day long without any object." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth," [...] Nigel said hopefully, [...] "I believe that Immelan is losing ground. His whole scheme is too selfish. Of course, Naida won't discuss these things with me in plain words, but <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> hint now and then. Amongst her gifts, she has a marvellous sense of justice and a hatred of any form of bribery. That is where I feel {{convinced}} that she and Immelan will never come together. Immelan could never see more than the selfish side, even of a world upheaval. Naida searches everywhere for motive. She has the altruistic instinct. I wonder no longer at Matinsky. She is a born ruler herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|A roar of {{laughter}} followed this, {{out of which}} Danforth went on. [...] "By George, boys, <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> prayer-book once! I've got it yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Lady Augusta stared—my irony {{was lost}} on her. ‘She didn’t have time, so <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> chance first; because {{unfortunately}} I go to-morrow to Bigwood.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{told me you}} {{had been}} to her, [...] And {{mentioned}} me to him: [...] <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good character, [...] But said I could not swim.|$|R
6000|$|... "One o' us {{is pretty}} {{sure to get}} hurted," [...] {{explained}} the mucker in defense of his plan, [...] "an, if it's a croak it's a lot better dat it be me than youse, fer the girl wouldn't be crazy about bein' lef' alone wid me--she ain't got no use fer the likes o' me. Now youse are her kin, an' so youse stay here w'ere yeh can help her after I git her out--I don't {{want nothing to do}} wid her anyhow. <b>She</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> swift pain, and," [...] he added as though it were an after-thought, [...] "I ain't got no use fer dat ransom eider--youse can have dat, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody waits on Mistress at table," [...] he explained, [...] "but me. Sometimes <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bit or a drink {{over her}} shoulder. Very little drink--just a sip, and no more. I quite approve {{of only a}} sip myself. Oh, I know how to behave. None of your wine-merchant's fire in my head; no Bedlam {{breaking}} loose again. Make your minds easy. There are no cooler brains among you than mine." [...] At this, Fritz burst {{into one of his}} explosions of laughter. Jack appealed to Fritz's father, with unruffled gravity. [...] "Your son, I believe, sir? Ha! what a blessing it is there's plenty of room for improvement in that young man. I only throw out a remark. If I was afflicted with a son myself, I think I should prefer David." ...|$|E
60|$|This terrible {{example of}} my comrade frighted me heartily, {{and for a}} good while I made no excursions; but one night, in the {{neighbourhood}} of my governess's house, they cried 'Fire.' My governess looked out, for we were all up, and cried immediately that such a gentlewoman's house was all of a light fire atop, and so indeed it was. Here <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> job. 'Now, child,' says she, 'there is a rare opportunity, for the fire being so near that you may go to it before the street is blocked up with the crowd.' She presently gave me my cue. 'Go, child,' says she, 'to the house, and run in and tell the lady, or anybody you see, that you come to help them, and that you came from such a gentlewoman (that is, one of her acquaintance farther up the street).' She gave me the like cue to the next house, naming another name that was also an acquaintance of the gentlewoman of the house.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{look that}} I remarked at the moment; then, visibly, {{with a quick}} blankness, seemed {{to try to take}} it back. [...] "But aren't they all--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{knew well}} she had laid aside for me some dainty, as was her habit. I dismounted. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> quick, troubled glance, {{and said in}} a low voice: ...|$|R
60|$|Must. This {{will be a}} doleful {{day with}} old Bess. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> gilt nutmeg at parting; that's lost too: But, as you say, hang losses! Pr'ythee fill again.|$|R
6000|$|It {{must not}} be {{supposed}} that Dr. Sloper visited his disappointment upon the poor girl, or ever let her suspect that she had played him a trick. On the contrary, {{for fear of being}} unjust to her, he did his duty with exemplary zeal, and recognised that she was a faithful and affectionate child. Besides, he was a philosopher; he smoked a good many cigars over his disappointment, and in the fulness of time he got used to it. He satisfied himself that he had expected nothing, though, indeed, with a certain oddity of reasoning. [...] "I expect nothing," [...] he said to himself, [...] "so that if <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> surprise, it will be all clear again. If she doesn't, it will be no loss." [...] This was about the time Catherine had reached her eighteenth year, so that it will be seen her father had not been precipitate. At this time she seemed not only incapable of giving surprises; it was almost a question whether she could have received one--she was so quiet and irresponsive. People who expressed themselves roughly called her stolid. But she was irresponsive because she was shy, uncomfortably, painfully shy. This was not always understood, and she sometimes produced an impression of insensibility. In reality she was the softest creature in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{the child}} gravely continued, [...] "you are a clever man; {{and you have}} come here to help mamma. I have got that much out of grandmamma, if I have got nothing else. Don't look at me; look at your float. My papa has gone away and Syd has left me without even saying good-by, and we have given up our nice old house in Scotland and come to live here. I tell you I don't {{understand}} it. If you see your float begin to tremble, and then give a little dip down {{as if it was}} going to sink, pull your line out of the water; you will most likely find a fish at the end of it. When I ask mamma what all this means, she says there is a reason, and I am not old enough to understand it, and she looks unhappy, and <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> kiss, and it ends in that way. You've got a bite; no you haven't; it's only a nibble; fish are so sly. And grandmamma is worse still. Sometimes she tells me I'm a spoiled child; and sometimes she says well-behaved little girls don't ask questions. That's nonsense--and I think it's hard on me. You look uncomfortable. Is it my fault? I don't want to bother you; I only want to know why Syd has gone away. When I was younger I might have thought the fairies had taken her. Oh, no! that won't do any longer; I'm too old. Now tell me." ...|$|E
5000|$|He gained fame for his noted and oft quoted {{exchange}} with Glenn McGrath, after McGrath gets frustrated at {{being unable to}} dismiss Brandes. The bowler asked: [...] "Why are you so fat?" [...] to which Brandes replied: [...] "Because every time I make love to your wife <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> biscuit." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> quick look, {{and again}} I caught that dancing, tremulous light and {{something}} more in her eyes. But {{it was only}} for the moment. Then she smiled.|$|R
60|$|With {{raised eyebrows}} <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> glance mingled with that superciliousness {{which she was}} for ever bestowing upon me, and which, from the monotony of it alone, grew irksome.|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{think things}} went {{the worst way}} for me that was humanly possible. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> look of mere gratitude. [...] "Ah, thank you for that!" [...] says she.|$|R

5000|$|Pam, the Fag Lady, {{is one of}} the {{characters}} of Old Compton Street. A small, squat woman in her late fifties with closely cropped hair and [...] "barn owl" [...] glasses.

Do you like it?" [...] she cries, like a kid at Christmas.

[...] Dirty White Boy: Tales of Soho by Clayton Littlewood(2008) As a homeless person, she needed £7 every day to pay for a bed in the hostel in Pimlico which she used. To finance this and her habits of gambling and smoking, she regularly begged in the nearby district of Soho where she became familiar to the bohemian community in drinking establishments such as the French House.|$|E
30|$|I don’t like {{my older}} son’s teacher {{because she is}} not {{interested}} in my son’s language problems and his achievement in the classroom. Whenever I send a letter which includes my son’s health conditions or questions about assignment, she never replies to my letter. When I visit her classroom, <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> short answer, “Your son is getting better in the classroom.” I don’t like her indifferent manner and attitude.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> distracted hand, as {{she said}} to her husband: [...] "Have you been telling the story about that picture again?" [...] He was still holding it. [...] "Silly!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What about her?' A {{confused}} look {{came over}} Gerald. 'Well,' he added, 'I don't know. I {{can only tell}} you <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> hit over the face last time I saw her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> startled glance quite unusual with her, {{more than}} {{wonderful}} to me; and suddenly {{as though she}} had seen {{me for the first time}} she exclaimed in a tone of compunction: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's Tom--he {{frightened me}} out of my senses." [...] Dropping his wrists, <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> most disconcerting look; there was in it the {{suspicion}} of a smile. [...] "What are you doing here, Hugh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Honor Charlecote,' he {{repeated}} mistily: then, making an effort, 'Yes, good old soul, <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> vacation tour {{on condition that}} I should {{keep an eye on}} you. Go on, Rashe; what were you saying?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{me about}} it?" [...] she said. [...] "I get {{so little time}} for reading, and then I only care to read the books that help me," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{grateful}} look more eloquent than words.|$|R
5000|$|... "Impatient of sloppy musicianship, {{demanding}} emotional commitment, <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{vision of}} the art of singing that led me the rest of my life. On the few occasions when she sang, I learned what a great singing artist is." ...|$|R
