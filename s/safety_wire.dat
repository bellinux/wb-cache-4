25|$|One of Houdini's {{most popular}} {{publicity}} stunts {{was to have}} himself strapped into a regulation straitjacket and suspended by his ankles from a tall building or crane. Houdini would then make his escape {{in full view of}} the assembled crowd. In many cases, Houdini drew tens of thousands of onlookers who brought city traffic to a halt. Houdini would sometimes ensure press coverage by performing the escape from the office building of a local newspaper. In New York City, Houdini performed the suspended straitjacket escape from a crane being used to build the New York subway. After flinging his body in the air, he escaped from the straitjacket. Starting from when he was hoisted up in the air by the crane, to when the straitjacket was completely off, it took him two minutes and thirty-seven seconds. There is film footage in the Library of Congress of Houdini performing the escape. Films of his escapes are also shown at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, PA. After being battered against a building in high winds during one escape, Houdini performed the escape with a visible <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> on his ankle so that he could be pulled away from the building if necessary. The idea for the upside-down escape was given to Houdini by a young boy named Randolph Osborne Douglas (March 31, 1895â€“ December 5, 1956), when the two met at a performance at Sheffield's Empire Theatre.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>wire</b> tabs are washers {{that are}} used to secure {{fasteners}} by transferring the force of the <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> {{to the head of the}} fastener to be secured. They are installed just like any other washer, after which the sides of the tab are bent up to make contact with the sides of the head of the fastener. One side of the tab is longer than the other with a small hole at the top, through which <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> is threaded. Once the <b>Safety</b> <b>Wire</b> is properly installed, the sides of the tab transfer the force of the <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> to the fastener, as though the fastener itself had been drilled and had the <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> run though it.|$|E
50|$|A <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> twister is {{a simple}} tool that allows the user to grip the two loose ends {{of a piece of}} <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> and then, while holding the main barrel of the tool, turn the end that is not {{gripping}} the wire (which is bent to create a simple cranking mechanism) in order to twist the <b>safety</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E

50|$|Much Hallicrafters {{equipment}} {{is still in}} common use by collectors and vintage amateur radio enthusiasts, and widely available on the used market. Due to the transformerless design of many tube radios of this period, an isolation transformer should be used with any radio that has not had <b>safety</b> <b>wiring</b> modifications.|$|R
50|$|Although many systems {{purport to}} be more {{efficient}} than installing traditional <b>safety</b> <b>wire,</b> an advantageous by-product of the twisting method of installing <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> is that it leaves a highly visible and easily inspectable indication that the fasteners in question are in fact properly secured.|$|E
50|$|When {{drilling}} a fastener, {{the choice}} of where to drill {{it depends on the}} type of fastener and to what it will be wired. The alternative to drilling holes in fasteners is to use <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> tabs (see <b>Safety</b> <b>wire</b> tabs section below), or to purchase pre-drilled fasteners.|$|E

50|$|Almost all ships used {{in modern}} times are fitted with steel <b>safety</b> <b>wires</b> (sometimes erroneously called jackstays) along the yards to which sailors attach {{themselves}} using a harness. This is a relatively recent innovation - cargo-carrying and naval sailing ships were not so equipped and falling from the yard represented a real (though less than commonly imagined) risk.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{having to}} comply with the various {{limitations}} of a particular class, motorcycles must meet other criteria to be allowed to compete in CCS sanctioned events. Requirements include safety modifications (such as <b>safety</b> <b>wiring</b> of crucial fasteners), homologation, proper display of race numbers, and so on. Also counted in the Equipment category is the riders' personal gear, such as leathers, helmets, back protectors, boots, and gloves.|$|R
5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang {{off the edge of the}} roof secured by <b>safety</b> <b>wires,</b> while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> at all, such as lock washers, locknuts, jam nuts, thread-locking fluid, castellated nuts and cotter pins, all of which accomplish the same objective as <b>safety</b> <b>wire,</b> which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|E

50|$|Immediately {{preceding}} World War II, Ford {{developed an}} aircraft engine {{similar to that}} of the American Allison engines of that era. It was a 60 degree V-12 with aluminum block and head, dual overhead camshafts, and four valves per cylinder. The intention of this design was to help Ford break into the anticipated large market for fighter engines. This engine was built to typical aircraft standards: it was light, high performance, and highly reliable. Everything was <b>safety</b> <b>wired</b> or staked with close attention to detail on every part. Available information suggests this design performed well.|$|R
50|$|Safety {{cable is}} an {{alternative}} to <b>safety</b> <b>wire.</b> Safety cable {{is defined as a}} group of strands right-hand helically twisted without a core. This eliminates the need for twisting during installation, as is required with <b>safety</b> <b>wire.</b> Several companies manufacture safety cable, and it is becoming an industry standard due to easier control of critical inputs and reduced installation time. Installation and quality requirements of safety cable are governed by SAE AS4536.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of traditional <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> {{is the time}} it requires to install properly when securing fasteners, although technicians who use it often can implement it fairly quickly. It also leaves behind waste products when ends are clipped off or when it is cut off of secured fasteners {{that need to be}} removed during maintenance, resulting in sharp metal bits that can easily damage soft materials or injure skin. However, the amount of waste product is relatively small, it is non-toxic, and the hazard can be mitigated altogether if technicians properly dispose of any waste product. When clipping off ends, the ends can go flying off which makes their recovery difficult and can cause injury to anyone in the immediate vicinity, such as the technician or an assistant; however, this can also be easily mitigated by using extra care or by using <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> pliers that have a special insert that is designed to catch clipped off ends. Another disadvantage is that since the manual skill required to implement traditional <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> is easily learned, the techniques required to maximize the retentive force of <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> (e.g., in which direction the retentive force should be exerted, the direction of twist, proper angles for securing multiple fasteners, proper twists per inch, which type of wire to use, etc.) are often ignored by non-formally trained technicians (e.g., hobbyists) who use <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> for their projects.|$|E

50|$|The {{differential}} is a Salisbury 4HU {{unit with}} a hypoid spiral bevel gear. It provides final drive reduction ratios ranging from 2.88:1 to 3.54:1, {{depending upon the}} Jaguar model. The bolts that attach the differential to the subframe have small holes through their heads {{so that they can}} be <b>safety</b> <b>wired</b> to prevent them coming undone, which would otherwise be difficult to detect since they can only be accessed when the whole suspension assembly is removed from the car. A limited slip differential was standard on some models and optional on others. The first generation IRS always had the disc brakes mounted inboard, the brake units being located immediately adjacent to the differential and braking its output shafts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>wire</b> is not reusable, thus {{it can be}} cut {{apart in}} order to remove it easily when the {{fastener}} is to be opened.|$|E
5000|$|When using a {{most common}} gauge of <b>safety</b> <b>wire,</b> which is [...]032", {{guidance}} for installation {{can be found}} in several publicly available sources. identifies only 6 to 8 twists per inch. 43.13-1B has no other reference to twists per inch either by hand twisting with special tools. identifies different twists per inch as[...]020 - [...]025" [...] 8-14 twists per inch, [...]032 - [...]041 6 - 11 twists per inch, [...]051" [...] -.060" [...] 4 - 8 twists per inch The <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> should be threaded through the object fastener such that it creates tension in the opposite direction of the fastener's removal. For example, if a standard automotive bolt in the U.S. is being secured, then the <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> when installed should put tension on the bolt in a clockwise direction, since that is the direction that the bolt turns to tighten.|$|E

5000|$|Bugattis are noticeably {{focused on}} design. Engine blocks were hand scraped {{to ensure that}} the {{surfaces}} were so flat that gaskets were not required for sealing, many of the exposed surfaces of the engine compartment featured guillochÃ© (engine turned) finishes on them, and <b>safety</b> <b>wires</b> had been threaded through almost every fastener in intricately laced patterns. Rather than bolt the springs to the axles as most manufacturers did, Bugatti's axles were forged such that the spring passed though a carefully sized opening in the axle, a much more elegant solution requiring fewer parts. He famously described his arch competitor Bentley's cars as [...] "the world's fastest lorries" [...] for focusing on durability. According to Bugatti, [...] "weight was the enemy".|$|R

5000|$|The {{film was}} made in Beijing, with {{location}} shooting in the Anhui, Hebei, Jiangsu and Xinjiang provinces of China. The first phase of shooting was in the Gobi Desert where it would consistently rain. Director Ang Lee noted that [...] "I didn't take one break in eight months, not even for half a day. I was miserable -- I just didn't have the extra energy to be happy. Near the end, I could hardly breathe. I thought I was {{about to have a}} stroke." [...] The stunt work was mostly performed by the actors themselves and Ang Lee stated in an interview that computers were used [...] "only to remove the <b>safety</b> <b>wires</b> that held the actors." [...] "Most of the time you can see their faces," [...] he added, [...] "That's really them in the trees." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>wire</b> or locking-wire {{is a type}} of {{positive}} locking device that prevents fasteners from loosening or falling out due to vibration and other forces. The presence of safety wiring may also serve to indicate that the fasteners have been properly tightened.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> {{twisting}} is a standard, non-proprietary technique, {{and tools}} and materials {{can be easily}} found, cheaply purchased, and mixed with other brands while still working properly (provided of course that all components are used properly and with the proper types of complimentary components and tools, if not brands).|$|E
50|$|For certain {{applications}} where safety wiring is common, fasteners come pre-drilled {{with holes}} to accept <b>safety</b> <b>wire.</b> When wiring {{something that did}} not come with pre-drilled fasteners stock, however, the more cost-effective way (as opposed to replacing all stock fasteners with pre-drilled ones of the same type) is often to drill the stock fasteners.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} that this film uses over twice the amount of special effects shots than the first film, Rodriguez did not ask the {{producers}} for a larger budget; he said [...] "...I told the studio I don't want more money. I just want to be more creative". Rodriguez picked some visual effects companies who were eager and less established, as well as starting up his own Troublemaker Studios, and reemploying Hybride, who had worked with him on the first film. Gregor Punchatz, the film's lead animator, employed a certain technique to make the movements of the computer generated creatures resemble the stop-motion work of filmmaker Ray Harryhausen, who has a cameo in the film. The scene with the army of live skeletons was shot on a real rock formation, with the two young actors on <b>safety</b> <b>wires,</b> and the computer generated skeletons added later to over three dozen shots.|$|R
