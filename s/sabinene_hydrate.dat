40|$|Context: Mandarins are {{a complex}} taxonomic group {{including}} different species, cultivars and hybrids growing {{around the world}} being fruits greatly appreciated by the consumers. Citrus deliciosa Tenore var. Caí originates from Rio Grande do Sul State (Brazil) and the fruit is characterised by its pleasant properties, especially its aroma. Aims: To evaluate the C. deliciosa cold-pressed essential oils, classified as “green”, “yellow” and “red” according to fruit maturity, and the one produced by distillation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O). Methods: The essential oils aromatic quality was evaluated by GC-O through a panel of trained judges. The identification of the volatile compounds was performed by GC-MS and their quantification by GC-FID. Results: The chemical composition of {{the three types of}} cold-pressed essential oils was very similar. However, the distilled oil presented a higher concentration of oxygenated monoterpenes (mainly α-terpineol, 4 -terpineol and <b>sabinene</b> <b>hydrates).</b> Herbaceous and floral aromatic notes were able to describe the “green” oil, while for the distilled oil wood and unpleasant notes were perceived. Conclusions: The cold-pressed oils did not show nor chemical, or aromatic differences, by the fruit maturity. The distilled oil was characterized by aromatic nuances making the oil less appreciated (inferior quality) than the cold-pressed oil. Probably as consequence of artifacts formation during the distillation process...|$|R
50|$|A {{good example}} of a plant with many {{polymorphic}} chemotypes is Thymus vulgaris. While largely indistinguishable in appearance, specimens of T. vulgaris may be {{assigned to one of}} seven different chemotypes, depending on whether the dominant component of the essential oil is thymol, carvacrol, linalool, geraniol, <b>sabinene</b> <b>hydrate</b> (thuyanol), α-terpineol, or eucalyptol. Such chemotypes may be indicated as Thymus vulgaris ct. thymol (red thyme), or Thymus vulgaris ct. geraniol (sweet thyme), etc. Such an indication has no taxonomic standing.|$|E
40|$|Steam {{distillation}} {{of young}} leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia in 18 O-labelled water {{resulted in the}} 18 O-labelling of the principal oxygenated p-menthanes, terpinen- 4 -ol and α-terpineol. The p-methanes; terpinen- 4 -ol, γ-terpinene, α-terpinene, terpinolene and p-cymene, found in M. alternifolia oil are primarily formed from cis-sabinene hydrate {{and to a lesser}} extent from trans-sabinene hydrate and sabinene. The pattern of the p-menthanes and the enantiomeric composition of terpinen- 4 -ol found in young and old leaves, regardless of the isolation process are similar to those formed during the acid catalyzed transformations of sabinene or <b>sabinene</b> <b>hydrate.</b> The incorporation of 18 O into terpinen- 4 -ol during steam distillation in H 218 O supports the formation of terpinen- 4 -ol and the other p-menthanes from the terpinen- 4 -yl cation, generated from the hydration of sabinene and/or <b>sabinene</b> <b>hydrate.</b> This same mechanism appears to operate during leaf aging. Around 60 % of the terpinen- 4 -ol obtained from the steam distillates of young leaves is an artefact of the distillation process, although the extent to which terpinen- 4 -ol is an artefact in commercial distillations will depend upon the age mix of the leaves that are distilled. No precursors of α-terpineol were identified, however, the labelling is consistent with the formation of the α-terpinyl cation...|$|E

40|$|Thymus vulgaris, {{the common}} garden thyme, is an {{aromatic}} plant known and valued for its essential oil since antiquity. In natural populations, the terpenoid {{composition of the}} essential oil, which is dominated by monoterpenoids and their derivatives, can vary strongly among individual plants which are otherwise morphologically identical. This variation {{takes the form of}} so-called chemotypes named after the dominant monoterpene alcohols produced in the glandular trichomes {{on the surface of the}} leaves: geraniol (G), α-terpineol (A), <b>sabinene</b> <b>hydrate</b> (thujanol, U), linalool (L), carvacrol (C), thymol (T), and 1, 8 -cineole (E). A genetically distinct epistatic series of five loci, with a set order of dominance (G > A > U > L > C > T), has been previously shown to be involved in controlling the monoterpenoid production of individual plants. In this study, some pivotal genes of terpenoid biosynthesis were isolated and identified, and their role in monoterpenoid chemotype formation examined, to gain a better understanding of the control mechanisms underlying the chemical polymorphism in T. vulgaris. Several terpene synthases were isolated: a γ-terpinene synthase, two linalool synthases, two <b>sabinene</b> <b>hydrate</b> synthases, and a (E) -β-caryophyllene synthase. Two cytochrome P 450 gene sequences are thought to be involved in the reactions from γ-terpinene to thymol and carvacrol, respectively. The terpene production observed in the plants correlated with differences in the transcript levels of these terpenoid biosynthetic genes. A regeneration protocol for T. vulgaris was established based on that for lavandin (Lavandula x intermedia) which made it possible for the first time to regenerate T. vulgaris plantlets from leaf explants by inducing callus formation followed by subsequent shoot induction on media with different hormone concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} {{potential of}} marjoram and sweet basil essential oils obtained by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was tested in vitro using THP- 1 human macrophage cells. THP- 1 cells were activated by lipopolysaccharide or human ox-LDL and the cytokine secretion and gene expression of, respectively, TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and IL- 10 along with COX- 2 and NFκB gene expression was evaluated. Results indicated that both marjoram and sweet basil essential oils at {{a concentration of}} 10 μg/mL markedly suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gene expression in LPS and ox-LDL THP- 1 activation. The chemical composition of marjoram and basil extracts was evaluated and {{the activity of the}} main compounds was also tested for cytokine production and gene expression. We concluded that the anti-inflammatory activity of both oils is dedicated to their main compounds, respectively, <b>sabinene</b> <b>hydrate</b> and terpineol for marjoram and linalool and eugenol for sweet basil extracts. Furthermore, these results confirmed their application as anti-atherosclerotic agents. Main compounds presented in supercritical basil (linalool and eugenol) and marjoram (<b>sabinene</b> <b>hydrate</b> and terpineol) essential oils also presented an important anti-inflammatory activity, which allowed us to propose these compounds as responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity found in essential oils. In conclusion, SFE allowed to obtain sage and marjoram essential oils with significant anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, these supercritical essential oils have also shown an important anti-inflammatory effect in an atherosclerotic environment and presented a highly potential application in the prevention of atherosclerosisFinancial support from Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (CICYT) (Project: IPT- 300000 - 2010 - 034) Ingredientes Saludables Mediterráneos Innovadores, (INNSAMED) and Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid (ALIBIRD, project S- 505 /AGR- 0153).

Of the eight species tested, hyssop (Hyssopus offcinalis), majoram (Origanum majorana), and Thymus zygis essential oils showed strong fumigant toxicity against S. oryzae adults at 25 mg/L air concentration. Constituents of active essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detector (FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 13, 15, and 17 compounds were identified from hyssop, majoram, and Thymus zygis essential oils, respectively. Pinocamphone and isopinocamphone were isolated by open column chromatography. Among the test compounds, pinocamphone and isopinocamphone showed the strongest fumigant toxicity against S. oryzae. <b>Sabinene</b> <b>hydrate,</b> linalool, α-terpineol, and terpinen- 4 -ol exhibited 100 % fumigant toxicity against S. oryzae at 3. 9 mg/L air concentration.

40|$|Melaleuca alternifolia (Cheel) is an Australia native tree {{harvested}} for its monoterpene-rich, essential oil. Monoterpene synthases (E. C. 4. 2. 3. 20) were partially purified {{from the}} flush {{growth of the}} commercially important, high terpinen- 4 -ol chemotype of M. alternifolia. The purified fractions produced an acyclic monoterpene, linalool that is not present in the essential oil. To further characterise the monoterpene synthase, a cDNA library was constructed and 500 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced to isolate putative terpene synthases. A single clone with similarity to the TspB gene sub-family of angiosperm monoterpene and isoprene synthases was isolated but was truncated at the 5 ′ end. This single clone was used to design a probe for a cDNA library and was applied to isolate a full-length clone.
