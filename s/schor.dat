40|$|Taken together, Robert Putnam’s work on {{the decline}} of social capital (2000) and Juliet <b>Schor’s</b> {{insights}} about the rise of “the new consumerism ” (1999) suggest a shift in values in which our responsibilities as citizens have taken a backseat to our desires as consumers.

50|$|Ilya <b>Schor</b> {{was born}} in Zloczow (Galicia), in the Austrian Empire, later Poland, in 1904. He came from a deeply Hasidic family. His father Naftali Schorr was a folk-artist, {{painting}} colorfully illustrated store signs for local merchants. Ilya <b>Schor</b> first trained as an apprentice in metalcrafts and engraving before enrolling at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts in 1930 where he studied painting. In 1937, he was awarded a grant by the Polish government to study in Paris. He exhibited successfully at the Salon d’Automne in 1938. Ilya <b>Schor</b> and his artist wife Resia <b>Schor</b> immigrated to the United States in December, 1941, from Marseilles, via Lisbon, after fleeing Paris in late May 1940. Ilya <b>Schor</b> and Resia <b>Schor</b> had two daughters, born in New York City: artist and writer Mira <b>Schor</b> (b. 1950) and noted literary scholar and theorist, Naomi <b>Schor</b> (1943-2001).|$|E

40|$|In <b>Schor’s</b> (1993) book, {{she claimed}} that American’s were overworked. With hindsight, this {{turns out to}} be only half right. What has {{happened}} is an increase in the dispersion of labor supply, with more individuals working long or short hours, respectively, now than in 1980. Simultaneously, wage inequality has also increased. Recent research suggests that the widening income distribution plays an important causal role in determining labor supply patterns. Using a sensitive version of the Panel Study on Income Dynamics linked to the Current Population Survey, this claim is tested. Little support is found for the claim that either inequality in the workplace or inequality in the community increases labor supply. The results are robust to different measures of inequality, different specification of the reference group, and different panel data estimation techniques. The conclusion is that the positive correlation between work hours and inequality at the occupational level found by previous researchers is capturing variations in the underlying institutional structure of occupations. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} several {{directions to}} replace the gradient in James <b>Schor's</b> gradient algorithm to solve the dual problem. The alternative directions are: the variance and standard deviation of buffer levels, the deviation of the average buffer level from half-full, the difference between probability of starvation and blocking, {{and the difference between}} the production rate upstream and downstream of a buffer. The objective of the new algorithms is to achieve the final production rate of the dual problem faster than the gradient. The decomposition method is used to evaluate the production rates and average buffer levels. We find that the new algorithms work better in lines with no bottlenecks. The variance and standard deviation algorithms work very well in most cases. We also include an algorithm to generate realistic line parameters. This algorithm generate realistic line parameters based on realistic constraints set on them. This algorithm does not involve filtering and is fast and reliable. by Ketty Tanizar. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, Naomi Schor's Polish-born parents Ilya and Resia <b>Schor</b> were artists who had {{recently}} immigrated to the US as refugees from war-torn Europe. Ilya <b>Schor</b> was a painter, jeweler and artist of Judaica, and Resia <b>Schor</b> was a painter who later worked in silver and gold and mixed media on sculptural jewelry and Judaica. The Schors lived among a polyglot community of émigrés, among them musicians, intellectuals, and artists. Naomi Schor’s first language was French, and she went to the Lycée Français de New York where she received her Baccalauréat in 1961, the same year, sadly, that her father died. <b>Schor</b> received her B.A. in English Literature from Barnard College then received her PhD in French Literature from Yale.

5000|$|The new operation, codenamed Berezino, {{was drafted}} by colonel Mikhail Maklyarsky and {{approved}} by Stalin, NKVD chief Lavrenty Beria and Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov. NKVD officers Nahum Eitingon, Willie Fischer, Mikhail Maklyarsky, Alexander Demyanov and Yakov Serebryansky departed to Belarus {{with a group of}} ethnic German antifascists.

Scherhorn, former commander of the guards' regiment of the 286th Security Division, was taken prisoner in June 1944.

5000|$|During {{that time}} the Soviet forces were {{advancing}} across the north-eastern Ukraine and occupied Rylsk and Novhorod-Siversky. On December 21 the Ukrainian Front took the important strategic railroad connection in Kupyansk. After that a full-scale advance started between Dnieper and Oskol Rivers. On January 3, the Red Army took Kharkiv, almost as by the same scenarios when Bolsheviks occupied Kiev in February 1918. The Ukrainian forces at that time consisted of two regular troop formations, the Zaporozhian Corps and the Sich Riflemen, as well as partisan detachments. These partisans were led by unreliable atamans who occasionally sided with the Bolsheviks such as Zeleny, Anhel, and Hryhoryev. The army which had over 100,000 fell to about 25,000 due to peasants leaving the army and desertions to the Bolsheviks. Bolbochan with {{the remnants of the}} Zaporizhian Corps retreated to Poltava which was holding off for couple of more weeks. On January 6, 1919 the government of Pyatakov officially declared the creation of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic. Yet his government continued to stay in Kursk until January 24. On January 4 the Bolsheviks Army Group Ukrainian Front was reformed into the unified Ukrainian front under the command of Antonov-Ovsiyenko with his deputies Kotsiubynsky and Schadenko. On the several inquiries about the purpose of the Russian Army in Ukraine that Directory was sending to Moscow Chicherin finally responded on January 6: ...there is no army of the Russian Socialist Soviet Republic in Ukraine. At this time the military action that takes place on the territory of Ukraine is between the armies of Directory and the Ukrainian Soviet Government which is completely independent. On January 12, the troops under the command of Mykola <b>Schors</b> occupied Chernihiv while other units undercommand of Pavlo Dybenko took Lozova, Pavlohrad, Synelnykove, and established the contact with Nestor Makhno. After some long discussion between the members of the Directory and other state officials it was decided to declare a war against the Soviet Russia. The only person who was against it was the chairman of the Directory Volodymyr Vynnychenko, while Shapoval, for example, for some reason was simply requesting the prompt creation of the Soviet government. Denikin later commented that the war declaration did not change absolutely anything on frontlines and only reflected the political crisis inside the Ukrainian government with the victory of the military party of Petliura-Konovalets-Hrekov over Vynnychenko-Chekhivsky. On January 20 the Soviet Army took Poltava while the Ukrainian troops retreated further to Kremenchuk. On January 26 Dybenko took Katerynoslav. The Soviets took Left-Bank Ukraine, and then marched on to Kiev. On February 2 they forced the Directorate to move to Vinnytsia while troops of <b>Schors</b> and Bozhenko occupied Kiev three days later.|$|R
