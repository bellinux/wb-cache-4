50|$|The methyl {{group on}} a {{sulfoxide}} is sufficiently acidic {{to substitute for}} phenolic hydroxyl. The preparation of this combined α- and β-blocker <b>sulfinalol</b> begins by protection of the phenolic hydroxyl as its benzoate ester. Bromination followed by condensation with 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)butan-2-amine (not PMA) gives the aminoketone 3. Successive catalytic reduction and saponification affords aminoalcohol 4. Oxidation of the sulfide to the sulfoxide with a reaagent such as metaperiodate gives <b>sulfinalol</b> (5).|$|E
