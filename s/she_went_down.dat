5|$|Dallas {{was elected}} {{as part of}} a {{coalition}} between the Democratic Party organization and reforming independents who wished to challenge the Republican city government. The reforms in question focused many on shifting power from the city council to the mayor and in converting the longstanding patronage system to convert to a merit system of city employment. Her reformist tendencies clashed with some of the party organization, and <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to defeat in 1955. After a second career as a newspaper editor and investment banker, she retired in 1978 and died in 1983.|$|E
5|$|During their active service, {{the boats}} of the U-20 class {{suffered}} from unreliable engines which compounded the already poor handling {{characteristics of the}} boats. None of the class had any successes and two of their number were sunk during the war. U-23 was the first sunk when <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> on 21 February 1918 from an explosive paravane in the Straits of Otranto. U-20, the lead boat of the class, sank in July 1918 when she was torpedoed by the Italian submarine F-12 in the Tagliamento estuary. The remaining two boats were surrendered at war's end, with U-21 being ceded to Italy in 1920, and U-22 to France; both were broken up.|$|E
5|$|In early August, Lerch and U-12 set {{out from}} Pola for Venice to look for enemy ships to sink. On 6 August, the Italian {{destroyer}} Rosolino Pilo rammed U-12, probably by chance, at about 05:00 in the Lido inlet of the Venetian Lagoon. Two days later, when Italian workers were dredging to try to determine the object Rosolino Pilo had hit, they heard a heavy explosion. When divers {{went down in the}} area, they discovered the wreck of U-12 with her stern blown off. U-12s entire complement of 17 men was lost when <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> U-12 was the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk during the war.|$|E

5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
25|$|Ranked at No. 141, Mirza kicked-off her {{year with}} the ASB Classic in Auckland. She needed one more win {{to qualify for the}} tournament, but lost in three sets against Sabine Lisicki. In doubles, she partnered Renata Voráčová of Czech Republic and reached the semifinals, but lost to Katarina Srebotnik and Květa Peschke. Going into the Australian Open, Mirza lost in the first round against Belgium's former world No. 1 Justine Henin in a tight three-setter, having won the first set 7–5 <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> 3–6, 1–6 in the next two.

Her bad form continued, as she lost {{in the second round}} of the Odlum Brown Vancouver Open and qualifying rounds of both the Cincinnati Masters and the Rogers Cup. Mirza won her first round match against Michelle Larcher de Brito at the 2010 US Open, but <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> against 20th seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the second round.|$|E

25|$|Seahorse {{then moved}} to Palau and on 28 January, Cutter {{discovered}} three freighters emerging from the harbor under heavy escort. He tracked the convoy for 32 hours waiting for an opening and at 0200 on the 30th {{was finally able to}} put three torpedoes into Toku Maru (2,747 tons). One of these blew the stern off, and <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> directly, taking over 450 troops with her. Harassed by the escorts and accompanying aircraft, Cutter nonetheless kept Seahorse in trail of the remaining Japanese for another 48 hours and attempted another attack just after midnight on 1 February. Eight torpedoes missed. Under heavy pressure from an escort, he shot two last torpedoes from his stern tubes just before going deep. Amid the ensuing depth charge attack, Cutter's men heard both torpedoes hit and the now-familiar sound of exploding gasoline drums. Indeed, it was later confirmed that they had sunk the Japanese steamer Toei Maru (4,004 tons). After this 80-hour chase - nearly a record, Seahorse returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 February with another five ships and 13,716 tons to her credit. The patrol earned Cutter a second Navy Cross.|$|E
25|$|The women's draw {{saw some}} of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history, in which the top four seeds (Ana Ivanovic, Jelena Janković, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova) all failed to reach the quarter-finals. Maria Sharapova {{suffered}} her earliest exit at Wimbledon and her earliest exit at a Grand Slam since the 2003 US Open when <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to Alla Kudryavtseva in the second round, whilst recent French Open champion and newly crowned World No. 1 Ana Ivanovic was stunned in the third round by Chinese wildcard entrant and World No. 133 Zheng Jie. This was the earliest exit by a top seed at Wimbledon since Martina Hingis lost in the first round in 2001, and Zheng Jie also became the lowest-ranked player ever to defeat a top seed at the tournament. Janković and Kuznetsova had their tournaments ended in the fourth round by Tamarine Tanasugarn and Agnieszka Radwańska, respectively. This was the first time since seedings began at Wimbledon in 1927 (and {{the first time in the}} Open Era) in which none of the top four seeds advanced past the fourth round at Wimbledon. For Zheng Jie's part, she became the second Chinese player (after Li Na in 2006) to reach the final eight at Wimbledon, and the first wildcard entry in the tournament's history to reach the semi-finals (a feat later achieved by Sabine Lisicki in 2011, where she also beat the reigning French Open champion), where she was defeated by eventual runner-up Serena Williams, whilst Tanasugarn reached her first Grand Slam quarter-final by virtue of her victory against Janković, losing to the eventual champion Venus Williams.|$|E

500|$|On the 7thJune, 1917, while {{disguised}} as a British merchant vessel with a dummy gun mounted aft, H.M.S. [...] "Pargust" [...] was torpedoed at very close range. Her boiler-room, engine-room, and No. 5 hold were immediately flooded, and the starboard lifeboat was blown to pieces. The weather was misty at the time, fresh breeze and a choppy sea. The [...] "Panic Party", {{under the command of}} Lieutenant F. R. Hereford, D.S.C., R.N.R., abandoned ship, and as the last boat was shoving off, the periscope of the submarine was observed close before the port beam about 400 yards distant. The enemy then submerged, and periscope reappeared directly astern, passing to the starboard quarter, and then round to the port beam, when it turned again towards the ship, breaking surface about 50 yards away. The lifeboat, acting as a lure, commenced to pull round the stern; submarine followed closely and Lieutenant Hereford, with complete disregard of the danger incurred from the fire of either ship or submarine (who had trained a maxim on the lifeboat), continued to decoy her to within 50 yards of the ship. The [...] "Pargust" [...] then opened fire with all guns, and the submarine, with oil squirting from her side and the crew pouring out of the conning tower, steamed slowly across the bows with a heavy list. The enemy crew held up their hands in token of surrender, whereupon fire immediately ceased. The submarine then began to move away at a gradually increasing speed, apparently endeavouring to escape in the mist. Fire was reopened until she sank, one man clinging to the bow as <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> The boats, after a severe pull to the windward, succeeded in saving one officer and one man. American Destroyers and a British sloop arrived shortly afterwards, and the [...] "Pargust" [...] was towed back to port. As on the previous occasions, officers and men displayed the utmost courage and confidence in their captain, and the action serves as an example of what perfect discipline, when coupled with such confidence, can achieve.|$|E
