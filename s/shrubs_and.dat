5|$|Cicadas {{sometimes}} {{cause damage}} to amenity <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> trees, {{mainly in the}} form of scarring left on tree branches where the females laid their eggs. Branches of young trees may die as a result.|$|E
5|$|Northern {{specimens}} can {{be quite}} small <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> {{may be hard to}} distinguish from B.micrantha, which has smaller inflorescences and large flattened follicles.|$|E
50|$|At lower elevations, this {{ecoregion}} grades into Himalayan subtropical pine forests. At higher elevations, it grades into Western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests {{as well as}} Northwestern Himalayan alpine <b>shrub</b> <b>and</b> {{meadows and}} Western Himalayan alpine <b>shrub</b> <b>and</b> meadows.|$|R
50|$|The Eastern Himalayan alpine <b>shrub</b> <b>and</b> meadows lie {{east of the}} Kali Gandaki gorge, {{while the}} Northwestern Himalayan alpine <b>shrub</b> <b>and</b> meadows lies west of the Sutlej. Below 3000 m lie the Western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests. Permanent ice and snow lies above 5000 m. To the north, the Western Himalayan alpine <b>shrub</b> <b>and</b> meadows {{transition}} to the drier Central Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe of central Tibet. The Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe lies to the southwest.|$|R

5|$|About 10 to 20 {{white-tailed deer}} {{per square mile}} (2.6 to 5.2 deer per square kilometer) live along {{the river and the}} parkway, more than the {{ecosystem}} can carry. They eat low-lying plants, <b>shrubs,</b> <b>and</b> tree saplings, reducing the food supply for smaller animals. The deer also collide with cars—in Hastings, about 1.6 times per month.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ravenelii is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms mutualistic associations with <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> trees. Mushrooms grow {{on the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests. Although the specific tree associations preferred by A.ravenelii are unknown, in general, Amanita from section Lepidella tend to associate with diploxylon pine (that is, pines in subgenus Pinus), oak, and hickory.|$|E
5|$|At higher {{elevations}} above the lake (especially in rocky or exposed locations), the pine and fir tree forests are thinner, {{and the trees}} grow in a more stunted fashion; instead, <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> bushes, such as green manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), dwarf mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos neuadensis), and tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) find areas and niches to grow.|$|E

5|$|Creek {{restoration}} projects {{since the}} 1990s {{have reduced the}} amount of Himalayan blackberry, an invasive species {{that had come to}} dominate much of the landscape near the creek. New plantings include native <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> trees such as red-osier dogwood, elderberry, Indian plum, and willow. City parks adjacent to Johnson Creek have areas devoted to marsh with shrubs, cattails, and smartweed, forested wetland, riparian woodland, open meadow, and orchard trees.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the line}} lay unused and in disrepair, but the riveted-steel {{elevated}} structure was structurally sound. Around this time, the structure became known {{to a few}} urban explorers and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses, <b>shrubs,</b> <b>and</b> rugged trees such as sumac that had sprung up in the gravel along the abandoned railway. It was slated for demolition under the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.|$|E
5|$|Okapis are herbivores, {{feeding on}} tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. They prefer {{to feed in}} treefall gaps. Staple foods {{comprise}} <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, dicotyledonous species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae and Violaceae.|$|E

5|$|The English Garden is a {{rectangular}} garden featuring brick paths, a pergola that features cypress {{trees at the}} head of the garden, and a number of statues and garden ornaments. The garden has hundreds of native trees, <b>shrubs,</b> <b>and</b> perennials, most notably azaleas. It also features a wall garden, which was built in 1922. The centerpiece of the garden is a large wisteria arbor.|$|E
5|$|The Ficus genus is {{composed}} of 800 species of vines, <b>shrubs,</b> <b>and</b> trees, including the cultivated fig, defined by their syconiums, the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside. Each fig species has its own fig wasp which (in most cases) pollinates the fig, so a tight mutual dependence has evolved and persisted throughout the genus.|$|E
5|$|The {{avifauna}} {{consists of}} various types of laughing thrushes, which live in <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> on the forest floor. The blue whistling-thrush, redstarts, and forktails are found near waterfalls and hill-streams. The mixed hunting species present in the region include warblers, tit-babblers, treecreepers, white-eyes, wrens, and rose finches. Raptors such as black eagle, black-winged kite and kestrels; and pheasants such as monals and blood pheasant are also found.|$|E

5|$|The marls was colonized by pioneer species, then <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> trees, {{corresponding}} to a primary succession. Without human intervention, a climax community would be reached. This dynamic may {{eventually lead to}} the disappearance of related open environments, particularly heritage species. However woodlands can also {{play an important role}} in creating habitat for many species. The management plan is therefore to maintain patch dynamics.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the house there is a further terrace, {{surrounded}} by balustrades with views towards the Pynsent Column. There are flagstone walkways leading to panels of lawn, interspaced with topiary spheres. The walkway leads to an area of ornamental <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> a woodland garden.|$|E
5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Carolina wrens {{adapt to}} various {{habitats}}. Natural habitats include {{various types of}} woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands, ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth. The preferred habitats are riparian forests, brushy edges, swamps, overgrown farmlands, and suburban yards with abundant thick <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> trees, and parks. It has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man-made areas. Subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos.|$|E

5|$|Green rosellas {{generally}} forage in {{the canopy}} or understory of forested areas, or in hedges, <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> trees in more open areas. They {{come to the}} ground to eat fallen fruit or spilt grain in orchards or farmland. They keep quiet while on the ground, and are quite noisy when in trees. Green rosellas forage in pairs or small groups of under 20 individuals, though larger groups of 50 to 70 have been observed at stands of blackberries or thistles in fields. When feeding, they generally hold food items in their left feet and extract edible parts or break and discard nut shells with their beaks.|$|E
