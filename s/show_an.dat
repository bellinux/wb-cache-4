5|$|According to Tarkovsky, the {{original}} idea for a film {{about the life of}} Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was motivated by the idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. He wanted to <b>show</b> <b>an</b> artist's maturing and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E
5|$|According to the English {{officers}} of arms John Martin Robinson and Thomas Woodcock, crests {{have played a}} relatively insignificant role in Scottish heraldry when compared to English heraldry. In consequence many Scottish armigers, including clan chiefs, have comparatively similar crests to one another. Because of this, crest badges can sometimes <b>show</b> <b>an</b> obvious association with another clan. For example, clans associated with the Chattan Confederation share very similar crest badges bearing wild cats. Clans associated with Clan MacTavish Clan Campbell of Breadalbane, Clan MacIver and Clan Campbell use a crest badges which contain similar crests and mottoes that allude {{to that of the}} chief of Clan MacTavish.|$|E
5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further coagulation, {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. benefit is important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, and three months is generally the standard length of treatment. In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility. Those who finish VKA treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated D-dimer level <b>show</b> <b>an</b> increased risk of recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision-making.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies <b>show</b> <b>an</b> {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E

Although much of the episode was set in Birmingham, it was filmed entirely in London.

The company's {{double decker}} buses are unique in Scotland in still displaying the destination at both the front and rear. In early mornings and late evenings, some services are curtailed to the city centre or to early termini, in the transition to the night bus service.

Certain routes have all day short working termini, and minor diversions which are often indicated through the use of internal or external 'tram boards'.
