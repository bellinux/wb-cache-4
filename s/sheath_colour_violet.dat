5000|$|For most adult butterflies, {{including}} the small tortoiseshell butterfly, nectar {{is one of}} the main sources of nutrients. In order to obtain the nectar, the butterfly must be able to recognize distinct floral aromas and colours.

[...] Tortoiseshell butterflies in particular tend to prefer colours at both ends of the visible light spectrum for humans, 400 nm and 600 nm. [...] These correspond to the <b>colours</b> <b>violet</b> and red respectively. This ability comes from their compound eye. The flowers depend on the butterflies for pollination, so it is a mutually beneficial relationship.|$|R
