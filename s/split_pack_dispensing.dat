40|$|In {{the circle}} packing problem for {{triangular}} containers, one asks whether a given set of circles can be packed into a given triangle. Packing problems like this {{have been shown}} to be NP-hard. In this paper, we present a new sufficient condition for packing circles into any right or obtuse triangle using only the circles' combined area: It is possible to pack any circle instance whose combined area does not exceed the triangle's incircle. This area condition is tight, in the sense that for any larger area, there are instances which cannot be packed. A similar result for square containers has been established earlier this year, using the versatile, divide-and-conquer-based <b>Split</b> <b>Packing</b> algorithm. In this paper, we present a generalized, weighted version of this approach, allowing us to construct packings of circles into asymmetric triangles. It seems crucial to the success of these results that <b>Split</b> <b>Packing</b> does not depend on an orthogonal subdivision structure. Beside realizing all packings below the critical density bound, our algorithm can also be used as a constant-factor approximation algorithm when looking for the smallest non-acute triangle of a given side ratio in which a given set of circles can be packed.

40|$|Purpose: The {{advent of}} grocery sales through online {{channels}} necessitates that bricks-and-mortar retailers redefine their logistics networks {{if they want}} to compete online. Because the general understanding of such bricks-and-clicks logistics systems for grocery is still limited, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the internal logistics networks used to serve customers across channels by means of an exploratory study with retailers from different contexts. Design/methodology/approach: A total of twelve case companies from six European countries participated in this exploratory study. Face-to-face interviews with managers were the primary source for data collection. The heterogeneity of our sample enabled us to build a common understanding of logistics networks in grocery retailing on multiple channels and to understand the advantages of different warehousing, picking, internal transportation and last-mile delivery systems. Findings: Bricks-and-mortar grocery retailers are leveraging their existing logistics structures to fulfill online orders. Logistics networks are mostly determined by the question of where to <b>split</b> case <b>packs</b> into customer units. In non-food logistics channel integration is mostly seen as beneficial, but in grocery retailing this depends heavily on product, market and retailer specifics. The data from our heterogeneous sample reveals six distinct types for cross-channel order fulfillment. Practical implications: Our qualitative analysis of different design options can serve as decision support for retailers developing logistics networks to serve customers across channels. Originality/value: The paper shows the internal and external factors that drive the decisionmaking for omni-channel logistics networks for previously store-based grocery retailers. Thereby it makes a step towards building a contingency and configuration theory of retail networks design. It discusses in particular the differences between grocery and non-food omni-channel retailing, lastmile delivery systems and market characteristics in the decision-making of retail networks design...|$|R

Phospholipid asymmetry was measured by phospholipase A 2 digestion (RBCs) and activation of the prothrombinase complex (RBCs, vesicles). RBC membrane exhibited a significantly greater (P 0. 01) in EAS 25 than in Adsole. The results indicate that despite comparable reduction in the rate of aminophospholipid transport and reduced GSH concentrations, RBC phospholipid asymmetry was better maintained during storage in EAS 25 than in Adsol®. The data suggest that glycerol in the hypotonic EAS helps preserve RBC lipid organization and membrane integrity during storage...|$|R

40|$|Split PH domain is {{a unique}} subtype of PH domain, which is split into two halves by other protein modules. It occurs in several {{proteins}} during evolution, including scaffold protein α-Syntrophin, phospholipase C gamma (PLC-γ), endosome transport machinary ESCRTII component Vps 36, neuronal PI(3) K enhancer GTPase PIKE (also named GGAP and AGAP), Rho kinase ROCK and unconventional myosin motor Myosin X. However, {{little is known about}} split PH domain prior to this thesis study. The central theme of this thesis work has been focusing on structural characterization of individual split PH domain and elucidation of the functional roles of split PH domain mediated regulation of protein localization and activities. Chapter 1 provides an overall introduction about the background of PH domain and PH domain mediated lipid or protein interaction. From Chapter 2 to Chapter 5, I systematically characterized four split PH domains and their potential functions. In chapter 2, I characterized the structure of split PH domain from α-Syntrophin. We reported for the first time split PH domain adopts a canonical PH domain fold. We also showed two halves of PH domain can stably exist in solution and they undergo de novo folding when encountering each other. We also reported for the first time PDZ domain inserted into split PH domain is a weak lipid binder and it works synergistically with the split PH domain in lipid binding. In chapter 3, I moved on to the split PH domain in Phospholipase C gamma. Again, this split PH domain also adopts a canonical PH domain fold. However, it does not contain the conventional lipid binding pocket and thus it does not serve as a lipid binding module. Our biochemical and structural data proved that the two halves of split PH domain form a tight and stable β barrel and it is less possible to be opened. We further showed that the split PH domain directly inhibits lipase activity. In chapter 4, I presented the structure of split PH domains from PIKE, and showed the split PH domain works together with inserted nuclear localization signal (NLS) and regulate the proteins localization. In chapter 5, structure of the Myosin-X PH 12 tandem was solved. Unlike other split PH domain, this <b>split</b> PH domain <b>packs</b> together with its inserted PH domain in a neck to neck pattern, leaving the lipid binding pockets on the same side and thus results in enhanced lipid binding avidity...|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of quality pharmacy services to rural and remote communities {{is influenced by}} the National Strategy for the Quality Use of Medicines. The implementation of National Medicines Policy is challenged by the shortage of pharmacists in rural areas. Australia compares unfavourably with both the United Kingdom and the USA in this regard. The study by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in 2002 identified that there is a severe shortage of hospital pharmacists in New South Wales and acute shortages of community pharmacists in Queensland regional areas. Although the lack of a telecommunications infrastructure has been a major impediment to the extension of telehealth into rural Australia, the challenge of delivering pharmaceutical services into rural areas may be augmented by the {{provision of}} telepharmacy applications such as remote dispensing of medications, counselling and implementing medication reviews by video conferencing. The aims of this thesis were to ascertain the opinions of relevant healthcare professionals to the concepts of telepharmacy; to identify the requirements of a telepharmacy system suitable for use in rural Australia; to develop a pilot telepharmacy system and to demonstrate the system by dispensing a limited range of products locally and then remotely via telecommunications. Thereafter, to identify an area of telepharmacy where there is a clinical need and to demonstrate the applicability of telepharmacy by means of a trial involving volunteer patients. This study initially involved interviewing healthcare workers in northern Queensland, the Tiwi Islands, and the western coast of Tasmania to assess the receptiveness, requirements and potential for telepharmacy applications in rural and remote regions in Australia. Thereafter a comprehensive literature search on telepharmacy applications was conducted with a view to identifying suitable equipment for use in rural Australia. Whilst the search revealed a number of examples of commercial telepharmacy applications in the USA and Europe, none met all of the defined criteria for an ideal rural Australian telepharmacy system. Accordingly, two pilot telepharmacy systems were developed and constructed, based upon the identified criteria. For remote controlled operations under video supervision, the criteria for a telepharmacy application were defined as: • a system capable of storing a range of individual medications to suit the intended application; • a standard commercial dispensary computer program; • an automated method of removing individual packs from the storage unit; • an image acquisition device to capture and store a picture of the <b>dispensed</b> <b>pack,</b> and • a bar code reader to record the bar code of the dispensed product. In addition, video conferencing capability was required to enable the remote pharmacist to provide counselling and medication review services to the patient. Four trials were conducted using the constructed pilot telepharmacy equipment to demonstrate the validity, accuracy and reliability of the systems in dispensing a limited range of products locally and then remotely via telecommunications. These studies adequately demonstrated the operation of the telepharmacy dispensing systems and identified the requirement for a different design of bar code reader in any further trials. These studies also identified that the inclusion of video conferencing in a single remote telepharmacy application was not the optimum solution and that a separate video conferencing unit was required. A simple system of quality assurance, incorporating a <b>dispensed</b> <b>pack</b> image acquisition and bar code verification was also demonstrated, resulting in the addition of a significant patient safety factor to mitigate dispensing errors. In order to ascertain the level of support for the concept of telepharmacy and its potential applications, four key healthcare professional groups in rural northern Australia were surveyed. Pharmacists and medical practitioners were surveyed by post and the nurse group was surveyed at the 2006 Royal College of Nursing annual conference in Cairns. The nurse/healthcare group was an online Internet survey, advertised in the Nursing Careers and Allied Health booklet published in June 2006. The major findings were that 87 per cent of all the healthcare respondents supported the use of telepharmacy to provide professional pharmaceutical services to rural and remote areas of Australia. The study did, however, identify that 70 per cent of the pharmacist group surveyed were not supportive, or neutral to, the use of remotely operated automated dispensing equipment as a telepharmacy application in rural areas, when the local pharmacy was closed. The pharmacist group were also not supportive of the use of such equipment in remote areas where there was no community pharmacy (58 per cent disagreed or were neutral). These results were further analysed and revealed that the younger pharmacist age group (less than 10 years experience), were in favour of the use of the automated dispensing equipment as a telepharmacy application, where there was no community pharmacy, compared to the older pharmacist group (P< 0. 05). Medication reviews are a key objective of the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement and are provided as a fee for service basis for face to face reviews conducted in the home. They were identified in the surveys as a clinical need which may be solved by a telepharmacy application due to the difficulty and expensive of providing medication reviews to patients in rural and remote areas. A pilot study involving volunteer patients was conducted to demonstrate the use of a telepharmacy application in conducting medication reviews. The study recruited nine patients and the medication reviews were conducted by an accredited pharmacist via a local area wireless network, equivalent to a Broadband Internet connection. The telepharmacy interviews were recorded and provided valuable information for the pharmacist preparing the medication management reports. The patients were asked to complete a customer satisfaction questionnaire on conclusion of the video conference. Six of the patients rated the overall telepharmacy experience as excellent and three rated the experience as very good.
