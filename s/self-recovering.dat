On {{the strength of the}} results of differential thermal analysis the temperature of the beginning of the interaction in polydisperse material was determined. It should be more than 960 oC. Kinetic curves of carbothermic <b>self-recovering</b> at 970 oC and 1050 oC were obtained on monodisperse model samples. During the study of high-temperature processing kinetics of Fe-C waste materials the amount of removed oxygen was determined from the volume and composition of the emitted gas phase. The method comprising simultaneous volume - dynamic and gas analyses was used. Analysis of the results showed that with increase in temperature the maximum rate of oxygen removal was achieved faster and had greater value. Analysis of the gas phase showed that at the initial stage of the process CO content was low over the whole operating temperature range. Then it increased and CO/CO 2 ratio remained constant till the experiment was over. The concentration of CO for all temperatures being studied was about 75 %, the rest was CO 2. It convincingly indicated that the process is out of equilibrium with the gas phase and shifting towards CO 2 formation. It was found that the completion of the first stage of the process is characterized by virtually zero magnetic properties of the material, i. e. by obtaining pure wustite.

40|$|Abstract—Transmitter {{redundancy}} introduced using finite {{impulse response}} (FIR) filterbank precoders offers a unifying framework for single- and multiuser transmissions. With minimal rate reduction, FIR filterbank transmitters with trailing zeros allow for perfect (in {{the absence of}} noise) equalization of FIR channels with FIR zero-forcing equalizer filterbanks, irrespective of the input color and the channel zero locations. Exploiting this simple form of redundancy, blind channel estimators, block synchronizers, and direct <b>self-recovering</b> equalizing filterbanks are derived in this paper. The resulting algorithms are computationally simple, require small data sizes, can be implemented online, and remain consistent (after appropriate modifications), even at low SNR colored noise. Simulations illustrate applications to blind equalization of downlink CDMA transmissions, multicarrier modulations through channels with deep fades, and superior performance relative to CMA and existing output diversity techniques relying on multiple antennas and fractional sampling.

40|$|A novel semi-fragile digital {{watermarking}} method {{based on the}} Slant transform (SLT) for image authentication and selfrestoration is introduced in this paper. The watermark bits are embedded into the middle frequency region of each block after applying SLT of the original image.

The tampered regions of the watermarked image can be detected and localised by extracting the embedded watermark to compare with the original watermark for authentication. Localised tampered regions are <b>self-recovered</b> by extracting the LSBs of the watermarked image. Results achieved show that the SLT algorithm is more robust, faster and accurate than other transform methods based on the DCT and Pinned Sine Transform.

40|$|For indoor {{localization}} {{based on}} wireless sensor networks, {{the transmission of}} wireless signals can be disrupted by obstacles and walls. This situation, called non-line-of-sight (NLOS), degrades localization accuracy and may lead to localization failures. This paper proposes a new NLOS identification algorithm based on distributed filtering to mitigate NLOS effects, including localization failures. Rather than processing all measurements via a single filter, the proposed algorithm distributes the measurements among several local filters. Using distributed filtering and data association techniques, abnormal measurements due to NLOS are identified, and negative effects can be prevented. To address cases of localization failures due to NLOS, the hybrid particle finite impulse response filter (HPFF) was adopted. The resulting distributed HPFF can <b>self-recover</b> by detecting failures and resetting the algorithm. Extensive simulations of indoor localization using time of arrival measurements were performed for various NLOS situations to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithm.
