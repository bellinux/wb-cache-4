5|$|To {{perform in}} vitro analysis, a protein must be {{purified}} {{away from other}} cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> can concentrate the proteins from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein's molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. Additionally, proteins can be isolated according their charge using electrofocusing.|$|E
2500|$|Isopropyl {{alcohol is}} {{miscible}} in water, ethanol, ether, and chloroform. [...] It will dissolve ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl butyral, many oils, alkaloids, gums and natural resins. Unlike ethanol or methanol, isopropyl alcohol is not miscible with salt solutions {{and can be}} separated from aqueous solutions by adding a salt such as sodium chloride. The process is colloquially called <b>salting</b> <b>out,</b> and causes concentrated isopropyl alcohol to separate into a distinct layer.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Salting</b> <b>out</b> is a {{spontaneous}} process when the right {{concentration of the}} salt is reached in solution. The hydrophobic patches on the protein surface generate highly ordered water shells. This results in a small decrease in enthalpy, ΔH, and a larger decrease in entropy, ΔS, of the ordered water molecules relative to the molecules in the bulk solution. The overall free energy change, ΔG, of the process is given by the Gibbs free energy equation: ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Salting</b> <b>out</b> is {{the most}} common method used to {{precipitate}} a protein. Addition of a neutral salt, such as ammonium sulfate, compresses the solvation layer and increases protein–protein interactions. As the salt concentration of a solution is increased, the charges {{on the surface of the}} protein interact with the salt, not the water, thereby exposing hydrophobic patches on the protein surface and causing the protein to fall out of solution (aggregate and precipitate).|$|E

The ideal salt for protein {{precipitation}} is most effective for a particular amino acid composition, inexpensive, non-buffering, and non-polluting. The most commonly used salt is ammonium sulfate. There is a low variation in <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> over temperatures 0°C to 30°C. Protein precipitates left in the salt solution can remain stable for years-protected from proteolysis and bacterial contamination by the high salt concentrations.|$|E

50|$|One demerit of <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> in {{purification}} {{of proteins}} is that, {{in addition to}} precipitating a specific protein of interest, contaminants are also precipitated as well.
