40|$|Given the all-importance of analyst {{coverage}} for IPO firms, {{we examine the}} interaction between the initiation of analyst coverage and management forecast disclosure in IPO prospectuses. We find that IPO firms that provide a prospectus forecast are more likely to receive coverage (and earlier), particularly from lower quality analysts. The depth of coverage, measured by the number of analysts issuing a recommendation on the firm, is also greater for forecasters. These results hold after controlling for potential endogeneity due to simultaneity in management decision to provide a forecast and analysts' decision to cover the firm. Further analyses show that reputation concerns matter to analyst coverage decisions — conditional on firms providing a prospectus forecast, the likelihood of receiving coverage decreases with the magnitude of the absolute management forecast error. There is evidence of quid pro quo where the analyst working for the underwriter of the IPO aligns her forecast with the management forecast more than unaffiliated analysts. Insofar as management forecasts are important to coverage decision and analyst coverage is valuable, our research has important implications for strengthening the <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>provision</b> for prospectus forecasts in litigious environments such as that in the U.

This can bring into existence work that would not otherwise exist, generating economic benefits. A content owner’s exclusive rights are subject to limitations and exceptions. Excepting the Future makes the the economic case for flexible copyright exceptions and extended <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>provisions.</b> These mediate the respective rights of the myriad participants in the copyright eco-system, where intellectual property (IP) outputs are, to an increasing extent, developed from IP inputs, where creators are also users, users are creators and copyright material cannot be distributed digitally without copies being made. A companion report, Exceptional Industries, reveals the economic contribution to Australia and other countries made by industries relying on such limitations and exceptions to copyright. In Australia in 2010 this includes: 	Contributing 14 % of Australia’s annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or $ 182 billion;  	Employing 21 % of our paid workforce, almost 2. 4 million people;  	Paying wages and salaries of $ 116 billion.   This report was prepared for the Australian Digital Alliance by John Houghton and Nicholas Gruen, Lateral Economics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the ability of}} models on cheap talk, and of audit and liability regulations, to provide analytically-based assessment of credibility of management forecast disclosure in market and regulated settings. While credibility is linked to restrictive conditions in pure market settings, regulatory enforcement does not necessarily contribute to forecast credibility. Key findings imply that ex ante approaches, including audit and tort liability in general, as well as partly verifiable disclosures supplementing the forecast and <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>provisions</b> in particular can contribute to forecast credibility. Overall {{results suggest that the}} usefulness of managerial forecast disclosure should not be overestimated, as neither market nor regulatory mechanisms can overcome the problems related to non-verifiability. audit regulations; cheap talk; credibility; forecast disclosure; liability regulations; credibility; management forecasts; financial reporting. ...|$|R

It sets out practical guidance to help practitioners, policy-makers and academics to understand current developments in debt restructuring, and provides solutions for creditors holding distressed debt and debtor options in a distressed scenario. The Corporate Debt section includes a number of very significant changes such as the UK Supreme Court decision in Eurosail and the disapproval of the "point of no return" test for balance sheet insolvency or the endorsement of the Cheyne Finance decision on cashflow. The changes in treatment of schemes of arrangement since with the decision in Rodenstock are reflected as are the Recast European Insolvency Regulation (EIR) and the Supreme Court decision in Rubin. In the US chapter the new edition considers the limitations on bankruptcy court jurisdiction in Stern v. Marshall and, in the RadLax case, the right of secured creditors to credit bid in a sale of their collateral under a chapter 11 plan. Other significant case law includes consideration of the various <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Bankruptcy Code relating to derivative and other financial instruments and cases concerning the effect of foreign court orders in the US [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{industries}} {{relying on}} limitations and exceptions to copyright are a sizable part of Australia’s economy. Copyright can strengthen {{the incentive to}} create by affording content owners exclusive rights to exploit their work. This can bring into existence work that would not otherwise exist, generating economic benefits. A content owner’s exclusive rights are subject to limitations and exceptions. These mediate the respective rights of the myriad participants in the copyright eco-system, where increasingly intellectual property outputs are developed from intellectual property inputs, where creators are also users, users are creators and copyright material cannot be distributed digitally without copies being made. Limitations and exceptions determine questions like: 	How much may be quoted from a copyrighted work without permission? 	In what circumstances can {{someone who has a}} legitimate copyrighted work change the format in which it has been supplied, or the time and place at which they use it?  	Where intermediaries make digital copies of copyrighted works to help disseminating them to legitimate users, in what, if any, circumstances must they obtain explicit permission?

40|$|In {{response}} to Australia’s decision to adopt international financial reporting standards (IFRSs) from 2005, New Zealand has subsequently decided to follow. New Zealand reporting entities {{are required to}} adopt IFRSs from 2007 with the option of early adoption from 2005. As New Zealand {{is one of many}} jurisdictions where different rules are employed to determine income for financial reporting and tax purposes, it would seem to a casual observer that the adoption of IFRSs in New Zealand is unlikely to have any income tax implications for New Zealand companies. This is not entirely correct. There are links between financial reporting standards and the determination of taxable income under New Zealand income tax law in respect of certain matters. One such area is the application of the New Zealand thin capitalisation rules in subpart FG of the Income Tax Act 2004. The rules rely upon values taken from a taxpayer’s financial statements to determine the taxpayer’s debt percentage and consequently {{the extent to which a}} deduction for interest expense will be apportioned. Therefore the adoption of IFRSs in New Zealand potentially could affect a taxpayer’s New Zealand tax liability if the thin capitalisation rules have application. This paper seeks to examine the changes in IFRS and their impact on the New Zealand thin capitalisation provisions. In particular it will examine the changes in the IFRS Standards concerning the measurement and valuation of assets and the effect on the <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>provisions.</b> In addition, the paper will consider the implications for tax advisers and their clients in complying with the new standards and the transitional issues involved...|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the current {{situation}} of Spanish case law on ISP liability. It starts by presenting the more salient peculiarities of the Spanish transposition of the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> laid down in the E-Commerce Directive. These peculiarities relate to the knowledge requirement of the hosting <b>safe</b> <b>harbour,</b> and to the <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> for information location tools. The article then {{provides an overview of}} the cases decided so far with regard to each of the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours.</b> Very few cases have dealt with the mere conduit and the caching <b>safe</b> <b>harbours,</b> though the latter was discussed in an interesting case involving Google’s cache. Most cases relate to hosting and linking <b>safe</b> <b>harbours.</b> With regard to hosting, the article focuses particularly on the two judgments handed down by the Supreme Court that hold an open interpretation of actual knowledge, an issue where courts had so far been split. Cases involving the linking <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> have mainly dealt with websites offering P 2 P download links. Accordingly, the article explores the legal actions brought against these sites, which for the moment have been unsuccessful.

40|$|Safe harbour' is {{shorthand}} for {{a bundle of}} privileges in insolvency which are typically afforded to financial institutions. They are remotely comparable to security interests as they provide a financial institution with a considerably better position as compared to other creditors should one of its counterparties fail or become insolvent. <b>Safe</b> <b>harbours</b> have been {{and continue to be}} introduced widely in financial markets. The common rationale for such <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> is that the protection they offer against the fallout of the counterparty’s insolvency contributes to systemic stability, as the dreaded ‘domino effect’ of insolvencies is not triggered from the outset. However, <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> also come in for criticism, being accused of accelerating contagion in the financial market in times of crisis and making the market more risky. This paper submits that the more important argument for the existence of <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> is liquidity in the financial market. <b>Safe</b> <b>harbour</b> rules do away with a number of legal concepts, notably those attached to traditional security, and thereby allow for the exponentiation of liquidity. Normative decisions of the legislator sanction <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> as modern markets could not exist without these high levels of liquidity. To the extent that <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> accelerate contagion in terms of crisis, which in principle is a valid argument, specific regulation is well suited to correct this situation, whereas to repeal or significantly restrict the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> would be counterproductive...|$|R

40|$|Data breach {{notification}} laws require organisations {{to notify}} affected persons or regulatory authorities when an unauthorised acquisition of personal data occurs. Most laws provide a <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> to this obligation if acquired data has been encrypted.
