40|$|Regular {{two-level}} fractional factorial {{designs are}} often used in industrial ex-periments as screening experiments. When some factors have levels which are hard or expensive to change, restrictions are often placed on {{the order in which}} runs can be performed, resulting in a split-plot factorial design. In these cases, the hard or expensive to change factors are applied to whole plots, whereas the easier or less expensive to change factors are applied to the subplots within the <b>split</b> <b>plot</b> <b>designs.</b> For such experimental situations the minimum aberration criterion has been used by a number of authors to find optimal regular fractional factorial <b>split</b> <b>plot</b> <b>designs.</b> In this paper, we suggest an alternative criterion called the maximal rank-minimum aberra-tion criterion for selecting optimal fractional factorial <b>split</b> <b>plot</b> <b>designs</b> and study how this alternative criterion performs in terms of the optimal designs it selects, and how it compares to the minimum aberration criterion.

40|$|In {{this study}} we propose a new method for {{designing}} computer experiments inspired by the <b>split</b> <b>plot</b> <b>designs</b> used in physical experimentation.

40|$|The sowing {{of winter}} {{pastures}} in areas used for summer grain production and their management under direct cattle grazing can cause changes in soil physical attributes, whose intensity {{depends on the}} degree of soil mobilization, grazing interval, stocking rate and weather. To study these aspects it was conducted over four years an experiment in a randomized block with <b>split</b> <b>plots</b> <b>design</b> and four replications. In the main plots were applied two forms of sowing the annual winter pasture (direct seeding and seeding + harrowing) and, in the subplots, four intervals between grazing (7, 14 and 28 days and ungrazed). Undisturbed soil cores were sampled {{at the end of each}} grazing cycle, in the 0 - 0. 05 m layer to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity and aggregate stability and in the layers of 0 - 0. 05, 0. 05 - 0. 10, 0. 10 - 0. 15 and 0. 15 - 0. 20 m depth to determine bulk density and classes of soil pores. The direct seeding of annual winter pasture increases hydraulic conductivity and reduces soil bulk density in relation to seeding + harrowing while dairy cows trampling increases soil density and reduces macroporosity in the most superficial soil layer.

40|$|Introduction Savory (Satureja hortensis L.) is {{an annual}} and {{aromatic}} plant from Labiatae family, which {{has plenty of}} essential oil and is important in medicinal, food, health and beauty industries (6). In comparison with chemical fertilizers, organic fertilizers especially manure have lots of organic material sources, {{and can be used}} as nutrients, especially Nitrogen, Phosphor and Potassium. Organic fertilizers also keeps more water in the soil (14). Water deficit {{is one of the most}} important boundaries of production in arid and semi-arid regions. Drought stress reduces water content, limits plant growth and changes some physiological and metabolic activities (31). This experiment was conducted as there is a global interest for production of medicinal plants with sustainable agriculture system, and with low input and shortage of information about Savory reaction to fertilization in drought stress condition.
