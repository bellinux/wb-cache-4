2500|$|Animal {{trainers}} and pet owners were applying {{the principles and}} practices of operant conditioning long before these ideas were named and studied, and animal training still provides one of the clearest and most convincing examples of operant control. Of the concepts and procedures described in this article, {{a few of the}} most salient are the following: (a) availability of primary reinforcement (e.g. a bag of dog yummies); (b) the use of <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> (e.g. sounding a clicker immediately after a desired response, then giving yummy); (c) contingency, assuring that reinforcement (e.g. the clicker) follows the desired behavior and not something else; (d) shaping, [...] as in gradually getting a dog to jump higher and higher; (e) intermittent reinforcement, as in gradually reducing the frequency of reinforcement to induce persistent behavior without satiation; (f) chaining, where a complex behavior is gradually constructed from smaller units.|$|E
2500|$|Positive and {{negative}} reinforcement play central {{roles in the}} development and maintenance of addiction and drug dependence. An addictive drug is intrinsically rewarding; that is, it functions as a primary positive reinforcer of drug use. The brain's reward system assigns it incentive salience (i.e., it is [...] "wanted" [...] or [...] "desired"),An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug , cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993)....Negative reinforcement is a special condition associated with a strengthening of behavioral responses that terminate some ongoing (presumably aversive) stimulus. In this case we can define a negative reinforcer as a motivational stimulus that strengthens such an “escape” response. Historically, in relation to drug addiction, this phenomenon has been consistently observed in humans whereby drugs of abuse are self-administered to quench a motivational need in the state of withdrawal (Wikler, 1952).}} so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving. [...] In addition, stimuli associated with drug use– e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use– become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug. These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become conditioned positive reinforcers of continued use. Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of drug paraphernalia as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing relapse upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.|$|E

Skinner’s work {{had a profound}} effect on James Dinsmoor, who described the work of Skinner as the “bare bones heart” of psychology. In line with Skinner’s work, Dinsmoor’s first published study compared the discriminative and reinforcing functions of a stimulus. Reinforcing stimuli are stimuli that are provided that increase the rate of behavior. Discriminative stimuli are defined as stimuli that signal the availability of reinforcement. For example, a mother might ring a dinner bell only when dinner is available, and this leads her children to come inside the house to get the meal. The dinner bell is the reinforcing stimulus (the children will come inside of the house again when they want food), and the dinner bell is the discriminative stimulus (the children know food is available when the dinner bell rings) (see Stimulus Control). In James Dinsmoor’s first work, he compared the rate at which behavior (bar-pressing for food among rats) decreased over time in the presence of a discriminative stimulus without reinforcement, a reinforcing stimulus without the discriminative stimulus, and in the presence of no stimulus. He found that responses decreased over time at a slower rate when a discriminative stimulus was present, even without reinforcement, and concluded that discriminative stimuli act as a filter, or a kind of <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement.</b>|$|E

40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringThe use of {{multifunctional}} {{materials is}} ever increasing day by days. Multifunctional materials contain structural and non-structural functions and could improve system performances through reducing weight and {{volume of the}} system. Especially, carbon fiber reinforced composites are {{regarded as one of}} the outstanding multifunctional materials which can offer structural and electrochemical energy storage functions. Performances of carbon fiber composites are critically determined by interphase interactions between fibers and matrix. Therefore, many surface treatment methods are utilized to improve composite properties. Among the surface treatments, the whiskerization method does not degrade the carbon fiber properties via nanostructure deposition. Therefore, the tin oxide nanorods were synthesized on woven carbon fiber (WCF) surface using two step hydrothermal methods as a sort of whiskerization treatment. The SnO 2 nanomaterials are widely used as energy storage devices owing to its wide band gap and high excitation energy as a semiconductor material. Therefore, the mechanical and electrochemical performances of tin oxide nanostructured carbon fiber composites were studied.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} program {{to simulate the}} behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) members under the action of monotonic increasing loading has been developed. The nonlinear response of the RC members is mainly due to the nonlinear material characteristics including nonlinear biaxial stress-strain relations and cracking of concrete and yielding of steel reinforcement. A constitutive model of concrete under biaxial stress state is adopted in this thesis. In this model, concrete fails and critical cracks occur when the tensile strain of concrete exceeds the limiting tensile strain. The complete stress-strain relationship of concrete under compression and tension are employed in the study to investigate the post-peak behavior of reinforced concrete members. An elaborate cracking model has been implemented which allows concrete to crack {{in one or two}} directions. The tension stiffening effect of cracked concrete is also incorporated into this model by including a descending branch in the stress-strain curve of concrete under tension. Other nonlinear effects such as crushing of concrete in compression and yielding or strain hardening of steel reinforcement are also taken into account. A nonlinear finite element program was developed, in which the abovementioned nonlinear effects have all been included in modeling the reinforced concrete structures. The nonlinear equations of equilibrium are solved using an incremental-iterative technique performed under displacement control. The validity of the model including the confinement effect of <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcements</b> has been examined by analyzing three reinforced concrete beams.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{problem of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} partial primary reinforcement as a possible parameter of <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Although partial primary reinforcement is known to be important in many learning situations, there appears to be little systematic knowledge of its relationship to <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> An experiment was performed in which (1) a neutral stimulus was present on every training trial, (2) a primary reinforcer was present on only some of these trials, (3) after training was completed, a test was made for the secondary reinforcing properties of the neutral stimulus. Six independent groups of albino rats were trained in a simple runway with food as the primary reinforcer and goal box brightness as the neutral stimulus. Each group received a different number of primary reinforcements, namely, 100 %, 90 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %, out of one-hundred-twenty training trials. Half of the subjects were trained on a white goal box and half on a black goal box. When training was completed, the alleyway was converted to a T maze with black and white goal boxes. Neither goal box was visible to the subjects until after entrance. The animals were given twenty trials in the T maze, and the number of times they entered each goal box was tabulated. Analysis of the data revealed that the lower the percentage of reinforcement given during training, the greater were the number of entries into the training box during the test. Some characteristics of the function were: between 100 % and 90 % the strength of <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> did not increase, between 90 % and 80 % there was a large increase, from 80 % to 40 % there was a further increase, and from 40 % to 20 % there was some decrease. It was also revealed that some subjects in the lower percentage of reinforcement groups went either to the training box or to the novel box on every test trial. Other aspects of the data were also analyzed. From this data a number of conclusions were drawn: 1. Partial primary reinforcement is a parameter of <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Decrease in partial reinforcement results in an increase in <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> various characteristics of this relationship were discussed. It was pointed out that the obtained function might be derived from two separate functions: the relationship of <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> to the number of reinforced trials, and the relationship of <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> to the number of non-reinforced trials. 2. The fact that some subjects went to the same box on every test trial was explained in terms of the development of strong <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> in the case of subjects who went to the training box, and in terms of the development of strong generalized <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> in the case of subjects who went to the novel box. 3. It has often been reported in the experimental literature that partially reinforced subjects show greater resistance to extinction than continuously reinforced subjects. Our findings can be applied to this phenomenon. Stimuli present during partial reinforcement are apt to acquire greater secondary reinforcing properties than those present during continuous reinforcement, and, hence, the presence of the former during extinction are able to maintain a higher frequency of responding than the presence of the latter. This hypothesis was distinguished from others offered in the literature which purport to explain the greater resistance to extinction in terms of <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> 4. It was pointed out that this experiment revealed a significant variable, <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> which might develop in studies whose training set up resembles ours. 5.

40|$|Single wall carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have attracted}} considerable attention {{because of their}} remarkable mechanical properties and electrical and thermal conductivities. Use of these materials as primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>reinforcements</b> in polymers or ceramics could lead to new materials with significantly enhanced mechanical strength and electrical and thermal conductivity. Use of carbon-nanotube-reinforced materials in aerospace components will enable substantial reductions in component weight and improvements in durability and safety. Potential applications for single wall carbon nanotubes include lightweight components for vehicle structures and propulsion systems, fuel cell components (bipolar plates and electrodes) and battery electrodes, and ultra-lightweight materials for use in solar sails. A major barrier to the successful use of carbon nanotubes in these components {{is the need for}} methods to economically produce pure carbon nanotubes in large enough quantities to not only evaluate their suitability for certain applications but also produce actual components. Most carbon nanotube synthesis methods, including the HiPCO (high pressure carbon monoxide) method developed by Smalley and others, employ metal catalysts that remain trapped in the final product. These catalyst impurities can affect nanotube properties and accelerate their decomposition. The development of techniques to remove most, if not all, of these impurities is essential to their successful use in practical applications. A new method has been developed at the NASA Glenn Research Center to purify gram-scale quantities of single wall carbon nanotubes. This method, a modification of a gas phase purification technique previously reported by Smalley and others, uses a combination of high-temperature oxidations and repeated extractions with nitric and hydrochloric acid. This improved procedure significantly reduces the amount of impurities (catalyst and nonnanotube forms of carbon) within the nanotubes, increasing their stability significantly. The onset of decomposition of the purified nanotubes (determined by thermal gravimetric analysis in air) is more than 300 C higher than that of the crude nanotubes. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of nanotubes purified by this method reveals near complete removal of iron catalyst particles. Analysis of the nanotubes using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy revealed that the iron content of the nanotubes was reduced from 22. 7 wt% in the crude nanotubes to less than 0. 02 wt%. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a decrease in iron content after purification as well as an increase in oxygen content due to the formation of carboxylic acid groups {{on the surface of the}} nanotubes. Nanotubes purified by this improved method can be readily dispersed in common organic solvents, in particular N,N-dimethylformamide, using prolonged ultrasonic treatment. These dispersions can then be used to incorporate single wall carbon nanotubes into polymer films...|$|R

Watching an infant make his first smile, or move smoothly into language from babbles and coos, implied to me that our species, as all others, enter the world with considerable baggage. Nevertheless, I read my Skinner and Hull as was expected of me but turned to Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey for enlightenment. Nor was it generally beneficial to raise the issue in the well-defended bastion of pristine environmentalism that defined psychology in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s. During a class on operant conditioning, I asked whether anyone had placed a rat trained to press a bar for food into a naturalistic setting to see if it would get on its hind legs to press twigs or similar protuberances. The instructor shrugged and said that it would probably begin to burrow. The issue was irrelevant. Subsequently, I heard the esteemed ethologist, Daniel Lehrman, introduce hi...|$|R
40|$|The spontaneously {{hypertensive}} rat (SHR) {{has been}} proposed as an animal model for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The behavioural problems have been suggested to be <b>secondary</b> to altered <b>reinforcement</b> mechanisms in which nucleus accumbens dopaminergic activity plays an important role. Interaction between the noradrenergic and dopaminergic system in the nucleus accumbens has been implicated in the locomotor hyperactivity and impaired discriminative performance of SHR. The present study therefore investigated whether there was {{any change in the}} α 2 -adrenoceptor mediated inhibition of dopamine release from nucleus accumbens slices of SHR in comparison with their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. The electrically stimulated release of [3 H]dopamine (DA) from nucleus accumbens slices was decreased to a similar extent by UK 14, 304, an α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, in SHR and WKY. Basal norepinephrine (NE) levels were increased in locus coeruleus (LC) and A 2 noradrenergic nuclei, but not in the A 1 nucleus of SHR, while basal serotonin (5 -HT) levels were increased in all these pons- medulla nuclei. These results suggest that a primarily dysfunctional LC and A 2 nucleus does not have a secondary effect on dopaminergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens via α 2 -adrenoceptor mediated inhibition of DA release. Basal monoamine levels in several brain areas of SHR were significantly different from that of WKY. DA, and 5 -HT turnover were decreased in SHR versus WKY suggesting hypofunctional dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in some brain areas of SHR.
