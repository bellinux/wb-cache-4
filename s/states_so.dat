5|$|After {{a drunken}} and violent fight with Graham in 1938, Scott {{returned}} to Asheville. A group from Zelda's hospital {{had planned to}} go to Cuba, but Zelda had missed the trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The trip was a disaster even by their standards: Scott was beaten up {{when he tried to}} stop a cockfight and returned to the United <b>States</b> <b>so</b> intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized. The Fitzgeralds never saw each other again.|$|E
5|$|The USS Atherton was {{transferred}} to Japan and served {{as part of the}} Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force until 1975 when she was returned to the United States. She was given to the Philippines in 1978 and served with the Philippine Navy as recently as 2016. Interest has been expressed in returning Atherton to the United <b>States</b> <b>so</b> she can be restored to her World War II appearance and be opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{will have no}} spin when it has even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) {{it is possible to}} polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin <b>states</b> <b>so</b> that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E

5|$|American {{merchant}} shipping had been {{protected by the}} British Navy, {{and as a consequence}} of the Treaty of Paris and the disarmament of the Continental Navy, the United States no longer had any protection for its ships from pirates. The fledgling nation did not have the funds to pay annual tribute to the Barbary <b>states,</b> <b>so</b> their ships were vulnerable for capture after 1785. By 1789, the new Constitution of the United States authorized Congress to create a navy, but during George Washington's first term (1787–1793) little was done to rearm the navy. In 1793, the French Revolutionary Wars between Great Britain and France began, and a truce negotiated between Portugal and Algiers ended Portugal's blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar which had kept the Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean. Soon after, the pirates sailed into the Atlantic, and captured 11 American merchant ships and more than a hundred seamen.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{returned}} to the War Department, where {{he was promoted to}} major on 11 December 1915. In June 1916, he was assigned as head of the Bureau of Information at the office of the Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker. MacArthur has since been regarded as the Army's first press officer. Following the declaration of war on Germany on 6 April 1917, Baker and MacArthur secured an agreement from President Wilson {{for the use of the}} National Guard on the Western Front. MacArthur suggested sending first a division organized from units of different <b>states,</b> <b>so</b> as to avoid the appearance of favoritism toward any particular state. Baker approved the creation of this formation, which became the 42nd ("Rainbow") Division, and appointed Major General William A. Mann, the head of the National Guard Bureau, as its commander; MacArthur was its chief of staff, with the rank of colonel. At MacArthur's request, this commission was in the infantry rather than the engineers.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1914 Rowell and {{his classmates}} were {{commissioned}} as first lieutenants in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). At the time, Rowell's class {{had not yet}} completed its military training. The AIF's commander, Major General William Throsby Bridges, decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he allotted the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the AIF, rather than as staff officers. The cost of this decision was high; of the 134 commissioned in time to serve at the front, 42 were killed and 38 wounded. Cadets were posted to units being formed in their home <b>states,</b> <b>so</b> Rowell was posted to the 10th Infantry Battalion. When he discovered that the 3rd Light Horse Regiment was {{to be commanded by}} his cousin, Lieutenant Colonel F. M. Rowell, Sydney obtained permission to swap places with another member of his Duntroon class Lieutenant Eric Wilkes Talbot Smith. It was a fateful decision; Smith was fatally wounded on Anzac Day.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Swimming Union (ASU) did not {{recognise}} {{times that}} had been recorded in short-course pools in the United <b>States,</b> <b>so</b> Evans was forced to return for the Australian Championships {{to qualify for the}} 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane. Despite winning neither of the breaststroke events, Evans successfully earned selection and lined up at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m breaststroke and the 4×100m medley relay. In his favoured 100m event, Evans won bronze, having been led home by Adrian Moorhouse of England and Canada's Victor Davis. In the 200m event, Evans came fourth, almost four seconds behind the victorious Davis. He then combined with David Orbell, Jon Sieben and Brooks to win the medley relay in a Commonwealth Games record time. Canada reached the wall far ahead of Australia, but were disqualified for a premature changeover.|$|E

Prior to the {{recording}} sessions, Gustafsson left the band {{to return to}} the United <b>States,</b> <b>so</b> Therion continued as a trio with Hansson, Forss and Johnsson, the last of whom covered the bass. The album shows a more experimental edge to the death metal music; keyboard and clean vocals were used sparingly.|$|E

25|$|One {{argument}} for the British detachment towards the study of science in India is that England itself was gradually outpaced {{in science and technology}} by European rival Germany and a fast-growing United <b>States</b> <b>so</b> the prospects of the British Raj adopting a world class science policy towards its colonies increasingly decreased. However, Deepak Kumar notes the British turn to professional education during the 1860s and the French initiatives at raising awareness on science and technology in French colonies.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality. After the German {{occupation}} of Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Althing replaced the King with a regent {{and declared that}} the Icelandic government would take control of foreign affairs and other matters previously handled by Denmark. A month later, British armed forces invaded and occupied the country, violating Icelandic neutrality. In 1941, the occupation {{was taken over by}} the United <b>States</b> <b>so</b> that Britain could use its troops elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} these criticisms, federal {{government}} support has made abstinence the de facto focus of sex education in the United <b>States,</b> <b>so</b> that opponents frequently adopt the line that abstinence education is acceptable {{only if it is}} combined with other methods, such as instruction in the use of condoms, and easy availability thereof. Most nations of Western Europe use more comprehensive measures, and {{in sharp contrast to the}} heated discussion in the U.S., abstinence is hardly discussed as an educational measure.|$|E
25|$|After {{their return}} to Europe, Castagnoli wanted {{to return to the}} United <b>States</b> <b>so</b> he could wrestle {{full-time}} for Chikara. As a result, Marc Roudin was brought in to replace him. Castagnoli would return to team with Ares on occasion, and while the trio were billed as a 3-man team, all three members were rarely seen together. Castagnoli's growing involvement with Chikara, and later Ring of Honor, saw Roudin making up the bulk of appearances with Ares for the next few years.|$|E
25|$|Suppiluliuma then recounts how {{the land}} of Ishuwa on the upper Euphrates had seceded {{in the time of}} his grandfather. Attempts to conquer it had failed. In the time of his father, other cities had rebelled. Suppiluliuma claims to have {{defeated}} them, but the survivors had fled to the territory of Ishuwa, that must have been part of Mitanni. A clause to return fugitives is part of many treaties between sovereign states and between rulers and vassal <b>states,</b> <b>so</b> perhaps the harbouring of fugitives by Ishuwa formed the pretext for the Hittite invasion.|$|E

Brian Luckhurst (59), Colin Cowdrey (38) and Mike Denness (42) availed themselves of some batting practice in England's 204/4.
