5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. No cure {{for the common}} cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{realizes that}} September's message was literal, {{and returns to}} his home, where he is knocked out by Jones' men. He is brought to the same {{facility}} as Olivia and tied up. As they prepare to torture him, Olivia begins to use her powers to activate the lights, {{not only on the}} box but within the facility, creating electrical sparks that kill one of Jones' men. As Jones and Nina retreat, Olivia frees Peter and they give chase, though Olivia suffers from a seizure, following excessive use of her powers. They catch up to Jones and Nina as they are crossing back to the parallel universe, but the two are able to escape. Peter contacts the authorities to bring medical help for Olivia. As they are waiting, Peter admits to Olivia that he fears what he has done to her memories, and has seen his original Olivia through the Observer's mind. He leaves her, believing that <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> this Olivia would be for the best.|$|E

5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} domestic responses to the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Opposition parties, activists and religious bodies have been staunchly demanding Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's resignation, {{with the exception of}} fearful Christian authorities, who called for <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the protests (although Christian individuals have taken part). The government has made ongoing attempts at media censorship, including briefly shutting down nearly all Internet traffic.|$|E
25|$|Social distancing, another tactic, is <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{other people}} who might be infected, and can include {{avoiding}} large gatherings, spreading out a little at work, or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection is spreading in a community.

25|$|Many mass {{deworming}} {{programs also}} combine their efforts {{with a public}} health education. These health education programs often stress important preventative techniques such as: washing your hands before eating, and <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> water/areas contaminated by human feces. These programs may also stress that shoes must be worn, however, these come with their own health risks {{and may not be}} effective. Shoe wearing patterns in towns and villages across the globe are determined by cultural beliefs, and the levels of education within that society. The wearing of shoes will prevent the entry of hookworm infections from the surrounding soils into tender skin regions; such as areas between the toes.|$|E
25|$|Mick McCarthy {{resigned}} as Ireland manager in November 2002 after defeats to Russia and Switzerland in qualification for Euro 2004. The possibility of Keane {{returning to the}} squad for future qualifiers was raised, as Keane had not yet fully retired from international football, insisting that McCarthy's presence was the main incentive for <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Irish squad. McCarthy's replacement, Brian Kerr, discussed with Keane {{the possibility of a}} recall, and in April 2004 he was brought back into the Irish team to face Romania on 27 May. Keane was not reinstated as captain, however, as Kerr decided to keep the armband with Kenny Cunningham. After the team's failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, he announced his retirement from international football in order to help prolong his club career.|$|E

Queensland also got their first win of the season, rain <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the 'Gabba as Queensland recovered from a 28-run first-innings deficit against the Bushrangers to make 405 in the second innings, before Michael Kasprowicz got the best first-class bowling figures in Australia all season with eight for 44. Victoria were bowled out for 155, despite number three Lloyd Mash making 83 in his second first-class match. The weekend also saw four matches in the women's National League, the Southern Scorpions and the Victoria Spirit winning one match each, while the NSW Breakers started the season unbeaten with two wins over Western Fury.|$|E
25|$|Immediately after Dušan's death (20 December 1355), {{his wife}} Empress Helena {{was found in}} Serres. She started to exert her {{imperial}} control on the region. This surely was against the goals of Vojihna, which would later on trigger armed conflicts. How the Empress ended up in Serres and started to rule it is unknown, it exists sources saying {{she was in the}} region <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the harsh winter in the north, just when her husband died. As she was energetic and smart (although not so talented), she might have foreseen the crumbling of the Empire, and sought to rule this region. If this version is correct, Vojihna and his son-in-law Uglješa Mrnjavčević (the son of Vukašin Mrnjavčević) were obliged to work for her as they had done to Dušan, although as the future will tell; with less enthusiasm and fidelity. It is not known how much power Vojihna had in the Serres province, although he most likely had the ambitions of putting it under his control.|$|E
500|$|North of Copper Peak, {{the road}} once again roughly {{parallels}} the river, but <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the river's course.

The falls {{are connected to the}} road by four separate hiking trails. The byway continues past these landmarks before terminating at Black River Harbor. [...] The harbor is the site of a 1920s fishing village, one of only two harbors in the National Forest System. The area was also host to three taverns built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression and a pedestrian suspension bridge used by the North Country Trail to cross the mouth of the river.|$|E
