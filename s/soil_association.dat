40|$|The {{predictive}} {{nature of}} digital soil mapping {{makes it a}} labour- and cost-effective way of facilitating soil surveys. A digital elevation model was used to generate terrain attributes {{that can be used}} to infer the distribution of <b>soil</b> <b>associations</b> relative to the topography. Two study areas Gladstone and Potsane in the Free State Province of South Africa were considered. Slope, aspect, contour and plan curvature, topographic wetness index and topographic morphological unit were used to develop a model for predicting <b>soil</b> <b>associations.</b> Discriminant analysis was employed to develop the model. The model was trained on data obtained from Gladstone and validated on data from Gladstone and Potsane. Predicting soil form was unsatisfactory. Prediction done on <b>soil</b> <b>associations,</b> with <b>soils</b> grouped as deep, shallow and valley-bottom soils (criteria closely related to the suitability for in-field rainwater harvesting), achieved acceptable improvement in prediction accuracy. For Gladstone, when analysis was done using equal prior probability, accuracy percentages of 56. 9 %, 51. 5 % and 58. 3 % were found for calibration, cross-validation and areas suited to in-field rainwater harvesting, respectively. With prior probability set in accordance to sample frequency, the accuracy percentages were improved to 83. 1 %, 80. 0 % and 94. 6 %, respectively. In Potsane, the prediction accuracy percentage was low (38. 23 %) with equal prior probability but markedly improved (67. 65 %) when prior probability was similar to sample frequency. These results support the validity of the statement that the predictive nature of digital soil mapping makes it a labour- and cost-effective way of facilitating soil surveys...|$|R

Schumacher's experience led him to become a pioneer of what is now called appropriate technology: user-friendly and ecologically suitable technology applicable to the scale of the community; a concept very close to Ivan Illich's conviviality. He founded the Intermediate Technology Development Group (now Practical Action) in 1966.

40|$|In {{long-term}} experiments, it {{has been}} demonstrated that management of cropland influences the evolution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. National inventories of SOC stocks in Belgium have recently been compiled, and show an evolution of SOC stocks of arable land from 1960 to 1990 and 2000. In order to analyse the driving forces of these changes, we concentrate on the SOC evolution in the <b>soil</b> <b>associations</b> {{of three of the}} 13 Belgian agricultural regions (Dunes-Polders, Loam belt and Condroz). The small confidence limits around the mean SOC values within some <b>soil</b> <b>associations</b> (0. 4 - 12. 7 t C ha(- 1)) allow us to compare the observed values with the results of the RothC soil carbon model and hence quantify the most important driving forces. After estimating the local parameters by fitting the model to SOC values from a long-term experiment in central Belgium, the model was run from 1960 to 2000 for typical soil profiles of <b>soil</b> <b>associations</b> in the three agricultural regions. The main factors inducing changes in SOC stocks are'the increase in plough depth as a result of continued mechanisation in the 1960 s and the sustained input of organic amendments in the form of farmyard manure and slurry. In contrast to earlier publications on CO 2 emissions from agricultural soils, the model did not predict a decrease in SOC stocks for the period 1990 - 2000. A slight increase Was observed, although this increase is not significant for most <b>soil</b> <b>associations.</b> The comparison between modelled and observed SOC data at two time slices allows the uncertainty of the model results to be estimated. This uncertainty ranges from 7. 5 to 14. 4 % of the SOC stock and is in the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty around SOC modelling for the long-term experiments both in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe. The organic matter concentration in the topsoil, an indicator for soil quality, was in the range of 1. 5 to 3. 3 %. Organic matter content increased in the Dunes-Polders and decreased in the Loam belt and the Condroz from 1960 to 2000. Many soils in the Loam belt are now close to the critical level of 2 % under which the soils are vulnerable to compaction and erosion...|$|R
