5|$|The {{show has}} {{frequently}} {{been criticized for}} perpetuating negative <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> Italian Americans.

40|$|In this article, {{the issue}} of sex-role <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> {{administration}} was examined through a survey of social workers in one state. The analysis of data revealed that, in their descriptions of the good social work administrator, females held a greater preference for the male stereotype than did males. This female preference substantially explained the overall preference for the male stereotype over the female stereotype for the entire sample. The need for further examination of this female preference for the male <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> administration is discussed...|$|R
5|$|In 2010, the Australian arm of KFC {{was accused}} of racial {{insensitivity}} over a television commercial showing an outnumbered white cricket fan handing out pieces of fried chicken to appease a dancing, drumming and singing group of black West Indies supporters. The clip found its way {{around the world on}} the internet, prompting stinging criticism in the United States where fried chicken remains closely associated with long-standing racist <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> black people in the once segregated south.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{screening}} came a {{month after}} the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) aired the first episode of television sitcom Citizen Khan. Revolving around the life of a British Muslim of Pakistani descent, the show had been co-written by its star, Adil Ray, himself a British Muslim of Pakistani descent. The BBC received 200complaints regarding the content of the episode, including accusations that it perpetuated <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> British Asians, ridiculed Islam and disrespected the Qur'an; some of these criticisms would be echoed in the furore regarding Holland's documentary.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Jens Wehner {{notes that}} the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in terms of presentation of historical realities. These included the uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the Fliegerasse ("aces") and <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could {{be traced to the}} prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Further, the political and social consequences of World War II were completely ignored.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, {{others have}} argued that the {{character}} of Wanda Gruz, who participated in the persecution of those who threatened the Soviet-sponsored postwar regime, perpetuates a <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> Polish Jews as collaborators with the regime.|$|R

5|$|Though {{the general}} public of the United States was aware of oil {{production}} in Texas, the wealth that it generated in the state {{for the first three}} decades after Spindletop was largely unknown. Of the four most prominent oil businessmen in Texas at the end of World War II— Murchison, Cullen, Richardson, and Hunt— only three articles about them appeared in the New York Times during their lifetime, despite their philanthropy and influence in Washington D.C. <b>Stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> Texas in the American imagination generally revolved around cowboys and cattle.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers {{have criticized the}} book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> African Americans is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E
5|$|Appian Way later {{produced}} another biopic, Public Enemies (2009), a Michael Mann-directed mob drama starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. Following {{the final}} years of the notorious bank robber John Dillinger (Depp) as he is pursued by FBI agent Melvin Purvis during Great Depression, the film was an adaptation of Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34. A commercial success, it also received generally positive reviews, though critics found historical inaccuracies in the film. The company, along with Dark Castle Entertainment, released the 2009 psychological horror film Orphan, which told the story of a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious 9-year-old girl. The film was considered by the adoption community to promote negative <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> orphans. Although the film received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success.|$|E
50|$|Stereotype {{threat is}} being {{at risk of}} confirming, as self-characteristic, a {{negative}} <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> one's group. In the case of gender it is the implicit belief in gender stereotype that women perform worse than men in mathematics, which is proposed to lead to lower performance by women.|$|R
5000|$|The {{national}} director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that [...] "there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes Jews and finances have become" [...] than Thompson's belief that [...] "repeating an age-old <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the central figure as a [...] "princess" [...] (and in some lore called, [...] "Princess Winona") {{is in keeping with}} a European-American <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> Native American [...] "princesses." [...] However, the Sioux do not have an {{equivalent}} title for [...] "princess" [...] in any of the major dialects, and Native American cultures do not see their leaders as royalty.|$|R

25|$|The popular culture's {{image of}} ethnic celebrities often {{includes}} <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> immigrant groups.

50|$|Racial {{profiling}} is {{the act of}} suspecting or targeting {{a person}} of a certain race based on a <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> their race, rather than on individual suspicion. More commonly in the U.S, racial profiling is thought of {{in the sense of}} the law enforcement at the local, state, and federal levels and the racial discrimination of people in the Black, Muslim, Latino, Asian, and Native American communities.|$|R
5000|$|In Europe and the United States {{there is}} a {{pervasive}} <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> women in Iran and the Islamic World in general. They are perceived as helpless victims of a patriarchal system that oppresses and enslaves them. This image is reinforced through superficial observations of female dress, and outdated stories of female treatment in Islamic nations. Such distorted perspective was criticized by Ayatollah Khomeini, who argued: ...|$|R
50|$|The Igbo People—an {{umbrella}} {{term for}} {{groups such as}} Mbaise, Ika, Aniocha, Ikwerre(disputed), and Orlu—occupy South Eastern and parts of South-Southern Nigeria, living in such states as Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia, Ebonyi, Delta, and Rivers. The Igbo {{are one of the}} three major ethnic groups of Nigeria. The <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> Igbos is that they do well in business. The Igbo women dress like the Edo people, with beads.

25|$|In {{considering}} {{disparities between}} test results of different ethnic groups, {{it is crucial}} to investigate the effects of stereotype threat (a situational predicament in which a person feels at risk of confirming negative <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> the group(s) he identifies with), as well as culture and acculturation.|$|E
25|$|Like all topics {{relating}} to sexuality, gender {{is a fundamental}} part of sexual education, and ideas of gender and sex are closely related in American culture. However, {{there is evidence of}} gendered messages within American school-based sex education that may lead to the continued existence of harmful <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> gender and sexuality.|$|E
25|$|Stereotypes can be {{a source}} of {{heuristic}} attributes. In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> the relative intelligence of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.|$|R
500|$|In 2005, O'Brien {{started writing}} a book on Madonna, where she wanted to look at her life and work, as the artist was {{approaching}} the age of fifty. She believed that the general public was eager to know the real-self of Madonna, and she concentrated on finding that out. According to her, [...] "the popular negative <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> the artist is that of a publicity-hungry, manipulative ball-breaker, while for many woman she is a beacon of feminism. I have always found her work clear and autobiographical, but her personality complex and disarmingly changeable." ...|$|R
500|$|Reavis and {{director}} Richard Christian utilized {{the talk show}} format, breaking down the subject matter {{into a series of}} smaller topics. Each segment included one or more subject matter experts discussing homosexuality from a different perspective. Within each segment, Reavis presented a <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> homosexuality and then challenged the validity of that stereotype through the expert interviews. His goal, as he noted in his original proposal, was to give the viewer [...] "a feeling he is confused and that society as a whole is confused about homosexuality". Experts interviewed for the program included: ...|$|R
25|$|Biphobia is aversion toward {{bisexuality}} {{and toward}} bisexual {{people as a}} social group or as individuals. It can {{take the form of}} denial that bisexuality is a genuine sexual orientation, or of negative <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> people who are bisexual (such as the beliefs that they are promiscuous or dishonest). People of any sexual orientation can experience or perpetuate biphobia, and it is a source of social discrimination against bisexual people.|$|E
25|$|Reel Injun explores many <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> Natives in film, {{from the}} Noble savage to the Drunken Indian. It {{profiles}} such figures as Iron Eyes Cody, an Italian American who reinvented {{himself as a}} Native American on screen. The film also explores Hollywood's practice of using Italian Americans and American Jews to portray Indians in the movies and reveals how some Native American actors made jokes in their native tongue on screen when the director thought they were simply speaking gibberish.|$|E
25|$|Many Arab–Israeli peace {{projects}} actively involve {{children and}} teenagers. For example, Seeds of Peace {{was founded in}} 1993 {{with the goal of}} creating new generations of leaders in conflict regions that will no longer accept outdated and harmful <b>stereotypes</b> <b>about</b> each other. This would occur by bringing together youth from both sides of conflict regions to literally put a human face on those who were previously perceived as an enemy. The organization, which began with Israeli, Palestinian, and Egyptian teenagers, has expanded to reach Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, Tunisia, Afghanistan, Yemen, India, Pakistan, Maine, Cyprus (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus/Republic of Cyprus), and the Balkans.|$|E
40|$|In {{many rural}} {{communities}} {{there exists a}} <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> clergy education perpetuated since slavery. This project offered bi-vocational clergy opportunities to be equipped, empowered and certified for servant leadership. Data captured from 2006 through 2008 {{was taken from the}} 25 ordinands. Questions that guided this study were grouped into two sets: examination by quantitative measurements through the passing of a catechism; and by qualitative measurements from personal and telephone interviews. The results of the research revealed a discrepancy in the ordination process where prerequisites and retention studies must play a greater role for future ordinands...|$|R
50|$|Many {{organizations}} and communities {{have worked hard}} to raise awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in Canada, and are calling for a National Inquiry of the issue which has been turned down by Canada's government because government officials believe that there has been enough studies done on the issue and another would be redundant. Researcher Maryanne Pearce has found that 80% of First Nations women who have gone missing or who have been found dead in North America were not involved in sex trade, which it a huge <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> these women and girls.|$|R
5000|$|Although Japan {{remains a}} {{socially}} conservative society, with relatively pronounced gender roles, Japanese women and Japanese society {{are quite different}} from the strong stereotypes that exist in foreign media or travel guides, which paint the women in Japan as 'submissive' and devoid of any self-determination. [...] Another strong <b>stereotype</b> <b>about</b> Japan is that women always stay in the home as housewives and that they do not participate in public life: in reality most women are employed - the employment rate of women (age 15-64) is 64.6% (data from OECD 2015).|$|R
