40|$|Using a {{technique}} of image comparison {{on the one}} hand and data management on the other, we have developed a system that takes into account the singularity of moulded ceramics and allows us to approach the figurines from various points of view such as iconography, archaeological contexts, fabric and painting. The system is receptive to products of different economical regions and guarantees the objectivity of the dating process. A total of 3200 figurines have been described, measured and photographed to allow comparison of the digital images. The analysis enabled us to establish a relative chronology, to recognise iconographical evolution and to redefine the relationships between the coroplasts and the workshops. The major result of the study is the establishment of a chronological system that will make the figurines an important <b>dating</b> <b>instrument</b> for Roman provincial archaeology. Furthermore, we succeeded in defining the economic interaction between Eastern and Central Gaul...|$|R

40|$|Instrumented knee {{replacements}} {{can provide}} in vivo data quantifying physiological loads {{acting on the}} knee. To <b>date</b> <b>instrumented</b> mobile unicompartmental knee replacements (UKR) have not been realised. Ideally instrumentation would be embedded within the polyethylene bearing. and Tthis study investigated the feasibility of an embedded flexible capacitive load sensor. A novel flexible capacitive load sensor was developed which could be incorporated into standard manufacturing of compression moulded polyethylene bearings. Dynamic experiments were performed to determine {{the characteristics of the}} sensor on a uniaxial servo-hydraulic material testing machine. The instrumented bearing was measured at sinusoidal frequencies between 0. 1 and 10 Hz, allowing for measurement of typical gait load magnitudes and frequencies. These correspond to frequencies of interest in physiological loading. The loads that were applied were a static load of 390 N, corresponding to an equivalent body weight load for UKR, and a dynamic load of ± 293 N. The frequency transfer response of the sensor suggests a low pass filter response with a - 3 dB frequency of 10 Hz. The proposed embedded capacitive load sensor was shown to be applicable for measuring in vivo loads within a polyethylene mobile UKR bearing...|$|R
