40|$|Abstract. Rational {{decision}} making (for flood warning, navigation, or reservoir systems) {{requires that the}} total uncertainty about a hydrologic predictand (such as river <b>stage,</b> <b>discharge,</b> or runoff volume) be quantified {{in terms of a}} probability distribution, conditional on all available information and knowledge.

Fundamentals are presented of a Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) for producing a probabilistic forecast of a hydrologic predictand via any deterministic catchment model. The BFS decomposes the total uncertainty into input uncertainty and hydrologic uncertainty, which are quantified independently and then integrated into a predictive (Bayes) distribution. This distribution results from a revision of a prior (climatic) distribution, is well calibrated, and has a nonnegativ ex ante economic value.

40|$|Rating curves {{relating}} stream <b>discharge</b> to water-surface <b>stage</b> {{are traditionally}} established empirically through many measurements of <b>discharge</b> and concurrent <b>stage.</b> However, <b>discharge</b> measurements typically scatter {{and do not}} show a unique relation to the stage because the underlying physics are usually not reflected in the rating.

The Hydraulic Performance Graph, which provides a steady-state approximation to the hydrodynamics governing open-channel flow, provides a tool to develop theoretical ratings. Analysis of a hypothetical channel indicates that terms describing the pressure gradient, conveyance, and convective acceleration should be included to develop a rating that applies to the possible range of flow conditions.

30|$|Design, {{operation}} and management of water resource projects {{are influenced by the}} amount of discharge passing through the stream. Discharge at the gauging site is generally estimated by developing single-valued simple rating curves. However, in case of unsteady flows, hysteresis affect is introduced in the <b>stage</b> <b>discharge</b> relationship and as such single-valued rating curves are no longer valid for such situations. The present paper presents a simple spreadsheet-based optimization approach for modelling the hysteresis-affected discharge rating curves. Generalized reduced gradient (GRG) technique has been reported as a reliable tool for handling optimization problems; therefore, in the present paper, it has been applied to estimate discharge for two sites with hysteresis affect based on Jones formula. Comparison of results shows that discharge estimated by GRG technique is as efficient as genetic algorithm and the goodness-of-fit criteria shows that the rating curves obtained by using Jones formula fit the observed data better than single-valued simple rating curves for both the sites considered in the present study. Application of spreadsheet-based GRG optimization technique could prove very helpful to the hydrometric offices.|$|E

40|$|Partial Discharge (PD) is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} main reasons for aging and degradation of the oil/pressboard insulation system in power transformers. Vegetable oils which own excellent dielectric performance are introduced as potential insulation liquids substituting traditional mineral oil. In this paper, an air-gap PD model was adopted to investigate the PD characteristics of refined rapeseed oil and Karamay 25 # mineral oil that are both currently employed in liquid filled power transformers. The PD current pulse waveform analysis (PD-CPWA) method was used to investigate PD mechanisms of two different insulation systems: mineral oil/pressboard and vegetable oil/pressboard. For both insulation systems, phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns throughout the accelerated deterioration experiments were compared. The extracted ?-q-n plots with respect to various PD times were analyzed. It is found that, the air-gap PD stage characteristics of vegetable oil/pressboard are more notable. It has fewer double-peak pulses, smaller inception phase angle, lower charge amplitude, higher repetition rate, and more remarkable ‘rabbit-ear’ patterns than mineral oil/pressboard.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} lengths of stay of chronic status {{patients}} in an acute care hospital, to identify <b>discharge</b> <b>stages</b> {{that contribute to}} excessive stays, to estimate the length of stay at each <b>discharge</b> <b>stage</b> and to link hospital bed-day utilization by the <b>discharge</b> <b>stage</b> {{to the experience of}} the patient. DESIGN: Two-year prospective cohort study. The number of hospital days retrospective to the date of the current admission were included in the analysis. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: All 115 inpatients formally declared as achieving chronic status by July 31, 1987. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lengths of stay (total days and days at acute and chronic status) for chronic status patients, including those still in hospital {{at the end of the}} study period. Each bed-day was assigned to a <b>discharge</b> <b>stage</b> that corresponded to the patient's status. The disposition of each patient by the end of the study period was reviewed. RESULTS: The study population spent a total of 101 585 days in hospital. The total length of stay per patient was nearly four times that stated in the hospital's annual report, in which the figure was calculated only on the basis of discharge data. On average only 77. 2 (8. 7 %) of the days were spent in acute care. The remaining days were at the chronic level: 24. 1 % were spent waiting for completion of an application to a long-term care facility, 25. 3 % for application approval and 41. 9 % for an available bed in the assigned long-term care institution. For 30 patients no initiation of the discharge process was ever undertaken. As the number of patients in each progressive <b>discharge</b> <b>stage</b> decreased, the wait per patient increased. By the end of the study period only 32 patients had been transferred to a public long-term care facility; 22 were still in hospital, and 35 had died waiting for placement. CONCLUSIONS: Although considered to be a useful measure of hospital efficiency, length of stay determined from discharge data creates an iceberg effect when applied to chronic status patients in acute care hospitals. Lack of access to the assigned resource is the most important reason for a delay in discharge. Interventions, whether undertaken at the patient, hospital or provincial level, must to some degree address this issue. Further study is required to determine which risk factors will predict lags at each <b>discharge</b> <b>stage.</b> Since our <b>discharge</b> <b>staging</b> reflects not only the experience of the patient but also the utilization of hospital bed-days and access to provincial resources, it provides a common language for clinicians, hospital administrators and systems planners...|$|R

Another significant characteristic for flow in natural rivers is that the floodplain regions are found to behave as a storage reservoir instead of conveying excess water. Flow resistance relationships have been presented in terms of Manning’s coefficient and Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, showing the complex nature of flow resistance in flooded natural rivers and further explaining the danger inherent in the conventional practices of extrapolating inbank data for the analysis of overbank flows.

An experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to measure the boundary shear stress distribution along the wetted perimeter of the smooth and rough channel using piston tube technique the accuracy of the method has been compared and checked with another convention method,NDM, VDM,MPM,Velocity Profile Method and energy gradient approach.

The percentage of boundary shear carried by the wall and bed has been analysed and found to depends on upon non-dimensional geometry and hydraulic parameters such as Aspect ratio,Reynolds number and Froude’s number. A multi linear regression model has been applied to predict the boundary shear distribution for bed.

40|$|<b>Stage</b> – <b>discharge</b> {{relationship}} is mainly developed from measured data in any hydrometry station. Measured data usually obtain in low to medium flow discharge, because {{in most cases}} {{it is very difficult}} to measure the flow discharge during flood. Therefore, the stage–discharge is extrapolated beyond the measured data to compute the flood which may estimate low or higher value. This is because during the high flow, the bed form is developed which causes the flow resistance to change. In order to establish a better <b>stage</b> – <b>discharge</b> relation, it is important to apply methods which consider the bed form resistance. In this study an attempt has been made to determine the best method for developing such relationship.
