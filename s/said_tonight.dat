This disease, or condition, or whatever it may be called, from which Mr. Trelawny is suffering, is in some way connected with Egypt. I have had a suspicion of this from the first; and later it grew into a certainty, though without proof. What you have <b>said</b> <b>tonight</b> confirms my conjecture, and makes me believe that a proof is to be had. I do not think that you quite know all that has gone on in this house since the night of the attack--of the finding of Mr. Trelawny's body. Now I propose that we confide in you. If Mr. Ross agrees, I shall ask him to tell you. He is more skilled than I am in putting facts before other people. He can speak by his brief; and in this case he has the best of all briefs, the experience of his own eyes and ears, and the evidence that he has himself taken on the spot from participators in, or spectators of, what has happened. When you know all, you will, I hope, {{be in a position to}} judge as to whether you can best help Mr. Trelawny, and further his secret wishes, by your silence or your speech." ...|$|E

Boothby opposed free trade in food stuffs, and claimed that such a policy would invalidate the Agriculture Act 1947 and ruin British farmers. This economic liberalism of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rab Butler, led to Boothby complaining that [...] "The Tory Party have in fact become the Liberal Party" [...] and cited what {{the leader of the}} Liberal Party (Clement Davies) had said to him about Butler: [...] "Sir Robert Peel has come again." [...] In response Davies claimed that Boothby [...] "has been sitting {{on the wrong side of}} the House for many years. Undoubtedly he <b>said</b> <b>tonight</b> that he is the planner of planners. I do not believe in that kind of planning. The hon. Member seems to know better than the ordinary person what is good for the ordinary person, what he ought to buy, where he ought to buy it, where he ought to manufacture and everything else of that kind. There is the true Socialist".|$|E

This is the weird side effect of the way True Blood tells stories: one week they’re awful, but the next week they are perfectly fine. The main thing driving tonight’s improved episode is {{a few of the}} disparate storylines finally coming together, clicking into place like the outside edge of a puzzle.
