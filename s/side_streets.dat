5|$|When the {{reconstruction}} of Denmark's capital was begun a number of changes were introduced. A commission was appointed to regulate the streets. After surveyings among the ruins this commission submitted a suggestion to create 12 to 15-metre wide main streets with 10-metre wide <b>side</b> <b>streets</b> {{with none of the}} surrounding houses being half-timbered.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Athlete or Desultor, {{located near}} the forum, {{contains}} a humorous mosaic of an athlete or acrobat riding a donkey back to front while holding a cup in his outstretched hand. It may possibly represent Silenus. The most prestigious houses in the city were situated adjoining the Decumanus Maximus, behind rows of shops that lined the street under an arcade. They were entered from <b>side</b> <b>streets</b> between the shops.|$|E
5|$|The city centre, {{dating from}} the Middle Ages, lies {{on a series of}} clay banks between the former streams of Vesterå and Lilleå, which used to run into the sound. Despite {{effective}} drainage, the main streets, including Algade, still run east to west while the <b>side</b> <b>streets</b> run north to south. The Budolfi Church and the old town hall line Gammeltorv, the old market square. The main shopping streets are Algade and Bispengade, the latter lying inbetween the modern Vesterbro thoroughfare and Nytorv square. Østerågade, once the old harbor, is noted for its merchants' mansions.|$|E

It now connects to another <b>side</b> <b>street</b> known as Swan Alley, in turn {{connecting}} to Moorgate. The <b>side</b> <b>street</b> is {{the location of the}} Chartered Accountants' Hall, home of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.|$|R
50|$|In Izhevsk, since 1849 {{under the}} Jewish {{religious}} needs the prayer house was allocated (the Dornbush's house). A second synagogue was opened in 1917 on Verkhniy Uzskiy <b>side</b> <b>street</b> (at present Internatsionalnyiy <b>side</b> <b>street)</b> between Tserkovnaya Street (at present Vadim Sivkov Street) and Gospitalnaya Street (at present Krasnoarmeyskaya Street), it {{was moved to}} another location (22 Verkhniy Uzskiy <b>side</b> <b>street)</b> in 1927.

5|$|The route {{continues}} north, {{serving as}} the boundary between Searingtown and Albertson as it proceeds past <b>side</b> <b>streets</b> lined by homes. At I.U. Willets Road, CR101 serves Henry Wiscardi School and enters Searingtown. Just inside of the community, CR101 intersects Hilldale Drive and Dogwood Road, two local streets connecting to Herricks Middle School. The route continues on through Searingtown into the village of North Hills, where the homes give way to trees as it turns to the northeast and passes under the Northern State Parkway. A short distance after the Northern Parkway overpass, CR101 meets the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495) by way of Nassau Boulevard—the southern service road—and North Service Road.|$|E
5|$|In Monroe County, {{state police}} closed Interstates 80 and 380 during the {{afternoon}} of the 14th because of bad road conditions. Interstate 80 was closed between Interstates 81 and 380. The combination of a heavy snowfall then a mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain made for hazardous road conditions. The mixed precipitation made it more difficult for some road crews to keep up. At 4 PM EST on the 17th the interstates reopened after ice was removed and the road surfaces was safe for travel. In and around the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area, in Bucks County, slippery road conditions contributed to a tractor-trailer accident on the 14th on Route 309 in Richland Township. The highway was closed for more than an hour, which forced motorists to detour on slush-covered <b>side</b> <b>streets.</b>|$|E
5|$|The University Belt {{refers to}} the area {{where there is a}} high {{concentration}} or a cluster of colleges and universities in the city and it is commonly understood as the one where the San Miguel, Quiapo and Sampaloc districts meet. Generally, it includes the western end of España Boulevard, Nicanor Reyes St. (formerly Morayta St.), the eastern end of Claro M. Recto Avenue (formerly Azcarraga), Legarda Avenue, Mendiola Street, and the different <b>side</b> <b>streets.</b> Each of the colleges and universities found here are at a short walking distance of each other. Another cluster of colleges lies along the southern bank of the Pasig River, mostly at the Intramuros and Ermita districts, and still a smaller cluster is found at the southernmost part of Malate near the border with Pasay such as the private co-educational institution of De La Salle University, the largest of all De La Salle University System of schools.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{district}} is densely developed, primarily residential in its {{northern and southern}} portions, with commercial use concentrated in central blocks near Monument Square. The only significant open spaces within it are the one-block Washington Park near its southern end and Seminary Park, the main quad at Russell Sage. Most of the major streets and the central area of the district are lined with multi-story dwellings that are primarily commercial but {{with a mix of}} office and residential space on their upper floors. On the <b>side</b> <b>streets,</b> there are smaller-scale residential townhouses. Institutional use is limited to Russell Sage, a few churches, RPI's buildings and governmental structures like the county courthouse and post office. No industrial use, past or present, is within the district, with the notable exception of the Gurley Building, and even that has been scaled back in recent years.|$|E
5|$|US 46 turns {{east and}} crosses the Passaic River a {{fourth and final}} time, {{entering}} Bergen County in Elmwood Park. Immediately after the river, the route has an interchange for CR 507. Passing through more RIRO-accessed business areas, the road narrows to four lanes and has a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway. Past the parkway, US 46 continues as a road with some jughandles and other traffic light-controlled intersections (but still largely maintaining RIRO access to driveways and <b>side</b> <b>streets),</b> passing through a small corner of Garfield before crossing into Saddle Brook. Within Saddle Brook, the road turns more to the southeast and crosses over New Jersey Transit’s Bergen County Line. Continuing east, US 46 has an exit for with Outwater Lane and crosses into Lodi. Through this area, there is no access across the median of US 46, as it interchanges with Main Street. The route continues into Hasbrouck Heights, where it turns more south-southeast, interchanging with Boulevard. A short distance later, US 46 reaches an interchange with Route 17 and crosses New Jersey Transit’s Pascack Valley Line near the Teterboro station.|$|E

25|$|Land use {{varies from}} commercial, mainly street-level retailing, along heavily trafficked Thames and America's Cup Avenue to {{primarily}} residential along the <b>side</b> <b>streets</b> to the east.

25|$|The {{town centre}} {{is home to}} several high street retailers, {{including}} River Island, Wilko, Argos, Peacocks, and New Look. There are also branches Subway and Costa Coffee.

25|$|The {{layout of}} the {{intersection}} is very poor for trucks making this turn, and the congestion all these factors create has been forcing more drivers to resort to <b>side</b> <b>streets,</b> the village believes, since traffic counts have been going up on 52 and 208 but down on the concurrency. It is hoping {{to work with the}} state DOT on marking an alternate route for trucks.|$|E

In protest of the new mall, local residents barricaded nearby <b>side</b> <b>streets</b> to prevent traffic congestion from spilling over to residential blocks. By 1971, the mall expanded to 125 outlets.|$|E
