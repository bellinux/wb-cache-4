40|$|Dental caries is a multifactorial {{microbial}} {{disease that}} affects tooth hard tissue leading to destruction of its mineral and organic components. The current work reviewed {{the development of}} caries assessment methods and excavation concepts {{in the past two}} centuries. In the late ninetieth century, G. V. Black introduced a classification of dental caries, as well as established the principals of tooth preparation, based on his {{understanding of the nature of}} the disease. However, due to the great development of dental materials and caries detection methods, most of Black’s principals are no longer valid nowadays. In light of the minimal invasive philosophy, several new <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> concepts were introduced. These concepts converts ‘old’ Black’s <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> concept of “extension for prevention” to “prevention of extension”. Since 2000 the concepts of <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> have greatly changed due to the popularity of the ‘partial caries removal’ concept. As an example of this new ‘conservative’ vision, the “Fédération Dentaire Internationale” (FDI) (World Dental Federation) approved the atraumatic restorative technique (ART) as one of the <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> methods in 2002...|$|R
30|$|Limited {{in vitro}} studies {{comparing}} these two complemantary methods of <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> (chemomechanical and erbium laser techniques) have been performed so far (de Almeida Neves et al. 2011; Kinoshita et al. 2003), especially considering their effects on {{the features of the}} remaining dentin after caries removal in permanent teeth with natural occlusal dentin carious lesions. Therefore, the aims of this in vitro study were to investigate the Carisolv chemomechanical and Er:YAG laser <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> methods in comparison with the conventional tungsten-carbide bur excavation with regard to the extent of removing carious dentin based on the stereomicroscopic observations and microindentation hardness measurement of the residual dentin left at the cavity bottom after <b>caries</b> <b>excavation.</b> The chemical composition of remaining dentin examined by a scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) has also been evaluated after caries removal.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to compare the ability of fluorescence-aided <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> (FACE) to remove {{infected}} dentin in primary teeth with that of conventional methods. METHODS: Sixty-six extracted carious primary teeth were divided according to lesion size into 3 groups of 22 teeth. <b>Caries</b> <b>excavation</b> was carried out with a slow-speed handpiece and round burs for all groups. In the first group, caries was excavated conventionally using visual tactile criteria. In the second group, a caries detector dye was used to detect carious dentin. In the FACE group, cavities were excited with violet light (370 - 420 nm) and observed through a 530 nm highpass filter. Orange-red fluorescing areas were removed. Undecalcified thin slices were prepared, stained with Giemsa, and examined for presence of infected dentin using light microscopy. Four samples were lost during processing. RESULTS: Histology showed infected dentin in significantly less FACE samples (3 of 22) compared to conventional excavation (9 of 20; P=. 03), but not significantly less compared to caries detector (5 of 20; P=. 35). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this in vitro study, it can be concluded that fluorescence-aided <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> is more effective than conventional excavation in removal of infected primary dentin...|$|R

40|$|Information {{concerning}} phenotypic {{heterogeneity of}} Streptococcus mutans in carious dentin is sparse.

40|$|The {{advent of}} "Adhesive Dentistry" has {{simplified}} {{the guidelines for}} cavity preparation enormously. The design and extent of the current preparations are basically defined by the extent {{and shape of the}} caries lesion, potentially slightly extended by bevelling the cavity margins {{in order to meet the}} modern concept of minimally invasive dentistry. New <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> techniques have been introduced, such as the use of plastic and ceramic burs, improved caries-disclosing dyes, enzymatic caries-dissolving agents, caries-selective sono/air abrasion and laser ablation. They all aim to remove or help remove caries-infected tissue as selectively as possible, while being minimally invasive through maximum preservation of caries-affected tissue. Each technique entails a specific caries-removal endpoint and produces residual dentin substrates of different natures and thus different receptiveness for adhesive procedures.

40|$|AimThe aim of {{the present}} thesis was to study surface {{mediated}} interactions related to chemo-mechanical caries removal, in particular effects on oral tissues and dental restorative materials. Materials and MethodsFreshly mixed Carisolv® {{was applied to the}} oral mucosa of human and rat for 3 min. The soft tissue reactions were evaluated by visual inspection, and biopsies were taken from the rats and examined under light microscopy after histological preparation. Dentine cavities after <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> with burrs and Carisolv®, respectively, were chemically characterised with Fourier Transform (FT) Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). A topographical comparison of acid etched dentine cavities after burrs and Carisolv®, respectively, was performed with a Contact Stylus Pofilometer. Furthermore, the surface topography of 3 different types of dental ceramics, a composite resin, a polyacid modified composite resin, and a glass-ionomer material was measured before and after 5, 10, and 20 min exposure to solutions for chemo-mechanical caries removal; topography was performed with Confocal Laser Scanning Profilometry (CLSP), Optical Interferometry, and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). AFM was also used to investigate the effect of Carisolv® on salivary films formed on germanium prisms. ResultsNo or only weak inflammatory response was detected on the oral mucosa after direct contact with Carisolv® for 3 min. The dentine cavities after chemo-mechanical caries removal were chemically comparable to the dentine cavities after <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> with burrs. After phosphoric acid treatment dentine cavities exhibited a similar surface roughness, independently on whether the <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> had been performed with burrs or Carisolv®. Minor changes in the surface topography of the restorative materials investigated were detected after up to 20 min exposure to solutions used for chemo-mechanical caries removal. Five minutes Carisolv® exposure seemed to be sufficient for the removal of salivary films on germanium prisms. ConclusionsChemo-mechanical caries removal can be expected to have minor effects on the inflammatory response of oral mucosa, on the surface chemistry of dentine cavities, and on the surface topography of etched dentine cavities and restorative materials.

40|$|Chemomechanical <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> is an {{excellent}} example of conservative caries removal methods due to its ability to reliably preserve a greater thickness of caries-affected dentine (CAD). Chemomechanical caries removal (CMCR) agents dissolve the denatured collagen fibrils leaving the sound and partially degraded fibrils intact. Also, one of the main advantages of the CMCR method is its characteristic visual excavation end point sign, after this point, the solution fails to become turbid. Chemomechanical caries removal agents are classified based on their chemistry into sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) - or enzyme-based CMCR agents. The aim of this project was to evaluate the efficacy of currently available chemomechanical caries removal methods and their effects on tooth substrate, residual bacteria, and bonding to dentine with either resin- or resin-modified glass ionomer (RM-GIC) -based adhesives. The current project was designed to answer five research questions. The first research question aimed to compare the <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> time between CMCR and rotary caries removal methods. According to the outcome of this study, the NaOCl-based CMCR method is more time consuming compared with the enzyme-based CMCR method. Furthermore, no significant difference in <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> time was found between the enzymebased CMCR and the caries-detector guided rotary <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> method. The second research question investigated the effects of CMCR methods on surface topography, hardness and chemical structure of dentine. The morphological analysis showed that there was no smear layer formed following enzyme-based CMCR; while it was partially absent after the NaOCl-based CMCR method. Also, the Vickers hardness of residual dentine following both CMCR methods was lower than the hardness of dentine following the rotary caries removal method. Moreover, the outcome of this study also revealed that the CMCR methods investigated had no adverse effect on the chemical structure of dentine. The third research question was regarding the evaluation of the antibacterial effects of CMCR agents. Accordingly, a study was conducted on coronal cariesfree dentine discs using a modified non-invasive protocol. This confocal laser scanning microscopy study reported that the enzyme-based CMCR agent (Papacarie) showed an antimicrobial effect similar to 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate solution (gold standard antibacterial solution). The NaOCl-based CMCR agent (Carisolv) showed a weak antibacterial activity, which could be improved by subsequent application of a silver diamine fluoride and potassium iodide agent. The ‘adhesion studies section’ of this project consists of three studies and was conducted to answer the fourth and fifth research questions of this project. The outcomes of the first and second studies showed that surface treatment of dentine with 37 % phosphoric acid for 5 seconds had no adverse effect on bonding of RMGIC adhesives to both sound and caries-affected dentine, which addressed the fourth research question. The purpose of the last research question was to evaluate the effect of CMCR method on bonding of MDP-containing self-etch and RM-GIC adhesives to residual caries-affected dentine. It was concluded that CMCR methods had no adverse effects on bonding to dentine and both adhesive systems showed good bond strengths to caries-affected dentine. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Conservative caries removal {{has become}} an {{integral}} part of minimally invasive dentistry (MID). Polymer burs and chemomechanical caries removal are two feasible methods of MID. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the efficacy of polymer bur and chemomechanical caries removal agent clinically and microbiologically for selective removal of infected dentin. Methods: A total of fifty primary second molars with occlusal decay involving dentin were selected from 25 patients aged between 5 and 9 years. They were randomly allocated to Group A (polymer bur group) and Group B (Carie-Care group) for caries removal. Completeness of <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> was assessed clinically with the application of caries detector dye. Dentinal samples were collected before and after caries removal and cultured in Luria-Bertani Agar, and total viable count was assessed. All the teeth after <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> were restored with Type 2 glass ionomer cement. The data obtained was tabulated and statistically analyzed using paired t-test and Chi-square test. Results: There was a statistically significant reduction in the mean microbial count before and after treatment in polymer bur group and Carie-Care group. The reduction in mean microbial count was found significantly higher in polymer bur group compared to Carie-Care group. There was no significant association was observed between the two groups when efficacy was assessed clinically. Conclusions: Both polymer bur and Carie-Care were efficient caries removal agents when assessed clinically and microbiologically.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{performance}} of the fluorescence camera device VistaCam iX (VC) for the control of <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> compared to visual assessment and bacteriological evaluation. Twenty-three patients with 32 dentinal carious lesions were included in the study. The lesions were classified using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System. Fluorescence images were taken at the surface of each lesion using the VC before excavation (stage 1), during (stage 2) and after excavation (stage 3). At each stage, dentine samples were collected. All cavities were closed after excavation using permanent fillings. Bacteria were counted within each dentine sample using flow cytometry. Significant moderate correlation between the fluorescence readings and the bacteria count was found at stage 3 (Spearman correlation coefficient r s[*]=[*] 0. 40, p[*]=[*] 0. 027). Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated for fluorescence readings and bacteria count using the clinical status at stage 3 as a reference. AUC was 0. 954 for the VC readings and 0. 797 for bacteria count. Using the median bacteria count at stage 3 as a reference, the AUC for the fluorescence readings was 0. 753.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} enzyme-based (Papacárie) and sodium-hypochlorite-based (Carisolv) chemomechanical caries removal methods on bonding of self-etching adhesives to caries-affected dentin, {{in comparison to the}} standard rotary-instrument caries removal method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight carious permanent molars exhibiting frank cavitation into dentin were used. Forty-eight teeth were randomly divided into three groups, according to the <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> methods: (i) Papacárie, (ii) Carisolv and (iii) a round steel bur. After caries removal, each group was subdivided into two groups for two-step (Clearfil SE Bond) or one-step (Clearfil S 3 Bond) self-etching adhesive application and resin composite buildups. Bonded specimens were sectioned into beams for microtensile bond strength testing. Bond strength data were analyzed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. For interfacial nanoleakage evaluation using a field-emission scanning electron microscope, caries was similarly removed from the remaining thirty carious molars, bonding was performed as for bond strength testing, and the teeth were sectioned. RESULTS: RESULTS of three-way ANOVA revealed that bond strength was significantly affected by "adhesive" (p 0. 05). The bond strength of the two-step self-etching adhesive was significantly higher than that of the one-step self-etching adhesive (p< 0. 001). Conversely, the bond strength of self-etching adhesives to sound dentin was significantly higher than to residual caries-affected dentin (p< 0. 001). Greater silver penetration was observed in the bonded interfaces of residual caries-affected dentin and in interfaces bonded with the one-step self-etching adhesive vs those bonded with the two-step self-etching adhesive. CONCLUSION: Chemomechanical caries removal did not affect the bonding of self-etching adhesives to caries-affected dentin as compared to <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> with rotary instruments...|$|R
30|$|<b>Caries</b> <b>excavation</b> has {{conventionally}} {{been performed}} using mechanical rotary instruments (handpieces and burs) but alternative {{techniques such as}} the use of chemomechanical caries removing agents, sono/air abrasion and laser ablation are presently available today (Banerjee et al. 2000; de Almeida Neves et al. 2011). The rationale of development of the different techniques for caries removal and cavity preparation is to meet the modern concept of minimally invasive dentistry. The objectives of more conservative approaches are to complete removal of carious dentin in order to provide adequate retention for the restorative material producing long-term successful restoration and identification of a superficial infected dentin and a subjacent affected dentin layer being minimally invasive during caries removal (Banerjee et al. 2000; de Almeida Neves et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this review}} {{was to assess the}} methodologies used in {{previously}} published prospective randomized clinical trials on chemomechanical caries removal and to conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the differences in the excavation time between chemomechanical and conventional caries removal methods. Methods: An electronic search was performed using Scopus, PubMed, EBSCO host, and Cochrane Library databases. The following categories were excluded during the assessment process: non-English studies published before 2000, animal studies, review articles, laboratory studies, case reports, and nonrandomized or retrospective clinical trials. The methodologies of the selected clinical trials were assessed. Furthermore, the reviewed clinical trials were subjected to meta-analysis for quantifying the differences in excavation time between the chemomechanical and the conventional caries removal techniques. Results: Only 19 randomized clinical trials fit the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. None of the 19 reviewed trials completely fulfilled Delphi's ideal criteria for quality assessment of randomized clinical trials. The meta-analysis results revealed that the shortest mean excavation time was recorded for rotary <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> (2. 99 ± 0. 001 minutes), followed by the enzyme-based chemomechanical caries removal method (6. 36 ± 0. 08 minutes) and the the hand excavation method (atraumatic restorative technique; 6. 98 ± 0. 17 minutes). The longest <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> time wasrecorded for the sodium hypochlorite-based chemomechanical caries removal method (8. 12 ± 0. 02 minutes). Conclusions: It was found that none of the current reviewed trials fulfilled all the ideal requirements of clinical trials.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of enzymatic-based chemomechanical caries removal method on bonding of self-etch adhesives to caries-affected dentine. Methods: Seventy-eight permanent molars exhibiting frank cavitation on the occlusal surface reaching dentine were used in the study. Forty-eight teeth were randomly divided into three groups (n= 16) according to the <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> method: Group 1 : Papacarie (Formula & Acao, Brazil), Group 2 : Carisolv (MediTeam, Göteborg, Sweden), Group 3 : round carbide bur. After caries removal, each group was further subdivided into two groups (n= 8) for bonding with two-step self-etch (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray) or one-step self-etch (Clearfil S 3 Bond, Kuraray) adhesive, following manufacturers’ instructions. Composite build-ups were performed using Filtek Z 250 (3 M ESPE). After 24 h storage in distilled water, the bonded teeth were sectioned into 0. 8 mm 2 beams and stressed to failure for microtensile bond strength testing. Bond strength data was analyzed using 3 -way ANOVA (<b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> method, adhesive type and dentine type) and Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparison test (α = 0. 05). The remaining 30 carious molars were similarly randomly distributed into 6 groups (n= 5) for interfacial nanoleakage evaluation using field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Results: The results of three-way ANOVA revealed that bond strength was not significantly affected by the “caries excavation method” (p> 0. 05), but affected by “adhesive type” and “dentine type” (p< 0. 001). The microtensile bond strength of two-step self-etch adhesive was significantly higher than one-step self-etch adhesive (p< 0. 001). For two-step self-etch adhesive, the bond strength to sound dentine was significantly higher than residual caries-excavated dentine. Higher silver penetration was found in the bonded interfaces of residual caries-affected dentine and one-step self-etch adhesive groups.

40|$|Dental caries is {{clinically}} {{seen as a}} yellowish-brown discoloration {{that can}} be explained by the reactions between proteins and sugars resulting in Maillard products. However, the discoloration of carious dentine is an imprecise indicator of whether or not the dentine is caries free. Other processes might act in concert with the Maillard reactions. This thesis describes how special functional groups formed in the carious process can be used in connection with dyes that selectively stain the carious tissue in order to avoid over excavation. The initial study aimed to analyse unique functional groups in sound and carious dentine and their presumed reaction with hydrazine derivative using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The second and third studies focused on the possible formation of covalent bonds between carious dentine and 15 N 2 -hydrazine, 15 N 2 -labelled Lucifer yellow, and stains carrying a hydrazine derivative respectively, using ToF-SIMS, solid-state NMR spectroscopy (13 C and 15 N) and light-microscopic observations. The latter aimed to evaluate the type of binding, electrostatic or covalent, to carious dentine. In a systematic review with an adjacent meta-analysis, the ability of a chemically based product in clinical <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> was evaluated by comparing the efficacy of chemo-mechanical excavation with that of traditional rotating instruments. The results revealed ester groups unique to the carious dentine, with a higher occurrence in the inner layer of carious dentine, which, after reaction with hydrazine derivative, form covalent bonds not seen in sound dentine. This is a selective binding in comparison with dyes with only an electrostatic binding capacity. The systematic review found that the chemo-mechanical excavation technique is as efficient as burs, albeit with a longer treatment time but with enhanced patient comfort. It is concluded that ester functional groups unique to carious dentine can be specifically stained with dyes carrying a hydrazine group, thereby acting selectively in distinguishing between sound and carious dentine. As a result, using a more precise indicator will support the identification of the end-point during clinical <b>caries</b> <b>excavation...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of carious dentin removal with erbium lasers {{irrespective of the}} parameters used during laser irradiation has also been questioned over the years. Controlled <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> becomes more difficult {{due to the lack}} of tactile sensation because a noncontact beam emission mode is recommended for optimal irradiation when using erbium lasers (de Almeida Neves et al. 2011; Celiberti et al. 2006). Moreover, irregularity of the dentin surfaces left after laser ablation hampers an adequate tactile feedback for proper clinical hardness assessment with the probe (de Almeida Neves et al. 2011; Celiberti et al. 2006). Despite these factors, favourable results were recorded for a non-contact Er:YAG laser used in this study and the number of cavity with residual dentin did not differ significantly between the conventional bur and laser excavation techniques, while the chemomechanical excavation presented to leave more carious dentin behind. The results of this study are in agreement with the comparative study from Kinoshita et al. (2003). In their study light microscopic observations have also disclosed better scores of residual dentin after excavation with an Er,Cr:YSGG laser than with Carisolv.|$|R

The time taken to remove caries by Airotor method was observed to be least while the patient acceptance was found to be highest with Papacarie method...|$|R
30|$|Regarding minimal {{invasive}} tooth preparation, the endpoint of <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> can clinically {{be defined}} {{based on the}} hardness of dentin as felt with a dental probe, and also more subjective features such as the colour and moisture of the excavated dentin (de Almeida Neves et al. 2011; Neves Ade et al. 2011). In an attempt to develop an objective caries-removal procedure, the clinical use of staining agents were included (Fusayama 1993). The clinical and laboratory studies, however, revealed that hard and sound pulpal floors stain more easily because of its lower degree of mineralization {{and it has been}} recommended that light-pink stained tissue should be left in the cavity (Kidd et al. 1989; Yip et al. 1994). In this study, caries removal endpoint was reached when a ‘hard’ cavity floor was felt using dental explorer with a gentle pressure and the caries detector dye was used to guide and limit excavation to caries-infected dentin following excavation in all groups. However, residual dentin stained light-pink with a caries-staining dye retained in the cavity as instructed (de Almeida Neves et al. 2011; Neves Ade et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|Chemomechanical caries {{removing}} {{agents are}} classified as sodium hypochlorite-based agents and enzymatic-based agents (de Almeida Neves et al. 2011; Hamama et al. 2013). Carisolv system (MediTeam Dental, Sweden) mainly contains sodium hypochlorite, three amino acids (glutamic acid, leucine, lysine) and water and has been developed {{with the purpose of}} removing all the infected dentin preventing the removal of affected dentin, and is intended to provide less painful <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> (Banerjee et al. 2000; de Almeida Neves et al. 2011; Hamama et al. 2013). Sodium hypochlorite has a non-specific proteolytic effect which dissolves the denatured collagen {{as a result of the}} action of chlorine. The complete caries removal rate and chemical composition and microstructure of dentin after Carisolv treatment does not seem to be significantly different from conventional rotary instruments (Banerjee et al. 2000; Hossain et al. 2003; Sakoolnamarka et al. 2005; Ramamoorthi et al. 2013; Garcia-Contreras et al. 2014) although definitive conclusions generated by systematic reviews and meta-analysis could not be obtained concerning the clinical efficacy of chemomachanical caries removal system Carisolv (Marquezan et al. 2006; Li et al. 2014; Lai et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the remaining dentin thickness after cavity preparation, calcium hydroxide lining, and two restorative systems on the occurrence of postoperative pain or hypersensitivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-three fillings were placed in 123 healthy patients. The remaining dentin thickness after <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> was measured with the Prepometer device at the deepest area of the cavity. The cavities were allocated to three different groups (shallow, medium, and deep) {{on the basis of the}} Prepometer results. The decision to use a calcium hydroxide liner or not was made by tossing a coin. Cavities which were to be later treated with an indirect restoration were restored with a buildup material. The other cavities were treated with a hybrid composite. After 6 months, the patients were re-examined and interviewed concerning postoperative pain incidents or hypersensitivity. A logistic regression was performed for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Logistic regression showed no statistically significant influence of any of the three different variables "cavity depth", "calcium hydroxide liner" and "restorative material" on the occurrence of pain or hypersensitivity. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of pain or hypersensitivity does not depend on the remaining dentin thickness, calcium hydroxide lining, or the restorative system used in the present study...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{compared}} the chemical, morphological and microhardness changes in carious dentine following application of NaOCl-based (Carisolv), papain-based (Papacarie) chemomechanical caries removal agents with conventional rotary method. METHODS: Thirty-two carious and eight non-carious human permanent molars were used. The carious molars were randomly distributed into four groups: Group 1 (positive control) - molars were left without caries removal; Group 2 - caries excavated with rotary method; Group 3 - caries excavated with Carisolv; Group 4 - caries excavated with Papacarie. Group 5 (negative control) consisted of eight sound molars. After <b>caries</b> <b>excavation,</b> all specimens {{were prepared for}} chemical, morphological analysis and Vickers hardness testing. RESULTS: EDX analysis showed {{no significant difference in}} Ca wt%, P wt% and Ca/P ratio among Groups 2 to 5. Vickers hardness of dentine from Groups 3 and 4 was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) than for Groups 2 and 5. The use of Papacarie resulted in a dentine surface without smear layer and patent tubules, while Carisolv resulted in a dentine surface exhibiting two patterns: (1) the presence of smear layer or (2) patent tubules with partial smear layer formation. CONCLUSIONS: Papain-based (Papacarie) chemomechanical caries removal method is a reliable alternative to conventional rotary and NaOCl-based (Carisolv) caries removal...|$|R

40|$|Aims and Objectives : This {{study was}} done to {{characterize}} the surface chemistry after <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> with burs and Carisolv 2, by analyzing the relative amounts of organic and inorganic content, and also to analyze the penetration of the adhesive after etching and bonding using Micro Raman spectroscopy. Materials and Methods : Twenty extracted molars with caries were distributed into the following groups and treated accordingly. Group 1 -excavation with bur (10 teeth), and Group 2 -excavation using Carisolv 2 (10 teeth). Results and Conclusion : Spectroscopic analysis showed {{that there was no}} significant difference in the chemical composition of the tooth between the groups after excavation (P > 0. 05) either with bur or with Carisolv. The penetration of the dentin bonding resin in all samples of the Carisolv group was up to 15 &# 956;m, whereas, in the bur group it was upto 10 &# 956;m in few samples. Scanning Electron Microscopic analysis showed the surfaces of the Carisolv-treated dentin to be free of the smear layer, with open tubules, whereas, the dentin surfaces of the bur group showed surfaces covered with a smear layer. In the Carislov group the resin tags were found comparatively deeper than in the bur excavation group. In both the groups the integrity of the remaining dentin surfaces were maintained chemically and morphologically...|$|R
30|$|Microindentation {{hardness}} {{testing has}} been used in in vitro studies to determine the hardness of different carious layers and is commonly associated with the relative mineral content of dental hard tissues (Almahdy et al. 2012). This study compared the microindentation hardness to the visual macroscopic appearance of remaining dentin left at the cavity bottom after three <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> techniques. The microindentation hardness value of residual dentin left at the cavity bottom after Carisolv excavation was significantly lower than those obtained after conventional and laser excavations, as previously reported (Hamama et al. 2013; Magalhães et al. 2006). Carisolv was reported to leave more demineralised (caries-affected) dentin on the cavity floor, which may be a possible explanation for the decreased microindentation hardness measured in this study (Hamama et al. 2013; Magalhães et al. 2006). According to atomic analysis, the calcium and phosphorus content remain similar after all excavation methods, which is also in agreement with another study (Hamama et al. 2013). They also compared conventional bur guided by a caries-staining dye and Carisolv, as was used in this study. Moreover, a similar Ca (wt%) and P (wt%) or Ca/P ratio, indicating no chemically-induced changes of dentinal components, were found with Carisolv cavities as compared to adjacent sound dentin areas used as a control reference (Hossain et al. 2003). The results of our study confirmed that previous study about on the possible use of Carisolv caries removal system when a proper clinical guide is used in clinical dentistry.|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{comparatively}} {{evaluate the}} efficacy of photo-activated disinfection (PAD), calcium hydroxide (CH) and their combination on the treatment outcome of indirect pulp treatment (IPT). Materials and Methods Institutional ethical clearance and informed consent of the patients were taken. The study was also registered with clinical registry of India. Sixty permanent molars exhibiting deep occlusal carious lesion in patients with the age range of 18 - 22 yr were included. Clinical and radiographic evaluation and set inclusion and exclusion criteria's were followed. Gross <b>caries</b> <b>excavation</b> was accomplished. In group I (n = 20) PAD was applied for sixty seconds. In group II (n = 20), CH {{was applied to the}} remaining carious dentin, while in group III (n = 20), PAD application was followed by CH placement. The teeth were permanently restored. They were clinically and radiographically followed-up at 45 day, 6 mon and 12 mon. Relative density of the remaining affected dentin was measured by 'Radiovisiography (RVG) densitometric' analysis. Results Successful outcome with an increase in radiographic grey values were observed in all three groups. However, on inter-group comparison, this change was not significant (p > 0. 05). Conclusions PAD and CH both have equal disinfection efficacy in the treatment of deep carious dentin. PAD alone is as effective for treatment of deep carious lesion as calcium hydroxide and hence can be used as an alternative to CH. They can be used independently in IPT, since combining both does not offer any additional therapeutic benefits...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This {{study was}} aimed to {{determine}} the effectiveness of Papacαrie® for caries removal {{as compared to the}} conventional method with respect to microbial flora, time, the amount of tissue removal, child′s behavior, pain perception, and preference of treatment. Materials and Methods: Sixty primary molars of 30 children of age 4 - 9 years were selected randomly and divided into two groups of 30 teeth each: Group A treated by conventional method and group B with Papacαrie® method. Results: Comparatively, no statistical difference was seen in microbial growth, total bacterial count, and lactobacilli count in both the groups (P = 0. 36). The mean cavity entrance size with group A was 0. 98133 mm and group B was 0. 26083 mm (P < 0. 001). The mean preparation time for group A was 4. 7 Mins (minutes) and group B was 17. 96 min s (P < 0. 001). Majority of kids of both group A and B scored 3 (Frankl Behavior Rating Scale) before and after the treatment showing no statistical difference in their behavioral score (P = 1). In group A 50 % of children experienced no pain as compared to 86. 7 % in group B (P = 0. 01). There was no statistical difference in the preference of treatment (P = 0. 12). Conclusion: Thus, the Chemo mechanical caries removal method can be considered as an effective method to control pain and preserve sound tooth structure during <b>caries</b> <b>excavation...</b>|$|R
