IBM OS/360 uses macros to perform <b>system</b> <b>generation.</b> The user specifies options by coding a series of assembler macros. [...] Assembling these macros generates a job stream to build the system, including job control language and utility control statements.|$|E

The PEM fuel cell <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> efficiency decreases as its output power increases. Thus, an optimum efficiency should exist and should result in a cost-effective PEM fuel cell <b>generation</b> <b>system.</b> The PEMFC <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> cost and efficiency fuzzy model were build, we use the PSO as an optimization engine to indentify the fuzzy model.
