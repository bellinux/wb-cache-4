5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences shows that C.vinicolor {{groups in a}} clade with the closely related C.jamaicensis and C.pseudovinicolor. All of these species feature darkly-amyloid flesh and thick-walled cystidia. Based on this analysis, Miller considered C.jamaicensis to be insufficiently distinct genetically from C.vinicolor to warrant designation as a separate species; however, as of 2012, both MycoBank and Index Fungorum list it as a valid species.|$|E
5|$|According to Rolf Singer's infrageneric {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Pluteus, the fungus belongs in the section Celluloderma. Species in this section have pleurocystidia that are either absent or non-. Furthermore, the majority have a cap cuticle comprising short club-shaped or spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem) cells, {{that may or may}} not be mixed with elongated cystidia-like cells. Other species in Celluloderma include P.romellii, P.aurantiorugosus, P.pulverulentus, P.thompsonii, and P.horakianus. Molecular analyses of internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences supports the placement of P.nevadensis in Celluloderma, and further suggest that it has a sister relationship with P.horakianas. The specific epithet nevadensis refers to the mountain, Nevado de Colima, where the type material was collected.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of large subunit and internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence data, {{the results of}} which were published in 2012, concluded that the species then known as F.ellipsoidea was closely related to Phellinus gabonensis, P.caribaeo-quercicolus and the newly described P.castanopsidis. The four species share morphological characteristics, and form a monophyletic clade. This clade resolved more closely with the Phellinus type species P.igniarius than it did with the Fomitiporia type species F.langloisii, and so the authors proposed a transference of F.ellipsoidea to Phellinus, naming the new combination Phellinus ellipsoideus. While the taxonomic database Index Fungorum follows the 2012 study, MycoBank continues to list Fomitiporia ellipsoidea as the correct binomial. Some mycologists consider Fomitiporia to be a synonym of Phellinus anyway.|$|E
40|$|Tev-mTALENs are genome-editing {{nuclease}}s which {{combine the}} nuclease and linker domains of I-TevI with the DNA-binding domain of a TAL effector.

40|$|ABSTRACT: There is a {{considerable}} difference in morphological traits between Bokbunja cultivated in Korea (KCB) and Korea native Rubus coreanus, contrary to {{the conviction that the}} cultivated Bokbunja is the domestication of R. coreanus. To infer the phylogenetic relationship of KCB with other Rubus species, we compared the chloroplast <b>DNA</b> <b>spacers</b> of KCB with those of several Rubus species including black raspberry, R. occidentalis. The three chloroplast <b>DNA</b> <b>spacers,</b> atpB~rbcL, trnL~trnF, and trnT~trnL, were amplified using the specific primer pairs and converted to Single Strand Confor-mational Polymorphism (SSCP) markers. The SSCP makers of the chloroplast <b>DNA</b> <b>spacers</b> showed {{a considerable}} varia-tion both within and among Rubus species. In the phylogenetic tree generated by the SSCP markers, KCB accessions were located in the same clade with R. occidentalis, but R. coreanus accessions in the different clade. Also, in the phylogenetic tree by the nucleotide sequences of the chloroplast <b>DNA</b> <b>spacer</b> trnL~trnF, KCB located in the same clade with R. occidentalis but not with R. coreanus.

40|$|By using PCR, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains were {{identified}} directly from plaque samples {{without the need}} to isolate or culture bacteria. DNA fragments were generated by a nested, two-step PCR amplification of the ribosomal spacer region between the 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes. For the first amplification, primers homologous to sequences common to all bacterial species were used. This {{was followed by a}} second amplification with primers specific to A. actinomycetemcomitans. The ribosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>spacer</b> region was amplified from as few as 10 bacterial cells within a total population of 10 (8) cells (0. 00001 %), and cross-reactivity between species was not observed. DNA fragments specific for Porphyromonas gingivalis were generated from the same samples by using a P. gingivalis-specific primer, and equivalent sensitivity and specificity were observed. A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 60 % and P. gingivalis was detected in 79 % of 52 subjects tested. Sequence analysis of the <b>spacer</b> region <b>DNA</b> fragment for A. actinomycetemcomitans gave precise strain identification, producing unique sequences for seven reference strains and identification of nine plaque-derived isolates. A phylogenetic tree based on quantitative sequence relationships was constructed. Two-step PCR amplification directly from plaque samples combined with sequence analysis of the ribosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>spacer</b> region provides a sensitive assay for detection and strain identification of multiple species directly from a single plaque sample.
