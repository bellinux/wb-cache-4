40|$|Creating {{realistic}} and complete 3 D city models is the ambitious {{goal of this}} project. This reconstruction has to be performed fully automatically. The basis is an existing automatic method for creating extruded ground polygons with roofs from aerial images. The challenge is to provide all of these houses with detailed facades. The system will be evaluated, taking the city of Graz as example: many different building styles coexist, from medieval, over highly decorated neoclassical, to post-modern facades. Input Data Only terrestrial input data is used: �Highly redundant road side photographs �Road side LIDAR scans 180 ° in 1 ° resolution, ~ 30 cm spacing �Preprocessing yields registered textured point clouds Processing �Filter out obstacles: cars, trees, people or parking ticket machines �Segmentation of facades, detection of: windows, doors and other structural elements �Aim: classify and represent every detail down to a resolution of 50 cm Shape Grammar �Urban shape grammar based on generative modeling (GML) �Hierarchical representation of facades: <b>split</b> <b>hierarchy</b> �Parametrized buildings �Analysis of facade structure: building style, periodic sequences of elements or symmetries �Compact data representation, goal: web transmission �Extensive library of terminal elements �Convex polyhedra serve as geometric representation Fitting The terminal symbols of the urban shape grammar are parametrized by fitting them directly to 3 D point clouds. The fitting, as well, proceeds in a hierarchical manner. If, for example, a door or balcony is detected, first, the basic parameters are fitted and then the element is differentiated (round arch) and sub-geometry is fitted (columns on balcony). This helps to keep the parameter space on every level small, and to limit the element search space...|$|E

The incremental definition of objects through inheritance and type hierarchies is {{an important aspect of}} object-oriented systems. This dissertation examines the relationship between protection and object-oriented <b>hierarchies.</b> <b>Splitting</b> object-oriented <b>hierarchies</b> across protection boundaries is particularly attractive for the purposes of providing a uniform programming model to objectoriented applications and for implementing a minimal object-oriented kernel. After surveying current research and providing a background for discussion, this dissertation presents a detailed analysis of the issues relating to <b>splitting</b> object-oriented <b>hierarchies</b> across protection boundaries. The analysis is independent of language, operating system, and protection model. The analysis reveals the precautions that must be taken to guard against protection violations. The analysis also shows that in the general case an object must be able to be split across the protection boundaries, and that the child portion of the object should delegate or forward unrecognized method calls to the parent portion of the object {{on the other side of}} the boundary.

40|$|In {{the recent}} {{literature}} {{there is growing}} interest in the morpho-syntactic encoding of hierarchical effects. The paper investigates one domain where such effects are attested: ergative splits conditioned by person. This type of splits is then compared to hierarchical effects in direct-inverse alternations. On the basis of two case studies (Lummi instantiating an ergative split person language and Passamaquoddy an inverse language) we offer an account that makes no use of hierarchies as a primitive. We propose that the two language types differ {{as far as the}} location of person features is concerned. In inverse systems person features are located exclusively in T, while in ergative systems, they are located in T and a particular type of v. 2 A consequence of our analysis is that Case checking in split and inverse systems is guided by the presence/absence of specific phi-features. This in turn provides evidence for a close connection between Case and ĳ-features, reminiscent of Chomsky’s (2000, 2001) Agree. 1. Person <b>splits,</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and markedness Many ergative languages employ nominative-accusative and absolutive-ergative markings depending on a) person distinctions (person splits), b) tense/aspect/mood of the clause or c) the main/subordinate clause distinction (Dixon 1994). In this paper we concentrate on person splits. In languages with person splits, sentences with 1 st and 2 nd person arguments have a different syntax than sentences with 3 rd person arguments. 1 st and 2 nd person pronouns exhibit a nominative-accusative pattern, i. e. transitive subjects and intransitive arguments bear nominative case / agreement marking while transitive objects bear accusative marking.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a short report on an Optimality Theoretic {{analysis}} of the syllabification of single intervocalic consonants in the Arabic dialect of Sakaka city. This study aimed at investigating how intervocalic consonants of different sonority profiles are treated in the dialect of Sakaka City. Thirty monolingual male participants were recruited voluntarily in this study. Participants’ judgments were elicited using a metalinguistic word blending task with pairs of disyllabic nonwords of the structure ꞌCVCVC + ꞌCVCVC, where stress was on the first syllable only throughout the data. All phonemes involved in this structure are in conformity with Arabic phonotactics. In addition, the intervocalic consonants under examination belonged to four sonority levels; glides ([j] and [w]), liquids ([r] and [l]), nasals ([m] and [n]) and obstruents ([s] and [b]). The low vowel [a] was the only vowel used in this structure. Unlike many works of this nature, ambisyllabicity and word minimality effects were blocked in this complete word task. Although the investigation shed light on several important universal rules of syllabification, sonority profile of intervocalic consonants was the overriding preference in this blending task. That is, glides, liquids and nasals were parsed in coda position {{by the majority of}} participants whereas obstruents were parsed in onset position. However, the effects of other universal principles of syllabification such as Maximal Onset Principle and stress placement were minimized. The study concluded that the <b>Split</b> Margin <b>Hierarchy</b> adopted showed a strong preference for coda parse with high sonority consonants and onset parse with low sonority ones, thus adding further support to the abstractness of the syllable as a higher prosodic constituent and the discreteness of phonemes in the human speech stream.

Randomization tests of phylogenetic hypotheses based on the concepts of split support and split conict are described here, as are tests where splits, rather than the data, are randomly permuted. These tree-independent randomization tests are explored through their application to phylogenetic data for caecilian amphibians. Of these tests, split support randomization tests ap-pear to be the most promising tools for phylogeneticists. These tests seem quite conservative, are applicable to nonpolar data and unordered multistate characters, and do not have the problems of nonindependence that affect <b>split</b> conict and <b>hierarchy</b> tests. Unlike <b>split</b> conict tests, their power {{does not appear to be}} correlated with split size. However, all tests are sensitive to taxonomic scope. Split support tests may help discern data that are likely to be affected by the problems of long-branches effects. Comparison of test results formutually incompatible splits may help identify the presence of strong misleading signals in phylogenetic data. Signicant split support could be a prerequisite for considering phylogenetic hypotheses to be well supported by the data, and split support randomization tests might beusefully applied prior to or as part of tree construction.

It is clear that investigating the statute of homosexuality in Freudian theory leads us, necessarily, to some relativity, since Freud's conceptions are not always the same and sometimes contradict themselves. We do not intend, however, to appoint the multiple faces of homosexuality described by psychoanalysis founder, not even to make them cohere among themselves. It is about promoting a critical and renewed dive into homosexuality field. In order to do so, we have initially traced a history brief of the creation, appropriation and investigation of that category along the 19 th century - when Freud brings out the psychoanalysis. In fact, sexology, new science from the XIX Century, diligent in the positivist task of classifying sexual "types" and behaviors, {{has contributed to the}} production of homosexuality. This meant, largely, to produce it as pathological. After that, we interrogate the creation itself of the categories of heterosexuality and homosexuality in Freud's work in order to reflect upon in what sense the hegemony of the Phallic/Oedipal model produces one truth of the subject which is forged by the sexual and binary <b>split,</b> leading to <b>hierarchies</b> and asymmetries.

40|$|Together with {{break-up}} {{and mass}} transfer, coalescence {{is an essential}} process in many industrial and natural fluid/fluid dispersions, governing drop/bubble sizes and thereby the final product properties. Conceptually, coalescence can be <b>split</b> into a <b>hierarchy</b> of sub-processes, characterized by progressively diminishing length scales (Chesters, 1991) : The external flow, governing the frequency, strength and duration of the collisions; Film formation and drainage; The destabilization of the film by inter-molecular forces, leading to rupture. Viscoelastic behavior is exhibited by one or both phases in many industrial processes involving dispersions (blending of molten polymers, production of polymer foams, suspension polymerization, polymer coating, etc.). Of the various elements involved in, coalescence sub-process (ii) is especially sensitive to departures from Newtonian rheology - small changes in the stresses exerted on the film translate into large forces per unit volume. Much {{progress has been made}} in recent years on the numerical investigation of film drainage and rupture in Newtonian systems under different conditions (Abid 2 ̆ 6 amp; Chesters, 1994, Rother, Zinchenko 2 ̆ 6 amp; Davis, 1997) but the extension of such investigations to viscoelastic dispersions is still in its infancy. In the present study the drainage of a Newtonian film between axi-symmetrically interacting viscoelastic drops is investigated. The mathematical model is based on the assumption of small deformation, typical for coalescing collisions, and consists of: lubrication approximations of the film flow (solved by a FDM); creeping flow equations in the viscoelastic, Maxwell-type constitutive equations, for the dispersed phase (solved by a FEM). The film and drop-phase equations are coupled by continuity of the velocity and stress boundary conditions at the interface. The outer boundary condition consists of uniform pressure while a prescribed interaction force takes into account the external flow. The effect of the extra elastic stress in the drop phase on the film drainage is investigated and predictions of the rate of drainage presented. As a main result it is found that an increase of the elastic component (increase of Weissenberg number) yields a faster film drainage...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{scholars}} rely {{on traditional}} {{theories of the}} firm to analyze corporate organization and corporate contracting. Traditional theories of the firm, however, have long neglected the role of knowledge in shaping the internal structure of firms. Current analyses of firm structure that rely on these theories therefore suffer from serious shortcomings. This paper begins to address this gap by analyzing knowledge resources and investigating their influence on internal corporate governance structures. We propose a new typology that explains firm internal governance structure based on the types of knowledge used in the production process. We analyze the interaction of law and knowledge management. We investigate how firms can bind knowledge by means of patents, trade secrets and private contracting, such as covenants not to compete. We propose a principle of efficient knowledge allocation, which holds that organizational structures result from the necessity to maximize the use of knowledge resources. We discuss specific hazards that emerge from transactions with knowledge inputs. We discuss particular applications of the typology. We show how the management of knowledge resources required in mass production, high tech and law firms differentially affects the decisional hierarchies of these firms and also their compensation structure in certain instances. We argue that knowledge resources drove {{the change in the}} organizational structure of mass production firms from the U-form to the M-form, affecting decision making rights. We show how the adoption of stock options plans in high tech firms aims at constraining knowledge hazards. Stock options prevent leakage by retaining individual knowledge and discouraging hoarding of knowledge. We argue that the model of profit <b>splitting</b> and the <b>hierarchy</b> between partners and associates in law firms are also explained by the necessity of maximizing the use of knowledge resources. We then examine how the change of knowledge types used in law firms is affecting their organization. Finally, we investigate how certain business transactions like mergers, joint ventures and licensing contracts are shaped by knowledge inputs. We show that knowledge considerations provide a positive explanation for firm structure and a normative view in that the principle of efficient knowledge allocation should be an important concern of policy makers concerned with corporate reform...|$|R
