On the other hand, sales that are exported indirectly have troublesome relationship with output and foreign direct investments, which {{is related to the}} gap between entry of foreign firm and engagement of domestic firms with foreign presence and overall absorptive capacity (Zhang et al. 2010; Girma 2005 a).|$|R
50|$|Any {{company which}} {{provides}} multiple products may suffer from product self-competition. Similar products {{are more likely}} to have this issue. For example, a bakery which offers raspberry muffins and then adds blackberry muffins will likely see a decline in sales of the original product, although the <b>total</b> <b>sales</b> of both products will likely be higher than the original single product. If <b>total</b> <b>sales</b> do not increase, then this will have a negative impact on the business. However, even if <b>total</b> <b>sales</b> do increase slightly, this may still lower profits, as producing two products increases costs over a single product. Therefore, only a large increase in <b>total</b> <b>sales</b> would justify the addition of the new product.|$|R

We divided annual sales amount of each stage into three industrial sectors, forestry sector, pulp, paper, and wooden products sector, and transport sector, by two types of resource and delivery distance of each stage. Specifically, <b>total</b> <b>sales</b> in all stages of wood chip for fuel, which mainly uses logging residues as a resource, are classified into forestry sector. And <b>total</b> <b>sales</b> in all stages of wood chip for board, which mainly uses sawmill waste, are categorized into pulp, paper, and wooden products sector. For wood chip for paper, <b>total</b> <b>sales</b> in collecting stages using logging residues is classed as forestry sector, and <b>total</b> <b>sales</b> in transport stage using both resources is labeled as transport sector, while <b>total</b> <b>sales</b> in collecting stages using sawmill waste and in chipping stage using both resources are sorted into pulp, paper, and wooden products sector.|$|R
