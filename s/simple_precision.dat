Accurate motion manipulation on the nanometer level {{is one of the main}} challenges facing precision engineers today. With more developed nations' economies being driven in part by the growing telecommunications, photonics, and integrated circuit industries, the need for inexpensive and accurate solutions for precision motion manipulation is clear. Unfortunately, current technology requires costly sensors and feedback control to achieve the necessary accuracy to complete even the <b>simplest</b> <b>precision</b> manipulation tasks. This feedback control can represent up to 50 % of the total packaging cost of these systems. These systems could be much more affordable if the feedback and controls could be eliminated from devices such as Cartesian nanopositioners.

An adult macaque monkey performed two manual dexterity tasks: (i) âmodified Brinkman boardâ task, assessed <b>simple</b> <b>precision</b> grip versus complex precision grip, the latter involved a hand postural adjustment; (ii) âmodified KlÃ¼ver boardâ task, assessed movements ranging from power grip to precision grip, pre-shaping and grasping. Two consecutive unilateral M 1 lesions targeted the hand area of each hemisphere, the second lesion was performed after stable, though incomplete, functional recovery from the primary lesion. Following each lesion, the manual dexterity of the contralesional hand was affected in a comparable manner, effects being progressively more deleterious from power grip to simple and then complex precision grips. Both tasks yielded consistent data, namely that the secondary M 1 lesion did not have a significant impact on the recovered performance from the primary M 1 lesion, which took place 5 months earlier. In conclusion, the intact contralesional M 1 did not play a major role in the long-term functional recovery from a primary M 1 lesion targeted to the hand area...|$|E
