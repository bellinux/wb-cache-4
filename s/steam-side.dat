Â This study extends previous {{work in the field}} on inclined, convective condensation in small, round tubes to large, non-circular tubes with low inlet mass flux of vapor. Â The steel condenser tube in this study was designed for use in a power-plant air-cooled-condenser array with forced convection of air. Â The tube was cut in half lengthwise and covered with a polycarbonate viewing window to allow simultaneous visualization and heat transfer measurements. Â The half tube test section had inner dimensions of 214 mm x 6. 3 mm and a length of 10. 72 m. Â This study investigated heat transfer results for a mass flux of steam of 6. 8 kg/m 2 -s over a range of inclination angles. Â The angle of inclination of the condenser tube was varied from 0. 3 o (horizontal) to 13. 2 o downward flow. Â The experiments were performed with uniform crossflowing air with velocity of 2. 0 m/s. Â Both dropwise and filmwise condensation were observed on the tube wall, and depth of the condensate river at tube bottom was seen to decrease with an increase in inclination angle. Â Average <b>steam-side</b> heat transfer coefficient was shown to increase with an increase in inclination angle. Â However, average <b>steam-side</b> heat transfer coefficient was much lower than the predictions of both vertical flat-plate Nusselt condensation, as well as Krogerâ€™s correlation for condensation in air-cooled condensers. Â Overall, the results suggest that an improvement in <b>steam-side</b> heat transfer performance can be achieved by varying the tube inclination angle.

40|$|In {{this work}} the <b>steam-side</b> {{oxidation}} resistance of various austenitic boiler steels was evaluated. The {{aim was to}} evaluate applicability of tested steels to over 600 °C live steam temperatures. Experimental work has been performed by exposing various austenitic boiler steels to supercritical steam in autoclave. The mass gains per unit area and oxide scale thicknesses are determined from sample coupons. Compositions of oxide scales are analyzed with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GDOES). The efficiency of steam power plant can be increased by increasing the temperature and pressure of live steam. Today s advanced power plants have supercritical steam parameters with live steam temperature approximately 600 °C, {{and there are several}} research efforts to increase the temperature even further. High operating temperature sets very demanding requirements to the materials used in hottest components. The basics of steam boiler technology are introduced {{in the first part of}} this thesis. Brief introduction to fluidized bed (FB) combustion is also made. Typically used boiler materials and material degradation mechanisms that are typically occurring in fluidized bed type boilers are also briefly introduced. The main focus is on the <b>steam-side</b> oxidation of boiler steels. Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations affecting the oxidation process are discussed. The effect of alloy composition, grain size and degree of cold-working in surface layer on <b>steam-side</b> oxidation resistance was recognized from the available literature. Boiler steel must have sufficient chromium content so that protective Cr 2 O 3 scale is formed on the surface. Grain size and surface finish affect the diffusivity of Cr in the metal lattice by introducing more diffusion paths for Cr. The effect of cold-working (machining) was observed in the experimental work of this study. However, the detailed analysis of oxide scales revealed that the long term performance of machined alloy may be inadequate. Besides chromium, also other alloying elements were detected from thin oxide scales. This suggests that also other alloying elements (Mn, Si, Al and Ti) have a certain role in the oxidation behaviour of a stainless steel alloy. The experimental work suggests that advanced austenitic alloys with over 22, 5 wt-% Cr will be applicable in final superheaters of advanced supercritical power plants with over 600 ºC live steam temperature. More testing in different temperatures is required in order to determine the actual temperature limits. Shot-peened tube pieces should also be tested in autoclave and compared to the already tested machined sample coupons. /Kir 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLimited water {{supplies}} in proposed {{concentrated solar power}} (CSP) plant locations have instigated the need for air-cooling of the condensers in the Rankine cycle. The current industry standard for air-cooling in power plants is the A-frame air-cooled condenser (ACC), the installation of which has increased exponentially in the last 15 years. This has occurred despite the fact they suffer from significant inefficiencies and weather effects. This paper introduces a modular air-cooled condenser (MACC) design which seeks to minimise these inefficiencies. A thermodynamic analysis is carried-out to determine the outcome of installing this MACC design in a CSP plant. Firstly, a series of measurements performed on a full-scale prototype MACC under vacuum conditions representative of an operational ACC are presented. Condenser temperature and pressure were measured as fan speed was varied, {{for a range of}} steam flow rates, to determine the qualitative and quantitative relationship between fan rotational speed and condenser <b>steam-side</b> conditions. Results show that for a fixed steam flow rate and constant ambient temperature, condenser temperature and pressure decrease as fan speed increases. The relationships, developed from the measurements, between fan speed and condenser temperature-pressure were then used to evaluate the gross output from a 50 MW steam turbine and, ultimately, evaluate the net plant output. Results show that increasing fan speed leads to an increase in plant output up until a certain point, at which further increases in output are offset by larger fan power consumption rates. Thus, an optimum operating point exists. The effects of ambient temperature were also examined and were seen to {{have a significant impact on}} firstly, <b>steam-side</b> conditions and consequently, plant output. Increases in ambient reduce plant output. However, by varying the fan speed to achieve the optimum operating point for any given ambient, the losses can be minimised...|$|E

The first with a tube, 15 m long and 48 mm in diameter and the second which had the choice of one of three tubes, all 10 m long, with diameters (23, 40 & 48 mm). The apparatus was designed to enable the measurement of overall heat transfer coefficients. The effects of process variables, on the product-side and on the <b>steam-side</b> heat transfer coefficients, were determined by fixing conditions {{on the other side}} of the tube. Experiments were conducted on water, sucrose solution and skim milk. Aspects evaluated were temperature driving force, boiling temperature, tube liquid loading, feed temperature, non-condensable gas concentration in steam, de-aeration rates, product concentration (sucrose solution, milk) and feed thermal history (milk). The results obtained have been compared with theory and empirical data from the literature. A numerical integration procedure for the boiling side Nusselt number was developed to account for the change in boiling-side fluid properties over the length of the tube. The effect of boiling film Reynolds number on the overall heat transfer coefficient proved complicated with a local maximum being found in the transition flow region. A model description was developed to mimic the steam flow and condensation behaviour in the <b>steam-side</b> annulus of a single tube falling film evaporator. The numerical method initially chosen to solve the model proved inapplicable. A range of methods for measuring the amount of non-condensable gases present in vacuum steam were considered.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{of energy}} demand and aims of reducing CO 2 emissions promote the future coal-fired fuel power industries to pursue {{for the higher}} steam temperatures and pressures to increase the boiler efficiency. Higher operating temperatures and pressures will {{increase the risk of}} <b>steam-side</b> oxidation in the boiler tubing and this could post several potential concerns such as the thickening of low thermal conductivity oxide scale can cause rapid increase in the fire-side and <b>steam-side</b> oxidation rates. Furthermore, the associated stresses and strains accumulation during the scale growth can cause scale exfoliation, especially when the hoop strain exceeded a value obtained from the oxide failure criteria. Austenitic steel and nickel-based alloys are often known to be the preferred choice of materials under the aggressive operation environment, thus, the oxidation behavior and thermo-mechanical stress-strain should be investigated when these materials are used for boiler tubing. To date, no literature has been reported on estimating the oxide scale growth and thermo-mechanical stress-strain of austenitic steel and nickel-based alloy tubes under the USC operation. Thus, in this research, a simple and efficient analytical solution was proposed to evaluate the temperature distribution and thermo-mechanical stress-strain of multi-layered cylinder tubes. The analytical solutions were then included into the iterative procedures for the estimation of oxide scale growth in boiler tubes. It would allow the simulation to produce more comprehensive results. The scale growth predictions were verified with actual data from power plants. Meanwhile the results obtained from the analytical thermo-mechanical solutions were compared and verified with those produced by the finite element analysis software of ANSYS. To investigate the events of the scale exfoliation during the service, an oxide scale failure model was adopted, and the parameters for determining the critical strain causing the exfoliation were proposed. Verification of the findings with the published data was provided. The evaluations of the effect of oxide scale growth and presumed exfoliation on the temperature distribution and thermo-mechanical stress-strain in the boiler tubes (austenitic steel and nickel-based alloy) were carried out. In general, based on the simulations demonstrated in the present work, the oxide scale growth rates of austenitic at steam temperatures of around 650 oC seemed to be acceptable in USC operations, meanwhile those of nickel-based alloys at steam temperatures up to 750 oC were found to be allowable in the operations. With regard to the potential of faster rates of oxidation, further viability studies and careful consideration on the use of nickel-based alloys for steam temperatures operations of 800 oC or higher are required. It was also observed that when both steam-side/ID (inner diameter) and fireside/OD (outer diameter) scales developed on the tube, the ID scales would experience higher strain than that in the OD scales. As a result, the ID scales were more susceptible to oxide scale failure as compared to the OD scales. The research revealed that blockage due to exfoliation of <b>steam-side</b> scale could result in steam flow starvation in the tube thus leading to elevation of the metal temperature, and consequently causing rapid scale growth in the tube...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, the {{foundation}} is being developed for the numerical simulation of the processes that determine the oxide scale exfoliation behavior of the <b>steam-side</b> surfaces of superheater and reheater tubes in a steam boiler. Initially, the assumptions concerning the base state for calculating oxide strains also were critically examined. The state of stress-strain of an oxide growing on the inside surface of an externally-heated tube was considered for the conditions experienced in a boiler during transition from full- to partial-load operation. Since {{the rate at which}} the oxide grows is an important consideration, it was necessary to determine the appropriate temperature to use in the oxidation rate calculations. The existence of a temperature gradient through the tube, and the cyclic nature of the boiler operation (temperature and pressure) were considered; the growth temperature of the oxide was taken to be the oxide surface temperature. It was determined that the commonly-used approach for accounting for geometrical effects when calculating stress-strain development in a growing oxide scale of using the analogy of an infinitely-long flat plate gave sufficiently different results than when using a cylindrical geometry, that the latter was adopted as the preferred calculation procedure. Preliminary calculation of strains developed in multilayered oxides formed on alloy T 22 as a function of boiler operating conditions indicated the magnitude of the strains in each layer; the large strain gradients between the layers inferred the importance of the detailed scale morphology in determining the mode of exfoliation...|$|E

A total of 16 drainage strips were manufactured and tested on two finned tubes each with a fin thickness and height of 1. 0 mm and with a fin spacing of 0. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm. The heat-transfer performance generally increased with increasing porous strip height up to a possible optimum value between 11 and 15 mm. Of the pore diameters tested (0. 05 - 0. 013 mm, 0. 025 - 0. 05 mm, and 0. 0025 - 0. 05 mm), the strip with an average pore diameter of 0. 025 - 0. 05 mm gave the best heat-transfer performance.

40|$|As {{a result}} of concern {{about the effects of}} CO 2 emssions on the global warming, there is {{increasing}} pressure to reduce such emissions from power generation systems. The use of biomass co-firing with coal in conventional pulverised fuel power plants has provided the most immediate route to introduce a class of fuel that is regarded as both sustainable and carbon neutral as it produces less net CO 2 emissions. In the future it is anticipated that increased levels of biomass will be required to use in such systems to accomplish the desired CO 2 emissions targets. The use of biomass, however, is believed to result in severe fireside corrosion of superheater and reheater tubing and cause unexpected early failures of tubes, which can lead to significant economic penalties. Moreover, future pulverised fuel power systems will need to use much higher steam temeptures and pressures to increase the boiler efficiency. Higher operating temperatures and pressures will also increase the risk of fireside corrosion damage to the boiler tubing and lead to shorter component life. Predicting the remaining service life of superheater and reheater tubes in coal-biomass fired power plants is therefore an important aspect of managing such power plants. The path to this type of failure of heat exchangers involves five processes: combustion, deposition, fireside corrosion, <b>steam-side</b> oxidation, and creep. Various models or partial models each of these processes are available from existing research, but to fully understand the impact of new fuel mixtures (i. e. biomass and coal) and changing operating conditions on such failures, an integrated model of all of these processes is required. This work has produced an integrated set of models and so predicted the remaining service life of superheater/reheater tubes based on the three frameworks which have been developed by analysing those models used in depicting the five processes: one was conceptual and the other two were based on mathematical model. In addition, the outputs of the integrated mathematical models were compared with the laboratory generated data from Cranfield University as well as historical data from Central Electricity Research Laboratories. Furthermore, alternative models for each process were applied in the model and the results were compared with other models results {{as well as with the}} experimental data. Based on these comparisons and the availability of models constants the best models were chosen in the integrated model. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of different model input values on the residual life superheater and reheater tubing. Mid-wall metal temperature of tubes was found to be the most important factor affecting the remaining service life of boiler tubing. Tubing wall thickness and outer diameter were another critical input in the model. Significant differences were observed between the residual life of thin-walled and thick-walled tubes...|$|E
40|$|An ultrasupercritical (USC) boiler {{with higher}} steam {{temperature}} and pressure {{is expected to}} increase the efficiency of the coal-fired power plant and also decrease emissions of air pollutants. Ferritic/martensitic alloys have been developed with good creep strength for the key components in coal-fired USC plants. However, they typically suffer excessive <b>steam-side</b> oxidation, which contributes to one of main degradation mechanisms along with the fire-side corrosion in coal-fired boilers. As the steam temperature further increases in USC boilers, oxidation of the tube internals becomes an increasing concern, and protective coatings such as aluminide-based diffusion coatings need to be considered. However, conventional aluminizing processes via pack cementation or chemical vapor deposition are typically carried out at elevated temperatures (1000 - 1150 C). Thermochemical treatment of ferritic/martensitic alloys at such high temperatures could severely degrade their mechanical properties, particularly the alloy's creep resistance. The research focus of this project was to develop an aluminide coating with good oxidation resistance at temperatures {le} 700 C so that the coating processing would not detrimentally alter the creep performance of the ferritic/martensitic alloys. Nevertheless, when the aluminizing temperature is lowered, brittle Al-rich intermetallic phases, such as Fe{sub 2 }Al{sub 5 } and FeAl{sub 3 }, tend to form in the coating, which may reduce the resistance to fatigue cracking. Al-containing binary masteralloys were selected based on thermodynamic calculations to reduce the Al activity in the pack cementation process and thus to prevent the formation of brittle Al-rich intermetallic phases. Thermodynamic computations were carried out using commercial software HSC 5. 0 for a series of packs containing various Cr-Al binary masteralloys. The calculation results indicate that the equilibrium partial pressures of Al halides at 700 C were a function of Al content in the Cr-Al alloys. Cr- 25 Al and Cr- 15 Al were chosen as the masteralloys in the pack cementation process. In contrast to pure Al masteralloy which {{led to the formation of}} Fe{sub 2 }Al{sub 5 } coatings at 650 C, a coating consisting of a thin Fe{sub 2 }Al{sub 5 } outer layer and an FeAl inner layer was formed at 700 C with the Cr- 25 Al masteralloy. By switching to the Cr- 15 Al masteralloy, thin FeAl coatings ({approx} 12 {micro}m) containing < 50 at. % Al were achieved at 700 C. The effect of the amount of masteralloys on coating growth was also studied by employing packs containing 2 NH{sub 4 }Cl-x(Cr- 15 Al) -(98 -x) Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, where x = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 wt. %. It was noticed that when the Cr- 15 Al masteralloy was increased from 10 to 40 wt. % in the pack, both coating thickness and surface Al content increased, suggesting that gas phase kinetics played an important role in Al deposition. However, with further increase of the masteralloy, solid state diffusion became the rate-limiting factor. The long-term oxidation performance of the aluminide coatings synthesized at 700 C with Cr- 25 Al and Cr- 15 Al masteralloys was evaluated in the water vapor environment at 650 - 700 C. The low-temperature pack coatings demonstrated excellent oxidation resistance at 650 C in humid air after {approx} 1. 2 yr testing. Longer lifetimes can be expected for these thin coatings due to minimal interdiffusion at this testing temperature. Exposure at 700 C was conducted to accelerate coating failure via increased interdiffusion of Al with the substrate alloy. The coatings also exhibited good oxidation protection up to 6, 000 - 8, 000 h at 700 C, with longer testing needed for coating failure to occur. Furthermore, the oxidation results indicate that in addition to the Al reservoir (as determined by the Al content and coating thickness), the initial coating surface quality had a significant impact on the oxidation behavior. In addition, the effect of various pack aluminide coatings on the creep resistance of coated T 91 was investigated. Three representative types of coatings with different thicknesses, Al concentrations and phase constituents were included in the creep test. The creep experiments were performed at 650 C in air at uniaxial stress levels of 100 - 120 MPa. The thick aluminide coating made at 1050 C showed a considerable reduction ({approx} 42 %) in the creep rupture life of the coated alloy, due to the decrease of the load-bearing section. In contrast, the low-temperature thin coatings developed in this project did not significantly reduce the creep resistance of the coated T 91 alloy, particularly the thin FeAl coating synthesized at 700 C using the Cr- 15 Al masteralloy...|$|E

(2) Tools are not integrated across functions. For example, the knowledge represented by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of equipment is not used in process-level simulations. (3) No tool exists for readily integrating the design and behavioral knowledge about components. These problems must be overcome to develop the Vision 21 Simulator. In this project our major objective is to achieve a seamless integration of equipment-level and process-level models and apply the integrated software to power plant simulations. Specifically we are developing user-friendly tools for linking process models (Aspen Plus) with detailed equipment models (FLUENT CFD and other proprietary models). Such integration will ensure that consistent and complete knowledge about the process is used for design and optimization. The technical objectives of the current project are the following: Develop a software integration tool called the V 21 -Controller to mediate the information exchange between FLUENT, other detailed equipment models, and Aspen Plus. Define and publish software interfaces so that software and equipment vendors may integrate their computer models into the software developed in this project. Demonstrate the application of the integrated software with two power plant simulations, one for a conventional steam plant and another for an advanced power cycle. The project was started in October 2000. Highlights of the accomplishments {{during the first year of}} the project are the following: Formed a multi-disciplinary project team consisting of chemical and mechanical engineers; computer scientists; CFD, process simulation, and plant design software developers; and power plant designers. Developed a prototype of CFD and process model integration: a stirred tank reactor model based on FLUENT was inserted into a flow sheet model based on Aspen Plus. The prototype was used to show the effect of shaft speed (a parameter in the CFD model) on the product yield and purity (results of process simulation). This demonstrated the optimization of an equipment item in the context of the entire plant rather than in isolation. Conducted a user survey and wrote the User Requirements, Software Requirements and Software Design documents for the V 21 -Controller. Adopted CAPE-OPEN standard interfaces for communications between equipment and process models. Developed a preliminary version of the V 21 -Controller based on CAPE-OPEN interfaces. Selected one unit of an existing conventional steam plant (Richmond Power & Light) as the first demonstration case and developed an Aspen Plus model of the <b>steam-side</b> of the unit. A model for the gas-side of the unit, based on ALSTOM's proprietary model INDVU, was integrated with the Aspen Plus model. An industrial Advisory Board was formed to guide the software development effort and one Advisory Board meeting was conducted. Because we are integrating widely used commercial software (Aspen Plus and FLUENT) we expect that the results of the project will find immediate commercial applications at the conclusion of the project. The future activities planned are the following: Complete and test the V 21 -Controller and complete the integration between process-level and equipment-level models. Conduct power plant Demonstration Case 1 simulations with the integrated software suite. Select power plant Demonstration Case 2 and conduct simulations. Prepare a mock up of a 3 -D plant walk through to assess the integration of process and physical domain software in a future phase of the project...|$|E
