40|$|The design {{objective}} was to develop an inexpensive digital to analog (D/A) converter for use in vision science. Soundcards are hardware units that can be integral or {{can be added to}} a computer to add sound capability. A soundcard contains D/A converters designed to work in the audio frequency range, typically 20 – 20, 000 Hz. Soundcard outputs are high-pass filtered and thus do not convey <b>sub-audio</b> <b>frequency</b> or dc information. It is possible to circumvent this design feature by programming the desired output waveform as an amplitude modulation of a high frequency carrier, and then demodulating the soundcard output. The circuit, using a 20 kHz carrier, provides precise D/A conversion for the frequency range relevant for vision experiments, dc to 100 Hz, using inexpensive readily available components. The specific application was for 8 channels of D/A conversion using a Macintosh computer running under OS X. The software needed to program stimuli was created using CoreAudio, a library for programming sounds in OS X. Using soundcards on other platforms would not be a problem, as long as there exists a low level library that would enable the wave table to be filled...|$|E
