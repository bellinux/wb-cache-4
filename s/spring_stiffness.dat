25|$|For example, {{calculating the}} FRF for a massndash&springndash&damper {{system with a}} mass of 1nbsp&kg, <b>spring</b> <b>stiffness</b> of 1.93nbsp&N/mm and a damping ratio of 0.1. The values of the spring and mass give a natural {{frequency}} of 7nbsp&Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1nbsp&Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7nbsp&Hz. The frequency response of the massndash&springndash&damper therefore outputs a high 7nbsp&Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low 7nbsp&Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the force is applied to.|$|E

For this order, results as angular velocity and acceleration versus time for input shaft to gearbox reported, which investigated in initial turbulences that was from initial impacts of engine start up process and so converge of engine vibrations observed.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} a formal connexion between springs and continuum mechanics {{in the context}} of two-dimensional and three dimen-sional hyperelasticity. First, we establish the equivalence between surface and volumetric St Venant-Kirchhoff materials defined on linear triangles and tetrahedra with tensile, bending and volumetric biquadratics springs. Those springs depend on the variation of square edge length while tra-ditional or quadratic springs depend on the change in edge length. How-ever, we establish that for small deformations, biquadratic springs can be approximated with quadratic <b>springs</b> with different <b>stiffnesses.</b> This work leads to an efficient implementation of St Venant-Kirchhoff materi-als that can cope with compressible strains. It also provides expressions to compute <b>spring</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> on triangular and tetrahedral meshes. ...|$|R
40|$|Lamb {{waves in}} plates are {{strongly}} dispersive. For some {{branches of the}} dispersion curves ω(k), a minimum occurs at a non-zero wavenumber k, corresponding to a Zero Group Velocity (ZGV) Lamb mode. Such ZGV modes also exist in multi-layer plates and depend {{on the quality of}} the bonding. Because the group velocities of these modes vanishe, after a local impact, the energy remains trapped under the source resulting in sharp resonances. Laser based ultrasonic techniques offer a unique tool to observe these resonances. When the layer thickness is small compared with the plate thickness and the acoustic wavelength, the coupling layer can be modeled by a normal and a tangential spring to take into account the normal and shear interfacial stresses [1]. For greater layer thicknesses, the three layer model was used [2], taking into account normal and tangential springs at both interfaces. Under certains hypothesis, such <b>spring</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> can be evaluated from ZGV frequencies [3]. Theoretical results are illustrated through measurements conducted on several samples made of couple of millimeter thick metal plates bonded with submillimetric glue layer. Eventually, <b>spring</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> measurements are realized into samples with different controled bond strengths provided by Safran Tech...|$|R

50|$|Wristwatches {{and smaller}} clocks {{do not use}} pendulums as the timing device. Instead, they use a balance spring: a fine spring {{connected}} to a metal balance wheel that oscillates (rotates back and forth). Most modern mechanical watches have a working frequency of 3 to 4 Hz (3 - 4 cycles, or 6 - 8 beats per second, 21,600 - 28,800 beats per hour or bph). Faster or slower speeds are used in some watches (33,600 bph or 19,800 bph). The beats per minute depend on the balance <b>spring's</b> <b>stiffness</b> (<b>spring</b> constant); to keep time, the stiffness should not vary with temperature. Consequently, balance springs use sophisticated alloys; in this area, watchmaking is still advancing. As with the pendulum, the escapement must provide a small kick each cycle to keep the balance wheel oscillating. Also, the same lubrication problem occurs over time; the watch will lose accuracy (typically it will speed up) when the escapement lubrication starts failing.|$|R
