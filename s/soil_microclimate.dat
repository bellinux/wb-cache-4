However, {{our understanding of the}} effects of nitrogen (N) deposition on forested ecosystems remains limited due to the variable controls on N cycling. <b>Soils,</b> <b>microclimate,</b> and vegetation can influence rates and processes of N cycling, singly or in concert at multiple scales.

The objectives of this study were to characterize variation in <b>soils,</b> <b>microclimate</b> and vegetation characteristics, and N cycling and decomposition dynamics across the landscape in a region impacted by N deposition. Relationships among these factors were explored to determine the main factors influencing N cycling and decomposition. Strong differences in net N mineralization and nitrification were found between forest stands with contrasting species composition and moisture availability.

This study examined how aboveground disturbance might impact short-term soil carbon flux in a forest impacted by emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) in central New Hampshire, USA. We anticipated changes to soil moisture and temperature resulting from tree mortality caused by emerald ash borer, with subsequent effects on rates of soil respiration and methane oxidation. We measured carbon dioxide emissions and methane uptake beneath trees before, during, and after infestation by emerald ash borer. In our study, emerald ash borer damage to nearby trees did not alter <b>soil</b> <b>microclimate</b> nor soil carbon fluxes. While surprising, the lack of change in <b>soil</b> <b>microclimate</b> conditions {{may have been a}} result of the sandy, well-drained soil in our study area and the diffuse spatial distribution of canopy ash trees and subsequent canopy light gaps after tree mortality.

Although soil biodiversity declined with the decrease of plant diversity, many previous studies found plant species identities were more important than plant diversity in controlling soil biodiversity. This study focused on the responses of soil biodiversity to the altering of plant functional groups, namely overstory and understory vegetations, rather than plant diversity gradient. We conducted an experiment by removing overstory and/or understory vegetation to compare their effects on soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and nematode diversities in eucalyptus monocultures. Our results indicated that both overstory and understory vegetations could affect soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities, which manifested as the decrease in Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') and Pielou evenness index (J) {{and the increase in}} Simpson dominance index (λ) after vegetation removal. <b>Soil</b> <b>microclimate</b> change explained part of variance of soil biodiversity indices. Both overstory and understory vegetations positively correlated with soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities. In addition, the alteration of soil biodiversity might be due to a mixing effect of bottom-up control and <b>soil</b> <b>microclimate</b> change after vegetation removal in the studied plantations.

They are {{pertinent to the}} hydrology and biochemical cycling of high elevation ecosystems that supply drinking water to major metropolitan areas, and are undergoing change {{as a result of}} N deposition. As biological systems, they are virtually unstudied. In order to gain a basic understanding of these important systems, we studied the seasonal timing of C inputs and microclimate, and how they corresponded to microbial biomass dynamics, in vegetated and unvegetated soils from a high altitude talus slope at 3750 m in the Colorado Front Range. The <b>soil</b> <b>microclimate</b> was described by soil moisture and temperature measurements; C inputs were estimated with measures of eolian dust inputs and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The biomass of different microbial functional groups (glutamate and salicylate mineralizers adapted to different temperatures) was estimated seasonally over 3 years. We found that the <b>soil</b> <b>microclimate</b> can be divided into three distinct seasons: Winter, with free water and temperature between 2. 9 and 0 8 C; spring, characterized by wet isothermal soils (0 8 C); and summer, characterized by hot (mean 10. 3 8 C; range 0 – 29. 3 8 C) dry soils occa-sionally wetted by precipitation. The highest OM inputs to unvegetated soils occurred in spring; PAR only reached soils in the summer. In unvegetated soils, the biomass of glutamate mineralizers (GM) was highest in spring and summer. In contrast, the GM of vegetated soils had highest biomass in the winter when plants were senesced. In both unvegetated and vegetated soils, salicylate mineralizers (SM) had greater biomass levels in the summer when temperatures were highest...|$|E

Soil respiration, soil temperature, and soil moisture content (SMC) were measured between July and October 2004 and 2005 in 12 control and 12 irrigated plots {{laid out in a}} randomized block design in adjacent forest (aspen or conifer) and rangeland (sagebrush [Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ] or grass–forb) sites. Irrigated plots received a single water addition of 2. 5 cm in July 2004 and two additions in July 2005. The SOC decomposability in mineral soil samples (0 – 10, 10 – 20, and 20 – 30 cm) was derived from 10 -mo lab incubations. The amount of SOC accumulated in the A horizon (16 Mg ha − 1) and the top 1 m (74 Mg ha − 1) of the mineral soil did not differ significantly among vegetation type, but upper forest soils tended to contain more decomposable SOC than rangeland soils. The CO 2 efflux measured in the field varied significantly with vegetation cover (aspen> conifer = sagebrush> grass–forb), ranging from 12 kg CO 2 –C ha − 1 d − 1 in aspen to 5 kg CO 2 –C ha − 1 d − 1 in the grass–forb sites. It increased (? 35 %) immediately following water additions, with treatment effects dissipating within 1 wk.

Fifth, there are inadequate databases on disturbances at the continental scale to support the quantification of their effects on the carbon balance in North America. Finally, procedures are needed to quantify the uncertainty of model inputs, model parameters, and model structures, and thus to estimate their impacts on overall model uncertainty.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the fire-induced transport and physiochemical complexities involved with modeling the FIHL, there may yet be a third important dynamic process involved. Hudson et al. (1994) suggested that qualitative differences in hydrophobic layers (at a particular site) may in part be due to physical or structural differences in the soil (at that same site). Because {{it is reasonable to}} assume that at least some aspect of soil structure is involved with the formation of the FIHL and that fire can alter soil structure, it therefore follows that the fire-induced changes in soil structure may have a significant impact on the formation or suppression of the FIHL. This possibility yields the following hypothesis: that the fire may alter the physical arrangement of the soil particulate surfaces so as to enhance or suppress the condensation of the organic vapors responsible for the formation of the FIHL. Furthermore, these changes in soil structure may be independent of or coupled to the formation of the FIHL itself. In general, not a lot is known about the nature of fire-induced changes to soil structure. Nevertheless, this is an important first-order fire effect with potentially long-term implications for the <b>soil</b> <b>microclimate</b> and so is discussed in greater detail in the next section.|$|E
40|$|Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae Annand, a small aphid-like pest, is {{initiating}} {{rapid and}} widespread changes in composition and structure in southern New England hemlock forests. Rapid HWA expansion and extensive eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) salvage logging threaten a region-wide reduction of this ecologically unique, culturally and economically important forest type. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to describe the major results from a series of ongoing decomposition studies comparing the direct impacts of HWA feeding (damage to foliage, changes in <b>soil</b> <b>microclimate)</b> with indirect effects of forest harvest and community change. HWA canopy thinning rapidly alters soil temperature and moisture, retarding surface soil decomposition in stands suffering heavy damage and immediately following forest harvest. Fungal establishment and litter N retention at the most open sites were reduced. Regenerating stands had increased decomposition relative to noninfested hemlock forests, whether they where initiated after logging or by HWAhemlock mortality. Initial results suggest that feeding by HWA did not alter foliar chemistry and only weakly influenced N retention in decomposing foliage. Replacement of hemlock by high foliar N black birch (Betula lenta) is likely to have persistent impacts on decomposition in these forests. These changes probably enhance N mobility in infested hemlock stands and potentially increase N export to forest streams.
