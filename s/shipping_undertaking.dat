25|$|Named {{after the}} 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria, {{the ship had}} a gross {{register}} tonnage of 29,100 and a capacity of about 1,200 passengers and 500 crew. For a country attempting to rebuild its economy and reputation after World War II, Andrea Doria was an icon of Italian national pride.

25|$|The <b>ship</b> <b>undertook</b> {{her first}} sea trials from 10 August 2011 to 15 August 2011. On 29 November 2011 the carrier left port for her {{second set of}} trials. The carrier {{completed}} her eighth sea trial between 7 and 21 June 2012 and returned to Dalian. In July 2012, the ship {{set out for the}} longest trials thus far, 25 days. The carrier completed sea trials in early August 2012 and loaded Shenyang J-15 aircraft and KJ-88, YJ-83K, and YJ-91 missiles in preparation for weapons systems trials.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ship</b> <b>undertook</b> her {{builders}} and acceptance sea trials {{over a period}} of two weeks, during which she steamed for a total of 150 hours, arriving at Chatham on 22 September, where she was de-stored. Mataplan was initially laid up in Gillingham Reach on the River Medway from 28 October 1947 and was subsequently towed to Devonport on 20 July 1948, where she was prepared for preservation in long-term reserve. She was to remain moored in the River Tamar for the next 20 years.|$|R

5000|$|Mainly {{this means}} that if two {{chronometers}} contradict, {{how do you know}} which one is correct? At one time this observation or rule was an expensive one as the cost of three sufficiently accurate chronometers was more than the cost of many types of smaller merchant vessels.Some vessels carried more than three chronometers [...] - [...] for example, the HMS Beagle carried 22 chronometers. [...] However, such a large number was usually only carried on <b>ships</b> <b>undertaking</b> survey work {{as was the case with}} the Beagle.|$|R
50|$|On 29 November 1942, Armidale {{set out for}} an {{operation}} to Betano, Timor, along with HMAS Castlemaine. The two ships were attacked by Japanese aircraft along the way, and were subsequently late in arriving at their destination, missing a planned rendezvous with HMAS Kuru. While returning to Darwin, the pair encountered Kuru south of Betano and it was decided by Castlemaines commanding officer—as the senior officer—that Armidale and Kuru should voyage to Betano. The two <b>ships</b> <b>undertook</b> different routes to Betano, during which both vessels came under aerial assault.|$|R
5000|$|The refit was a mid-life upgrade, modernizing {{the ship}} for the {{following}} ten years - it cost £25million and was completed on time in spring 2014. It fitted her with the all electric 'Kryten' 4.5" [...] Mod1 gun and the mid-life upgrade to her Sea Wolf missile system together {{with a wide range}} of more detailed improvements. A new crew was then assembled and the <b>ship</b> <b>undertook</b> an extended period of trials developing her military capability and testing her systems integration. During the trials the ship visited Plymouth and Falmouth.|$|R
50|$|The International Fleet Review {{ended with}} the {{participating}} <b>ships</b> <b>undertaking</b> a passage exercise (PASSEX) in the Bay of Bengal on 9 February. The exercise was conducted in two formations, with the aircraft carriers INS Vikramaditya and INS Viraat each heading a formation. The first group was headed by the Vikramaditya, commanded by Western Fleet Rear Admiral Ravneet Singh; the second was headed by the Viraat, commanded by Eastern Fleet Rear Admiral S. V. Bhokare. A helicopter from HMS Defender landed on the Viraat, commemorating the carrier's historic ties with the Royal Navy.|$|R
5000|$|Tills {{was placed}} back in full {{commission}} at Charleston, South Carolina, on 21 November 1950, with Lt. Comdr. Elmo R. Zumwalt in command.

Homeported at Charleston, the ship took part in Exercise [...] "Convex III" [...] from 27 February to 20 March 1952 and in Operation [...] "Emigrant" [...] from 6 to 12 October 1952.

25|$|Turned {{over to the}} {{operational}} control of Commander, Naval Support Activity, Saigon, in April 1967, the ship commenced services to LSTs engaged in operations off {{the mouth of the}} Mekong River. During this period, the repair ship continued to provide support and maintenance facilities for craft of the Mobile Riverine Assault Force and supported Coastal Division 13 as well. Further, Tutuilas /50 caliber guns spoke in anger {{for the first time in}} the Vietnam conflict, as the <b>ship</b> <b>undertook</b> a shore bombardment in the Rung Sat Special Zone, providing harassment and interdiction fire into an area of suspected Viet Cong activity north of Vung Tau.|$|R
2500|$|In 1885 the <b>ship</b> <b>undertook</b> a {{simulated}} {{attack on a}} fleet at anchor at Berehaven. The principal object of this was to test tactics for a possible attack on Kronstadt Harbour {{in the event of}} the threatened war with Russia. Booms [...] and nets (to catch propellers) were laid across the channel behind Bereshaven, along with small observation mines and the area covered by machine guns and torpedo boats. Polyphemus launched {{a simulated}} attack on 30 June, evading around ten torpedoes fired by 6 torpedo boats during her two-mile run-in and easily smashed through the booms and a 5-inch steel hawser holding them in place.|$|R
50|$|Amazon was {{the first}} of the five sister ships to enter service. In December 1851 she reached Southampton to prepare for her maiden voyage. She carried 1,000 tons of coal for her bunkers and loaded several hundred tons of cargo. Her strong room {{contained}} 500 bottles of mercury for use in the production of mining explosive in Mexico and £20,000-worth of specie. The mercury was worth over £5,000 and the total value of the cargo was estimated at about £100,000. In common with many <b>ships</b> <b>undertaking</b> trans-oceanic voyages in that era, the ship carried livestock on deck and bales of hay to feed them.|$|R

In this study sediment cores collected from deep Indus and Oman basins (CD 1715, CD 1730, CD 1738) have been analyzed for mineralogy, water content and porosity. In general, the cores {{are mainly composed of}} clay to silt sized terrigenous and biogenic constituents. Quartz, chlorite and illite are the common minerals of Arabian Sea sediments.

50|$|In 1842 {{one of his}} <b>ships</b> <b>undertook</b> an {{emigrant}} {{charter to}} New Zealand, {{and in the same}} year his first ship visited Australia. By 1846 his ships had become established in the Australian trade. Initially this was to Sydney, but with the discovery of gold at Ballarat the ships also traded to Melbourne. George Thompson first established the Aberdeen Line (or Aberdeen White star Line to distinguish it from Rennie's Aberdeen Line) on the Australian trade in his own right in 1856. From that time, Thompson's ships were distinguished by their green-painted hulls, their white masts and yards and the red and blue house flag with the six-pointed white star which gave rise to the alternative name.|$|R
