40|$|Busing of {{children}} to achieve racial balance in schools is an important and controversial social issue. In studying the <b>school</b> <b>busing</b> problem, various groups (e. g., operations researchers, educators, sociologists, psychologists) proceed quite differently because of their different "Weltanschauungen" [...] their different perceptions of reality, their different world views. Operations researchers have viewed the <b>school</b> <b>busing</b> problem as a desegregation problem (i. e., simply physically mixing the races) while others have seen it as an integration problem (i. e., helping {{to bring about a}} viable, multi-racial society). The usefulness of the desegregation view of operations researchers is evaluated in light of findings from the educational literature about various aspects of the <b>school</b> <b>busing</b> problem. Explicit attention by operations researchers to the concept of "Weltanschauung" should result in studies more useful to school officials and administrators. Statements made about the role of "Weltanschauung" in operations research studies of the <b>school</b> <b>busing</b> problem may be applied to operations research studies in other areas of social concern such as health, welfare, and law enforcement. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1995, Dammasch State Hospital {{was closed}} {{by the state}} of Oregon, and the site was then {{proposed}} as a location for what became the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, which opened in 2001 at a different site {{to the north of the}} old hospital grounds. In protest of the construction of the prison, specifically the effect on property values, Larry Eaton began erecting <b>school</b> <b>buses</b> on his property. The former grounds of the state hospital are, as of 2009, under development as Villebois, a primarily residential complex. Also in 1995, Wilsonville High School opened as part of the West Linn-Wilsonville School District, the first high school in the city's history. In 1998, lack of an adequate long-term water supply forced the city to suspend adding any new developments to the city. A new water treatment plant on the Willamette River opened in 2002 to address this need.|$|E
5|$|School ran {{at various}} times at localities near Meander including: Montana; Golden Valley; Western Creek; and Jacky's Marsh. A school opened on a {{property}} known as Cheshunt in 1907, as the Springdale School. In 1919 it was moved to Montana, and renamed Montana School in 1923. The building burned down December 1926. During rebuilding some students were educated at the Montana Baptist church, others at the school at Meander. The school closed in 1944, by which time there were only seven students. The Montana school building was moved {{to be part of}} the Meander School in 1947–48. A school was run at Golden Valley from 1870 to 1945, initially as a 1/2-day school. During most of its life it had around 30 students. After closing the school building was relocated to Meander School. Western Creek had a school from 1893 to 1938. After it closed some students attended Meander's school, but others moved to schools at Mole Creek and Deloraine. Unlike other schools in the area the building was not moved to Meander but instead to Mole Creek's school. Children from Jacky's Marsh travelled to Meander for schooling until 1900 when the Jacky's Marsh school opened. The school was closed 1910–22 and finally closed in 1937. The school building was moved to Meander c1940. From the 1940s <b>school</b> <b>buses</b> brought children from Jacky's Marsh, Montana, Huntsman, Western creek and other nearby areas.|$|E
5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for <b>school</b> <b>buses</b> in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

5|$|Officials {{recommended}} the citizens on Smith Island to evacuate {{on the day}} prior to the hurricane making landfall, the only evacuations for the Eastern shore of Maryland. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying and other specific areas in Calvert, St. Mary's, and Charles counties, and the residents in six homes were asked to leave in Howard County. Officials recommended residents in flood areas of Baltimore County to evacuate, and some {{in the city of}} Baltimore left spontaneously due to flooding. Evacuation rates were low throughout the Maryland coastline, with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore. The primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane. Between 20% and 33% of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived, with similar numbers expressing concern about being able {{to return to their homes}} if they evacuated. Of those who left, most went to the house of a friend or family member, with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county. Most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall. In most areas, the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast, with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal. The most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees, inadequate signage, flooded roads, or stalled cars. In all, 3,080people evacuated their homes in preparation for Hurricane Isabel. Boats, trucks, and <b>school</b> <b>buses</b> helped more than 1,000people evacuate the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, as well.|$|E
