The term “conflict diamonds” is applied to those diamonds that are not sold through an internationally recognized company. They are “conflict diamonds” because warlords in Africa fight for these diamonds in order to sell them to acquire larger wealth and new weapons for continued fighting.

50|$|Gant's next {{role was}} in the novel Winter Hawk. Originally, Gant's mission was to smuggle {{scientist}} and spy Filip Kedrov out of the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, as Kedrov had information on a Soviet spaceborne directed-energy weapon. However, Gant and Kedrov were both captured by the KGB. Dmitri Priabin, the ranking head of the KGB, still holds a vendetta against Gant due {{to the death of}} Anna Akhmerovna. When he learns, however, of a plot by the Soviet military {{to take control of the}} Soviet <b>space</b> <b>weapon</b> and use it against an American Space Shuttle, Priabin is again forced to ally himself with Gant in order to warn his civilian superiors in Moscow. With the Soviet Army imposing a security crackdown on Baikonur, even upon the KGB, Gant and Priabin escape Baikonur in a KGB helicopter. Shot down by Soviet helicopters, Gant is forced to escape again with evidence of the Soviet weapon - first on foot, then in a stolen An-2 cropduster, then again on foot when the An-2 is shot down near the Turkish border. Eluding a manhunt by Soviet Paratroopers, Gant is extracted by US Army helicopters.|$|E
50|$|The {{events of}} Winter Hawk {{transpire}} {{over a few}} days in which the Soviet Union will launch into orbit {{the first in a series}} of laser battle stations, the existence of which they have kept a closely guarded secret. The launch is meant to coincide with the signing of a new and apparently groundbreaking treaty dramatically reducing nuclear weapons to be kept by both sides, but excluding space based weapons such as the one the Soviets will be launching, mostly because none are known to exist. The Americans know of the weapon because a Soviet technician named Philip Kedrov has been supplying them information, operating under the code-name “Cactus Plant”. The Soviet <b>space</b> <b>weapon</b> places the Americans in a painful dilemma: they can neither sign a treaty that will dramatically cede the balance of power to the Soviet Union, nor can they back out of the treaty lacking proof of the Soviet weapon. The only alternative is a deep cover extraction mission of Kedrov and his evidence from the Soviet’s space launch complex, the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The mission, involving two stolen Soviet Mil Mi-24 helicopters to be flown by CIA pilots — one of whom is CIA pilot Mitchell Gant — is codenamed “Winter Hawk”.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{questions}} that is being addressed at present by SDI Multimegawatt Space Power Project {{is whether or not}} <b>space</b> <b>weapon</b> power systems must be closed, i. e., whether effluents from the systems are tolerable. If they are not tolerable, the major penalty that must be paid to close space systems is increased mass. Open systems remove waste heat by producing effluents, e. g., hot hydrogen gas. Closed systems require radiators, thermal storage masses, effluent storage, or refrigeration to remove waste heat. The mass penalty incurred by addition of these devices is so severe that the option of closing space power systems should be avoided if at all possible. The mass penalty is even more severe if the weapon system itself must also be closed...|$|E

An axial flow gas expansion turbine model was developed for these reasons and is in use as a comparative bench mark in space power system studies at Sandia. The turbine model is based on fluid dynamic, thermodynamic, and material strength considerations, but is considered simplified {{because it does not}} account for design details such as boundary layer effects, shock waves, turbulence, stress concentrations, and seal leakage.

40|$|Additional contributor: Raymond Duvall (faculty mentor). Throughout history, warfare has {{essentially}} {{been based on}} the holding or taking of one’s position on land, water, and just recently in the air. In today’s world the new frontier of orbital space is slowly becoming the latest addition to this list of the precious places which are vehemently fought over by humans. Satellites are now the foundation on which commerce, communication, warfare and other vital domains are built. To protect the United States’ space systems, the Department of Defense (DOD) is funding several programs which have the objective to keep space {{a safe place for}} the United States to operate. These purpose of these programs can be called Space Control, and the aim in my research was to discover as much as I could about these programs. The funding for these programs is somewhat large yet not enormous, with the amount of money requested for RDT&E in Space Control at approximately $ 2164. 1 million, which is 13. 4 % of the requested funds for RDT&E of Space Weapons as a whole. Of the programs devoted to this field, three programs stand out as being on the cutting edge, yet they are also representative of Space Control as a whole. These programs are Counterspace Systems, Front-end Robotics Enabling Near-term Demonstration, and Starfire Optical Range. In this poster I will go into detail about Counterspace Systems, Front-end Robotics Enabling Near-term Demonstration (FREND), and Starfire Optical Range. Counterspace Systems and Starfire Optical Range are Program Elements of the United States Air Force, meaning they consist of multiple projects while FREND is a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program which does not consist of any other programs besides itself. I also summarize six other programs, of which five are USAF Program Elements and one is a DARPA program. After that I put these and Space Control in context with other <b>Space</b> <b>Weapon</b> applications and the Department of Defense.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War the {{potential}} use of outer space for military purposes persisted to be intrinsically linked to the development of space technology and space flight. The launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, by the USSR in 1957 made Western states realise that a surprise attack from space was a real possibility, resulting in the so-called "space-race" between the USA and the USSR. During the Cold War space activities were intrinsically linked to the political objectives, priorities and national security concerns of the USA and the Soviet Union. After the Cold War the political relevance and benefits of space continued to be recognised by states. In view of the recent emergence of new major space powers such as China, the focus has again shifted to the military use of outer space and {{the potential}} that a state with advanced space technology may use it for military purposes in order to dominate other states. Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty prohibits the installation of nuclear weapons and {{weapons of mass destruction in}} outer space and determines that the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used for peaceful purposes only. Due to the dual-use character of many space assets, the distinction between military and non-military uses of outer space is becoming increasingly blurred. This article discusses a number of legal challenges presented by article IV of the Outer Space Treaty, relating specifically to the term peaceful, the distinction between the terms militarisation and weaponisation and the nature of a <b>space</b> <b>weapon.</b> It is concluded that article IV is in many respects outdated and that it cannot address the current legal issues relating to the military use of outer space. The legal vacuum in this area may have grave consequences not only for maintaining peace and security in outer space, but also on earth. Consequently, an international dialogue on the military uses of outer space should be facilitated under the auspices of the UNCOPUOS to address these uncertainties as a matter of urgency. Although it is agreed with the proponents of a hard law approach that a legally binding instrument should be adopted to regulate the military use of outer space, it is submitted that, as an interim measure, soft law guidelines should be developed to provide a framework for the eventual creation of a consolidated and binding legal instrument on all aspects relating to the use of outer space...|$|E

Keeping in mind that a lot of money is earned with space applications – the global revenue of the space industry in 2009 amounted to $ 261. 61 billion – an arms race in space would have negative economic consequences, too. Then how can we keep space safe? This is the central question, this report wants to answer. One recent initiative in this regard is the EU proposal to make the major spacefaring states agree on a Code of Conduct for behavior in space. While the establishment of “rules of the road” for space would be a first step into the right direction, it does not ban space weapons and hence cannot prevent an arms race in space. This report argues that the establishment of an international arms control regime for space would be a better instrument to keep space safe and that the EU should therefore combine its Code of Conduct approach with an initiative to establish such a regime. Of course, an arms control regime for space cannot be established overnight. This report outlines a long-term strategy that maps out the central problems that must be solved to reach arms control in space. In order to do so, it draws on theoretical considerations on the establishment of international regimes. The finding of this analysis is that {{in order to be able}} to agree on arms control in space, states must solve two classical problems of international cooperation, namely cheating and the unequal distribution of gains. This is possible, though, by drawing upon classical solutions to these problems, namely verification and issue-linkage. A first problem that prevents states from agreeing to arms control in space is the fear that other states would not stick to their commitment. This fear is reflected in the American concern for effective verification and, indeed, drawing up mechanisms for verification must be part of any arms control agreement for space. This is possible, though. Although not every action that could lead to the development of space weapons can be verified, testing space weapons under real conditions can. Since space weapons cannot be developed overnight, states can make use of a strategy of reciprocity, a kind of space weapons testing tit-for-tat. A second problem results from the fact that states tend to cooperate only, if the gains from this cooperation are distributed equally. This is not easy in the case of space weapons where the U. S. clearly has the technological lead. However, a general ban of space weapons provides for a compromise between the U. S. – that chiefly would benefit from a ban on ground-based anti-satellite weapons – and Russia and China who mainly seek to restrict the placement of more sophisticated weapons in orbit. However, before these problems can be tackled, the major space-faring states have to “learn” that due to the interdependent character of space, unilateral strategies, i. e. developing space weapons, do not further their security. By drawing a parallel between the case of space weapons and nuclear arms control during the Cold War, this report argues that the emergence of a transnational epistemic community of space experts from the major space-faring states that produces consensual knowledge on the dangers of warfare in space would be an important step to foster learning in space. The EU could facilitate such a process of knowledge building by initiating a series of conferences among scientists from the major space-faring nations on the dangers of war in space...|$|E
