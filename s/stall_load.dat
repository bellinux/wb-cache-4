40|$|Development of the Body Flap Actuation Subsystem for Space Shuttles {{included}} alterations {{from the}} original design to mechanical stops, planet gears, control valves, and solenoid valves. The mechanical stops were redesigned to absorb <b>stall</b> <b>load</b> and rotating inertia of the hydraulic motors instead of only <b>stall</b> <b>load.</b> The institution of a quill shaft (torsion spring) was a successful solution. The planet gears in the geared rotary actuators developed cracks during testing. This failure was alleviated via modification to the gears. A motor pressurization - brake release timing technique was developed thru analysis and testing. This resulted in a control valve configuration which would not permit freewheeling of the body flap surface. Finally, several solenoid valve configurations were tested to obtain the desired performance. Conceptual redesigns and modifications were weighted against each other to optimize a solution. Tradeoffs were usually made between life, performance, failure tolerance, and reliability versus weight, envelope, and maintainability...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} report for the {{actuator}} bracket/lug fracture mechanics qualification test. The test plan (CTP- 0071) outlined a two-phase test program designed {{to answer questions about}} the fracture criticality of the redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) nozzle actuator bracket. An analysis conducted using the NASA/FLAGRO fracture mechanics computer program indicated that the actuator bracket might be a fracture critical component. In the NASA/FLAGRO analysis, a simple lug model was used to represent the actuator bracket. It was calculated that the bracket would fracture if subjected to an actuator <b>stall</b> <b>load</b> {{in the presence of a}} 0. 10 in. corner crack at the actuator attachment hole. The 0. 10 in. crack size corresponds to the nondestructive inspection detectability limit for the actuator bracket. The inspection method used is the dye penetrant method. The actuator <b>stall</b> <b>load</b> (103, 424 lb) is the maximum load which the actuator bracket is required to withstand during motor operation.

40|$|Bidirectional cargo {{transport}} by molecular motors {{in cells}} {{is a complex}} phenomenon, in which the cargo (usually a vesicle) alternately moves in retrograde and anterograde directions. In this case, teams of oppositely pulling motors (eg., kinesin and dynein) bind to the cargo simultaneously, and `coordinate' their activity such that the motion consists of spells of positively and negatively directed segments, separated by pauses of varying duration. A set of recent experiments have analyzed the bidirectional motion of endosomes in the amoeba D. discoideum in detail. It was found that in between directional switches, a team of 5 - 6 dyneins stall a cargo against a stronger kinesin in tug of war, which lasts for almost a second. As the mean detachment time of a kinesin under its <b>stall</b> <b>load</b> was also observed to be ~ 1 s, we infer that the collective detachment time of the dynein assembly must also be similar. Here, we analyze this inference from a modeling perspective, using experimentally measured single-molecule parameters as inputs. We find that the commonly assumed exponential load-dependent detachment rate is inconsistent with observations, as it predicts that a 5 -dynein assembly will detach under its combined <b>stall</b> <b>load</b> {{in less than a}} hundredth of a second. A modified model where the load-dependent unbinding rate is assumed to saturate at stall-force level for super-stall loads gives results which are in agreement with experimental data. Our analysis suggests that the load-dependent detachment of a dynein in a team is qualitatively different at sub-stall and super-stall loads, a conclusion which is likely to have implications in other situations involving collective effects of many motors.

40|$|In {{aerospace}} positioning actuators, gear efficiencies of 85 % {{as well as}} breakout {{forces as}} high as 50 % of the <b>stall</b> <b>load</b> of the actuator are observed at very low temperature conditions. Due to the low efficiency and high loading, stiction in these actuators is common {{which can lead to}} limit cycles or problems with controlling the actuators. To be able to correctly predict and assess these effects using simulations, a complete actuator, including motor, inverter, load and controller is needed. This article presents an object based, numerically efficient gear contact in a planar environment with user-defined friction- and stiffness laws. The emphasis of the modeling is not a fully detailed contact model, but the description of a gear contact model which can be used for system simulations like complete aircraft electro-mechanical actuators including control surfaces. The presented model is suitable for complex gearing configurations (e. g. compound planetary gears). This is enabled by breaking down the transmission into the basic gear contacts. By adding masses and constraints from an existing component library, a complete transmission can be modeled. The generated model can be used for standalone simulations or can be used in multi-domain simulations like actuator modeling, in order to analyze the complete actuator model including parts such as drives, controllers and mechanical systems. The presented models have been validated using a gear test rig for a single stage spur gear...|$|E

The actuation system architecture of Boeing and Airbus is then presented as a conventional design where the new design concepts are also researched and the distributed architecture was proposed as another design trend.

The conventional and distributed flight actuation system design considered the redundancy of systems and actuators, and also the relationship of the power, control channel and actuator work mode. But only primary flight actuation control system specifications are calculated since this data has better precision and also the limited time has to be taken into consideration. Brief comparisons of the two system specifications demonstrate that the higher power actuator have has higher efficiency and distributed actuators could reduce the system weight through reduce the system redundancy with a power efficiency decline.

We have exploited fission yeast to elucidate the relationship between replication fork <b>stalling,</b> <b>loading</b> of replication and recombination proteins onto DNA, and the intra-S checkpoint. Here, we show that a functional recombination machinery is not essential for recovery from replication fork arrest and instead can lead to nonfunctional fork structures.

40|$|A Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) {{experiences}} imbalanced loads when {{it operates}} under yaw loads. For each blade {{element of the}} aerodynamically imbalanced rotor, {{not only is the}} angle of attack unsteady, but also the corresponding incident velocity, a fact usually unfairly ignored. For the unsteady angle of attack, a pitch oscillating airfoil has been studied experimentally and numerically when 3. 5 × 10 ⁴<Re< 10 ⁵. For small wind tunnel airfoils, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was utilized to determine the aerodynamic loads and the pressure field where other measurement techniques are either intrusive or very challenging. For dynamic airfoils in highly separated flow fields, i. e., deep dynamic <b>stall</b> phenomena, <b>loads</b> were calculated successfully based on the control-volume approach by exploring ways to reduce the level of uncertainties in particular for drag estimation. Consecutive high resolution PIV velocity fields revealed that increasing the reduced frequency was followed by an enriched vortex growth time and phase delay as well as a reduced number of vortices during upstroke motion. Moreover, the locations of the vortices after separation were influenced by each other. Laminar separation bubble height also showed a reducing trend as the reduced frequency increased. The nature of the vortex sheet vortices before stall were explored in two Reynolds numbers, with and without laminar separation bubbles, at low angles of attack. For all cases, a vortex sheet was the result of random vortex sheding while a longer vortex sheet was more favorable for lift augmentation. A wake study and averaged drag calculation at low angles of attack were also performed with Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) for Re= 10 ⁵. For the unsteady incident velocity, longitudinal freestream oscillations have been studied numerically, since experimental study of an unsteady freestream is challenging. In this regard, the streamwise freestream velocity and pitch angle of incidence oscillated with the same frequency {{in a wide range of}} phase differences. Changing the phase difference caused variation of the results, including significantly augmented and dramatically damped dynamic <b>stall</b> <b>loads,</b> both increasing and decreasing trends for vortex growth time during phase increase and shifted location of the maximum loads. The results showed strong dependency on the velocity and acceleration of the freestream during dynamic stall and the dynamic stall characteristics differed significantly from those of the steady freestream states. The results also demonstrated consistent trends regardless of the airfoil shape and the Reynolds number while Re= 10 ⁵ and 10 ⁶.

40|$|This paper predicts and {{analyzes}} {{main rotor}} airloads, structural loads, and swashplate servo loads in a prescribed high-g pull-up maneuver. A multibody finite-element structural model is {{coupled with a}} transient lifting-line aerodynamic model. The structural model includes a swashplate model to calculate servo loads. The lifting-line model combines airfoil tables, a Weissinger–L near-wake time-marching free wake, and a semiempirical dynamic stall model. The maneuver data {{were taken from the}} Army/NASA UH- 60 A Airloads Program Flight Counter 11029. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} isolate the effects of structural dynamics, free wake, dynamic stall, and pitch control angles in order to determine the key loads mechanisms in this flight. The structural loads are first calculated using airloads measured in flight. The measured airloads are then replaced with a lifting-line coupled analysis, which is ideally suited to isolate the effects of free wake and dynamic stall. It is concluded that the maneuver is almost entirely dominated by stall, with little or no wake-induced effect on blade loads, even though the wake cuts through the disk twice during the maneuver. At the peak of the maneuver, almost 75 % of the operating envelope of a typical airfoil lies beyond stall. The mechanism of dynamic stall, in the analysis, consists of multiple cycles within a wide disk area. The peak-to-peak structural loads prediction from the lifting-line analysis shows an underprediction of 10 – 20 % in flap and chord bending moments and 50 % in torsion loads.

The propeller characteristics were obtained for a range of power coefficients from 0. 30 to 1. 00 at free-stream Mach numbers of 0. 40 and 0. 50. The results of the force measurements are indicative only of trends in propeller efficiency with changes in power coefficient and advance-diameter ratio because unknown interference effects existed during the investigation. At a free-stream Mach number of 0. 40, the envelopes of the efficiency curves decreased about 11 % between advance-diameter ratios of 2. 40 and 4. 40. An increase in power coefficient from 0. 30 to 0. 80 at an advance-diameter ratio of 2. 40 had little effect on the propeller efficiency.

CPR/CFP scale the register file by aggressively reclaiming the destination registers of many in-flight instructions. However, an analogous mechanism {{does not exist}} for stores and loads. As the window expands, CPR/CFP processors must track all in-flight stores and loads to support forwarding and detect memory ordering violations.

50|$|Selective memory {{dependence}} prediction <b>stalls</b> specific <b>loads</b> {{until it}} is certain that no violation may occur. It does not explicitly predict dependencies. This predictor may delay loads longer than necessary and hence result in suboptimal performance. In fact, in some cases it performs worse than naively speculating all loads as early as possible. This is because often its faster to mispeculate and recover than to wait for all preceding stores to execute. Exact memory dependence prediction was developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Specifically, Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization delays loads only {{as long as it is}} necessary by predicting the exact store a load should wait for. This predictor predicts exact dependences (store and load pair). The synonym predictor groups together all dependences that share a common load or store instruction. The store sets predictor represents multiple potential dependences efficiently by grouping together all possible stores a load may dependent upon. The store barrier predictor treats certain store instructions as barriers. That is, all subsequent load or store operations are not allowed to bypass the specific store. The store barrier predictor does not explicitly predict dependencies. This predictor may unnecessarily delay subsequent, yet independent loads. Memory dependence prediction has other applications beyond the scheduling of loads and stores. For example, speculative memory cloaking and speculative memory bypassing use memory dependence prediction to streamline the communication of values through memory.|$|R

As Google engineers have discovered, people will visit a website less often if it is loading slower than a close competitor by more than 250 milliseconds — literally the blink of an eye. Moreover, four out of five online users will click away if a video <b>stalls</b> while <b>loading</b> [1]. The impending demand for performance, however, is not met by how performance requirements are validated by the industry. Most of the time, the performance of a system is most likely to be assessed {{at the end of the}} development cycle. This could lead to disastrous results if it is revealed at this stage that these quality requirements could not be met by the current architecture without significant rework. An experience from Oracle Corporation suggests that performance validation accounts for an average of 2. 5 % of the total cost of development. However, the cost of fixing poorly performing applications at the end of development cycle is estimated to be 25 % of the total cost of development [2]...|$|R
