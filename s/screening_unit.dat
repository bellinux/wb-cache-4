On 7 January 1953, she steamed south to join the Formosa Strait patrol. In mid-February, Marshall rejoined TF77. Two months later, her western Pacific deployment completed, she headed home, arriving at San Diego on 6 May.|$|E

40|$|Rationale and Objectives Women who {{are invited}} {{for breast cancer}} {{screening}} should get enough information about the {{benefits and harms of}} screening to make an informed decision on participation. Personal invitations are an important source of information, because all invited women receive them. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the information breast cancer <b>screening</b> <b>units</b> send to women invited for screening in Finland. Materials and Methods A questionnaire was sent to all breast cancer <b>screening</b> <b>units</b> in Finland in 2005 and 2008, and the information (eg, invitations, results letters, leaflets) the units sent to women was collected. Results from 2005 were sent as feedback to the units. Data were analyzed descriptively, and results from the 2 years were compared. Results <b>Screening</b> <b>units</b> sent personal invitation letters usually providing fixed appointment times. Most units informed about participation free of charge and the benefits of detecting breast cancer early. Harm associated with screening was seldom mentioned; no unit mentioned the possibility of false-negative results or overtreatment. Conclusion The <b>screening</b> <b>units</b> provided very variable information, which often was biased toward optimizing participation. The high participation rate (approximately 88...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesIssues such as {{specimen}} adequacy and diagnostic yield {{have rarely}} {{been studied in}} rural regions. This study investigated specimen adequacy and the diagnostic yield of cervical smears from outreach screening services in remote regions in eastern Taiwan. Materials and methodsThere were 5670 smears from outreach screening services; 649 smears were taken in mobile <b>screening</b> van <b>units</b> or in temporary walk-in clinics. The quality, compromising factors, and positive rates of smears from mobile <b>screening</b> van <b>units</b> and temporary walk-in clinics were compared with those obtained in physician offices. ResultsThe quality of smears from physician offices {{was better than the}} quality from mobile van <b>screening</b> <b>units</b> and temporary walk-in clinics; the satisfactory rates were 72 %, 54 %, and 53 %, respectively (χ 2  =  109. 9910, p <  0. 0001; df =  4). The most important limiting factor, absence of endocervical component (ECC), was reported in 56 %, 57 %, and 73 % of suboptimal smears at physician offices, mobile van <b>screening</b> <b>units,</b> and temporary walk-in clinics, respectively (χ 2  =  25. 2780, p <  0. 001; df =  2). Poor fixation compromised 18 %, 18 %, and 14 % of smears taken at physician offices, mobile van <b>screening</b> <b>units,</b> and temporary walk-in clinics, respectively. For smears taken in physician offices, the odds ratio for positivity of suboptimal smears with ECC was nine times the odds ratio of suboptimal smears with no ECC. ConclusionThe issue of quality of specimens from outreach services in rural areas needs to be emphasized to improve the sensitivity of the test. In future studies, the difficulties that health workers encounter when taking smears in outreach services and the underlying sociocultural and demographic barriers need to be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|In {{situations}} of imperfect testing and communication, {{as suggested by}} Sah and Stiglitz (AER, 1986), organizational forms can be identified with different rules of aggregating evaluations of individual <b>screening</b> <b>units.</b> In this paper, we discuss {{the relative merits of}} polyarchical organizations versus hierarchical organizations in evaluating cost-reducing R & D projects when individual units' decision thresholds are fully endogenous. Contrary to the results of Sah and Stiglitz, we find that the relative merit of an organizational form depends on the curvature of the screening functions of the individual evaluation units. We find that for certain parameters organizations would want to implement asymmetric decision rules across <b>screening</b> <b>units.</b> This allows us to derive sufficient conditions for a polyarchy to dominate a hierarchy. We also find conditions for which the cost curves associated with the two organizational forms cross each other. In this case the optimal organizational form will depend on product market conditions and on the "lumpiness" of cost-reducing R & D. © Springer-Verlag 2000...|$|R
