25|$|Jesus {{repeatedly}} {{denounced the}} Pharisees for their {{additions to the}} Law of God. Thus, we must be extremely careful about what laws we lay down for people. Does the Bible clearly state that contraception is sinful, or that people are obligated {{to have as many}} children as possible? If the Bible does not <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> we need to fear God and be frightened of adding to His Word.|$|E
500|$|García Márquez {{believed}} {{that most of}} the information available on Bolívar was one-dimensional: [...] "No one ever said in Bolívar's biographies that he sang or that he was constipated... but historians don't <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> because they think they are not important." [...] In the epilogue to the novel, García Márquez writes that he researched the book for two years; the task was difficult, both because of his lack of experience in conducting historical research, and the lack of documentary evidence for the events of the final period of Bolívar's life.|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things?</b> Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E
60|$|Dwight looked gratified {{and pleased}} {{while his mother}} was <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{scarcely}} {{knew what}} he was <b>saying.</b> <b>These</b> <b>things</b> came from him mechanically. She looked at him. His body seemed one weapon, firm and hard against her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said the}} {{business}} {{had gone to}} the devil. We're broke busted-petered-gone up the spout." [...] He took a sort of morbid pleasure in <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Tillman's brother Kevin Tillman {{testified before}} the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that: The {{deception}} surrounding this [...] case was {{an insult to the}} family: but more importantly, its primary purpose was to deceive a whole nation. [...] We <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> with disappointment and sadness for our country. Once again, we have been used as props in a Pentagon public relations exercise.|$|E
6000|$|... "It sorts {{well with}} your ways, my lord, {{that you could}} <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> behind his back. You are practiced at {{stabbing}} men behind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I am. I am the {{representative}} of the Liberal Parliamentary Committee, and I am empowered to <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> to you, and more.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think it's a question," [...] he {{promptly}} enough made answer, [...] "of liking you {{the more}} just for your <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> You should make something," [...] he added, [...] "of my liking you." ...|$|R
60|$|I do not {{apologize}} for <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> {{for they are}} not said in the speck-hunting spirit, but {{in the spirit of}} want-to-help-if-I-can. They would be useful to me if said to me once a month, they may be useful to you, said once.|$|R
6000|$|... "Felicity," [...] he said, with emotion. Presently {{he looked}} up. [...] "It is very strange to me," [...] he said wonderingly, [...] "to find myself <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> to you who {{an hour ago}} were a {{complete}} stranger to me. But you are not like other women." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold blanched. [...] "Reggie, old man, {{you don't}} {{know what you}} are saying. You can't {{remember}} Percy. I wish you wouldn't <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> even in fun." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY MARY (shivering). You hurt me. You <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> but you {{say them}} like a king. To me it is the past that was not real.|$|E
60|$|He is a {{personal}} friend of mine, but that is nothing to the point, his history would move me to <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> without that, and I feel them too.|$|E

60|$|He was {{a little}} {{surprised}} to find himself <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> he had not intended to say, and the lighter touch he had always possessed in dealing with the other sex, making him the envied of his friends, had apparently abandoned him. He was appalled at the possibility of losing her.|$|R
60|$|AGATHA. Here comes Ernest; now {{see if you}} can <b>say</b> <b>these</b> horrid <b>things</b> to his face.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lambert again warned Serviss {{from taking}} this {{outburst}} too seriously. [...] "She is possessed, doctor. Some bad spirit is influencing her to <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> to you. She's not herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{struggled}} against {{him as she}} answered: [...] "I don't know--Yes, I do know--it ain't right for me--for you to <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> to me while I am Mart Haney's wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Grace," [...] I said, [...] "forgive me, {{but why do}} you not <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> to the Board, or to Lord Chelsford and Colonel Ray {{after they}} have heard my story?" ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY JEDBURGH. [R.] Most {{kind of you}} to <b>say</b> <b>these</b> charming <b>things</b> to me! [MRS. ERLYNNE smiles, and {{continues}} conversation.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see that," [...] agreed Mr. Hoopdriver. He MUST help her. Within {{his skull}} {{he was doing}} some {{intricate}} arithmetic with five pounds six and twopence. In some vague way he inferred from all this that Jessie was trying to escape from an undesirable marriage, but was <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> out of modesty. His circle of ideas was so limited.|$|R
5000|$|This album {{features}} The Trip, one of Art Pepper's own melodies {{written in}} 1963 while in San Quentin. Pepper likened jazz to the storytelling {{that took place}} between the prisoners. As he says in the sleeve notes, [...] "When I play,... the sound {{that comes out of}} this thing, this piece of metal is just me <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> and taking people on a trip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In your friendship, certainly. But {{facts are}} facts, Watson, and, after all, {{you are only}} a general {{practitioner}} with very limited experience and mediocre qualifications. It is painful to have to <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> but you leave me no choice." ...|$|E
6000|$|This silenced {{him for a}} few moments, then he said: [...] "I'm rather glad of that. He isn't {{anything}} like the man you thought he was--I couldn't <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> before--but he is as greedy as Alec, only not so open about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Gerald, {{let me tell}} Mamma. It {{will make}} her so happy. You are her idol, and to hear you <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> to see you look so like dear Papa, would do more for her spirits than all the doctors in England." ...|$|E
60|$|You must figure me {{a rather}} ill-dressed {{young man in}} a state of great earnestness, {{standing}} up in that shabby studio of his and <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> perhaps with some gesticulations, and Ewart with a clay-smudged face, dressed perhaps in a flannel shirt and trousers, with a pipe in his mouth, squatting philosophically at a table, working at some chunk of clay that never got beyond suggestion.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} looking imploringly into Tommy's {{face as if}} begging it to <b>say</b> that <b>these</b> <b>things</b> need not terrify her, but what he wanted was information.|$|R
60|$|She pondered {{on these}} words as she guided the horse over a crossing. And all that Austen {{had said to}} her, all {{that she had been}} {{thinking}} of for a year past, helped her to grasp their meaning. But she wondered still more at the communion which, all at once, had been established between Hilary Vane and herself, and why he was <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> to her. It was all so unreal and inexplicable.|$|R
60|$|I have {{conceived}} my 'atred of animals, monsieur, {{many years}} ago in Paris. Animals are to me a symbol for the lost dreams of youth, for ambitions foiled, for artistic impulses cruelly stifled. You are astonished. You ask why I <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> I shall tell you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{would have}} made me <b>say</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> but your own good. I have not wished to interfere; I have not wished to give you pain. I am a useless old woman. I have no {{children}} of my own. I only {{want to see you}} happy, Katharine." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>say,</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> considered, and considering, again, how prone {{poor man}} {{is to give}} way, when truly awakened, to despondings and heart misgivings, no marvel if he did sink in his mind, between {{the time of his}} first setting out, and that of his coming to his Father.|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Ewaine {{cried out}} in an {{exceedingly}} bitter voice like one in great pain: [...] "Lady, why <b>say</b> ye <b>these</b> <b>things</b> to me? I know you not." ...|$|R
25|$|And again I <b>say,</b> <b>these</b> little <b>things</b> {{that one}} does - considerate, compassionate, courageous - I guess it's pretty hard {{to be able to}} realize the impact they have.|$|R
6000|$|... "And believe me, I {{know this}} game {{better than you}} do. It's of no use <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> No man should ever foul his own nest. Give me a little drop more brandy, Trigger, and then I'll get myself to bed." [...] When he was gone, they all sang Griffenbottom's praises. In staunch pluck, good humour, and manly fighting, no man was his superior. [...] "Give and take,--the English bull-dog all over. I do like old Griffenbottom," [...] said Spiveycomb, the paper-maker.|$|R
