2500|$|Fischer–Tropsch iron {{catalysts}} need alkali {{promotion to}} attain high activity and stability (e.g. 0.5 wt% [...] ). Addition of Cu for reduction promotion, addition of , [...] for structural promotion {{and maybe some}} manganese can be applied for <b>selectivity</b> <b>control</b> (e.g. high olefinicity). The working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron. With iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued. One direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process (Sasol–Synthol process). Due to the relatively high reaction temperature (approx. 340nbsp&°C), the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions. The catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small (particle diameter 100nbsp&µm) and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation. Thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite (plus promoters) after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate. For maximising the overall gasoline yield, C3 and C4 alkenes have been oligomerized at Sasol. However, recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in, e.g., polymerization processes is advantageous today. The second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low reaction temperature {{where most of the}} hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions. Typically, such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions. A high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores. The main product fraction then is a paraffin wax, which is refined to marketable wax materials at Sasol; however, it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel. Thus, iron catalysts are very flexible.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a comprehensive study into <b>selectivity</b> <b>control</b> over electrokinetic chromatography (EKC) {{systems for the}} determination of small organic anions and cations using various additives. For the separation of anions an electrolyte system comprising a cationic soluble polymer (poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride), PDDAC) and a neutral ß-cyclodextrin (ß-CD) as pseudo-stationary phases was used. The separation mechanism {{was a combination of}} electrophoresis, ion-exchange (IE) interactions with PDDAC, and hydrophobic interactions with ß-CD. The extent of each chromatographic interaction was independently variable, allowing for control of the separation selectivity of the system. Various cationic analytes were also examined, including opiate alkaloids, aromatic bases and amino acids. In the case of the opiate alkaloids (morphine, thebaine, 10 -hydroxy thebaine, codeine, oripavine and laudanine) a system utilising sulfated-ß-cyclodextrin (s-ß-C:P) as a pseudo-stationary phase was used. Cation-exchange interactions between the cationic analytes and the anionic s-ß-CD (7 - 11 moles of sulfate groups per mole CD) were found to be the predominant separation mechanism. The separation of a series of aromatic bases was achieved utilising an electrolyte system comprising an anionic soluble polymer (polyvinylsulfonic acid, PVS) and ß-CD as pseudo-stationary phases. The separation mechanism was based on a combination of electrophoresis, IE interactions with PVS, and hydrophobic interactions with ß-CD. The extent of each chromatographic interaction was independently variable, allowing for control of the separation selectivity of the system. The IE and the hydrophobic teractions could be varied by changing the concentrations of PVS and ß-CD, respectively. Additionally, mobilities of the bases could be controlled by varying pH, due to their large range of pKa values. <b>Selectivity</b> <b>control</b> of the enantiomeric separation of the three aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan) was demonstrated utilising temperature and s-ß-CD and dextran sulfate as pseudo-stationary phases. Two systems were explored using s-ß-CD as the chiral selector. In these systems either temperature or the addition of dextran sulfate was used to increase the <b>selectivity</b> <b>control.</b> The possibility of the simultaneous separation of anions and cations was demonstrated using a series of aromatic carboxylic acids, sulfonates and opiates as analytes. Separation was achieved using electrokinetic chromatography employing a mixture of PDDAC and the amphiphilic anion hexanesulfonate as pseudo-stationary phases. In this system, the PDDAC pseudo-stationary phase interacted with the anionic analytes, whereas the hexanesulfonate interacted with the cationic analytes. A further interaction between the combined PDDAC-hexanesulfonate complex and the more hydrophobic analytes was also evident. Mathematical modelling based on physical equilibrium and artificial neural networks was also undertaken, with the models successfully describing each system (r 2 > 0. 98 for predicted versus observed migration times).

Cytochrome P 450 mono-oxygenases are involved in diverse types of regio- and stereoselective oxidations, and represent a promising biocatalyst to address this challenge.
