40|$|Abstract – A {{credible}} {{reconstruction of}} a continuous two-dimensional earth surface potential distribution from a discrete set of noisy samples {{is essential for}} correct identification of regions with high values of touch and step voltages, {{as a part of}} grounding grid safety assessment procedure. This research provides some new and useful insights on the earth surface potential distribution reconstruction quality, focused mainly on the most commonly used radial basis function (RBF) interpolation kernels. The RBF approach to reconstruction was chosen because of the underlaying algorithm simplicity {{and the fact that it}} provides natural mathematical framework for smooth interpolation and approximation of potential fields from irregular sampling sets. Since the quality of potential distribution reconstruction is heavily influenced by the choice of interpolation method, <b>sampling</b> <b>layout</b> and a priori knowledge of the grounding grid structure under test, this research also elaborates some heuristic guidelines for planning proper sampling procedure and illustrates some examples of reconstructed functional shape distortions due to poor <b>sampling</b> <b>layouts...</b>|$|R

Conover and Iman provided a review of the four main types of rank transformations (RT). One method replaces each original data value by its rank (from 1 for the smallest to N for the largest).

Their concurrence promises the implementation of interesting magnetic structures like skyrmions in future memory and logic devices. The complex interplay of various effects originating from the spin-orbit coupling and their dependencies on the microstructural details of the material system mandates a holistic characterization of its properties. In this PhD thesis, a comprehensive study of the spin-orbit effects in a chromium oxide/cobalt/platinum trilayer sample series is presented. The determination of the complete micromagnetic parameter set is based on a developed measurement routine that utilizes quasistatic methods. The unambiguous quantification of all relevant constants is crucial for the modeling of the details of magnetic structures in the system. In this context the necessity of a strict distinction of magnetic objects, that are stabilized by magnetostatics or the DMI, was revealed. Furthermore, a <b>sample</b> <b>layout</b> was developed to allow for the simultaneous quantification of the magnitudes of SOTs and MR effects from nonlinear magnetotransport measurements. In conjunction with a structural characterization, the dominating dependence of the effect magnitudes on microstructural details of the systems is concluded.

40|$|RNA {{sequencing}} (RNA-seq) {{is widely}} used for RNA quantification in the environmental, biological and medical sciences. It enables the description of genome-wide patterns of expression and the identification of regulatory interactions and networks. The aim of RNA-seq data analyses is to achieve rigorous quantification of genes/transcripts to allow a reliable prediction of differential expression (DE), despite variation in levels of noise and inherent biases in sequencing data. This can be especially challenging for datasets in which gene expression differences are subtle, as in the behavioural transcriptomics test dataset from D. melanogaster that we used here. We investigated the power of existing approaches for quality checking mRNA-seq data and explored additional, quantitative quality checks. To accommodate nested, multi-level experimental designs, we incorporated <b>sample</b> <b>layout</b> into our analyses. We employed a subsampling without replacement-based normalization and an identification of DE that accounted for the hierarchy and amplitude of effect sizes within samples, then evaluated the resulting differential expression call in comparison to existing approaches.

Since all present wires use a solid-state diffusion reaction to form the A 15 layers, inhomogeneities with respect to Sn content are inevitable, in contrast to some previously studied homogeneous samples. Our study emphasizes the effects that these inevitable inhomogeneities have on the field-temperature phase boundary. The property inhomogeneities are extracted from field-dependent resistive transitions which we find broaden with increasing inhomogeneity.

40|$|Traditional market {{plays an}} {{important}} role in ancient urban life, especially in heritage cities such as Casbah, Algiers. Some traditional markets however are frequently criticized as inconvenient for users and consequently not well used. Improving performance of traditional markets is therefore a critical issue faced by the city planners and designers. Conventional model, which is described mainly in respect of maximum user’s capacity or service radius is inadequate to give an account of the issue, hence a new theoretical model is needed for both research and operational purposes. This study, accordingly, indicates an alternative model approach and seeks an explanation from the urban morphology and the way it conditions pedestrian movement. Through investigating the relationship between urban morphology and pedestrian movement based on the Casbah city of Algiers, which particularly epitomizes various urban grids that have different consequences on the access and use of traditional market. The research first formulates a new conceptual model by synthesizing the findings of previous studies on relevant subjects. A new theoretical model for the traditional market is described mainly in terms of its permeable and visual links to overall urban layout. The study then models the urban morphology and pedestrian movement into a system of linear spaces by applying the techniques of space syntax. The interrelationships of these linear spaces are subsequently described by configurational variables called integration to capture their relatives within the overall layout. The implication for pedestrian movement is also analysed by correlating the configurational variables with the observed encounter rates. Finally, the analyses were compared with the observed level of use to identify the describe relationship between configurational (both physical and visual), pedestrian movement and the level of structural stability and morphogenesis of traditional market through applying the Catastrophe Theory coined by René Thom. The analysis of traditional market place in the Casbah city has revealed several major findings. Firstly, different morphological development have varying influences on the traditional market, especially their influence varies between one layout pattern to the others. Among these properties, it is their strategic location within the overall layout that plays a consistent role in their level of use. By contrast, the visual place is proven to be not relevant to the use of spaces in the <b>sample</b> <b>layout</b> patterns. The structural stability and morphogenesis, however, is proven to have a significant effect on the use density inside the spaces. While in the areas with diffused movement pattern, the interrelationship between urban morphology and pedestrian movement tend to be vanished. In light of these findings, the research has not only shaped a new approach to investigating place related issues in urban design fields, but also has revealed various data that are likely to be used to improve the performance of traditional market place, mainly in the urban areas of Algiers...|$|E
