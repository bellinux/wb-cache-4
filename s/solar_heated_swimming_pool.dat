40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{theoretical}} model is presented concerning the various energy fluxes in a <b>solar</b> <b>heated</b> outdoor <b>swimming</b> <b>pool,</b> with a bare or covered surface. The analysis considers the instantaneous energy balance using actual climatological data, special attention being focussed on setting up equations for {{the calculation of}} the turbulent heat-mass transfer energy fluxes. Thus, the net heat loss can be calculated under constant water temperature conditions, {{paving the way for}} the determination of the needed <b>solar</b> collector <b>heat</b> power and/or conventional heating. A computer program is written and developed to implement the analysis. To check the validity of the model, experimental work has been carried out at the Athens Olympic (25 × 50 m) <b>swimming</b> <b>pool,</b> which is <b>heated</b> by a <b>solar</b> collector array consisting of flat plate plastic panels. A vast monitoring campaign is undertaken, involving the installation of the sensing instruments and the data acquisition and reduction system. All the relevant parameters were continuously recorded and conveniently averaged over 1 h intervals. For the first year of operation, the agreement between experimental results and theoretical calculations (on an hourly basis) is promising for the days tested. From a comparison of the magnitudes of the individual flux losses, it is concluded that the higher loss contributor is the evaporative one. © 1987...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{use of this}} {{technology}} is in residential buildings where the demand for hot water has a large impact on energy bills. This generally means a situation with a large family, or {{a situation in which}} the hot water demand is excessive due to frequent laundry washing. Commercial applications include laundromats, car washes, military laundry facilities and eating establishments. The technology can also be used for space heating if the building is located off-grid or if utility power is subject to frequent outages. <b>Solar</b> water <b>heating</b> systems are most likely to be cost effective for facilities with water heating systems that are expensive to operate, or with operations such as laundries or kitchens that require large quantities of hot water. Unglazed liquid collectors are commonly used to <b>heat</b> water for <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> but can also be applied to large scale water pre-heating. When loads are large relative to available collector area the bulk of the water heating can be done at low temperature, lower than at <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> temperatures where unglazed collectors are well established in the marketplace as the right choice. Because these collectors need not withstand high temperatures, they can use less expensive materials such as plastic or rubber. Many unglazed collectors are made of polypropylene and must be drained fully to avoid freeze damage when air temperatures drop below 44F on clear nights. A smaller but growing percentage of unglazed collectors are flexible meaning they can withstand water freezing solid inside their absorber. The freeze concern only need be the water filled piping and collector manifolds in a hard freeze condition. Unglazed solar hot water systems should be installed to [...] "drainback" [...] to a storage tank whenever solar radiation is insufficient. There are no thermal shock concerns with unglazed systems. Commonly used in <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> <b>heating</b> since <b>solar</b> energy's early beginnings, unglazed <b>solar</b> collectors <b>heat</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> water directly without the need for antifreeze or heat exchangers. Hot water <b>solar</b> systems require <b>heat</b> exchangers due to contamination possibilities and in the case of unglazed collectors, the pressure difference between the solar working fluid (water) and the load (pressurized cold city water). Large scale unglazed solar hot water heaters like the one at the Minoru Aquatic Center in Richmond BC [...] operate at lower temperatures than evacuated tube or boxed and glazed collector systems so they require larger more expensive heat exchangers but all other components including vented storage tanks and uninsulated plastic PVC piping reduce costs of this alternative dramatically compared to the higher temperature collector types. When heating hot water we are actually heating cold to warm and warm to hot. We can heat cold to warm as efficiently with unglazed collectors as we can heat warm to hot with high temperature collectors ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech(Chemical engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2000 The {{demand for}} pool heating has {{increased}} dramatically {{over the last few}} years. This is ascribed to the idea that a <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> is expensive and can only be used for four months of the year. Therefore, a need for a relatively inexpensive <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> system, capable of heating pool water to comfortable temperatures for an extended period, does exist. The least expensive <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> system for <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> <b>heating</b> on the market in South Africa is in the order of R 11000. This is a fixed system, usually mounted on the roof of a house. In order {{to ensure the safety of}} minors, a safety net or sail must be installed. This is an additional cost, which approximates R 1500, yielding a total cost for safety and heating in the order of R 12500. Copper pipes packed in black material are utilised in these conventional heating systems, and it is the cost of this good heat conductor that makes these units expensive. In this study an alternative pool heating system constructed of PVC was investigated. The system is designed to be flexible, mobile, act as a safety mechanism and absorbs the maximum amount of solar energy available. Dark blue material as opposed to black PVC was selected for aesthetic reasons at the expense of maximum efficiency. The material strength was tested as well as the strength of adhesion. The influence of factors such as exposure to the sun and the effect of water containing chlorine and acid on the material were evaluated. Also, various means of channelling the water through the system for increased efficiency was investigated. A pilot model was constructed and its performance evaluated. It has been concluded that the alternative approach provides effective heating at a lower cost than current systems. Also, the durability of the design was found to be acceptable...|$|R
