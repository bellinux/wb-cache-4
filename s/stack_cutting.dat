40|$|Runtime stacks are {{critical}} components of any modern software — {{they are used}} to implement powerful control structures such as function call/return, <b>stack</b> <b>cutting</b> and unwinding, coroutines, and thread context switch. Stack operations, however, are very hard to reason about: there are no known formal specifications for certifying C-style setjmp/longjmp, <b>stack</b> <b>cutting</b> and unwinding, or weak continuations (in C [...] ). In many proof-carrying code (PCC) systems, return code pointers and exception handlers are treated as general first-class functions (as in continuation-passing style) even though both should have more limited scopes. In this paper we show that stack-based control abstractions follow a much simpler pattern than general first-class code pointers. We present a simple but flexible Hoare-style framework for modular verification of assembly code with all kinds of stack-based control abstractions, including function call/return, tail call, setjmp/longjmp, weak continuation, <b>stack</b> <b>cutting,</b> stack unwinding, multi-return function call, coroutines, and thread context switch. Instead of presenting a specific logic for each control structure, we develop all reasoning systems as instances of a generic framework. This allows program modules and their proofs developed in different PCC systems to be linked together. Our system is fully mechanized. We give the complete soundness proof and a full verification of several examples in the Coq proof assistant...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} approaches to Java acceleration in embedded systems is a bytecode-to-C ahead-of-time compiler (AOTC). It improves the performance of a Java virtual machine (JVM) by translating bytecode into C code, which is then compiled into machine code via an existing C compiler. One important design issue in AOTC is efficient exception handling. Since the excepting point and the exception handler may locate in different methods on a call stack, control transfer between them should be streamlined, while an exception would be an “exceptional ” event, so it should not slow down normal execution paths. Previous AOTCs often employed <b>stack</b> <b>cutting</b> based on a setjmp() /longjmp(), which we found is involved with too much overheads. This paper proposes a simpler solution based on an exception check after each method call, merged with garbage collection check for reducing its overhead.

40|$|Optimizing {{exception}} handling {{is critical for}} programs that frequently throw exceptions. We observed {{that there are many}} such exception-intensive programs in various categories of Java programs. There are two commonly used {{exception handling}} techniques, stack unwinding and <b>stack</b> <b>cutting.</b> Stack unwinding optimizes the normal path, while <b>stack</b> <b>cutting</b> optimizes the exception handling path. However, there has been no single exception handling technique to optimize both paths. We propose a new technique called Exception-Directed Optimization (Edo), which optimizes exception-intensive programs without slowing down exception-minimal programs. Edo, a feedback-directed dynamic optimization, consists of three steps, exception path profiling, exception path inlining, and throw elimination. Exception path profiling attempts to detect hot exception paths. Exception path inlining compiles the catching method in a hot exception path, inlining the rest of methods in the path. Throw elimination replaces a throw with the explicit control flow to the corresponding catch. We implemented Edo in IBM's production Justin -Time compiler, and obtained the experimental results, which show that, in SPECjvm 98, it improved performance of exception-intensive programs by up to 18. 3 % without affecting performance of exception-minimal programs at all...|$|E

Few clinical assessments measure the abilities of the UEs to work together; rather, they assess unilateral function and compare it between affected and unaffected UEs.

This study examines the validity of an innovative approach to assess real-world bilateral UE activity using accelerometry. Methods: Seventy-four neurologically intact adults completed ten tasks (donning/doffing shoes, grooming, <b>stacking</b> boxes, <b>cutting</b> playdough, folding towels, writing, unilateral sorting, bilateral sorting, unilateral typing, and bilateral typing) while wearing accelerometers on both wrists. Two variables, the Bilateral Magnitude and Magnitude Ratio, were derived from accelerometry data to distinguish between high- and low-intensity tasks, and between bilateral and unilateral tasks.

40|$|Abstract. Grain {{refinement}} {{process can}} improve {{not only the}} strength, but also the forming characteristics of metals. In this paper, the free form forging process, which is broadly used in metal working factory, is considered to develop a multi-forging process, which can be served as a grain refinement process. Thereby, a bulk metal is plastically deformed repeatedly according {{to the principle of}} thermomechanical process for grain refinement. For each forging or deformation step, a flat punch is traveled onto the pre-heated material, so that the material height is to be halved. And the forged metal should then be folded or <b>stacked</b> after <b>cutting</b> and so prepared for the next deformation step, that the material will have the same height as in the previous step. However, before folding or stacking, the bulk metal must be quenched in water to hold the microstructure in the deformed metal. After folding or stacking, the material will be heated again to the forging temperature. In this paper, the commercial finite element code DEFORMTM is used to simulate such a grain refinement process in a plane strain state, in which a nickel alloy 718, 50 mm both in width and in thickness, is heated to 1000 °C and forged with a punch at 1000 °C. For the input data, especially for recrystallization processes, some stated in literatures are applied in this study.

40|$|This {{investigation}} applies architectural {{ideas of}} mass-customised difference and repetition, and tests them within the engineering paradigm of very tall timber buildings – taller than {{have ever been}} erected {{in the history of}} architecture. According to Edward Glaeser’s book, Triumph of the City, the cheapest way to deliver new housing (at least in the USA) is in theform of mass-produced two-storey homes, which typically cost only about $ 84 per square foot to erect. While building up is more costly, many of the costs – such as hiring a fancy, big-name architect – are fixed and won’t increase with the height of the building. In fact, once you’ve reached a height of about seven floors, building up has its own economic logic, since those fixed costs can be spread over more living units, writes Glaeser, before continuing: “The actual marginal cost of adding an extra square foot of living space at the topof a skyscraper in New York is typically less than $ 400 ”. If to this we add all the financial advantages of using stacked structures made from engineered timber – lower construction costs due to the simple geometry, and the speed oferection (four men built the nine stories of our primary precedent, the Stadthaus building in London, in nine weeks, reducing the entire building process from 72 weeks to 49); larger savings on the entire building (again, the Stadthaus came in at 15 percent less expensive than a concrete equivalent); and lower costs for transportation and foundations due to the lighterweight of the material – it soon becomes clear that timber developments make financial sense. Timber can also be precisely incorporated into different proprietary building systems: throughout this project, the systems of three Swedish manufacturers (Martinsons, Moelven, and Byggma) are used as structural frameworks. The trio of multi-storey timber buildings isbased on conceptual notions of <b>stacking,</b> <b>cutting,</b> and slotting, respectively. These simple formal ideas (a variation on Deleuze’s thoughts on difference and repetition) are interpreted to align with the fundamental material logic of wood, {{as well as with the}} specific ramifications of these existing timber building systems. Methodologically, these buildings utilise a primary organisational principle to inform its volumetric massing, circulatory planning, arrangement of living units, fenestration configuration, and so on, while allowing for other principles to guide further aspects so as to avoid what Reiser + Umemoto call The Abuse of the Diagram: “Any one organizational model has limits. The ambition to carry a diagram through all levels of a single architecturalproject is exhaustive and reductive. To have one model determine all aspects of design is to simplify what is in reality a richer, more heterogeneous complexity. A true multiplicity requires that many different models be coordinated. A single model relentlessly deployed at all scales emerges as merely formal. ”Having said that, an initial investigation into simple formal moves at the outset of a project often yields a plethora of potential trajectories created by the self-imposed constraints that are carried through by the limiting conceptual framework we choose to adopt. There appears to be a certain psychology of limitation that are highly beneficial for devising new ideas, be theyformal, spatial, or haptically driven. As neuroscience journalist Jonah Lehrer puts it in his book Imagine: How Creativity Works: “ [...] . the imagination is unleashed by constraints. You break out of the box by stepping into shackles”.

Burr height (up to 0. 5 mm) was observed to be greater at the hole exit (aluminium) compared to hole entry (titanium) while delamination was significantly reduced when machining CFRP in the stack configuration as opposed to a standalone arrangement. Spiral shaped continuous aluminium swarf was prevalent while both short and long helical chips were found with the titanium material when cutting wet.

Accumulative Roll Bonding (ARB) is a {{technique}} of grain refinement by severe plastic deformation, which involves multiple repetitions of surface treatment, <b>stacking,</b> rolling, and <b>cutting.</b> The rolling with 50 % reduction in thickness bonds the sheets. After several cycles, ultrafine-grained (UFG) materials are produced. Since ARB enables the production of large amounts of UFG materials, its adoption into industrial practice is favoured. ARB has been successfully used for preparation of UFG sheets from different ingot cast aluminium alloys. Twin-roll casting (TRC) is a cost and energy effective method for manufacturing aluminium sheets. Fine particles and small grain size are intrinsic for TRC sheets making them good starting materials for ARB.

40|$|AbstractOwing {{to their}} {{enhanced}} mechanical properties and improved structural functions, {{the use of}} hybrid CFRP/Ti stacks (a sandwich of both CFRP laminate and Ti alloy) has experienced an increasing trend in modern aerospace industry. The emergence of such composite-to-metal alliance, however, poses a series of new challenges to the manufacturing sectors for high-quality finishing of the material-made components. The key machining problems usually arise from the disparate natures of the stacked constituents (CFRP laminate and Ti alloy) and their correspondingly poor machinability. To study the fundamental cutting characteristics of the bi-material assembly, this paper presents an experimental study concerning the machinability evaluation of the hybrid CFRP/Ti <b>stacks.</b> An orthogonal <b>cutting</b> configuration (OCC) derived from the real manufacturing operation was adopted to finalize the CFRP/Ti cutting comprehension by using the superior polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tipped tools. The cutting trials were performed under the reasonable cutting sequence strategy of CFRP→ Ti as pointed out by most researches. The key cutting responses including cutting forces, machined surface quality and tool wear mechanisms were precisely addressed versus the utilized cutting conditions. The experimental results highlight that a parametric combination of high cutting speed (vc) and low feed rate (f) often facilitates the reduction of cutting forces and induced damage extents. The basic damage modes promoted on the machined CFRP/Ti surfaces are observed to be fiber pullout, resin loss, surface cavity, deformation of feed marks and re-deposited materials. Moreover, the key wear mechanisms governing the PCD tool cutting are confirmed to be crater wear and flank wear, while the tool failure mode is edge chipping. To ensure excellent machined surface quality, a stringent control of tool wear should be implemented when <b>cutting</b> hybrid CFRP/Ti <b>stacks...</b>|$|R

Once ignited, the tissue paper floated off haphazardly from table to table, setting off fires as it went. In the aftermath of the tragic event, many workers died. Many workers had died from inhaling thick smoke and from burning in the fire. The fire started to spread, and people began to jump out of the building because the stairway was blocked and the elevators were not functioning properly. Workers piled up at the entrance of the stairway because the stairway (which had no landing) was too dark for one to see his or her way down the steps. Many were crushed by the door because of the mass panic and fear from the people running to the dark stairway. The other entrance of the stairway was locked by management to prevent workers from stealing company garments. As for the elevators, the owners and their family went into the elevator, which only could have held twelve people and escaped the building. In request of the owner, they told the elevator operator to send the elevator back up; however, by the time the elevator made its way back, the fire was fully engaged on the eighth floor and quickly spreading to the ninth. This had forced the workers to jump out the windows and jump into the elevator shaft that was nine stories down. Although there was the option of using the fire escape {{to get out of the}} burning building, only few did manage to escape through it. With many workers going through the fire escape, the fire escape eventually collapsed. Prior to the fire escape collapsing, people still could not make it to the ground safely, because the ladder from the fire escape did not reach the ground, nor was it close enough for people to jump down, which led to many more deaths.|$|R

40|$|Solid {{freeform}} fabrication is the near-net-shape manufacturing of components by sequentially stacking thin layers of material until complicated three dimensional shapes are produced. The operation is computer controlled and requires no molds. This exciting {{new field of}} technology provides engineers {{with the ability to}} rapidly produce prototype parts directly from CAD drawings and oftentimes little or no machining is necessary after fabrication. Techniques for {{freeform fabrication}} with several types of plastics and metals are already quite advanced and maybe reviewed in references 1 and 2. Very complicated plastic models can be fabricated by stereolithography, selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, or three-dimensional ink jet printing. Metals may be freeformed by the LENS{trademark} technique and porous ceramic bodies by three dimensional printing into a porous powder bed. However, methods for freeform fabrication that utilize particulate slurries to build dense ceramics and composites are not as well developed. The techniques that are being developed for the freeform fabrication of dense structural ceramics primarily revolve around the sequential layering of ceramic loaded polymers or waxes. Laminated Object Manufacturing and CAM-LEM processing use controlled <b>stacking</b> and laser <b>cutting</b> of ceramic tapes [2, 3]. Similar to fused deposition modeling, ceramic loaded polymer/wax filaments are being used for the fused deposition of ceramics [2, 4]. Extrusion freeform fabrication uses high pressure extrusion to deposit layers of ceramic loaded polymer/wax systems[1]. Modified stereolithographic techniques are also being developed using ceramic loaded ultraviolet curable resins [2]. Pre-sintered parts made with any of these techniques typically have 40 - 55 vol. % polymeric binder. In this regard, these techniques are analogous to powder injection molding of ceramics. Very long and complicated burnout heat treatments are necessary to produce a dense ceramic, free of organics. Heating rates of 0. 2 degrees Celsius per minute are common. [5] Thus, while a part maybe rapidly prototype within a few hours, it takes several days to densify. In contrast, robocasting is a freeform fabrication technique developed at Sandia National Labs that utilizes particulate slurries but does not require organic binders. Since binder burnout is not an issue, a dense ceramic part maybe freeformed, dried, and sintered in less than 24 hours. In some regards, robocasting is analogous to the ceramic near-net-shape processing techniques, slip casting and gel casting [6]; however, robocasting is moldless and fabrication times can be quicker...|$|R
