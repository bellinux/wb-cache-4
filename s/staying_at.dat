40|$|This study {{compared}} the gender roles {{and attitudes toward}} women‟s and men‟s social roles of <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home fathers and employed fathers recruited on the Internet. The relationship between gender roles and attitudes toward women‟s and men‟s social roles on reasons for becoming a <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home father were also investigated. It was predicted that <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home fathers would endorse more traditionally feminine characteristics for themselves and would have more nontraditional attitudes toward men‟s and women‟s social roles than employed fathers. In addition, {{it was predicted that}} fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home for practical reasons (i. e. lost job) would be more traditional in their gender role attitudes than fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home for other reasons (i. e. really wanted to care for the children). Although <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home and employed fathers reported having similar feminine and masculine characteristics, <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home fathers reported having less traditional gender role attitudes than employed fathers. Biosocial theory (Eagly & Wood, 1999) suggests that <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home fathers may have less traditional attitudes about gender roles because the gender role they are acting out is a non-traditional role for men. <b>Stay</b> <b>at</b> home fathers reported that they really wanted to stay home with their children more than any other reason, whereas the least reported reason for choosing to stay home was having a child with special needs. Contrary to a prediction based on evolutionary psychology, <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home and employed fathers also reported that their children resembled them to the same degree. The results of this study will contribute further information about a group of fathers that have been under-studied and may also provide helpful information to support groups for <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home and employed fathers.
