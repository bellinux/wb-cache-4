The drag forces are responsible for driving particles along the ﬂow streamlines, whereas the inertial forces are responsible for the lateral migration of particles across the ﬂow streamlines. The parabolic nature of the laminar velocity proﬁle in Poiseuille ﬂow produces a shear-induced inertial lift force that drives particles towards the channel walls.

In addition, {{there are two}} types of plants with different biochemical pathways; the C3 carbon fixation, where the isotope <b>separation</b> <b>effect</b> is more pronounced, C4 carbon fixation, where the heavier 13C is less depleted, and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) plants, where the effect is similar but less pronounced than with C4 plants. Isotopic fractionation in plants is caused by physical (slower diffusion of 13C in plant tissues due to increased atomic weight) and biochemical (preference of 12C by two enzymes: RuBisCO and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) factors. The different isotope ratios for the two kinds of plants propagate through the food chain, thus it is possible to determine if the principal diet of a human or an animal consists primarily of C3 plants (rice, wheat, soybeans, potatoes) or C4 plants (corn, or corn-fed beef) by isotope analysis of their flesh and bone collagen (however, to obtain more accurate determinations, carbon isotopic fractionation must be also taken into account, since several studies have reported significant 13C discrimination during biodegradation of simple and complex substrates).Within C3 plants processes regulating changes in δ13C are well understood, particularly at the leaf level, but also during wood formation. Many recent studies combine leaf level isotopic fractionation with annual patterns of wood formation (i.e. tree ring δ13C) to quantify the impacts of climatic variations and atmospheric composition on physiological processes of individual trees and forest stands. The next phase of understanding, in terrestrial ecosystems at least, seems to be the combination of multiple isotopic proxies to decipher interactions between plants, soils and the atmosphere, and predict how changes in land use will affect climate change.Similarly, marine fish contain more 13C than freshwater fish, with values approximating the C4 and C3 plants respectively.|$|E

Among well-known energy separation effects noted there are Ranque-Hilsch vortex tubes, Hartmann-Sprenger resonance tubes, pulsating tubes and some others. A working principle of device under study is based on thermal interaction between subsonic and supersonic gas flows through a heat-conducting division wall. This energy separation method was proposed by academician Leontiev and was patented in 1998.

Experiment was carried out in the air prototype of energy separation device with supersonic flow Mach numbers 1. 9 and 2. 5, stagnation temperatures 40 °С and 70 °С, and for uni-flow and counter-flow air moving direction in subsonic and supersonic channels. Shock waves have been generated by means of circular ribs in supersonic channel of energy separation device.

Murray's law {{has been found to be}} true in blood macrocirculation, but not in microcirculation. In 2005, Alarcón et al took into account the non monotonous dependence of viscosity on vessel radius - Fåhræus-Lindqvist effect - due to phase <b>separation</b> <b>effect</b> of blood.

The hypersonic turbulent flow experiments needed are inherently difficult to design because of the high sensitivity of the macroscopic flow parameters which cause the turbulent flow processes. Hence computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a useful tool for the design and characterisation of models in hypersonic flows before model construction. One of the greatest challenges however is to ensure that the flow is being modeled accurately. In this paper, a commercial code has been used to model an experiment performed in a small reflected shock tunnel using a Mach 8. 65 condition. The research being carried out in this facility is concerned with separation due to incident shock wave/turbulent boundary interactions in hypersonic ducted flows.
