50|$|Deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> {{which involve}} illegal, nonconsensual, and sadistic themes. While people with {{paraphilia}} have deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies,</b> it <b>is</b> {{important to note}} that deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> not atypical and/or paraphilic. DSM-5 defines paraphilia as intense and persistent atypical preferences for sexual activities or targets like spanking, whipping, binding with erotic targets like children, animals, and/or rubber etc. While DSM-5 recognizes that paraphillias don’t have to be pathological, psychiatrists still find it difficult to differentiate between paraphilic interests and paraphilic disorders, because the concept of normal of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>is</b> subjective. It is based on factors like history, society, culture and politics. For example, masturbation, oral, anal and homosexual sex were illegal in some American states and even considered to be paraphilic disorders in earlier DSM revisions.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> {{distinct}} from limerent <b>fantasies.</b> Limerent <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> rooted in reality and is intrusive rather than voluntary. <b>Sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> under {{more or less}} voluntary control and may involve strangers, imaginary individuals, and situations that could not take place. Limerence elevates body temperature and increases relaxation, a sensation of viewing the world with rose-tinted glasses, leading to a greater receptiveness to sexuality, and to daydreaming.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> {{increasingly}} {{viewed as}} a necessary component to a healthy relationship. Accordingly, theorists have argued that <b>fantasies</b> may <b>be</b> used to encourage and promote sexual pleasure between partners. Researchers have additionally found {{a positive correlation between}} instances of sexual fantasising and increased orgasm, arousal, and general contentment. The relative benefits of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> summarised in a statement by Stroller; “sexual fantasises are a private pornography in which we rehearse over and over again needs that are nearly impossible to fulfil in actual sex”. Sexual fantasising therefore allows an individual to fulfil desires that cannot be realistically achieved. In this sense, researchers assert that fantasising about extra-marital, or multiple-partner sex is positively correlated with long-term partnerships. As such, <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> viewed as means to combat sexual dissatisfaction.|$|R

50|$|Deviant and sadistic <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to be the underlying risk factors for sexual crimes. 70-85% of sexual offenders extensively engage in deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies,</b> and certain themes can be attributed to types of sex crimes. For example, serial sexual murderers have more rape <b>fantasies</b> than non-serial <b>sexual</b> murderers and 82% of offenders that use a weapon engage violent <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies.</b> Offenders that report deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> have also <b>been</b> found to be more dangerous than offenders that do not.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> nearly universal, being {{reported}} in many societies across the globe. However, {{because of the}} nature of some fantasies, the actual putting of such <b>fantasies</b> into action <b>is</b> far less common, due to cultural, social, moral, and religious constraints. In some cases, even a discussion by a person of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>is</b> subject to social taboos and inhibitions. Some people find it convenient to act out <b>fantasies</b> through <b>sexual</b> roleplay. A <b>fantasy</b> may <b>be</b> a positive or negative experience, or even both. It may be in response to a past experience and can influence future sexual behavior. A person may not wish to enact a <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> in real life, and since the process is entirely imaginary, they are not limited to acceptable or practical fantasies, which can provide information on the psychological processes behind sexual behavior.|$|R
50|$|Sex {{differences}} {{have also been}} found with regard to paraphilic fantasies (i.e. those which {{are considered to be}} atypical). Examples of paraphilic <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> include incest, voyeurism, transvestic fetishism, sex with animals (see zoophilia), and pedophilia. One study reported that over 60% of men admitted to a <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> involving intercourse with an underage partner, and 33% of males reported rape fantasies. Along with other <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies,</b> it <b>is</b> thought that the age of occurrence for paraphilic <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>is</b> usually before 18 years, although this has been found to vary according to the specific <b>fantasy</b> at hand.Unusual <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> more common in men, with fantasies of urinating on their sexual partner and being urinated on being significantly higher among males. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) states that paraphilias are rarely diagnosed in women, with the exception of sexual masochism. Furthermore, sexual arousal {{has been found to be}} greater in men than in women when asked to entertain the thought of engaging in paraphilic sexual activity. It may, however, be the case that paraphilias are reported less often in women because they are under-researched in women. Paraphilic <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> in females include sexual sadism, exhibitionism, and pedophilia.|$|R

50|$|A {{person may}} {{have no desire to}} carry out a fantasy; people often use fantasies to help plan out future <b>sexual</b> encounters. <b>Fantasies</b> occur in all {{individuals}} and at any time of the day, although {{it has been suggested that}} they are more common among frequent daydreamers. <b>Sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> frequent during masturbation, although this may be truer for men than for women.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose and}} {{function}} of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> explained rather differently from an evolutionary perspective. Bowlby’s (1969/1982) attachment theory asserts {{that the absence of}} adequate attachment figures can devastate self-esteem. It is suggested that more anxiously attached individuals use sex to attain emotional security. Accordingly, they might engage in sex through a longing for sexual intimacy, and increase the frequency of sexual behaviour under conditions that challenge the status of their relationship. Contrastingly, the avoidant attachment type is apprehensive about the intimacy posed by sexual relations, and will take active measures to avoid feelings of closeness. Patterns of sexual behaviour include emotion free sex with casual partners, engaging in sex to promote oneself, and feelings of detachment during intercourse. <b>Sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> likely to follow attachment-related themes. It is noted that anxious attachment individuals report significantly more instances of sexual fantasising, and portray the self as feeble, dependable and powerless. Avoidant attachment types report fantasies in which relationships are regarded as cold, unfeeling and impersonal. As such, <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> serve the primary function of fulfilling interpersonal goals through the mode of mental representation.|$|R

A lot of studies have also found that “atypical” <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> quite common as indulging in greater varieties of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> increases sex-life satisfaction. For example, in 2011 study found that {{over half of the}} older men in Berlin had “atypical” <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> with 21.8% of them having sadistic fantasies-a prerequisite for sexual murders. Another study found that dominance and submission themes were extremely popular in pornographic searches.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{numerous}} variables influence <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> {{the differences}} between gender can be examined through multiple theoretical frameworks. Social constructionism predicts that sexual socialisation is a strong predictor of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> and that gender differences {{are the result of}} social influences. From this perspective, it is believed that female sexuality is more malleable since it is influenced to a greater extent by cultural views and expectations regarding how women should think and behave. In contrast, evolutionary theory (also known as evolutionary psychology or sociobiology) predicts that <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> predisposed to biological factors.29 For example, some studies have found that women prefer fantasizing about familiar lovers, whereas male <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> involve anonymous partners.|$|R
40|$|This {{literature}} review examines {{the nature of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> and their impact (both negative and positive) on arousal. The effects of guilt and shame resulting from religious negativism—specifically Christianity—toward <b>fantasies</b> <b>is</b> explored.

Keywords <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies,</b> guilt, religion Research demonstrates that <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> universally experienced cognitions that can serve to induce sexual desire, maintain arousal, enhance a sexual experience, or trigger an orgasm (Birch, 2001).

5000|$|The moral {{acceptance}} and formal study of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> in Western culture is relatively new. Prior to their acceptance, <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>were</b> seen as evil or sinful, {{and they were}} commonly seen as horrid thoughts planted into the minds of people by [...] "agents of the devil". Even when psychologists were willing to accept and study fantasies, they showed little understanding and {{went so far as}} to diagnose <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> in females as a sign of hysteria. Prior to the early twentieth century, many experts viewed <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> (particularly in females) as abnormal. Sigmund Freud suggested that those who experienced <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>were</b> sexually deprived or frustrated or that they lacked adequate sexual stimulation and satisfaction. Over several decades, <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> became more acceptable as notable works and compilations, such as [...] "Morality, Sexual Facts and Fantasies", by Dr Patricia Petersen, Alfred Kinsey's Kinsey Reports, Erotic Fantasies: A Study of the Sexual Imagination by Phyllis and Eberhard Kronhausen, and Nancy Friday's My Secret Garden, were published. Today, they are regarded as natural and positive elements of one's sexuality, and are often used to enhance sexual practices, both in normal settings and in therapy. Many Christians believe that the Bible prohibits <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> about people other than one's spouse in Matthew 5:28. Others believe that St Paul includes fantasy when he condemns works of the flesh such as [...] "immorality" [...] or [...] "uncleanness". Despite the Western World's relatively lax attitudes towards <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> many people still feel shame and guilt about their fantasies. This may contribute to personal sexual dysfunction, and regularly leads to a decline in the quality of a couple's sex life.|$|R

50|$|Fantasies {{can have}} benefits, such as {{increasing}} arousal {{more than other}} forms of sexual stimuli (such as an erotic story) and increasing sexual desire. Individuals who disclose their <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> to their partners also have a higher sexual satisfaction. However, whether {{people are willing to}} open up to their partner generally depends on the content of such fantasies. A more negative effect of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> that it has been linked with sexual crimes, and indeed sexual offenders often report that they have had fantasies related to their offense. However, such <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> also common among those who have not been involved in such criminal acts and non-offenders do not use their fantasies to guide their behaviour.

50|$|Beyond {{the legal}} {{problems}} in Belgium, the initial reception {{seems to have}} been a mixture of titillation at the erotic content, fascination with the scandal, and amusement at the fact that this darkly <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>was</b> from the mind of a young woman who was only twenty-four years-old at the time of the first publication and reportedly not yet twenty when she wrote it.

Later, after other women began writing and talking about sex publicly, Friday began thinking about {{writing a book about}} female <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies,</b> first collecting fantasies from her friends, and then advertising in newspapers and magazines for more. She organized these narratives into [...] "rooms", and each is identified by the woman's first name, except for the last chapter, [...] "odd notes", which is presented as the [...] "fleeting thoughts" [...] of many anonymous women.

5000|$|Studies {{have also}} been carried out to examine the direct {{connection}} between guilt and <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> as opposed to sex and guilt.

Studies that examined guilt about <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> by age have unclear results—Knoth et al. (1998) and Ellis and Symons (1990) found that younger people tended to feel less guilt about their fantasies, whereas Mosher and White (1980) found the opposite.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> a {{situation}} imagined {{by an individual}} that expresses certain desires or aims {{on the part of}} its creator.

50|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>is</b> nearly universal, but vary by gender, age, sexual orientation, and society. However, {{because of a}} reliance on retrospective recall, as well as response bias and taboo, there is an inherent difficulty in measuring the frequency of types of fantasies. In general, the most common fantasies {{for men and women}} are: reliving an exciting sexual experience, imagining sex with a current partner, and imagining sex with a different partner. There is no consistent difference in the popularity of these three categories of fantasies. The next most common fantasies involve oral sex, sex in a romantic location, sexual power or irresistibility, and rape.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> a form {{of mental}} sexual {{stimulation}} which many people engage in. It is where a person imagines a sexual experience while they <b>are</b> awake. <b>Fantasy</b> has less social or safety limits than in real life situations. It gives people more freedom to experiment or think of things they could not necessarily try in real life and can be anything from imagining your spouse naked, to imagining a sexual experience with a mythical creature. Common <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> include imagining activities with a loved partner, reliving past experiences and experiences with multiple partners of the opposite gender. It’s also common to have fantasies about things you would not do in real life and about taboo or illegal activities, such as forcing another, or being forced to have sex, intercourse with a stranger and sex with a boy or girl or older partner.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether a latency-based Go/No-Go Association Task (GNAT) {{could be used}} as an indirect measure of sexual interest in children. A sample 29 individuals with a history of exclusive extrafamilial offenses against a child and 15 individuals with either a history of exclusive intrafamilial or mixed offenses (i. e., against both adults and children) were recruited from a treatment center in the US. Also, a sample of 26 nonoffenders was recruited from a university in the UK. All participants completed the Sexual Fantasy-GNAT, a Control-GNAT, and two self-report measures of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy.</b> It <b>was</b> hypothesized that, relative to the two comparison groups, the extrafamilial group would respond faster on the block that paired 'sexual fantasy' and 'children'.

Response-latency indices were also found to effectively distinguish the extrafamilial group, {{as well as those who}} self-reported using child-related <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies.</b> The implications of these findings, along with the study's limitations and suggestions for future research, are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Critic Randy Rasmussen {{suggests}} that the character of Bill is fundamentally more naïve, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin. For Rasmussen and others, the film's Bill Harford is essentially sleep-walking through life with no deeper awareness of his surroundings. In the novella, when his wife discloses a private <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> he in turn admits {{one of his own}} (of a girl in her mid to late teens), while in the film he is simply shocked. The film's argument over whether he has fantasies over female patients and whether women have <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> <b>is</b> simply absent from the novella, where both husband and wife assume the other has fantasies. In the film, Bill's estrangement from Alice revolves around her confessing a recent fantasy to him; in the novella, both exchange fantasies, after which she declares that in her youth she could have easily married someone else, which is what precipitates their sense of estrangement.|$|R
40|$|This {{focus of}} this present is two-fold: We are {{interested}} in a multidimensional definition of sexual orientation {{and the relationship between}} societal heterosexism and self-esteem. We are concerned with the relationship between internalized homonegativity and lowered self-esteem within individuals expressing, lesbian, gay, or bisexual aspects of multidimensional sexual orientation. Participants responses to the Klien Sexual Oreintation Grid, the Nungesser Homosexual Attitudes Inventory, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were obtained through anonymous questionnaires. Our results support a multidimensional conceptualization of sexual orientation. Regression analyses revealed that sexual attraction, heterosexual/ homosexual lifestyle, and <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>are</b> predictive of <b>sexual</b> orientation self-identification. Correlational analyses reveal that within individuals expressing lesbian, gay, or bisexual tendencies for either self-identification, sexual behavior, sexual attraction or <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> a negative relationship exists between internalized homonegativity and self-esteem. Sexual orientation profiles were created through cluster analysis in order to view the negative relationship between homonegativity and self-esteem within multidimensional sexuality...|$|R
