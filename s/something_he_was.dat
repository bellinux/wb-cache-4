5|$|After leaving school, Macartney {{worked for}} a fruit and {{vegetable}} merchant near Sydney's Sussex Street docks, honing his batting skills by practising without pads on a wooden wharf during his lunch break. At this stage in his career, he possessed a copybook technique and defensive style, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to discard for an audacious, self-styled and attacking outlook.|$|E
5|$|The most noted of Bauer's {{pictures}} are his watercolors, the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines; he alternated between aquarelle and gouache. When he created illustrations the two mediums were sometimes mixed, since he needed both {{the speed of}} the aquarelle and the contrast and impasto that the gouache provided. These water-soluble, and fast drying, media allowed Bauer to work on his pictures until the last minute before deadline, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> prone to do.|$|E
5|$|Development of Final Fantasy X-2 {{began in}} late 2001 in {{response}} to the success of Final Fantasy X, particularly fan reaction to the Eternal Calm video included in the Japanese version of Final Fantasy X International. It was released in Japan shortly before the merger between Square and Enix. The game's eventual name, X-2, was initially not liked by the production team, but it was eventually accepted since the story was a direct continuation of X and thus could not be the next numbered title in the series. Kazushige Nojima, the previous game's writer, was also skeptical about the creation of a sequel. <b>Something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> particularly averse to originally was the happy ending, which he felt was wrong for the story. The production team was one third the size of the previous installment. This was because the team was already familiar with the material and it allowed them to give a hand-crafted feel to the game. In designing the game, a significant number of character models, enemies, and location designs from Final Fantasy X were reused. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura has explained that this allowed the game to be developed in one year and at half the normal scope Final Fantasy titles are normally produced. Maya and Softimage 3D were the two main programs used to create the graphics.|$|E

5|$|Gerber set out {{to expand}} the Society's {{membership}} beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining; he was also unable to gain any financial support from the more affluent members of Chicago's gay community. Gerber sought out the support {{of people in the}} medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of their fear of ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, Gerber stated, The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or depraved. Some were blasé. Many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was the real spice of life. With this argument, they rejected our aims. We wondered how we could accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people. Gerber shouldered all of the labor and financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort. The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals.|$|E

Dupas later told police he cancelled his appointment with Patterson after being told by her his problem was <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to work through of his own accord.|$|E

5000|$|Donald {{has a few}} memorable {{phrases that}} he {{occasionally}} comes out with in certain situations. For example, when he stumbles across other characters {{in the midst of}} planning some sort of retaliation or prank, or when things don't go as he'd planned or don't work properly, he often says, [...] "What's the big idea!?". When he has given up on <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> trying to do, or <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> hoping will happen, he tends to say, [...] "Aw, phooey!". When he confronts someone who's been antagonizing him or something that's <b>been</b> frustrating him, <b>he</b> likes to exclaim, [...] "So!!". He greets his friend Daisy, and occasionally others, with, [...] "Hiya, toots!". And when he's very excited about <b>something,</b> <b>he</b> usually mutters, [...] "Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy..." [...] under his breath.|$|R
25|$|Frank Herbert {{used his}} science fiction novels to explore complex ideas {{involving}} philosophy, religion, psychology, politics and ecology. The underlying thrust {{of his work}} was a fascination {{with the question of}} human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a sometimes fanatical fan base, many of whom have tried to read everything he wrote, fiction or non-fiction, and see Herbert as something of an authority on the subject matters of his books. Indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times asked if he was founding a cult, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very much against.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, Kemp stated {{he felt he}} {{had formed}} an {{intimate}} bond with the soldiers after their experience in Afghanistan, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> proud to have achieved. He stated the soldier next to him while the crew were pinned down was the first to text him on Christmas Day with the first three or four people to ring him Christmas Day also all people he was with in during that incident, reflecting a relief at survival Some of the soldiers he had been deployed with came to see him in the Christmas pantomime season at the end of 2007, stating {{that it was a good}} way to relax after what they had been through.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} of Ardyn, Gentiana, Iris, Aranea, Umbra, Cindy, Cid, and Verstael were all designed by Roberto Ferrari, {{who had previously}} done work on Type-0 and was involved with the project from its earlier development as Versus XIII. These designs were completed by 2010, when the project was still known as Versus XIII. Ferrari was brought on board the project in 2010 after an unidentified female designer resigned from the project as her art was repeatedly rejected by the developers. The change and subsequent alterations to the game's content meant that many of Ferrari's character designs went unused, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> openly frustrated about as he considered these unseen characters more visually striking than his surviving designs. Many of his surviving character designs were altered during later development, including those for Gentiana and Umbra. Ardyn and Aranea remained mostly unchanged. Another contributing artist was Yusaku Nakaaki, who helped design the character Cindy.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} year, Guo Yuan assisted the general Cao Ren in suppressing a rebellion by Tian Yin (田銀) and Su Bo (蘇伯) in Hejian Commandery (河間郡; around present-day Cangzhou, Hebei). After the revolt was crushed, many rebels were rounded up {{and sentenced to}} death. Guo Yuan advised Cao Cao to grant clemency to those rebels {{because they were not}} the masterminds. Cao Cao approved. Over 1,000 rebels were spared due to Guo Yuan's effort. At the time, it was not uncommon for officials to exaggerate their achievements in the reports they submitted after winning battles or suppressing rebellions. Guo Yuan, however, gave the exact figures in his report. When a surprised Cao Cao asked him why, Guo Yuan said that it was not <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> proud of because the rebellion was a sign of government failure. Cao Cao was so pleased when he heard what Guo Yuan said that he promoted him to be the Administrator (太守) of Wei Commandery (魏郡; around present-day Handan, Hebei).|$|E
25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove <b>something,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on the wrong track.|$|E
25|$|Back in Venice, Casanova {{started his}} {{clerical}} law career and was admitted as an abbé after being conferred minor orders by the Patriarch of Venice. He shuttled {{back and forth}} to Padua to continue his university studies. By now, he had become something of a dandy—tall and dark, his long hair powdered, scented, and elaborately curled. He quickly ingratiated himself with a patron (<b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to do all his life), 76-year-old Venetian senator Alvise Gasparo Malipiero, the owner of Palazzo Malipiero, close to Casanova's home in Venice. Malipiero moved in the best circles and taught young Casanova a great deal about good food and wine, and how to behave in society. However, Casanova was caught dallying with Malipiero's intended object of seduction, actress Teresa Imer, and the senator drove both of them from his house. Casanova's growing curiosity about women led to his first complete sexual experience, with two sisters, Nanetta and Marton Savorgnan, then fourteen and sixteen, who were distant relatives of the Grimanis. Casanova proclaimed that his life avocation was firmly established by this encounter.|$|E

[...] Oberbeck commented that Bond [...] "has become a sensitive man-of-ethics who suffers pangs of doubt and remorse over the 'senseless' violence of his profession". Oberbeck {{went on to say that}} Amis [...] "never quite captures the bizzare beat of a Fleming pace"; most telling, according to Oberbeck, was that [...] "the greatest flaw in Amis' conception of Bond is that he has attempted to transform the consummate spy-hero into <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> never meant to have been: a man with a job".|$|E

500|$|Aiello was the {{co-owner}} of a cheese importing {{business with a}} fellow Sicilian, Antonio [...] "Tony the Scourge" [...] Lombardo, an ally of organized crime figure Al Capone. Aiello {{was president of the}} company, which was called Antonio Lombardo & Co., and Capone was said to have lent both men $100,000 to start the enterprise. With the enactment of Prohibition and the start of bootlegging, the sugar import business brought Aiello into contact with organized crime, along with his brothers Dominick, Antonio, Andrew and Carlo. In Chicago they made a small fortune selling sugar and other home-cooked alcohol components to the Genna crime family, and Aiello earned enough money to buy a three-story mansion in Rogers Park. However, he craved recognition and prestige in addition to money, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gaining as he was becoming known as the top organized crime boss of Chicago. When the Genna family lost power in Chicago following gang wars, the Aiellos believed themselves the successors of their territory.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after hiring Kosinski, Bailey {{approached}} screenwriting duo Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, {{who accepted}} for being self-described [...] "obsessed about Tron". Horowitz later claimed {{the challenge was}} to [...] "homage the first movie, continue the story, expand it {{and take it to}} another place and open up space for new fans", and Kitsis claimed that the film would start a whole new mythology [...] "of which we're only scratching the surface". Horowitz and Kitsis first created a story outline, and developed and fine-tuned the plot with Bailey and Kosinski across a period of two days in La Quinta. The writers also consulted Lisberger, to view Trons creator input on the story. Lisberger gave his blessing, particularly as he has a son the same age as Sam, which Kitsis stated that [...] "was like we had tapped into <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> feeling without even realizing it." [...] The Pixar team contributed with rewrites for additional shooting after being shown a rough cut in March 2010, which helped in particular to the development of Sam's story line.|$|E
500|$|After {{converting}} to Catholicism and establishing his authority, Henry IV was hailed {{not only as}} the healer of the scrofulous, but also as the healer of the kingdom. The first Bourbon on the French throne, {{he decided to take}} advantage of the ability attributed to his predecessors and use it to confirm the legitimacy of his reign. He was, however, in an inconvenient situation: he was crowned at Chartres Cathedral rather than Reims, and thus made no visit to the shrine of Saint Marcouf. He maintained that the royal touch was <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> handed down by his predecessors and by God's grace, rather than an ability conferred by the rite of coronation. Henry decided not to exhibit his [...] "divine gift" [...] immediately after his coronation at Chartres in February 1594; instead, he decided to save the mystique element of his kingship for his entry in Paris in March. Two weeks after the event, on Easter, Henry exercised his healing power for the first time. He was determined not to show any skepticism about the ritual, fearing that it might cast doubt on the sincerity of his conversion.|$|E
