40|$|M. Ed. (Media Studies) As man is {{a dynamic}} being living in a 'world where "information (including knowledge) is accumulating in many fields at rates far {{exceeding}} a worker's capacity to absorb it" (Hawkridge, 1983 : 5) his initial training will always be insufficient and should be supplemented by means of in-service and further training. It appears that, because of financial and other reasons, further training will increasingly take place by means of tele-tuition. In the past few years, the <b>sound</b> <b>cassette</b> has been used {{more and more in}} tele-tuition owing to features such as its convenience, availability, inexpensiveness and effectiveness. Among the problems identified is that very few lecturers are familiar with the special didactic demands of tele-tuition and especially the use of the <b>sound</b> <b>cassette</b> as educational medium in the tele-tuition situation. Structured directions on the use of sound cassettes, to assist the lecturer, could not be found in the literature. This situation can easily lead to a haphazard and ineffective use of the <b>sound</b> <b>cassette.</b> The objective of this study, therefore, is to provide the lecturer with guidelines regarding the planning, production and use of sound cassettes in tele-tuition. In order to accomplish this objective, it was necessary to study existing literature and to talk with people who are authorities in their separate fields. With the information gathered, a frame of reference regarding tele-tuition at tertiary level was structured as basis for further discussion. Thereafter the potential of the cassette and the criteria that should be taken into consideration when planning, producing and using the <b>sound</b> <b>cassette,</b> were discussed. This led to some suggestions regarding the lecturer's preparation, the production, indexing, dispatch and evaluation of sound cassettes, and briefing the student on the use thereof. This study does not see the <b>sound</b> <b>cassette</b> as a panacea, but as an under-exploited educational medium with great potential in the tele-tuition situatio...|$|E
