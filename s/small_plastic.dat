25|$|The {{object of}} the game is to move around the board by {{correctly}} answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die.|$|E

A variation is the French hook design, which merely hangs from the earlobe without closure, although <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> retainers are sometimes used on ends of French hooks. Rarely, dangle earrings use the post attachment design.|$|E

25|$|Also called combo consoles, {{these are}} usually hard rubber or tough plastic moldings which enclose the SPG and have {{mounting}} sockets for other diver instrumentation, such as decompression computers, underwater compass, timer and/or depth gauge and occasionally a <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> slate on which notes {{can be written}} either before or during the dive. These instruments would otherwise be carried somewhere else such as strapped to the wrist or forearm or in a pocket and are only regulator accessories for convenience of transport and access, and {{at greater risk of}} damage during handling.|$|E
25|$|While TSR {{tried to}} {{leverage}} its line of existing SPI property, Milton Bradley started the Gamemaster line of mass-appeal wargames in 1984. With the financial backing {{of a company}} much larger than any in the wargame business, the Gamemaster games had excellent production quality, with mounted full-color boards (something that only Avalon Hill could regularly do), and plenty of <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> miniatures as game pieces. The games were generally simple, by wargaming standards, but very playable and successful. The {{first game of the}} line, Axis and Allies, is still in print today, and has spawned a number of spinoff titles.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMicro-sized {{polycrystalline}} {{copper wires}} of diameters ranging from 5  μm to 36  μm were cyclically loaded under stress-control in many steps with increasing the applied stress amplitude after a saturation state in plastic strain is reached. It is {{observed that the}} thicker wires show <b>smaller</b> <b>plastic</b> strain at saturation as well as smaller creep strain compared to the thinner wires. The results were discussed combined with the monotonic tensile results of these micro-sized wires...|$|R
