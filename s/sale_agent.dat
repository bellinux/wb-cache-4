40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of an insurance policies recommender for prospect client. The main aims of MyINS are twofold. The first aim is to simplify the process for client in making decision base on the information recommended through this system. The second aim is to allow client to choose the insurance policy that is most suitable for them. MyINS models the reasoning process employed by insurance <b>sale</b> <b>agent</b> in proposing policy to the client using case-based reasoning algorithm (CBR). CBR, generally describe the process of solving current problems based on the proposed solution from similar past problems.

40|$|Modeling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} problems encountered in the field of research on virtual enterprises. Multi-agent system has become nowadays a paradigm for modeling and applications implementation. In this paper, multi-agent system based approach is proposed to support virtual enterprise modeling. Multi-agent system to support virtual enterprise modeling can be seen as a collection of autonomous agents, which represent individual enterprises in virtual enterprises. Herein, agent generic framework for enterprises&# 39; encapsulation is also presented, which comprises of two levels, i. e. agent kernel level (AKL) and agent coordination level (ACL). AKL consists of legacy systems of enterprise, such as production planning and control system (ERP/MRPII), job shops automation system, manufacturing cells automation system and local DB. ACL, which is composed of global DB, <b>sale</b> <b>agent,</b> global planning agent, negotiation agent and monitor agent, realizes cooperation and interaction among individual enterprises of virtual enterprises. Multi-agent system based virtual enterprises modeling approach lets a virtual enterprise work as a single enterprise and keeps individual enterprises autonomous. Meanwhile, the approach also makes it possible for an individual enterprise to participate more than one virtual enterprise simultaneously according to its own real requirements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The paper discuses {{the main}} {{problems}} which appear when traditional business, based in <b>sales</b> <b>agents,</b> moves to new e-commerce models. Customers, {{used to describe}} to <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> their needs using natural language, are suffering {{from the lack of}} expressiveness using product query forms, which are too rigid.

40|$|We {{consider}} a three-layer supply chain with a manufacturer, a reseller, and a <b>sales</b> <b>agent.</b> The demand is stochastically {{determined by the}} random market condition and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent's</b> private effort level. Although the manufacturer is uninformed about the market condition, the reseller and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent</b> conduct demand forecasting and generate private demand signals. Under this framework with two levels of adverse selection intertwined with moral hazard, we study {{the impact of the}} reseller's and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent's</b> forecasting accuracy on the profitability of each member. We show that the manufacturer's profitability is convex on the reseller's forecasting accuracy. From the manufacturer's perspective, typically improving the reseller's accuracy is detrimental when the accuracy is low but is beneficial when it is high. We identify the concrete interrelation among the manufacturer-optimal reseller's accuracy, the volatility of the market condition, and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent's</b> accuracy. Finally, the manufacturer's interest may be aligned with the reseller's when only the reseller can choose her accuracy; this alignment is never possible when both downstream players have the discretion to choose their accuracy. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{literature}} on management control {{in the context of}} front-line service work, including sales work. Given the nature of front-line work, service recipients – customers and clients – {{play an important role in}} management control and in the social relations in the workplace. Moreover, the triangle relationship has become a research focus for decades. However, most of the research has been done in western countries. In addition, little attention has been paid to sales work mixed with service elements. Furthermore, the complexity of the triangle relationship between three parties has not been sufficiently evaluated. This thesis investigates management control in a Chinese life insurance company and the effects of management on individual <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and the triangle relationship between management, <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and clients. In order to address the research target, this study employs a qualitative approach and chooses a single-case study research design. The qualitative data has been collected from a documentary analysis, observations and semi-structured interviews. The empirical findings suggest that: a. 	The management controls in the studied case can be categorised into two main types: formally coercive control that consists of output control, bureaucratic control, direct control and attendant control; and informally normative control that consists of concertive control in the sales teams and normative control in morning meetings. b. 	The controls for contradictory logic that interact with one another to have an impact on individual <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and the triangle relationship. c. 	<b>Sales</b> <b>agents</b> who have a greater family responsibility and the capability of meeting sales targets set by the company are more motivated by financial incentives, identified with organisational and occupational value and self-disciplined. d. 	<b>Sales</b> <b>agents</b> who have a poor performance and lack the capability to improve their performance are more likely to resist management control. e. 	The relationship between management and the <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> is not always conflictual. f. 	Co-worker assistance and informal coping are found in the relationships among <b>sales</b> <b>agents,</b> although their <b>sales</b> work is highly individualised and competitive. g. 	The relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and clients is instrumental in its nature, but when there is an ongoing relationship and a high level of trust between <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and clients, this relationship appears to be less instrumental. h. 	Improving the quality of service and enhancing the myth of customer sovereignty may sacrifice efficiency in the short term, but it can potentially increase sales efficiency in the long run. ...|$|R
