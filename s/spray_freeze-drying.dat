40|$|For lung {{transplant}} patients, a respirable, inulin-based {{solid dispersion}} containing cyclosporine A (CsA) has been developed. The solid dispersions were prepared by <b>spray</b> <b>freeze-drying.</b> The solid dispersion {{was characterized by}} water vapor uptake, specific surface area analysis, and particle size analysis. Furthermore, the mode of inclusion of CsA in the dispersion was investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Finally, the dissolution behavior was determined and the aerosol that was formed by the powder was characterized. The powder had large specific surface areas (~ 160 m(2)). The water vapor uptake was dependant linearly on the drug load. The type of solid dispersion {{was a combination of}} a solid solution and solid suspension. At a 10 % drug load, 55 % of the CsA in the powder was {{in the form of a}} solid solution and 45 % as solid suspension. At 50 % drug load, the powder contained 90 % of CsA as solid suspension. The powder showed excellent dispersion characteristics as shown by the high emitted fraction (95 %), respirable fraction (75 %), and fine-particle fraction (50 %). The solid dispersions consisted of relatively large (x(50) approximately 7 mum), but low-density particles (rho approximately 0. 2 g/cm(3)). The solid dispersions dissolved faster than the physical mixture, and inulin dissolved faster than CsA. The <b>spray</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> with inulin increased the specific surface area and wettability of CsA. In conclusion, the developed powder seems suitable for inhalation in the local treatment of lung transplant patients...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{delivery}} of therapeutic peptides and proteins has many advantages including high relative bioavailability, rapid systemic absorption and {{onset of action}} and a non-invasive mode of administration which improves patient compliance. In this study, we investigated the effect of spray-drying (SD) and <b>spray</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> processes on the stability and aerosol performance of parathyroid hormone (PTH) (1 - 34) microparticles. In this study, the stabilisation effect of trehalose (a non-reducing sugar) and Brij 97 (a non-ionic surfactant) on spray-dried PTH particles was assessed using analytical techniques including circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy, modulated differential scanning calorimetry and an in vitro bioactivity assay. Physical characterisation also included electron microscopy, tap density measurement and laser light diffraction. The aerosol aerodynamic performance of the formulations was assessed using the Andersen cascade impactor. Based on these studies, a formulation for <b>spray</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> was selected {{and the effects of}} the two particle engineering techniques on the biophysical stability and aerosol performance of the resulting powders was determined. CD, fluorescence spectroscopy and bioactivity data suggest that trehalose when used alone as a stabilising excipient produces a superior stabilising effect than when used in combination with a non-ionic surfactant. This highlights the utility of CD and fluorescence spectroscopy studies for the prediction of protein bioactivity post-processing. Therefore, a method and formulation suitable for the preparation of PTH as a dry powder was developed based on spray-drying PTH with trehalose as a stabiliser with the bioactivity of SD PTH containing trehalose being equivalent to that of unprocessed PTH...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 40 % of {{the drugs}} {{dissolve}} poorly in the gastro-intestinal tract after oral administration. If the drug is not dissolved, it can not enter the bloodstream and hence it is not effective. Possible consequences are that these drugs have to be administered in large doses and that food can have a strong effect {{on the amount of}} drug entering the bloodstream. Nanocrystals (crystals smaller than a millionth of a meter) can be used to increase the dissolution rate and thereby the effectivity of these drugs. In this research, a novel process to prepare these drug nanocrystals, ‘controlled crystallization during freeze-drying’, was developed. This process yields drug nanocrystals embedded in a fast dissolving sugar matrix. To optimize this novel process, the mechamism of nanoparticle formation during freeze-drying was elucidated by in-line Raman-spectroscopy. Furthermore, a novel microscopic method was developed to analyze the drug particles that were obtained after freeze-drying. This microscopic method could be used to determine the drug particle size, even though the drug was embedded in a matrix. To change the freeze-drying process into a <b>spray</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> process, the application of a 3 -way nozzle was tested. By using this 3 -way nozzle, the <b>spray</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> process was suitable for the production of drug nanocrystals on a large scale. In conclusion, in this thesis, a novel process to prepare nanocrystals of poorly soluble drugs is described. Nanocrystals, prepared by this process, make it possible to lower the dose of these drugs and to control the amount of drug entering the bloodstream. ...|$|E

The encapsulated probiotics in microbead gel matrix {{were further}} stabilized in maltodextrin solids by either <b>spray</b> or <b>freeze-drying</b> to form probiotic microcapsule powders. The free cells of probiotics were also sprayed and freeze-dried in maltodextrin only without microgel encapsulation. After rehydration of microgel-encapsulated powder, gel particles regained their shape. There {{was no difference}} in the loss of viability between encapsulated and unencapsulated probiotics during <b>spray</b> drying or <b>freeze-drying.</b> For LNCFM, spray-dried bacteria with or without gel encapsulation exhibited less death (3. 03 and 3. 07 log CFU/g reduction, respectively) than those of freeze-dried bacteria (4. 36 and 4. 89 log CFU/g reduction, respectively) after 6 months storage at 4 A degrees C. The same trend was also observed in spray-dried LGG without gel encapsulation which showed 5. 87 log CFU/g reduction in viability after 6 months at 4 A degrees C; however, freeze-dried LGG without gel encapsulation exhibited a rapid reduction in viability of 5. 91 log CFU/g within just 2 months. Gel-encapsulated LGG which was freeze-dried exhibited less death (3. 32 log CFU/g reduction) after 6 months at 4 A degrees C.

Spray freeze drying has shown short process times and allows advanced control, product particle shape and size uniformity, and high solubility. This shows that the fluidized-bed freeze-drying process could be an alternative for classical freeze-drying processes.

40|$|The study {{provides}} a comprehensive overview on different stabilization techniques for liposomal formulations. The {{selection of the}} appropriate technology for a particular formulation can thereby be based on several considerations. If free flowable particulate bulk material is desired the spraying-technologies are preferred over lyophilization. Another advantage of spraying-based technologies is the possibility to combine the liposome formation step and the drying step within the same process. It {{is a prerequisite for}} the selection of the stabilization technique that the integrity of the liposomes is preserved with the incorporated drug after the process. Spray-drying is related to a thermal stress for the formulation but only for a short time. For heat labile drugs processes with low process temperatures, e. g. freeze-drying, <b>spray</b> <b>freeze-drying,</b> inert-spray drying or supercritical drying are most adequate.

50|$|After the {{extraction}} and tea creaming processes, the tea solution {{is still too}} dilute to pass through a drier. Drying at this point would take too much capital for little gain, and any type of <b>spray</b> or <b>freeze-drying</b> would cause the resulting powder to have too low a density. The answer is to first concentrate the solution to what is usually 40% solids before drying, which involves the removal of water through evaporation. Concentration of tea is normally done through reduction of pressure. At high temperatures, the theaflavins in the solution are converted to thearubigins and carbohydrates caramelize. Forced evaporation systems had hot spots which led to undesirable sensory characteristics such as stewed and burnt flavors. Plate heat exchangers can cause the desired evaporation at around 45 °C, with short residence times that {{reduce the risk of}} thermal damage. This method can produce an extract with 45% solids. Aroma stripping is done prior to concentration, because those compounds run the risk of being lost during evaporation.|$|R

NPs based on chitosan showed similar properties (size, structure, viscoelastic behaviour), but those based on SFDC showed a higher mean release of both active ingredients, with similar efficiency of encapsulation and loading capacity for prednisolone but lower for inulin. SFDC was less degraded in the presence of lysozyme and E. coli and was degraded by B. thetaiotaomicron but not by faecal slurry. The results obtained with SFDA were promising because this NP showed good encapsulation parameters for both active ingredients and biological degradability by E. coli and faecal slurry.

The SDs were prepared by <b>spray</b> <b>freeze-drying.</b> Scanning electron microscopy showed that the obtained samples were highly porous spherical particles. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry showed that the drugs incorporated in these carriers were fully or partially amorphous. The solubility of the drugs in solutions of the different carriers was increased in an order: inulin 2. 3 kDa <PVP K 30 ≪ Inutec® SP 1. The dissolution behavior of SD tablets was evaluated. Inutec® SP 1 -based SD tablets showed the best performance followed by PVP- and inulin-based SD tablets. The superior dissolution behavior of the drugs from Inutec® SP 1 -based SDs could be ascribed to its surface-active nature.

Yet, mucosal IgA, considered particularly important for protection at the site of virus entry, was poorly induced. Here we investigate the suitability of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and the saponin-derived compound GPI- 0100 to serve as adjuvant for influenza vaccine {{administered to the}} lungs as dry powder. The TLR ligands palmitoyl- 3 -cysteine-serine-lysine- 4 (Pam(3) CSK(4)), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) as well as GPI- 0100 tolerated the process of <b>spray</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> well. While Pam(3) CSK(4) had no effect on systemic antibody titers, all the other adjuvants significantly increased influenza-specific serum and lung IgG titers.

Pulmonary immunization with GPI- 0100 -adjuvanted vaccine did not induce an overt inflammatory response since influx of neutrophils and production of inflammatory cytokines were moderate and transient and lung histology was normal.

To design efficient and safe freeze-drying cycles, local temperature and moisture {{content in the}} product bed have to be known, but both are difficult to measure in the industry. Mathematical modeling of heat and mass transfer helps to determine local freeze-drying conditions and predict effects of operation policy, and equipment and recipe changes on drying time and product quality. Representative pellets situated at different positions in the product slab were considered. One-dimensional transfer in the slab and radial transfer in the pellets were assumed. Coupled heat and vapor transfer equations between the temperature-controlled shelf, the product bulk, the sub-limationfront inside the pellets, and the chamber were established and solved numerically. The model was validated based on bulk temperature measurement performed at two different locations in the product slab and on partial vapor pressure measurement in the freeze-drying chamber. Fair agreement between measured and calculated values was found. In contrast, a previously developed model for compact product layer was found inadequate in describing freeze-drying of pellets.

30|$|To {{address the}} {{challenges}} above, {{we have been}} focusing on preparing a kind of high-efficient graphene-based support to reduce unnecessary defect generated from in situ polymerization as much as possible. The graphene-based catalyst supports act as the framework for loading catalyst in its large surface and internal pores. Meanwhile, the spherical graphene support takes the role of nanometer reinforcing filler and conductive agent. During the process of olefin polymerization, the graphene-based catalyst cracks and all the graphene layers disperse in the polyolefin matrix uniformly. Here, a unique micron spherical reduced graphene oxide(RGO)/SiO 2 nanocomposite as support for Z-N catalyst with a novel 3 D porous architecture was synthesized by the self-assembly and <b>spray</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> method.

These properties are beneficial to continuous operation of the preparation and production equipment. Also to date, no reports have the synthesis of granuliform or roundish graphene/UHMWPE composites, which is a reappearance of the spherical morphology of the graphene-based support in the polymerization process.

Swallowing conventional tablets will be further hindered by conditions such as unavailability of water, allergic reactions and episodes of coughing 1. These problems can be solved by developing rapidly disintegrating and dissolving tablet dosage forms for oral administration, because they dissolve in saliva and does not require water for swallowing. Upon ingestion, the saliva serves to rapidly dissolve the dosage form. The saliva containing the dissolved or dispersed medicament is then swallowed and the drug is absorbed in the normal way. Some drugs are absorbed from the mouth, pharynx and oesophagus, as the saliva passes down in to the stomach. In these cases, the bioavailability of drugs is significantly greater than those observed from conventional dosage forms 2. The bioavailability of some drugs may be increased due to absorption of drugs in oral cavity and also due to pregastric absorption of saliva containing dispersed drugs that pass down into the stomach.

The morphology of the spray freeze-dried whey powder is substantially different to that produced by spray drying and displays a porous microstructure. The operation of the freeze-drying unites requires an further investigation for temperature, pressure, and flow control to maintain the freezedrying...|$|E
