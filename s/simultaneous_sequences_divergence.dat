Analysis of recombination products revealed that Alu/Alu recombination junctions occur more frequently in the first 100 bp of the Alu element within our reporter assay, just as they do in genomic Alu/Alu recombination events.

40|$|In Bacillus transformation, sexual {{isolation}} {{is known to}} be an exponential function of the <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence</b> between donor and recipient. Here, we have investigated the mechanism under which <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence</b> results in sexual isolation. We tested the effect of mismatch repair by comparing a wild-type strain and an isogenic mismatch-repair mutant for the relationship between sexual isolation and <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence.</b> Mismatch repair was shown to contribute to sexual isolation but was responsible for {{only a small fraction of}} the sexual isolation observed. Another possible mechanism of sexual {{isolation is}} that more divergent recipient and donor DNA strands have greater difficulty forming a heteroduplex because a region of perfect identity between donor and recipient is required for initiation of the heteroduplex. A mathematical model showed that this heteroduplex-resistance mechanism yields an exponential relationship between sexual isolation and <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence.</b> Moreover, this model yields an estimate of the size of the region of perfect identity that is comparable to independent estimates for Escherichia coli.

40|$|Background: Protein {{subcellular}} localization is {{a central}} problem in understanding cell biology and {{has been the focus}} of intense research. In order to predict localization from amino acid sequence a myriad of features have been tried: including amino acid composition, sequence similarity, the presence of certain motifs or domains, and many others. Surprisingly, sequence conservation of sorting motifs has not yet been employed, despite its extensive use for tasks such as the prediction of transcription factor binding sites. Results: Here, we flip the problem around, and present a proof of concept for the idea that the lack of sequence conservation can be a novel feature for localization prediction. We show that for yeast, mammal and plant datasets, evolutionary <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence</b> alone has significant power to identify sequences with N-terminal sorting <b>sequences.</b> Moreover <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence</b> is nearly as effective when computed on automatically defined ortholog sets as on hand curated ones. Unfortunately, <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence</b> did not necessarily increase classification performance when combined with some traditional sequence features such as amino acid composition. However a post-hoc analysis of the proteins in which <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence</b> changes the prediction yielded some proteins with atypical (i. e. not MPP-cleaved) matrix targeting signals as well as a few misannotations. Conclusion: We report the results of the first quantitative study of the effectiveness of evolutionary <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence</b> as a feature for protein subcellular localization prediction. We show that divergence is indeed useful for prediction, but it is not trivial to improve overall accuracy simply by adding this feature to classical sequence features.

Additional mismatches have a cumulative negative effect on the recombination rate. With <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence</b> of up to approximately 10 %, the inhibitory effect of mismatches results mainly from antirecombination activity of the mismatch repair system.

However, the rate and extent of SE promoted by these recombinases showed a strong negative correlation with increasing amounts of <b>sequence</b> <b>divergence</b> embedded at random across {{the length of the}} donor strand.

Such adaptations cause global selective sweeps, which purge the divergence both within and between populations.
