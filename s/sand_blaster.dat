5000|$|Filippo {{was born}} on June 10, 1983. He started {{mountain}} bike racing in 1997 and quickly {{fell in love with}} the sport. As junior racer from 1999-2001, he posted several great results. He got 3rd place in the 1999 SRAM Sea Otter Classic, which had 150 racers, and he was the 1999 <b>Sand</b> <b>Blaster</b> Champion with 3 out of 5 victories. In 2001 he was the Junior Expert State Champion with 5 out of 8 victories. In 2002, he moved up to pro class and his focus was to make it into the 2004 Brazilian Olympic Team. In 2002 he won the Florida sunshine State games. That same year he also got 2nd Overall in the [...] "Ford No Boundaries Mountain Bike Series" [...] and 15th Place at the Norba Nationals in West Virginia. Halfway through his 2002 season, his family went through a difficult time and he was forced to retire from racing to help them out as much as possible. 8 years later, he was lucky enough to have friends who knew he still had untapped potential in cycling. In August 2010 he began training again and did his first race back in Cat. 2 and won it. After that he got focused on getting back to racing full-time. In 2010-2011 he got 2nd overall in the State Series with 2 wins out of 8 races. He also got 1st overall in the 2011 Coconut Cup with 4 out of 6 victories in Cat. 2. In 2011 he moved back up the Pro Class again and won 3 Pro Races in the La Rooota Series. In 2012 he has set his goal of racing in the 2012 Pan American Games.|$|E

40|$|In {{the midst}} of {{increasing}} importance of modern cultural assets, especially, most modern bronze objects are exposed to outdoor environment, and as the objects are corroded steadily due to environmental factors the objects lost their original colors on the surface. We performed artificial patinas on the bronze sample per each color of red, black and green and checked cuprite and tenorite which are detected from actual bronze corrosion by analyzing the components. In addition, we applied the existing corrosion removal methods of grinder and <b>sand</b> <b>blaster</b> on a similar sample of bronze mirror per injection pressure and performed com-parative analysis on the result with Nd:YAG laser. As a result of Nd:YAG laser cleaning artificial patina from bronze samples, all of the patinas were removed by laser wavelength 1064 nm better than 532 nm. Upon applying to a similar sample of bronze mirror, the artificial patina could be selectively removed from substrates without surface damage when Nd:YAG laser was conducted other than the existing removal method...|$|E
40|$|A water droplet's {{behaviour}} {{on different}} substrates can vary significantly {{depending on the}} surface characteristics. A super hydrophobic surface is unique in that a droplet of water resting on it will exhibit contact angles greater than 1 so· and this brings about a variety of benefits, such as low liquid loss due to low adhesive properties. An unexplored application for superhydrophobic surfaces is in microfluidics for 'Lab-on-a-chip' type devices. In using a <b>sand</b> <b>blaster</b> approach, an intrinsically hydrophobic material such as Teflon {{was able to be}} transformed into a superhydrophobic one with contact angles up to 170 •. The impact angle of the particulates onto the surface was found to have significant influence on the behaviour modification. A rod that was made superhydrophobic allowed for direct contact with droplets under low sticking. In microplate wells, this permitted mixing to be done by simple liquid compression. Drops could be delivered to a superhydrophobic well either {{through the use of a}} liquid nebuliser, or the continuous delivery of water through a hole at the bottom of the well via a pump. The nebuliser allowed for accurate dispensation of droplets while the pump method offered better opportunities for the creation of a more compact device. The superhydrophobic well could also be used to restrain droplets when it was tilted at different speeds. The angular velocity of the well was found to correlate with the angle in which the droplet would escape the well; the faster the well rotated, the greater the angle required before the droplet would escape. Additionally, with an arrangement of multiple wells on a platform, droplets could be pushed from one well to another using a controlled short bursts of pressurised air. Overall, it has been found that attributes of superhydrophobic surface, particularly the low adhesion, non-contamination and non-sticking properties, have been shown to offer interesting vistas in discrete microfluidics...|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} to provide localized, real-time monitoring of material regression rates in various applications {{has the potential}} to provide a new stream of data for development testing of various components and systems, as well as serving as a monitoring tool in flight applications. These applications include, but are not limited to, the regression of a combusting solid fuel surface, the ablation of the throat in a chemical rocket or the heat shield of an aeroshell, and the monitoring of erosion in long-life plasma thrusters. The rate of regression in the first application is very fast, while the second and third are increasingly slower. A recent fundamental sensor development effort has led to a novel regression, erosion, and ablation sensor technology (REAST). The REAST sensor allows for measurement of real-time surface erosion rates at a discrete surface location. The sensor is optical, using two different, co-located fiber-optics to perform the regression measurement. The disparate optical transmission properties of the two fiber-optics makes it possible to measure the regression rate by monitoring the relative light attenuation through the fibers. As the fibers regress along with the parent material in which they are embedded, the relative light intensities through the two fibers changes, providing a measure of the regression rate. The optical nature of the system makes it relatively easy to use in a variety of harsh, high temperature environments, and it is also unaffected by the presence of electric and magnetic fields. In addition, the sensor could be used to perform optical spectroscopy on the light emitted by a process and collected by fibers, giving localized measurements of various properties. The {{capability to}} perform an in-situ measurement of material regression rates is useful in addressing a variety of physical issues in various applications. An in-situ measurement allows for real-time data regarding the erosion rates, providing a quick method for empirically anchoring any analysis geared towards lifetime qualification. Erosion rate data over an operating envelope could also be useful in the modeling detailed physical processes. The sensor has been embedded in many regressing media for the purposes of proof-of-concept testing. A gross demonstration of its capabilities was performed using a sanding wheel to remove layers of metal. A longer-term demonstration measurement involved the placement of the sensor in a brake pad, monitoring the removal of pad material associated with the normal wear-and-tear of driving. It was used to measure the regression rates of the combustable media in small model rocket motors and road flares. Finally, a test was performed using a <b>sand</b> <b>blaster</b> to remove small amounts of material at a time. This test was aimed at demonstrating the unit's present resolution, and is compared with laser profilometry data obtained simultaneously. At the lowest resolution levels, this unit should be useful in locally quantifying the erosion rates of the channel walls in plasma thrusters. ...|$|E
40|$|A ZIDS seminar {{paper on}} {{occupational}} {{health at the}} workplace. Occupational disease is simply defined as disease which arises from a person’s work. The {{fact that it has}} been with us for a long time is illustrated by this extract from a booklet produced by NIOSH. Ancient Roman slaves toiling in mercury mines devised bladder skin masks in a futile attempt to avoid inhaling toxic fumes. In 1979, several workers in Linden, New Jersey, were hospitalized with mercury poisoning, and others suffered classic symptoms: weight loss, tremors, and psychological problems. Federal officials ordered engineering and housekeeping improvements with strict use of respirators in the meantime. Sixteenth century grinders suffered a lung ailment they called "grinders disease” from inhaling silica dust. Today, in the United States, silicosis is prevalent among <b>sand</b> <b>blasters</b> in the shipbuilding industry. Despite the hazard, this country has chosen not to follow the lead of Great Britain, which banned the use of silica sand in blasting operations more than 25 years ago. Medieval scribes probably suffered lead poisoning because of the common practice of tipping their quills with their tongues between dipping them into metallic ink solutions. Today, lead poisoning is common among workers in lead smelters and battery plants and some industries routinely administer drugs to lower their workers’ blood levels. One Illinois labourer told Federal officials he was so afraid of lead poisoning that he took 250 pills every two weeks. In 1775 an English surgeon "discovered" occupational cancer when he noted numerous cases of scrotal cancer among chimney sweeps exposed to coal tar. On the bicentennial of occupational cancer, coke oven workers were (and still are) inhaling the same kind of substances • and dying of lung cancer at a rate of 11 times that of other steel workers. These examples demonstrate both the long history of occupational disease and also its prevalence today. The rapid development of chemicals since the end of World War II makes the problem far worse. New chemicals are currently being introduced at a rate of 3 000 each year. While many will be harmless, inevitably some will be dangerous and have both harmful and fatal effects on those who work on them...|$|R

40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} and the soil filters are water treatment devices using the filter material {{that in most}} cases consists of natural river gravel, coarse sand or crushed stone. This thesis deals with the research of unconventional filtration materials, or more precisely with examination {{of their ability to}} be used as an alternative medium that can ensure better cleaning effect.

40|$|Remediation mainly {{based on}} {{excavation}} and burial of the contaminated soil is impractical {{with regard to}} the large numbers of sites identified as being in need of remediation. Therefore alternative methods are needed for brownfield remediation. This study was conducted to assess a chemical stabilisation procedure of CCA-contaminated soil using iron-containing <b>blaster</b> <b>sand</b> or oxygen scarfing granulate. The stabilisation technique was assessed {{with regard to the}} feasibility of mixing ameliorants at an industrial scale and the efficiency of the stabilisation under different redox conditions. The stability was investigated under natural conditions in 1 -m 3 lysimeters in a field experiment and the effect of redox conditions was assessed in a laboratory experiment (10 l). The treatments with high additions of ameliorant (8 and 17 %) were more successful in both the laboratory and field experiments, even though there was enough iron on a stochiometric basis even at the lowest addition rates (0. 1 and 1 %). The particle size of the iron and the mixing influenced the stabilisation efficiency. The development of anaerobic conditions, simulated by water saturation, increases the fraction of AsIII and, consequently, arsenic mobility. The use of high concentrations of OSG under aerobic conditions increased the concentrations of Ni and Cu in the pore water. However, under anaerobic conditions, it decreased the arsenic leaching compared to the untreated soil and Ni and Cu leaching was not critical. The final destination of the treated soil should govern the amendment choice, e. g. an OSG concentration around 10 % may be suitable if the soil is to be landfilled under anaerobic conditions. Alternatively, the soil mixed with 1 % BS could be kept under aerobic conditions in a landfill cover or in situ at brownfield site. In addition, the treatment with BS appeared to produce better effects in the long term than with OSG. Validerad; 2007; 20070821 (soli...|$|R
40|$|Stabilisation of {{trace element}} {{contaminated}} soil is a soil remediation method {{used to reduce}} the mobile fraction of critical elements in the soil using soil additives (amendments). The stabilisation of trace elements occurs through i. e. sorption, co-precipitation or complex formation. In this work, different amendments and combinations of amendments {{have been added to}} chromate cupper arsenate (CCA) contaminated soil collected at a former wood preservation site at Robertsfors works, Sweden. The amendments used in the experiments were blast furnace slag (BFS), zerovalent iron (Fe 0), <b>blaster</b> <b>sand</b> (BS), coal fly ash (CFA) and peat. The changes in the element mobility were tested performing standard compliance batch leaching tests at L/S (liquid to solid ratio) 2 and 10. The purpose of the investigation was to increase knowledge about the behavior of the trace elements occurring in CCA contaminated soil when adding different amendments. One goal was to identify an amendment or combination of amendments that effectively stabilized the contaminants (reducing the mobility of the contaminants). A second goal was to test how the effectiveness of the selected amendment changed in different geochemical environments. To vary the geochemical environment the parameters pH, amount of water added to the soil and redox potential were controlled. The evaluation of the results was based on the leaching of As, but the behavior of the other trace elements e. g. chromium, copper was also considered. All amendments added alone decreased the mobility of As, except for peat which increased the amount of As in the leachate about 4 times. The most effective amendment to decrease the leaching of As was Fe 0 alone. Fe 0 also decreased the leaching of Cr, Cu and Zn. A combination of amendments that effectively reduced the mobility of the trace elements was Fe 0 and BFS together. When more water was added to the soil (L/S 10) it was observed that Fe 0 alone worked more effectively than the combination of BFS and Fe 0. Further investigations were made for the soil treated with Fe 0. The effect of redox could not be evaluated because the treatment with nitrogen gas of the samples during the leaching did not permit to reach low redox potential, i. e. to reach oxygen free conditions. The amount of water that was in contact with the soil had less effect on the mobility of As than the pH in the leachant. The pH was kept constant at pH 3, 5 and 8. The least amount of As was leached from the soil when pH was kept at 5. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
