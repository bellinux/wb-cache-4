5|$|In classes where {{horses are}} {{turned out in}} <b>saddle</b> seat equipment, it is typical for the horse to be shown in a single curb bit with a bit shank under , rather than the double bridle more common to other <b>saddle</b> seat breeds.

5|$|The {{mail pouch}} was a {{separate}} component to the <b>saddle</b> {{that made the}} Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time consuming detaching and attaching it from one <b>saddle</b> to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was thrown over the <b>saddle.</b> The <b>saddle</b> horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} {{can often be}} identified from its dorsal fin and <b>saddle</b> patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the <b>saddle</b> patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Saddles</b> from East Asia {{differ from}} Central Asian <b>saddles</b> by their high pommel and cantle {{and lack of}} a horn. East Asian <b>saddles</b> {{can be divided into}} several types that are {{associated}} with certain nationalities and ethnic groups. <b>Saddles</b> used by the Han Chinese are noted by their use of inlay work for ornamentation. Tibetan <b>saddles</b> typically employ iron covers inlaid with precious metals on the pommel and cantle and universally come with padding. [...] Mongolian <b>saddles</b> are similar to the Tibetan style except that they are typically smaller and the seat has a high ridge. <b>Saddles</b> from ethnic minority groups in China’s southwest, such as in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, have colorful lacquer work over a leather covering.|$|R

5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a <b>saddle</b> {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a <b>saddle,</b> and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under <b>saddle</b> and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under <b>saddle</b> until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, the Anglo-Norman {{studbook}} was {{combined with}} other regional warmblood <b>saddle</b> horses such as the Demi-sang du Centre and the Vendéen {{in order to create}} a unified national warmblood studbook for the Selle Français or French <b>saddle</b> horse. The French government actively supported the merger of regional types and breeds with a large financial appropriation. In spite of this merger, for decades afterwards, horses from Anglo-Norman bloodlines were clearly identifiable within the Selle Français due to differences in conformation.|$|E

40|$|National audienceCapsule Nasal <b>saddles</b> have no {{negative}} consequences apart from, under some circumstances, a potential bias in social relationships. Aims To test {{the effect of}} nasal <b>saddles</b> on Teal Anas crecca, Wigeon A. penelope, Mallard A. platyrhynchos and Pintail A. acuta. Methods The following features were compared between <b>saddled</b> and unsaddled individuals: body mass change of wild Teal between ringing and first live recovery, pairing probability of wild Teal through the winter, wild Teal and Wigeon time-budgets, captive Mallard and Pintail body mass fluctuations, testosterone levels and dominance in the aviary. Results We generally found {{no significant difference between}} values for birds with nasal <b>saddles</b> and control birds. Exceptions were for pairing probability, which was lower for marked Teal during one of the winters, and the proportion of aggressive interactions won by Pintail, which decreased after they were fitted with <b>saddles,</b> while this did not happen in Mallard. Conclusions Nasal <b>saddles</b> are an appropriate general method for marking dabbling ducks. However, <b>saddles</b> may not be appropriate for the study of social relationships in some conditions...|$|R

5|$|The Kentucky Mountain <b>Saddle</b> Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky. Developed as an {{all-around}} farm and riding horse in eastern Kentucky, it {{is related to}} the Tennessee Walking Horse and other gaited breeds. In 1989 the Kentucky Mountain <b>Saddle</b> Horse Association (KMSHA) was formed, and in 2002, the subsidiary Spotted Mountain Horse Association (SMHA) was developed to register Kentucky Mountain <b>Saddle</b> Horses with excessive white markings and pinto patterns. Conformation standards are the same for the two groups of horses, with the main difference being the color requirements. The KMSHA studbook is now closed to horses from unregistered parents, although it cross-registers with several other registries, while the SMHA studbook remains open.|$|E

50|$|Most flat racing <b>saddles</b> weigh {{less than}} 1½ pounds; the lightest <b>saddles</b> weigh {{as little as}} 8 ounces. They {{generally}} have only one billet to attach the girth, and so an overgirth is usually added to keep it secure. <b>Saddles</b> used in steeplechases are generally slightly heavier and more substantial, usually being built on a full tree. Exercise <b>saddles</b> are usually larger and heavier, with a more prominent pommel and cantle to provide more security to the rider. Though these features add pounds, weight does not matter as it would in a race.|$|R

40|$|Game-theoretic {{solution}} concepts, such as Nash equilibrium, {{are playing}} an ever increasing {{role in the}} study of systems of autonomous computational agents. A common criticism of Nash equilibrium is that its existence relies on the possibility of randomizing over actions, which in many cases is deemed unsuitable, impractical, or even infeasible. In work dating back to the early 1950 s Lloyd Shapley proposed ordinal setvalued solution concepts for zero-sum games that he refers to as strict and weak <b>saddles.</b> These concepts are intuitively appealing, they always exist, and are unique in important subclasses of games. We initiate the study of computational aspects of Shapley’s <b>saddles</b> and provide polynomial-time algorithms for computing strict <b>saddles</b> in normal-form games and weak <b>saddles</b> in a subclass of symmetric zero-sum games. On the other hand, we show that certain problems associated with weak <b>saddles</b> in bimatrix games are NP-hard. Finally, we extend our results to mixed refinements of Shapley’s <b>saddles</b> introduced by Duggan and Le Breton...|$|R
