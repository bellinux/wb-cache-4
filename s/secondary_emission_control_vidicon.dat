40|$|While {{small and}} medium size biomass {{combined}} heat and power (CHP) plants (i. e., up to 5 MW of electrical rated power) represent an attractive option to exploit locally available biomass resources at low cost, the corresponding investment {{per unit of}} rated power significantly rises when the installed power decreases. In these cases, <b>secondary</b> pollutant <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> measures are most of the time not economically viable and primary <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> must be used alone to avoid the formation of undesired compounds such as $NO_x$ and $SO_x$. Primary control measures require the careful optimization of fuel quality and combustion process. For plant operators, being able to accommodate biomass quality changes in order to minimize the fuel cost can be of great importance in order to guarantee the profitability of the plant. This contribution is dedicated {{to the development of a}} zero-dimensional (input-output) combustion simulation model able to predict the pollutants emissions resulting from complete and incomplete combustion with respect to varying combustion operation (ambient temperature, humidity, fumes recirculation, [...] ). This tool is intended to be integrated in a global simulation model of the CHP plant and the attached district heating network installed on the University campus in Liège. Doing so, the plant operation can be optimized with respect to economic as well as environmental and energetic aspects (3 E approach) thus ensuring the sustainability of the approach.

(All copper surfaces used in this study were oxygen-free, high-conductivity grade). The purpose of this investigation is to provide information necessary to develop high-efficiency multistage depressed collectors (MDC's) for microwave amplifier traveling-wave tubes (TWT's) for communications and aircraft applications.

Samples of textured carbon surfaces on copper substrates typical of three different levels of treatment are prepared and tested for this study.

50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>emission</b> {{in physics}} is a {{phenomenon}} where primary incident particles of sufficient energy, when hitting a surface or passing through some material, induce the <b>emission</b> of <b>secondary</b> particles. The term often refers to the emission of electrons when charged particles like electrons or ions in a vacuum tube strike a metal surface; these are called secondary electrons. In this case, the number of secondary electrons emitted per incident particle is called <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> yield. If the secondary particles are ions, the effect is termed <b>secondary</b> ion <b>emission.</b> <b>Secondary</b> electron <b>emission</b> is used in photomultiplier tubes and image intensifier tubes to amplify {{the small number of}} photoelectrons produced by photoemission, making the tube more sensitive. It also occurs as an undesirable side effect in electronic vacuum tubes when electrons from the cathode strike the anode, and can cause parasitic oscillation.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how regional inequalities {{are affected by}} <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> via credit trading and availability of absorption sources. We assume that homogeneous goods are costly traded without <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> and that the rural areas have an advantage {{in terms of the}} availability of absorption sources. We especially focus on the long-term effects of firm relocation. Our two key findings are as follows. First, in the case where an <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> scheme is implemented without allowing for offsetting emissions with carbon absorption sources (carbon sinks), strengthening the <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> drives firms to relocate from rural areas to urban areas, in the case that wage levels remain unchanged in both areas. As a result, regional inequalities in terms of both the number of firms and relative public welfare are enlarged by <b>emission</b> <b>controls.</b> Our second finding shows that in the case in which the <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> scheme allows for emissions-absorption offsetting, strengthening <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> has mixed effects on the relative welfare of rural areas. Numerical simulations show that when the costs associated with transporting differentiated goods are relatively low, the introduction of <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> with an offsetting system results in greater inequality across regions compared with introducing emissio...|$|R
50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>emission</b> can be {{undesirable}} {{such as in}} the tetrode {{thermionic valve}} (tube). In this instance the positively charged screen grid can accelerate the electron stream sufficiently to cause <b>secondary</b> <b>emission</b> at the anode (plate).

It is also partly responsible for this type of valve (tube), particularly early types with anodes not treated to reduce <b>secondary</b> <b>emission,</b> exhibiting a 'negative resistance' characteristic, which could cause the tube to become unstable. This side effect could be put to use by using some older valves (e.g., type 77 pentode) as dynatron oscillators. This effect was prevented by adding a third grid to the tetrode, called the suppressor grid, to repel the electrons back toward the plate. This tube was called the pentode.|$|R
