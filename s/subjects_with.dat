5|$|In the 2008–2009 {{prospectus}} in Singapore, the National University of Singapore (NUS) {{accepts the}} IBDP {{as a high}} school qualification for Singapore universities. University requirements are as follows: three HL <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> scores of 5 or better, two SL <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> scores of 4 or better, and a grade of 4 or better in English A, Standard Level. In addition, the Singaporean students are to fulfil a Mother Tongue criteria with a score or 4 or better for Language A/B Mother Tongue.|$|E
5|$|Oral trauma, {{including}} {{recession of}} gingival tissue and dental fracture and wear. Recession of gingival tissue affects 19% to 68% of <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> lip and/or intra-oral ornaments. In some cases, the alveolar tooth-bearing bone is also involved, jeopardizing {{the stability and}} durability of the teeth in place and requiring a periodontal regeneration surgery. Dental fracture and wear affects 14% to 41% of <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> lip and/or intra-oral ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Depictions in {{classical}} art are rare for such striking birds. The only known Ancient Egyptian {{example is a}} relief, probably of a little green bee-eater, on a wall of Queen Hatshepsut's mortuary temple, and an early Roman mural depicting blue-cheeked bee-eaters {{was found in the}} villa of Agrippina. Bee-eaters have been depicted on the postage stamps of at least 38 countries, the European and Carmine bee-eaters being the most common <b>subjects,</b> <b>with</b> 18 and 11 countries respectively.|$|E

5|$|He {{was said}} to have been crowned by St Humbert (Bishop Humbert of Elmham) on 25 December 855, at a {{location}} known as Burna (probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk) which at that time functioned as the royal capital. Later versions of his life recorded that he was a model king who treated all his <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> equal justice and who was unbending to flatterers. It was written that he withdrew for a year to his royal tower at Hunstanton and learned the whole Psalter, so that he could recite it from memory.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Hues {{lived in}} Oxford where he {{discussed}} mathematics and allied <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> like-minded friends. Cormack states {{he was a}} fellow at the University. Under the terms of the will of Thomas Harriot, who died on 2 July 1621, Hues and Warner were given the responsibility of helping Harriot's executor Nathaniel Torporley to prepare Harriot's mathematical papers for publication. Hues was also required to help price Harriot's books and other possessions for sale to the Bodleian Library.|$|E

Markinson orders Gabe to infiltrate Rhoemer's stronghold in Ukraine to inject test <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> a vaccine and locate Phagan, who is now Rhoemer's prisoner. In the catacombs, Phagan tells Gabe that Lian is alive, and they reunite. Lian has become infected with Syphon Filter, and she says there is no universal cure.|$|E

5|$|Primary and {{secondary}} education focused on racial biology, population policy, culture, geography and especially physical fitness. The curriculum in most subjects, including biology, geography and even arithmetic, was altered to change the focus to race. Military education became the central component of physical education and education in physics was oriented toward <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> military applications, such as ballistics and aerodynamics. Students were required to watch all films prepared by the school division of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.|$|E

She {{graduated}} with her dual Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MB, BS) degree in March 1921, achieving first-class honours in all <b>subjects,</b> <b>with</b> a first in medicine and fourth in surgery. She won the Keith Levi Memorial Scholarship in medicine and the Sameson Prize in clinical medicine, and became a resident surgeon at Royal Melbourne Hospital under Sir Alan Newton.|$|E
5|$|The lens {{exhibits}} significant distortion {{in keeping}} with the problems of wide-angle lenses. The complex barrel distortion is approximately 2.9% at 8mm focal length but is fairly insignificant as the focal length is raised above 12mm, according to Photozone.de. PC Magazine reports 3.1% distortion at 8mm and 0.7% at 12mm. It also reports that distortion switches to pincushion distortion of 1.4% at 16mm. SLAR Gear reports that the point of convergence between barrel and pincushion is about 13mm. Foreground subjects seem abnormally large compared to similar background <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> this lens.|$|E

She {{gradually}} opens up her feelings of ignorance and being out of her depth at court; they also discuss court politics and academic <b>subjects,</b> <b>with</b> her admirer offering advice and encouragement about her growing knowledge. Meanwhile, Mel meets Merindar's reclusive son Flauvic and pursues a brief relationship with him before realizing that she has no real feelings for him. Through this relationship experience, she begins to realize her exchange of letters has become a courtship, though {{she does not know}} her admirer's identity.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{investigation}} into human CD36 as well. A study examined oral detection of fat in obese <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> genetic bases for high, medium, and low expression of the CD36 receptor. Those <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> high CD36 expression were eight times more sensitive to certain fats (oleic acid and triolein) than the <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> low CD36 expression. Those <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> an intermediate amount of CD36 expression were sensitive to fat at a level between {{the high and low}} groups. This study demonstrates that there is a significant relationship between oral fat sensitivity and the amount of CD36 receptor expression, but further investigation into CD36 could be useful for learning more about lipid tasting in the context of obesity, as CD36 may be a target for therapies in the future.|$|E
