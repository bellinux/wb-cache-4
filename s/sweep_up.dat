5|$|The planets {{were formed}} 4.6 {{billion years ago}} in the protoplanetary disk that {{surrounded}} the early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The radiation pressure of the solar wind then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to <b>sweep</b> <b>up,</b> or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many impact craters on the Moon. During this period, some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have formed the Moon.|$|E

500|$|Strong led a <b>sweep</b> <b>up</b> {{the river}} and met with no {{resistance}} while a squad of trackers including Tourle moved south, towards Kariba. This latter group spotted the 10 insurgents in ambush in another gully at 13:30 on 19 July and a fierce battle ensued. The RLI squad leader's faulty radio set meant that {{he was unable to}} issue orders, leading Tourle to take the initiative by shouting orders to soldiers around him. This made him the subject of concentrated ZIPRA fire, but he nevertheless directed the RLI actions throughout the contact while also accounting for most of the opposing force personally. [...] "Tourle," [...] says Binda, [...] "armed with an MAG, moved with one other man to a rocky outcrop overlooking the enemy position and laid down a withering fire." [...] Under this cover Corporals Johnstone and Strydom flanked right and eliminated a ZIPRA sniper, while Corporal Kirkwood and Lance-Corporal Coom moved to the left. A sweep was then carried out, during which a guerrilla jumped out of cover and opened fire, wounding Coom; Johnstone killed the insurgent. The remainder of the search revealed the other nine cadres dead, six having been killed by Tourle. The remaining seven cadres were captured or killed {{over the course of the}} next week, leaving none unaccounted for when the operation ended at 12:00 on 26 July 1968.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the style}} of the work is {{thoroughly}} classicising, the overall form reflects the grandest type of the medieval Italian wall tomb, in which the vertical piling-up of a series of different elements is characteristic. Italian Gothic sculpture always retained considerable elements of classicism, and it was not necessary for Donatello and Michelozzo to adopt a radically original overall scheme from those of Tino di Camaino (c.1285–1337), the Siennese sculptor whose wall-tombs of a century before had been very influential throughout Italy. [...] A life-size marble effigy lying on top of an elevated protruding sarcophagus is highly typical. [...] The motif of curtains at the top is often found in monuments using Gothic decorative details, and the shape recalls the triangular gable tops of monuments in a more thoroughly Gothic style; other monuments have curtains, often held open by angels, around the effigy, and then sculptures above. The Cossa monument is often compared to the monument to Doge Tommaso Mocenigo of Venice, of 1423, which has high relief saints in shell niches on and above the sarcophagus, above which a large pair of curtains <b>sweep</b> <b>up</b> to a single terminal; however the architectural detailing here is Gothic. The design of the Cossa tomb itself was elaborated on, and adapted to local conventions, in the tomb by the same team for Cardinal Brancacci in Naples, and influenced the monument to Leonardo Bruni by Bernardo Rossellino, of about 20years later, in the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence.|$|E

[...] "In any event, the most relevant common attribute of the enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives is not 'completion'. [...] Rather, it is that all of these offenses, while not technically crimes against the person, nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury".

2500|$|While {{this was}} taking place Ganteaume and his 21 ships of the line {{carrying}} 18,000 troops were to have sailed from Brest on 23 November, passed through the English Channel and into the North Sea, and then sailed around the coast of Scotland.

While a full-scale invasion of Ireland was under way Ganteaume would sail around {{the west coast of}} Ireland, arriving in the Western Approaches in time to meet Villeneuve and Missiessy's forces returning from the West Indies. With a combined force of nearly 40 ships of the line, the French would <b>sweep</b> <b>up</b> the Channel to Boulogne and effect the third and final part of the plan, the invasion of England. [...] This plan, dependant on the weather, the non-interference of the British and subject to the vagaries of communication over thousands of miles of ocean verged on the impossible.

2500|$|The ruby {{slippers}} play {{an integral}} {{role in the}} 1985 Walt Disney Pictures film Return to Oz, for which Disney had to obtain rights from MGM to use reproductions in the film. Unlike the originals, the hand-made British spool-heeled shoes for Return to Oz were covered in hundreds of dark red crystals. The stones were soaked in sulfuric acid to remove the silver backing, and two types of glue were used to affix them to the shoes (a spray glue and an optical glue). No matter what was done, the stones kept falling off during filming. Stagehands were specifically hired to <b>sweep</b> <b>up</b> loose [...] "rubies" [...] that would fall off the slippers after a scene was shot. Being little girls, actresses Fairuza Balk who played Dorothy and Emma Ridley who played Princess Ozma, simply could not keep from playing, skipping and tapping their heels, so eventually {{they were required to}} take off the slippers between takes. Effects were later added in post production to give the slippers their magical glow. Simple, red grosgrain ribbon with additional stones were used for the bows. Seven pairs were made for the filming: two pairs, size one, for Ridley, three size twos for Balk and two men's size 11 for the Nome King played by actor Nicol Williamson.|$|E

2500|$|In 1883, Luther Standing Bear {{was sent}} to Philadelphia to work as an intern for John Wanamaker.

Luther was told by Pratt: [...] "My boy you are going away from us to work for this school. Go and do your best. The majority of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing. They think he can neither work nor learn anything; that he is very dirty. Now you are going to prove that the red man can learn and work as well as the white man.

[...] While riding on street cars in Philadelphia, Luther did not care to listen to the vulgar language used by white boys on the way to work. At the end of his internship, the entire Carlisle school students and faculty traveled to a large meeting hall in Philadelphia where Pratt and Wanamaker spoke. Luther was asked to come to the stage, and Wanamaker told the students that Luther had been promoted from one department to another every month getting better work and better money and in spite of the fact that he employed over one thousand people, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as Luther.|$|E
2500|$|UK law grants the {{greatest}} protection to banks or other parties that contract for a security interest. If a security is [...] "fixed" [...] over a particular asset, this gives priority in being paid over other creditors, including employees and most {{small businesses that}} have traded with the insolvent company. A [...] "floating charge", which is not permitted in many countries and remains controversial in the UK, can <b>sweep</b> <b>up</b> all future assets, but the holder is subordinated in statute to a limited sum of employees' wage and pension claims, and around 20 per cent for other unsecured creditors. Security interests have to be publicly registered, {{on the theory that}} transparency will assist commercial creditors in understanding a company's financial position before they contract. However the law still allows [...] "title retention clauses" [...] and [...] "Quistclose trusts" [...] which function just like security but {{do not have to be}} registered. Secured creditors generally dominate insolvency procedures, because a floating charge holder can select the administrator of its choice. In law, administrators are meant to prioritise rescuing a company, and owe a duty to all creditors. In practice, these duties are seldom found to be broken, and the most typical outcome is that an insolvent company's assets are sold as a going concern to a new buyer, which can often include the former management: but free from creditors' claims and potentially with many job losses. Other possible procedures include a [...] "voluntary arrangement", if three quarters of creditors can voluntarily agree to give the company a debt haircut, receivership in a limited number of enterprise types, and liquidation where a company's assets are finally sold off. Enforcement rates by insolvency practitioners remain low, but in theory an administrator or liquidator can apply for transactions at an undervalue to be cancelled, or unfair preferences to some creditors be revoked. Directors can be sued for breach of duty, or disqualified, including negligently trading a company when it could not have avoided insolvency. Insolvency law's basic principles still remain significantly contested, and its rules show a compromise of conflicting views.|$|E
2500|$|While {{corporate}} governance primarily concerns the general relative {{rights and duties}} of shareholders, employees and directors in terms of administration and accountability, corporate finance concerns how the monetary or capital stake of shareholders and creditors are mediated, given {{the risk that the}} business may fail and become insolvent. Companies can fund their operations either through debt (i.e. loans) or equity (i.e. shares). In return for loans, typically from a bank, companies will often be required by contract to give their creditors a security interest over the company's assets, so that in the event of insolvency, the creditor may take the secured asset. The Insolvency Act 1986 limits powerful creditors ability to <b>sweep</b> <b>up</b> all company assets as security, particularly through a floating charge, in favour of vulnerable creditors, such as employees or consumers. If money is raised by offering shares, the shareholders' relations are determined as a group by the provisions under the constitution. The law requires disclosure of all material facts in promotions, and prospectuses. Company constitutions typically require that existing shareholders have a pre-emption right, to buy newly issued shares before outside shareholders and thus avoid their stake and control becoming diluted. Actual rights, however, are determined by ordinary principles of construction of the company constitution. A host of rules exist to ensure that the company's capital (i.e. the amount that shareholders paid in when they bought their shares) is maintained for the benefit of creditors. Money is typically distributed to shareholders through dividends as the reward for investment. These should only come out of profits, or surpluses beyond the capital account. If companies pay out money to shareholders which in effect is a dividend [...] "disguised" [...] as something else, directors will be liable for repayment. Companies may, however, reduce their capital to a lower figure if directors of private companies warrant solvency, or courts approve a public company's reduction. Because a company buying back shares from shareholders in itself, or taking back redeemable shares, has the same effect as a reduction of capital, similar transparency and procedural requirements need to be fulfilled. Public companies are also precluded from giving financial assistance for purchase of their shares, for example through a leveraged buyout, unless the company is delisted and or taken private. Finally, in order to protect investors from being placed at an unfair disadvantage, people inside a company are under a strict duty to not trade on any information that could affect a company's share price for their own benefit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Massive stars evolve {{across the}} HR diagram, losing mass {{along the way}} and forming a variety of ring nebulae. During the main {{sequence}} stage, the fast stellar wind <b>sweeps</b> <b>up</b> the ambient interstellar medium to form an interstellar bubble. After a massive star evolves into a red giant or a luminous blue variable, it loses mass copiously to form a circumstellar nebula. As it evolves further into a WR star, the fast WR wind <b>sweeps</b> <b>up</b> the previous mass loss and forms a circumstellar bubble. Observations of ring nebulae around massive stars not only are fascinating, but also are useful in providing templates to diagnose the progenitors of supernovae from their circumstellar nebulae. In this review, I will summarize the characteristics of ring nebulae around massive stars throughout the HR diagram, show recent advances in X-ray observations of bubble interiors, and compare supernovae’s circumstellar nebulae with known types of ring nebulae around massive stars. 1...|$|R
