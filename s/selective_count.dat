40|$|The agar RCPB pH 5 {{has been}} {{considered}} a good alternative for counts of Bifidobacterium in yoghurt. However, during the refrigerated storage of yoghurt {{it is extremely difficult}} to count this microorganism due {{to the size of the}} colonies, which are so small they require the aid of a stereoscope to count them. Another agar, MRS-LP, has been also recommended for counts of Bifidobacterium in the presence of yoghurt bacteria. This study evaluated the supplementation of RCPB pH 5 agar with dehydrated liver extract and the salts KH 2 PO 4, K 2 HPO 4, FeSO 47 H 2 O, MnSO 4 H 2 O and MgSO 47 H 2 O, aiming at improving the differentiation of Bifidobacterium in yoghurt after refrigerated storage, and also evaluated the <b>selective</b> <b>count</b> of Bifidobacterium in yoghurt using the agar MRS-LP. The agar MRS-LP presented the same cell recovery as non-fortified RCPB pH 5 agar, used as a standard medium, thus being considered a good option for counts of Bifidobacterium in yoghurt. The fortified RCPB pH 5 also presented the same recovery as the standard RCPB pH 5 medium, however, the addition of dehydrated liver extract to the RCPB pH 5 agar considerably increased the size of the Bifidobacterium colonies after refrigerated storage, making differentiation of the colonies much easier and reliable when compared to the standard non-fortified RPCP pH 5. The addition of the salts (KH 2 PO 4, K 2 HPO 4, FeSO 47 H 2 O, MnSO 4 H 2 O and MgSO 47 H 2 O) had no influence on the performance of the RCPB pH 5 agar.

40|$|Using a {{confocal}} epi-illuminated microscope {{together with}} a pulsed laser, new applications of the recently developed, real-time spectroscopic technique BIFL (burst integrated fluorescence lifetime) are introduced. BIFL registers {{two different types of}} information on every detected photon with regard to the macroscopic time scale of a measurement and to the fluorescence lifetime. Thus, it is shown to be well suited to identify freely diffusing single dye molecules via their characteristic fluorescence lifetime. This allows for <b>selective</b> <b>counting</b> of dye molecules in an open volume element and opens up the possibility to quantify the relative concentration of the dye molecules, using a recently derived theoretical model, which analyzes the obtained burst size distribution of a sample survey. A closed theory is presented to calculate the probability of a specific dye to cause a fluorescence burst containing a certain number of detected photons. It considers the distribution of the excitation irradiance over the detection volume together with saturation effects of the fluorescence and of the detection electronics, the probability of different transit times through the detection volume, and the probability of multimolecule events. Using BIFL together with <b>selective</b> <b>counting,</b> the concentration of two dyes, Rhodamine B and Rhodamine 6 G, in separate solutions and in a mixture were determined.

40|$|Several {{milestones}} in {{the development}} of semiconductor radiation imaging detectors are attributed to scientists from the Low Countries, the Netherlands and Belgium, and a few historical details will be highlighted. The very first usable semiconductor nuclear detector was made in Utrecht, around 1943, {{in the form of an}} AgCl crystal. The earliest large-scale application of monolithic, double- sided silicon strip detectors was in the BOL experiment around 1968 at IKO, now NIKHEF, in Amsterdam. The technology developed and patented by Philips and IKO was adapted by the author and coworkers in 1980 to produce the first silicon microstrip detector used for the reconstruction of events in a CERN fixed target experiment. An avalanche of developments then led to worldwide use of silicon microstrip detectors in elementary particle physics, motivated by the capability to reconstruct particles with lifetime similar to 10 **- ** 1 ** 2 s, which decay on sub-millimeter scale. The intensive activity in silicon detector R&D culminated in 1991 in the construction of fine-grained 2 D monolithic and hybrid pixel detectors that incorporate sophisticated electronic functions in each microscopic detection element, with typical dimensions of 25 - 100 mum.

A presumptive identification of 1, 077 isolates by four biochemical tests disclosed that SCR, RSH, and ESD selected high, comparable percentages of strains that approximated most closely the typical description of enterococci (66, 60. 1, and 58 %, respectively).

The method is based on differential yeast growth on a medium containing cycloheximide and a medium containing lysine as only nitrogen source (lysine agar). The cycloheximide resistance of 45 yeast strains belonging to Candida stellata, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Hanseniaspora guilliermondii, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Torulaspora delbrueckii, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans and Zygoascus hellenicus, and 14 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus on WL nutrient agar, was assayed. Cycloheximide resistance is characteristic of the species H. uvarum, H. guilliermondii and Z. hellenicus, while for the other yeasts {{it depends on the}} strain and the concentration of cycloheximide used. Two mg/L of cycloheximide allows <b>selective</b> <b>counting</b> of a strain of C. stellata (Cs 3) compared to one of the sensitive S. cerevisiae strain (NDA 21).

Among the principal advantages of the method are its high sensitivity and freedom from errors due to reagent and laboratory contamination. These data have considerable significance {{in the fields of}} geochemistry and cosmochemistry. Each of these elements, except platinum, is separated after irradiation from the sample matrices by use of carriers and specific radiochemical separation techniques.

40|$|The {{development}} of energy <b>selective,</b> photon <b>counting</b> X-ray detectors {{allows for a}} wide range of new possibilities in the area of computed tomographic image formation. Under the assumption of perfect energy resolution, here we propose a tensor-based iterative algorithm that simultaneously reconstructs the X-ray attenuation distribution for each energy. We use a multi-linear image model rather than a more standard "stacked vector" representation in order to develop novel tensor-based regularizers. Specifically, we model the multi-spectral unknown as a 3 -way tensor where the first two dimensions are space and the third dimension is energy. This approach allows for the design of tensor nuclear norm regularizers, which like its two dimensional counterpart, is a convex function of the multi-spectral unknown. The solution to the resulting convex optimization problem is obtained using an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. Simulation results shows that the generalized tensor nuclear norm can be used as a stand alone regularization technique for the energy selective (spectral) computed tomography (CT) problem and when combined with total variation regularization it enhances the regularization capabilities especially at low energy images where the effects of noise are most prominent...|$|R

In addition, standardized. microbiological analyses are characterised by the high cost of the method, both in terms of labor and supplies, and. above all, by the long time needed to obtain definitive results (from 3 to 7 days).

It was also successfully applied to detect changes in microbial community composition of drinking water caused by changing environmental factors. Generally, the method {{can be used as a}} fast fingerprinting method of microbial communities in aquatic samples and as a tool to detect shifts within these communities. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a new {{technique}} to evaluate the number of spores incorporated in splash droplets by the use of an engineered fluorescent pathogen strain and image analysis hardware and software. The inoculum source consisted of a tomato leaflet infected with a Phytophthora infestans strain transformed with the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Splash droplets formed after impact of incident drops on sporulating lesions were collected on microscope slides located at different distances from the source. Each slide was examined using a fluorescent microscope to visualize the GFP expressing sporangia. Photographs were taken and assessed using image processing to count the sporangia incorporated in each droplet. Data analysis confirmed characteristics of splash dispersal shown using other methods. The use of fluorescent sporangia also facilitates the <b>selective</b> detection and <b>counting</b> of viable (living) sporangia, and is a tool that can be use in the study of splash dispersed diseases...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} focuses of today's dairy {{industry}} worldwide is the continued development of new products, especially probiotic-based products. Buttermilk is originally a by-product of butter making fermented by Mesophilic Aromatic Cultures (MAC). It can also be made by fermentation of pasteurized whole milk or skimmed milk. This product is not marketed in Brazil. The objectives of this work were: (1) to develop a selective medium for Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis enumeration and (2) to determine the viability of this microorganism during the shelf life of the buttermilk. Skim milk added with 10 % sucrose or 0. 03 % sucralose was pasteurized and inoculated with a composite starter culture consisting of 1 % MAC (containing Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris) and 2 % Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis. To attain <b>selective</b> <b>counts</b> of Bif. animalis subsp. lactis the MRS agar supplemented with 0. 5 % L-cysteine hydrochloride at 10 %, 1 % lithium chloride at 10 %, 0. 01 % aniline blue and 0. 5 % dicloxacillin at 0. 1 % was modified by increasing the antibiotic concentration, addition of NaCl, adjusting pH to 4. 8 or increasing the incubation temperature (from 37 to 45 ºC). Raising the incubation temperature to 45 ºC {{was found to be}} efficient in inhibiting the MAC cultures, even in media not added with dicloxacillin. Bif. animalis subsp. lactis exhibited high viability in the product. The buttermilk product prepared with sucrose and sweetener contained in excess of 10 (8) cfu. ml- 1 bifidobacteria throughout the shelf life of the product (28 days). Atualmente, um dos principais focos da indústria de laticínios em todo o mundo é o desenvolvimento de novos produtos, especialmente probióticos. Buttermilk é originalmente um sub-produto do processamento da manteiga fermentado por Culturas Aromáticas Mesofílicas (MAC). Pode também ser feito pela fermentação de leite integral ou desnatado. Este produto não é comercializado no Brasil. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram o desenvolvimento de meio de cultura seletivo para Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis e a determinação da viabilidade deste microrganismo durante a vida de prateleira do buttermilk produzido. Leite desnatado foi adicionado de 10 % da sacarose ou 0, 03 % de sucralose, pasteurizado e inoculado com 1 % de MAC composto por Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis e Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris e por 2 % de Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis. Para obter contagens seletivas de Bif. animalis subsp. lactis, o meio MRS ágar suplementado com 0, 5 % L-cisteína HCl a 10 %, 1 % cloreto de lítio a 10 %, 0, 01 % azul de anilina e 0, 5 % dicloxacilina a 0, 1 % foi modificado pelo aumento da concentração de antibiótico, adição de NaCl, ajuste de pH para 4, 8 ou aumento da temperatura de incubação (de 37 para 45 ºC). A temperatura de incubação de 45 ºC foi eficiente para inibir as culturas MAC mesmo sem adição de antibiótico ao meio. Bif. animalis subsp. lactis apresentou alta viabilidade no produto.

40|$|The {{induction}} of aneuploidy in cultured mammalian cells {{has been}} studied using two chemical agents, diethylstilboestrol dipropionate and Colcemid, which act on the mitotic spin-dle, in order to investigate different methods of scoring and statistical analysis. Two cell lines, one human and the other Chinese hamster, were each exposed to one test agent, and metaphase preparations scored (a) counting all the chromo-somes and (b) counting only the chromosomes of a selected group within the karyotype, to assess {{which would be the}} more rapid means of scoring metaphases for aneuploidy. Both the numbers of aneuploid cells and, where appropriate, the total numbers of chromosomes lost and gained were analys-ed using regression analysis, G-statistics and x 2 or Fisher's exact test. The results indicate that <b>counting</b> <b>selective</b> chromo-somes may in certain circumstances be advantageous, but will result in many more metaphases being required to be scored. Regression analysis to demonstrate dose response is suitable for the analysis of strong positives, but it is suggested that with weak inducers of aneuploidy, the additional tests cited above, using either the number of aneuploid cells or the ac-tual number of chromosomes lost and gained are more sen-sitive measures of the effects...|$|R
40|$|The Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch) is a {{reliable}} neuropsychological assessment of attention control in children. Methylphenidate (MPH) {{is an effective}} treatment to improve attentional difficulties in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous studies investigating the effects of MPH on attention performance of children with ADHD have produced mixed results and prior MPH usage may have confounded these results. No previous study has tested the effects of MPH on the entire TEA-Ch battery. This study investigated the effects of MPH on attention performance using the entire TEA-Ch in 51 medication-na?ve children with ADHD compared with 35 nonmedicated typically developing children. All children were tested at baseline and after 6 weeks: The children with ADHD were medication-na?ve at baseline, received MPH for 6 weeks and were tested whilst on medication at the second testing session. A beneficial effect of MPH administration was found {{on at least one}} subtest of each of the three forms of attention (selective, sustained, and attentional control) assessed by the TEA-Ch, independent of practice effects. MPH aided performance on the TEA-Ch tasks that were inherently nonarousing and that might require top-down control of attention. It is recommended that the TEA-Ch measures?Sky Search <b>Count</b> (<b>selective</b> attention),Score!

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{clinical}} and microbiological study was to evaluate longitudinally the changes occurring in the subgingival microbiota in children following the placement of orthodontic bands {{in the absence of}} a prophylactic oral hygiene program. A total of 12 children in the age between 10 and 15 years were selected for the study. The experimental group (E) consisted of 6 subjects scheduled for orthodontic treatment including the placement of fixed appliances. They were seen 1 week before and just prior to the placement of orthodontic bands. The control group (C) involved 6 children in the maintenance phase of orthodontic therapy in which removable retainers were used. All subjects were examined at 3 - 5 week intervals for a period of 4 months. At each examination, microbiological subgingival plaque samples were collected by means of sterile paper points. Plaque and gingival index scores as well as pocket probing depth at the site of sampling were determined. The microbiological samples were processed using continuous anaerobic culturing techniques and were plated on non-selective and <b>selective</b> media. Differential <b>counts</b> and biochemical characterization of isolates were performed according to the methods described by Kornman and Loesche. Following tooth-banding, an increase in pocket probing depth was observed, while the P 1 I and GI scores remained unaffected. A statistically significant increase from baseline values (p less than 0. 05) was found for the %s of black-pigmented bacteroides, the B. intermedius and A. odontolyticus species, concomitantly with a decrease of the anaerobe/facultative bacteria ratio in the experimental, but not the control sites.

40|$|The entomopathogenic fungus L. lecanii {{has been}} {{developed}} as biopesticides and used widely for biological control of several insects in agricultural practice. Due {{to the lack of}} isolation/count methods for L. lecanii in soil, the persistence of this fungus in soil appears to have attracted no attention. A <b>selective</b> medium and <b>count</b> method for L. lecanii in soil based on cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was developed, and then the persistence and viability of this fungus in soil were investigated under field conditions between 2012 and 2014. The results showed that the rate of recovery for L. lecanii in soil on the selective CTAB medium was satisfactory. The minimum CFUs for L. lecanii on the selective medium (0. 5 g/L CTAB) was about 102 conidia/g soil. The L. lecanii density in soil declined quickly in the first month after inoculation with fungal conidia, kept stable for 6 to 10 months, and then decreased gradually until undetectable. L. lecanii could persist for at least 14 months in the agricultural soil of northern China. The colony growth, conidia yield and germination rate on plates, as well as the median lethal concentration or times (LC 50 or LT 50) to aphids, mycelium growth in aphids and sporulation on aphids of L. lecanii did not change significantly during the persistence in soil. In general, the count method developed here was a very useful tool for monitoring the dynamics of natural or introduced L. lecanii populations in soil, and the data on the persistence of L. lecanii in soil reported here were helpful for biological control and environmental risk assessment...|$|R

The present work aimed to verify whether it is possible, {{by means of the}} counts of microorganism in the bulk raw milk ill four selective culture media, to establish a correlation with the occurrence of mastitis and therefore, to monitor this disease in bovine dairy herds. The following selective culture media were Used: KF Streptococcus Agar, Edwards Agar, Baird-Parker Agar, Blood Agar plus potassium tellurite. Spearman`s correlation coefficient was calculated in order to compare the Occurrence of mastitis (percentage) in each herd with respective <b>selective</b> culture media <b>counts</b> of microorganisms in bulk raw milk. Thirty-six possibilities were analysed (Tamis and CMT-positive rates were compared with the log-transformed <b>count</b> in four <b>selective</b> Culture media) and there was a negative correlation between Tamis 3 and the Baird-Parker Agar plate count. The total results of microbiological tests showed that there were three correlations of the <b>counts</b> in <b>selective</b> culture media. Fifty-two possibilities were analysed and there was a negative correlation between no-bacteria I-growth mastitis rates and log(10) of KF Streptoccocus Agar plate Count and there were two positive correlations between coagulase-positive staphylococci and log(10) of Baird-Parker Agar plate count and Blood Agar plus potassium tellurite plate count.

40|$|Today, it is {{difficult}} to study the physiological status of inoculants in complex environments, such as soil. In this thesis, we describe the combined use of marker genes and viability stains to determine the physiological status of the bacterial cells in pure cultures and in soil. In the experiments, cells previously tagged with gfp and luxAB or luc marker genes (encoding the green fluorescent protein and bacterial or eukaryotic luciferase, respectively) were used. Viability stains, 5 -cyano- 2, 3 -ditolyitetrazolium chloride (CTC) and propidium iodide (M), were used to stain active and dead cells, respectively. The soil bacterial community was extracted using Nycodenz density gradients. The GFP fluorescent and stained cells were monitored by flow cytometry. Luciferase activity was used to monitor metabolic activity of the population. In addition, the number of culturable cells was determined by <b>selective</b> plate <b>counting</b> and compared to the results obtained by flow cytometry in order to estimate the number of dormant cells. The physiological status of Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A 6 (a phenol degrading bacterium) was investigated upon inoculation into natural (uncontaminated) soil microcosms at different temperatures, 5 and 28 *C. Luciferase activity showed {{that the majority of the}} A 6 population remained metabolically active, after 20 days of incubation in soil at 5 'C. However, there was a fraction of the GFP-fluorescent A 6 population that was stained neither with CTC nor PI, presumably indicating a state of dormancy. At 28 'C, a majority of the cells lost their cell integrity, metabolic activity and the ability to be cultured on agar-plates, indicating that the cells were dying. The ability of A. chlorophenolicus A 6 to enter a state of dormancy, might be advantageous for the cells during stressful conditions in soil, and makes this strain a good candidate for treating chlorophenol contaminated soil in temperate climates. Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25, a plant growth promoting bacterium, has been widely studied due to its potential as an inoculum for improving crop yields. Similar to A 6, the physiological status was monitored in soil and in pure cultures incubated under different nutritional conditions. Most of the cells died after incubation for nine days in nutrient rich medium. By contrast when incubated under starvation conditions, most of the population was not stained with CTC or PI, indicating that most of the cells were presumably dormant. In soil, a large fraction of the SBW 25 cell population became inactive and died, as determined activity and viability staining as well as by selective plate countings. However, approximately 60 % of the population was unstained, presumably indicating that the cells entered a state of dormancy in soil similar to that observed under starvation conditions in pure cultures. These results demonstrate the applicability of this approach for monitoring the physiological status of specific cells under stress conditions, such as experienced by environmental inoculants in soil...|$|R
