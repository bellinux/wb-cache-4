50|$|This {{traditional}} form {{of farming}} {{has produced a}} High Nature Value landscape and in 2008 the European Union declared 250,000 ha of the Carpathian valleys as the Tarnava Mare Natura 2000 site with the whole area receiving protection as a Site of Community Importance (SCI) under the Birds Directive and 85,000 ha as a Special Conservation Area (SCA) under the Habitats Directive. The objective of these designations {{is to protect the}} traditional uses of the landscape that have produced this species-rich mosaic of habitats and species. The valleys contain the last lowland population of European Brown Bears (closely related to the American grizzly and more than 4000 animals remaining) as well as Wolves and threatened bird species, such as the Lesser Spotted Eagle, Corncrake and Woodlark, whilst the mainly oak and hornbeam forest areas contain 9 species of woodpecker as well as the spectacular Ural Owl. The upland hay meadows, which have not been fertilised for centuries, contain a very diverse grassland flora and associated butterfly species whilst the wet grass areas contain Great Burnet, the host plant for the <b>Scarce</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Blue</b> and Dusky Large Blue butterflies.|$|E
40|$|Two {{species of}} European Community interest, Dusky Large Blue (Phengaris nausithous) and <b>Scarce</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Blue</b> (Phengaris telejus) were {{monitored}} by external {{workers in the}} Czech Republic for six seasons (2005 - 2010). The data of abundance and environmental conditions was collected from both legally protected and unprotected localities.

40|$|Land-use {{change that}} took place in the second half of the 20 th century {{affected}} population sizes and viabilities of many species adapted to extensive land use. Dusky and <b>Scarce</b> <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies are ones of these species. Both number of their populations and population sizes declined all over Europe. During the last decade, many protected areas of the Natura 2000 network have been established to preserve these butterfly species. Protected areas are managed specifically to support viability of the Maculinea populations. This thesis investigates a current status set of the Natura 2000 sites in southwest Bohemia protecting one or both Maculinea butterfly species. Implementation of the specific management was found to be a crucial factor for successful protection of the Dusky and <b>Scarce</b> <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies. We found that there are significant differences in managements applied in different locations. Almost half of protected areas are managed in inappropriate ways, their butterfly population sizes were very small or already extinct. Other sites are managed well and stable Maculinea populations live there. An assumption that a specific Maculinea management could also support another rare or endangered species has been tested in this thesis too.

50|$|Recent {{findings}} have {{also shown that}} there is a positive correlation between <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly conservation success and that of other endangered species. One specific example is the relationship between Myrmica ants, the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly, violet seeds, and the violet-feeding butterfly (Boloria euphrosyne). The ants will bring the violet seeds into the nest. The seeds will often germinate in the nest, and their potential for germination increases as the nest becomes deserted. Since <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly predation of ant larvae can lead to desertion of the nest and B. euphrosyne tend to prefer violets growing on deserted ant nests, the fitness of B. euphrosyne appears to be indirectly affected by the presence of the <b>large</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview {{on the distribution of}} recently discovered <b>Scarce</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Blue</b> (Phengaris (Maculinea) teleius) in northern Serbia (Selevenj Sands, Ludaš Lake and Subotica Sands). Mapping of the butterfly and its habitat has shown that most of the suitable habitats are limited to protected areas where {{at least some of the}} wet meadows with Sanguisorba officinalis host plant are suitably managed and regularly mown. Given the known maximum dispersal distances of P. teleius, the suitable habitat patches possibly support two separate meta-populations. Fragmentation and isolation of remaining colonies represent the main threats to long term survival of the species in Serbia. Based on IUCN criteria for regional red lists, the species qualifies as Endangered (EN) in Serbia and requires immediate conservation actions. Our results suggest that mowing is of high importance for maintaining suitable habitat. Until more is known about local ecological requirements of the species, general mowing recommendations should be followed with avoidance of mowing between mid June and mid September and providing a mosaic of different mowing regimes...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{individual}} {{movements in}} heterogeneous environments {{is central to}} predicting how landscape changes affect animal populations. An important but poorly understood phenomenon is behavioural response to habitat boundaries and the way animals cross inhospitable matrix surrounding habitat patches. Here, we analyze movement decisions, flight behaviour, and activity of the endangered <b>scarce</b> <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> Phengaris (Maculinea) teleius, focusing on the differences among the patterns observed in patch interior, at patch boundaries and within matrix. The probability of crossing an external patch boundary, regardless of the land use in the adjacent area, was considerably lower than crossing a ‘control line’ within patch interior. Movement distances, flight durations and net squared displacement were largest in matrix, while similarly smaller at patch boundaries and in patch interior. The distribution of angles between successive movements was clearly clustered around 0 ° (indicating flight in a straight line) in matrix and at patch boundaries, but not in patch interior. There were no differences in time spent on foraging, resting and ovipositing between patch interior and boundaries, but the first two activities rarely, and oviposition never, happened in matrix. Our results suggest that although P. teleius adults do not avoid using the resources located in the boundaries of habitat patches, they often return to {{the interior of the}} patches when crossing their boundaries. However, having entered the matrix the butterflies perform relatively long and straight flights. The estimated probability of emigration and net squared distance implies that the dispersal between local populations is common in this species in the studied area...|$|E
40|$|I {{conducted}} a monitoring of <b>Scarce</b> <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> Phengaris teleius (Bergsträsser, 1779) by reverse capture of marked individuals method on 13 examined meadows in Broumov area near Ruprechtice, Hyncice and Vižňov {{in the period}} from 4 th July to 5 th August of 2016. I marked a total of 409 butterflies of this species. Data were evaluated {{with the help of}} software MARK 8. 1 and the total number of butterflies metapopulation was estimated at 802 individuals, whereas the estimates of quantity for each area ranged from 2 - 269 specimen. I registered most of the individuals at the Ruprechtice 2 station. I documented the flyovers of P. teleius individuals between stations within a Ruprechtice Hynčice area. I consider the involvement of Vižňov as realistic, but due to the local total number of butterflies, the detection of P. teleius flyover failed. I consider the hypothesis formulated in the objectives of the work: All the examined areas communicates via overflights of the butterflies and the system can be considered as a single metapopulation, as confirmed. I consider as important a finding that there still lives a stable population of Phengaris teleius and P. nausithous butterflies in Broumov area. The numbers of these butterfiles are in hundreds to thousands of individuals, and {{it is important to remember}} that this is only the population of examined areas, not all areas of occurrence of blue butterflies in stated territories. Those numbers after the first year of observation are unknown. The layout of examined colonies is beneficial for targeted protection planning. The metapopulation model continent islands is not the case of stations examined by myself...|$|E

50|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} shown that <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterflies}} predate the largest of the ant larvae first. This evolved tactic maximizes efficiency not only because the largest larvae provide the most substance by volume, but also because it prevents the larvae pupating and becoming inaccessible prey. Furthermore, it allows more newly hatched larvae time to grow bigger. While in the nest, <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> caterpillars acquire 99% of their final biomass, growing from an average of 1.3 mg to 173 mg. Results from laboratories estimate that 230 large larvae and a minimum of 354 Myrmica workers are needed to ensure the survival of one butterfly, however such a large nest is very rarely found in the wild. This supports findings that <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies are extremely capable of withstanding starvation. This becomes extremely beneficial in situations when the ants desert the colony and leave the caterpillar behind. <b>Large</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies have been known to be capable of migrating to new nests once the original is deserted. In many cases, a nearby colony with a fresh brood will populate the nest allowing the surviving <b>large</b> <b>blues</b> to parasitize multiple Myrmica colonies.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{other members}} of the Phengaris genus, the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterfly}} becomes a predator once it is in the ant nest. It feeds on the ant pupae while continuing to act as member of the Myrmica species. Even if they execute mimicry, mortality rates for the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> within the nest are high. One explanation is that each species of Phengaris is most suited for a specific species of Myrmica. Caterpillars that are adopted by an unfamiliar species of ant are often killed and eaten. Even if they are matched with the correct host, many <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies are unable to survive. If the mimicry is not perfect and the ants become suspicious, death is highly likely. Also ants in nests without a consistent supply of food {{are much more likely to}} identify the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> as an intruder. It has been found that <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> caterpillars are most likely to be attacked during the first 10 days after being adopted by the host ants. This is due to the fact that in this time the caterpillars become larger than the size range of the Myrmica ant larvae.|$|R
