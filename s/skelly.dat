In addition, ConocoPhillips was headquartered in nearby Bartlesville. Industry consolidation and increased offshore drilling threatened Tulsa's status as an oil capital, but new drilling techniques and the rise of natural gas has buoyed the growth of the city's energy sector.|$|E
25|$|After William G. <b>Skelly</b> died, {{his widow}} donated the <b>Skelly</b> Mansion, {{at the corner}} of 21st Street and Madison Avenue, to the University of Tulsa. The school sold the mansion and its {{furnishings}} to private owners in 1959. On July 5, 2012, the university announced that it would repurchase the house as a residence for its president, who would live on the second floor.

25|$|Designed {{expressly}} for {{the executive}} market, the Spartan Executive was configured for both performance and comfort. Built during the Great Depression, the 7W was {{the brainchild of}} company-founder William G. <b>Skelly</b> of <b>Skelly</b> Oil who desired a fast, comfortable aircraft to support his tastes and those of his rich oil-executive colleagues. Through a series of acquisitions, J. Paul Getty took over ownership of the Spartan Aircraft Company in 1935, and directed its fortunes from that point to 1968.|$|E
25|$|Shrewdly {{investing}} his resources {{during the}} Great Depression, Getty acquired Pacific Western Oil Corporation, {{and he began}} the acquisition (completed in 1953) of the Mission Corporation, which included Tidewater Oil and <b>Skelly</b> Oil.

25|$|The team only drew 15,937 {{to their}} first game, a home opener versus the {{expansion}} Pittsburgh Maulers on a rainy and cold spring day. (Home openers in the USFL for most teams were the highest attendance games of the season.) Two weeks into the season, Tatham's son, Bill, Jr.--who was serving as general manager despite being fresh out of law school—announced that <b>Skelly</b> Stadium was inadequate for the Outlaws' needs {{and that they would}} be playing elsewhere in 1985.|$|E
25|$|After some {{search for}} the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small {{emotional}} part in a play that did not run (The Noose). She {{seemed to have the}} quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since Pauline Lord. She and (Hal) <b>Skelly</b> were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck.|$|E
25|$|Scrambling for a home, Tatham seriously {{considered}} playing in Honolulu for its inaugural 1984 season, but settled on Tulsa, Oklahoma—even though {{the city had}} not even been included in a list of possible expansion sites for the USFL. However, Tatham had roots in Oklahoma (his father had moved to California during the Great Depression), and felt that putting his team there would {{give something back to}} the state. He christened his team the Oklahoma Outlaws. The club was the second major-league sports team to play in the state, after the North American Soccer League's Tulsa Roughnecks, and played at <b>Skelly</b> Stadium.|$|E
50|$|Prior {{to making}} Love Undercover, <b>Skelly's</b> band The Coral had {{commenced}} {{work on their}} sixth studio album, the follow up to Butterfly House (2010), with producer John Leckie at Real World Studios in March 2012.

25|$|I-44/SH-66 cut diagonally {{through the}} city of Tulsa. In West Tulsa, Interstate 244 {{branches}} off to serve the downtown area. I-44/SH-66 follow the <b>Skelly</b> Drive through midtown.

The next freeway interchange is with the Broken Arrow Expressway, carrying US-64 and SH-51, followed by the Mingo Valley Expressway, carrying US-169 I-244 then merges with I-44 at its eastern terminus. I-44/SH-66 cross into Rogers County and the suburb of Catoosa, serving as the southern terminus of SH-167. SH-66 then splits off from I-44, initially following an old alignment of the Interstate where it transitioned into the Will Rogers Turnpike. SH-66 then downgrades to an expressway as it passes through Catoosa, home of the Blue Whale. Northeast of Catoosa, near Verdigris, SH-66 intersects SH-266 at its eastern terminus.|$|E
25|$|The {{three-judge panel}} {{consisted}} of Judges J. <b>Skelly</b> Wright, who presided, Thomas Flannery and Charles Robert Richey. The United States, the ICC and the Railroads continued to challenge SCRAP’s standing and contended {{that at this}} stage of the rate process (the suspension stage), a preliminary injunction could not be issued by the court. Following a hearing, the court, in an opinion by Judge Wright, concluded SCRAP had standing to sue. He also concluded that although Congress had vested exclusive jurisdiction in the ICC at the suspension stage of rate-making, Congress had granted the court jurisdiction to review ICC decisions when there was a violation of NEPA. Because harm was imminent, and an EIS not yet prepared, the nation's railroads were enjoined from collecting the rate increase on recyclable materials. The railroads and the ICC sought a stay of the injunction from Chief Justice Burger, who denied it. The court noted probable jurisdiction at the request of the United States, the ICC and the Nation’s Railroads.|$|E
500|$|Development of Sonic 2 {{began in}} November 1991, {{two months later}} than Cerny had {{intended}} because Sega of America initially felt {{it was too soon}} for a sequel. Both American and Japanese Sonic Team staff contributed to development; art director Tim <b>Skelly</b> designed the appearance of the game's pseudo-3D special stages, based on a tech demo created by Naka. The special stages were created out of pre-rendered 3D polygons, video of which was compressed and halved, both vertically and horizontally, to fit in the game cartridge. Sonic 2 also introduced Sonic's sidekick, a two-tailed fox that could fly named Tails, inspired by Japanese folklore about the kitsune and created by level artist Yasushi Yamaguchi. Sega of America objected to the character's name, Miles Prower (a pun on [...] "miles per hour"), so he was given the nickname Tails as a compromise. Masaharu Yoshii served as the game's director. The staff increased the speed of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 compared to the first game.|$|E

50|$|The Spartan Executive Model 7W was {{a result}} of founder William <b>Skelly's</b> vision for an {{aircraft}} designed to accommodate the luxury and performance expected by wealthy people. Powered by a 450 h.p. Pratt & Whitney Wasp Jr. engine, the Executive was Spartan's first attempt at an all-metal aircraft design using monocoque technology. The large engine and aerodynamic airframe allowed for a then-remarkable 200 mi an hour cruise speed, a range of over 1000 nmi km and a 22000 ft service ceiling. The Executive's high-performance design was clearly evident in the 1939 Bendix race, in which the stock design aircraft won the trophy with speeds of nearly 197 miles per hour. Thirty four 7W aircraft were produced.|$|R
50|$|<b>Skelly’s</b> {{thorough}} {{grounding in}} the languages and {{cultures of the}} United States and Latin America, much less common during the years that spanned his career than it has become in more recent years, along with his skills {{as a writer and}} interviewer, made him uniquely qualified to report and comment on the political upheaval that roiled Latin America during those decades. He referred to himself as an “American Cuban,” or one of the more generic “bamboo Americans”, children born of American parents who grew up in Latin America. In addition to his distinguished career as a reporter he served as advisor and speech writer for U.S. presidents of both political parties who sought his insights and assistance in delicate matters concerning intelligence operations and international relations.|$|R

50|$|The station {{signed on}} the air on December 5, 1954 as KVOO-TV. It took its calls from <b>Skelly's</b> radio station, KVOO (1140 AM, now KFAQ). Channel 2 has been an NBC {{affiliate}} since its debut, owing to KVOO radio's longtime affiliation with the NBC Red Network. The first program broadcast on the station was a 39-minute station dedication program from its original studio facilities in the Akdar Building at Fourth Street and Denver Avenue in downtown Tulsa; {{this was followed by}} the first NBC network program aired by the station, Meet the Press. KVOO-TV was the second VHF television station to sign on in the Tulsa market, behind KOTV (channel 6), which debuted in October 1949; KTVX (channel 8, now KTUL) did not change its city of license to Tulsa from Muskogee until the following year, although that station operated from studio facilities located in west Tulsa.|$|R
60|$|Friday, November 9th.--Rain, as yesterday, till 10 o'clock, {{when we took}} a boat to row {{down the}} lake. The day improved,--clouds and sunny gleams on the mountains. In the large bay under Place Fell, three {{fishermen}} were dragging a net,--picturesque group beneath the high and bare crags! A raven was seen aloft: not hovering like the kite, for {{that is not the}} habit of the bird; but passing on with a straight-forward perseverance, and timing the motion of its wings to its own croaking. The waters were agitated; and the iron tone of the raven's voice, which strikes upon the ear at all times as the more dolorous from its regularity, was in fine keeping with the wild scene before our eyes. This carnivorous fowl is a great enemy to the lambs of these solitudes; I recollect frequently seeing, when a boy, bunches of unfledged ravens suspended from the church-yard gates of H----, for which a reward of so much a head was given to the adventurous destroyer.--The fishermen drew their net ashore, and hundreds of fish were leaping in their prison. They were all of the kind called <b>skellies,</b> a sort of fresh-water herring, shoals of which may sometimes be seen dimpling or rippling the surface of the lake in calm weather. This species is not found, I believe, in any other of these lakes; nor, as far as I know, is the chevin, that spiritless fish, (though I am loth to call it so, for it was a prime favourite with Isaac Walton,) which must frequent Ullswater, as I have seen a large shoal passing into the lake from the river Eamont. Here are no pike, and the char are smaller than those of the other lakes, and of inferior quality; but the grey trout attains a very large size, sometimes weighing above twenty pounds. This lordly creature seems to know that 'retiredness is a piece of majesty;' for it is scarcely ever caught, or even seen, except when it quits the depths of the lake in the spawning season, and runs up into the streams, where it is too often destroyed in disregard of {{the law of the land}} and of Nature.|$|R
2500|$|The Louisiana State Legislature {{promptly}} passed Act 555 and Act 556, protecting its segregated {{public school}} system from being dismantled by the Supreme Court.

2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with both {{versions}} of the Wranglers, Phoenix-area fans largely viewed the Outlaws with indifference. For {{the second year in a}} row, attendance dropped -- from the 25,568 George Allen's Wranglers' drew the year before, to 17,881. [...] The crowds looked even smaller than that due to the spacious configuration of Sun Devil Stadium. [...] The Outlaws actually drew 4,000 fewer fans than they did in Tulsa, even though Sun Devil Stadium was almost double the size of <b>Skelly</b> Stadium. Despite this, the Tathams hoped to stick it out once the league won their lawsuit against the NFL.|$|E

2500|$|Getty {{increased}} the family wealth, learning to speak Arabic, which enabled his unparalleled expansion into the Middle East. Getty owned the controlling interest in nearly 200 businesses, including Getty Oil. Associates identified his overall wealth at between $2 billion and $4 billion. It didn't come easily, perhaps inspiring Getty's widely quoted remark—"The meek shall inherit the earth, {{but not the}} mineral rights." [...] J. Paul Getty was an owner of Getty Oil, Getty Inc., George F. Getty Inc., Pacific Western Oil Corporation, Mission Corporation, Mission Development Company, Tidewater Oil, <b>Skelly</b> Oil, Mexican Seaboard Oil, Petroleum Corporation of America, Spartan Aircraft Company, Spartan Cafeteria Company, Minnehoma Insurance Company, Minnehoma Financial Company, Pierre Hotel at Fifth Avenue and 60th Street, Pierre Marques Hotel at Revolcadero Beach near Acapulco, Mexico, a 15th-century palace and nearby castle at Ladispoli on the coast northwest of Rome, a Malibu ranch home and Sutton Place, a 72-room mansion near Guildford, Surrey, 35 miles from London.|$|E
2500|$|Licences conferring {{rights to}} {{hydrocarbon}} exploration on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were first awarded by the Canadian {{government in the}} mid-1960s. The first exploration well in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin was the Murre G-67 well drilled in the southern, relatively uplifted end of the basin by the oil majors Amoco and Imperial Oil in 1971. [...] Soon after, a small, non-commercial amount of oil was test flowed in early 1973 at the Adolphus 2K-41 exploration well drilled in the much more deeply buried northern end of the Jeanne d'Arc Basin by Mobil Oil Canada and Gulf Canada. The Egret K-36 well, drilled jointly by Amoco, Imperial and <b>Skelly</b> in 1973, was a critical milestone in establishment of the basin's hydrocarbon prospectivity. Egret K-36 encountered the prolific oil source rock later assigned the name Egret Member, plus thick tilted beds of porous sandstones of the Jeanne d'Arc and Hibernia formations. [...] Despite this early establishment that all the components needed for an active petroleum system were present, there was a four-year hiatus in drilling in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin following termination of the Adolphus D-50 well in January 1975. The first well spud after the drilling lull proved that giant oil fields {{could be found in}} this basin. [...] The Hibernia P-15 discovery well, initiated on May 27, 1979, encountered and test flowed oil from the Jeanne d'Arc, Hibernia and Ben Nevis formations. This well heralded a vibrant era of oil exploration and development that has significantly impacted the economy of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA noted Tezuka's [...] "ability to {{simultaneously}} play with narrative devices and {{the emotions of}} his readers"; the former with how he uses different viewpoints, and the latter with Luster first hating Tomura but later pitying her. Luster concluded that the manga is: [...] "sexy, dark, and ultimately kind of tragic". Carlo Santos of Anime News Network called the story gripping, with Tezuka [...] "creating a massive but memorable network of characters", {{as well as with}} its twists and [...] "twisted psychology". Santos also felt that the manga represented Tezuka at his most serious with the focus on action and the ambitious art, with its [...] "wild metaphors and images jump off the page." [...] However, Santos criticized the exaggerated character designs which clashed with the manga's realistic themes, the misogynistic actions of the male characters, and the pacing at certain points. Katie <b>Skelly</b> complimented the contemporary fashion depicted with the character's clothing. She felt that the manga was Tezuka's response to gekiga, but that the [...] "cartoony" [...] character design diminished some of its seriousness. <b>Skelly</b> could also identify with the [...] start of the manga where Tomura's accomplishments are questioned by the public. Chris Kirby of the Fandom Post found Tomura to be an unsympathetic character, but called her compelling to observe in the manga's [...] "dog-eat-dog world of the 60s and 70s". Kirby also complimented Tezuka's ability to pursue multiple ideas and commentary in the manga without losing focus. Lastly he noted the importance of Tezuka's art style, where he uses [...] "experimentation and expression", and which represents a [...] "personal metamorphosis of Tezuka himself." [...] Melinda Beasi of Manga Bookshelf found herself surprisingly sympathetic towards Tomura, saying that Tezuka [...] "treats her with more respect and even affection" [...] compared to Ayako, and that, while the manga is scathing, an [...] "exuberance to Tezuka's writing [...] keeps it from sinking into real darkness." [...] Tom Spurgeon said that Tomura's [...] "awfulness" [...] was [...] "weirdly enjoyable" [...] because of Tezuka's frank portrayal of her. He also felt that Tezuka's art kept the reader's interest with its variety, saying: [...] "It's another sign of a great artist that they can seemingly do whatever they want and yet what they choose to do remains worthwhile." [...] Steve Bennett of ICv2 described the manga as an [...] "unbelievably bleak, unsentimental indictment of human life that makes no attempt to impart anything like a moral", concluding that it is a [...] "compelling work, meant for a genuinely mature audience, skillfully told by [...]" [...] David Brothers of Comics Alliance called Tezuka's art style [...] "eminently readable", with a skillful use of panels and metaphors, and said of Tezuka: [...] "his cartooning is wonderful, his writing relentlessly focused, and his plotting just that right balance of creepy and exciting." [...] Lori Henderson of Manga Village compared Tomura's sociopathic nature to Yuki's from MW, but said that the former is an example of [...] "survival of the fittest", while the latter is a product of his environment. She also calls Tomura inhuman in her ability to evolve and survive, with Mizuno serving as a foil to her and being the only one able to affect her. Henderson concludes that Tomura is a sympathetic character, that the story with Kamaishi was the highlight of the manga, and that the manga is a [...] "great thriller".|$|E
