60|$|April 1.--A pretty {{first of}} April truly; the hills white with snow, I myself as bilious as a dog. My noble guests left about noon. I wrote letters, as if I had not bile enough in my bosom already, {{and did not}} go out to face the <b>snow</b> <b>wreaths</b> till half-past two, when I am {{resolved}} to make a brush for exercise. There will be fine howling among the dogs, for I am about to shut my desk. Found Mrs. Skene disposed to walk, so I {{had the advantage of}} her company. The snow lay three inches thick on the ground; but we had the better appetite for dinner, after which we talked and read without my lifting a pen.|$|E
60|$|The second, that {{although}} the subject is one in itself almost incapable of color, and although, {{in order to increase}} the wildness of the impression, all brilliant local color has been refused even where it might easily have been introduced, as in the figures; yet in the low minor key which has been chosen, the melodies of color have been elaborated to the utmost possible pitch, so as to become a leading, instead of a subordinate, element in the composition; the subdued warm hues of the granite promontories, the dull stone color of the walls of the buildings, clearly opposed, even in shade, to the gray of the <b>snow</b> <b>wreaths</b> heaped against them, and the faint greens and ghastly blues of the glacier ice, being all expressed with delicacies of transition utterly unexampled in any previous drawings.|$|E
60|$|Behind {{and over}} us towered Sheba's snowy Breasts, and below, some five {{thousand}} feet beneath where we stood, lay league on league {{of the most}} lovely champaign country. Here were dense patches of lofty forest, there a great river wound its silvery way. To the left stretched a vast expanse of rich, undulating veld or grass land, whereon we {{could just make out}} countless herds of game or cattle, at that distance we could not tell which. This expanse appeared to be ringed in by a wall of distant mountains. To the right the country was more or less mountainous; that is, solitary hills stood up from its level, with stretches of cultivated land between, amongst which we could see groups of dome-shaped huts. The landscape lay before us as a map, wherein rivers flashed like silver snakes, and Alp-like peaks crowned with wildly twisted <b>snow</b> <b>wreaths</b> rose in grandeur, whilst over all was the glad sunlight and the breath of Nature's happy life.|$|E
60|$|Pictures {{of winter}} scenery are nearly {{as common as}} moonlights, and are usually {{executed}} by the same order of artists, that is to say, the most incapable; it being remarkably easy to represent the moon as a white wafer on a black ground, or to scratch out white branches on a cloudy sky. Nevertheless, among Flemish paintings several valuable representations of winter are to be found, and some clever pieces of effect among the moderns, as Hunt's, for instance, and De Wint's. But all such efforts end in effect alone, nor have I ever in any single instance seen a <b>snow</b> <b>wreath,</b> I do not say thoroughly, but even decently, drawn.|$|R
30|$|The {{deformation}} for the Hatanbulag earthquake {{was found}} to cover a large area of about 8 × 12 km 2 but with a peak-to-peak magnitude of only 8 – 10 mm. This small displacement was revealed despite the likely presence of water bodies (or <b>snow</b> <b>wreath</b> in some lake and marshes after the snow/dust storm) and sand dune drift in the small depression, where the epicenter is located. We obtained solutions for two cases with, and without, the questionable subsiding pattern to the east. The model that includes the eastern subsidence revealed a strike-slip mechanism with a fault plane size of 1.8 × 1.3 km 2 {{at a depth of}} 6.3 km and 1.3 m of slip. However, the modeled pattern did not match well the observed displacement, and the type of faulting is not consistent with the focal mechanism estimated previously from seismograms.|$|R
60|$|And so we {{remained}} {{till the}} red of the dawn {{began to fall}} through the snow gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror. But when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again. At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and <b>snow.</b> The <b>wreaths</b> of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle, and were lost.|$|R
60|$|At last, when for {{the second}} time she was seeing the <b>snow</b> <b>wreaths</b> dwindle, and the drops shine forth in {{moisture}} again, while the mountain paths were set free by the might of the springtide sun, she spoke almost {{for the first time with}} authority, as she desired Heinz to saddle her mule, and escort her to join in the Easter mass at the Blessed Friedmund's Chapel. Ursel heaped up objections; but so urgent was Christina for confession and for mass, that the old woman had not the heart to stop her by a warning to the elder Baroness, and took the alternative of accompanying her. It was a glorious sparkling Easter Day, lovely blue sky above, herbage and flowers glistening below, snow dazzling in the hollows, peasants assembling in holiday garb, and all rejoicing. Even the lonely widow, in her heavy veil and black mufflings, took hope back to her heart, and smiled when at the church door a little child came timidly up to her with a madder-tinted Easter egg--a gift once again like the happy home customs of Ulm. She gave the child a kiss--she had nothing else to give, but the sweet face sent it away strangely glad.|$|E
60|$|The {{scene is}} on {{the summit of the}} pass close to the hospice, or what {{seems to have been a}} hospice at that time,--I do not {{remember}} any such at present,--a small square built house, built as if partly for a fortress, with a detached flight of stone steps in front of it, and a kind of drawbridge to the door. This building, about 400 or 500 yards off, is seen in a dim, ashy gray against the light, which by help of a violent blast of mountain wind has broken through the depth of clouds which hang upon the crags. There is no sky, properly so called, nothing but this roof of drifting cloud; but neither is there any weight of darkness--the high air is too thin for it,--all savage, howling, and luminous with cold, the massy bases of the granite hills jutting out here and there grimly through the <b>snow</b> <b>wreaths.</b> There is a desolate-looking refuge on the left, with its number 16, marked on it in long ghastly figures, and the wind is drifting the snow off the roof and through its window in a frantic whirl; the near ground is all wan with half-thawed, half-trampled snow; a diligence in front, whose horses, unable to face the wind, have turned right round with fright, its passengers struggling to escape, jammed in the window; a little farther on is another carriage off the road, some figures pushing at its wheels, and its driver at the horses' heads, pulling and lashing with all his strength, his lifted arm stretched out against the light of the distance, though too far off for the whip to be seen.|$|E
6000|$|... 151. The evils {{necessarily}} {{resulting from}} the use of baseless currencies have been terribly illustrated while these sheets have been passing through the press; I have not had time to examine the various conditions of dishonest or absurd trading which have led to the late 'panic' in America and England; this only I know, that no merchant deserving the name ought to be more liable to 'panic' than a soldier should; for his name should never be on more paper than he can at any instant meet the call of, happen what will. I do not say this without feeling at the same time {{how difficult it is to}} mark, in existing commerce, the just limits between the spirit of enterprise and of speculation. Something of the same temper which makes the English soldier do always all that is possible, and attempt more than is possible, joins its influence with that of mere avarice in tempting the English merchant into risks which he cannot justify, and efforts which he cannot sustain; and the same passion for adventure which our travellers gratify every summer on perilous <b>snow</b> <b>wreaths,</b> and cloud-encompassed precipices, surrounds with a romantic fascination the glittering of a hollow investment, and gilds the clouds that curl round gulfs of ruin. Nay, a higher and a more serious feeling frequently mingles in the motley temptation; and men apply themselves to the task of growing rich, as to a labour of providential appointment, from which they cannot pause without culpability, nor retire without dishonour. Our large trading cities bear to me very nearly the aspect of monastic establishments in which the roar of the mill-wheel and the crane takes the place of other devotional music; and in which the worship of Mammon or Moloch is conducted with a tender reverence and an exact propriety; the merchant rising to his Mammon matins with the self-denial of an anchorite, and expiating the frivolities into which he may be beguiled in the course of the day by late attendance at Mammon vespers. But, with every allowance that can be made for these conscientious and romantic persons, the fact remains the same, that by far the greater number of the transactions which lead to these times of commercial embarrassment may be ranged simply under two great heads--gambling and stealing; and both of these in their most culpable form, namely, gambling with money which is not ours, and stealing from those who trust us. I have sometimes thought a day might come, when the nation would perceive that a well-educated man who steals a hundred thousand pounds, involving the entire means of subsistence of a hundred families, deserves, on the whole, as severe a punishment as an ill-educated man who steals a purse from a pocket, or a mug from a pantry.|$|E
50|$|In the Western world, {{rolls of}} brightly colored paper with secular or {{religious}} Christmas/winter/Hanukkah motifs are manufactured {{for the purpose}} of giftwrapping presents. The display of Christmas villages has also become a tradition in many homes during this season. Other traditional decorations include bells, candles, candy canes, garland, stockings, <b>wreaths,</b> <b>snow</b> globes, and angels. Snow sheets are made specifically for simulating snow under a tree or village.|$|R
60|$|Towards daybreak, we came {{among the}} snow, where a keen {{wind was blowing}} fiercely. Having, with some trouble, awakened the inmates of a wooden house in this solitude: round which the wind was howling dismally, {{catching}} up the <b>snow</b> in <b>wreaths</b> and hurling it away: we got some breakfast in a room built of rough timbers, but well warmed by a stove, and well contrived (as it had need to be) for keeping out the bitter storms. A sledge being then made ready, and four horses harnessed to it, we went, ploughing, through the snow. Still upward, but now in the cold light of morning, and with the great white desert on which we travelled, plain and clear.|$|R

But without hoping for this excess of clearsightedness, we may at least labour for a system of greater honesty and kindness in the minor commerce of our daily life; since the great dishonesty of the great buyers and sellers is nothing more than the natural growth and outcome from the little dishonesty of the little buyers and sellers. Every person who tries to buy an article for less than its proper value, or who tries to sell it at more than its proper value--every consumer who keeps a tradesman waiting for his money, and every tradesman who bribes a consumer to extravagance by credit, is helping forward, according to his own measure of power, a system of baseless and dishonourable commerce, and forcing his country down into poverty and shame. And people of moderate means and average powers of mind would do far more real good by merely carrying out stern principles of justice and honesty in common matters of trade, than by the most ingenious schemes of extended philanthropy, or vociferous declarations of theological doctrine. There are three weighty matters of the law--justice, mercy, and truth; and of these the Teacher puts truth last, because that cannot be known but by a course of acts of justice and love. But men put, in all their efforts, truth first, because they mean by it their own opinions; and thus, while the world has many people who would suffer martyrdom in the cause of what they call truth, it has few who will suffer even a little inconvenience, in that of justice and mercy.|$|E
