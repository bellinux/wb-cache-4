40|$|Summary. Hydrofoil struts, such {{as might}} be used for {{supporting}} a model in hydrodynamic experiments, are liable to failure through divergence or flutter. This makes the problem of designing a satisfactory strut particularly difficult if high speeds are required and if the struts must be kept thin to avoid cavitation. In the present report the theory developed to describe the aero-elastic stability of aircraft wings is applied to provide predictions of the speeds of onset of the two kinds of instability; in particular a simplified analysis of how the divergence speed depends on <b>strut</b> <b>length</b> and rake is included. The results {{of a series of}} experiments on the variation of divergence speed with <b>strut</b> <b>length</b> and on the variations of divergence speed and flutter speed with rake are presented. The agreement between theory and experiment is satisfactory. 1. Introduction. Thi...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Open-celled foams are {{three-dimensional}} {{networks of}} polymeric cells. The mechanical properties of a foam {{depend on the}} size and geometry of its cells. Since foams have a three-dimensional polyhedral structure, the two-dimensional characterization techniques currently used provide limited accuracy. Nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray tomography methods offer opportunities for three-dimensional imaging of these polyhedral structures. Software, which can use digital three-dimensional images to determine structural parameters such as <b>strut</b> <b>length</b> distribution, connectivity, and cell size, is being developed. The image processing approach uses conformal curvature flow (CCF) segmentation to find the surfaces of foam struts in the 3 -D images. Once these surfaces have been found, volume thinning is used to find the structural skeleton of the foam. The resulting data set can then {{be used to determine}} many statistical characteristics of the foam, including <b>strut</b> <b>length</b> distributions, window size and shape distributions, and cell size information. Analysis of a reticulated polyurethane foam sample using these methods yielded a reasonable approximation of the structural skeleton of the sample...|$|E

According {{to the results of}} this experimental study, the TSF provides advantages in the correction of rotational and translational deformities, but may be limited by its workspace. Nevertheless, the authors {{investigated the}} standard hexapod frame (ring diameter: 155  mm and standard struts) without evaluating the available smaller ring diameters and different <b>strut</b> <b>lengths.</b>|$|R
30|$|Classical {{constitutive}} {{models for}} elastic materials behavior are local {{and do not}} possess intrinsic length scales. For cellular solids the inadequacy of such models is obvious once the relevant scale of a problem becomes comparable to the intrinsic length scale defined by the cell size or <b>strut</b> <b>lengths</b> can be about the same order of magnitude as the system size. As a result smaller samples may behave differently compared to larger ones.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{compressive}} {{response of}} a sandwich {{plate with a}} metallic corrugated core is predicted. The back face of the sandwich plate is held fixed whereas the front face is subjected to a uniform velocity, thereby compressing the core. Finite element analysis is performed to investigate the role of material inertia, strain hardening and strain rate hardening upon the dynamic collapse of the corrugated core. Three classes of collapse mode are identified {{as a function of}} impact velocity: (i) a three-hinge plastic buckling mode of wavelength equal to the <b>strut</b> <b>length,</b> similar to the quasi-static mode, (ii) a ‘buckle-wave’ regime involving inertia-mediated plastic buckling of wavelength less than that of the <b>strut</b> <b>length,</b> and (iii) a ‘stubbing’ regime, with shortening of the struts by local fattening at the front face. The presence of strain hardening reduces the regime of dominance of the stubbing mode. The influence of material strain rate sensitivity is evaluated by introducing strain rate dependent material properties representative of type 304 stainless steel. For this choice of material, strain rate sensitivity has a more minor influence than strain hardening, and consequently the dynamic collapse strength of a corrugated core is almost independent of structural dimension...|$|E
40|$|An {{illustrated}} {{review of}} reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) as an electrode material is presented. Early uses of RVC were largely restricted to small-scale (< 1 cm 3) electroanalytical studies in research laboratories. RVC properties {{of a high}} ratio of surface area to volume and minimal reactivity {{over a wide range}} of process conditions, combined with low cost and easy handling, have resulted in a steady diversification of its applications both in research laboratories and in industry. The physical structure of RVC (in terms of pores per linear inch, <b>strut</b> <b>length,</b> strut thickness and area of the trigonal strut) is examined for 10, 30, 60 and 100 ppi (pores per linear inch) grades using scanning electron microscopy. The accurate measurement of these geometrical values presents both theoretical (in terms of definition of trigonal strut area, beginning and end of single strand) and practical problems (large differences in <b>strut</b> <b>length</b> and thickness in individual samples).

40|$|In PKM Machines, the Cartesian {{position}} and {{orientation of the}} tool point carried on the platform is obtained from a kinematic model of the particular machine. Accurate positioning of these machines relies on the accurate knowledge of {{the parameters of the}} kinematic model unique to the particular machine. The parameters in the kinematic model include the spatial locations of the joint centers on the machine base and moving platform, the initial <b>strut</b> <b>lengths,</b> and the <b>strut</b> displacements. The strut displacements are readily obtained from sensors on the machine. However, the remaining kinematic parameters (joint center locations, and initial <b>strut</b> <b>lengths)</b> are difficult to determine when these machines are in their fully assembled state. The size and complexity of these machines generally makes it difficult and somewhat undesirable to determine the remaining kinematic parameters by direct inspection such as in a coordinate measuring machine. In order for PKMs to be useful for precision positioning applications, techniques must be developed to quickly calibrate the machine by determining the kinematic parameters without disassembly of the machine. A number of authors have reported techniques for calibration of PKMs (Soons, Masory, Zhuang et. al., Ropponen). In two other papers, the authors have reported on work recently completed by the University of Florida and Sandia National Laboratories on calibration of PKMs, which describes a new technique to sequentially determine the kinematic parameters of an assembled parallel kinematic device. The technique described is intended to be used with a spatial coordinate measuring device such as a portable articulated CMM measuring arm (Romer, Faro, etc.), a Laser Ball Bar (LBB), or a laser tracker (SMX< API, etc.).

40|$|AbstractTo {{develop an}} osseointegration {{analyzing}} system for dental implants, a new analyzing system which can assess {{the level of}} osseointegration between an implant and trabecular bone was constructed using digital radiography with morphological filter and node-strut analysis. For assessment of this system, a grayscale test chart that simulates six levels of an osseointegration was created. In addition, digital implant images were made in which the trabecular pattern around the implant was varied over {{a total of five}} levels. Implant osseointegration was evaluated on the basis of seven parameters related to the number of nodes (Nd) and terminuses (Tm) of the skeleton bound to the implant (Im) and the skeletal length. The seven parameters were as follows: the number of struts connecting the Im with the Nd and Tm (N. ImNd, N. ImTm), the total number of N. ImNd and N. ImTm (N. Im), the <b>strut</b> <b>length</b> connecting the Im with the Nd and Tm (ImNd, ImTm), and the ratios of the struts connecting the Im with the Nd and Tm (ImNd/TSL, ImTm/ TSL), where TSL is the total <b>strut</b> <b>length.</b> Strong correlations (R 2 = 0. 971 – 1. 0) between the theoretical values from the test charts and the measured values were demonstrated.

Constitutive equations are developed for the force and couple stress tensors, accounting for finite deformations and anisotropy. The consistent tangent stiffness operators are derived and the equations are fully implemented in a nonlinear two-dimensional finite-element solution scheme for the coupled displacement/rotation problem. A boundary-value problem of a shear gap with prescribed boundary rotations is analysed, and the model is shown to predict the well-known gap size effect.
