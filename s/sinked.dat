50|$|The open double sink is {{equivalent}} to making an open sink, and then open-sinking {{the point in the}} opposite direction. It is a <b>sinked</b> analog of the crimp fold. When made in a single step (after pre-creasing), it can be easier to make than a single open sink, because it does not require neatly reversing the point.

30|$|A mobile <b>sink</b> {{is usually}} driven by fuel and/or electricity; that is why, the total travel {{distance}} {{covered by the}} <b>sink</b> throughout the network lifetime should be bounded. When a mobile <b>sink</b> moves from one <b>sink</b> location to another, the probability of data loss is high; so, the distance between two <b>sink</b> locations should be at minimum. Adaptive <b>sink</b> mobility requires that the <b>sink</b> must re-construct the routing table or routing tree at each new location, which takes a specific time. So, a mobile <b>sink</b> should reside for a minimum amount of time at each <b>sink</b> location. The transmission of data from nodes/CHs to a <b>sink</b> only occurs when the <b>sink</b> is not moving, i.e., <b>sink</b> is located at any <b>sink</b> location. Therefore, the sum of stop times in a mobile <b>sink</b> tour should be maximized. There should be a maximum number of stop locations for a mobile <b>sink</b> so that the throughput is maximized.|$|R

50|$|A butler's <b>sink</b> is a {{rectangular}} ceramic <b>sink</b> with a rounded rim {{which is set}} into a work surface. There are generally two kinds of butler's sinks: The London <b>sink</b> and the Belfast <b>sink.</b> In 2006, both types of <b>sinks</b> usually were 61 cm across and 46 cm front-to-back, with a depth of 22.5 cm. London <b>sinks</b> were originally shallower than Belfast <b>sinks.</b> (One plumbing guide in 1921 suggested that the Belfast <b>sink</b> was 38 cm deep.) Some believe this was because London had less access to fresh water (and thus a greater need to conserve water), but this theory is now contested. It is more likely the two <b>sinks</b> had different roles within the household. But that difference usually {{does not exist in}} the modern era, and both <b>sinks</b> are now shallow. The primary difference both in the past and today between a Belfast and London <b>sink</b> is that the Belfast <b>sink</b> is fitted with an overflow weir which prevented water from spilling over the <b>sink's</b> edge by draining it away and down into the wastewater plumbing.|$|R
30|$|In[1] the MSEP ({{multiple}} static <b>sinks</b> edge placement) {{model is}} discussed. In this model the multiple <b>sinks</b> {{are located on}} the same edge. In the MSEP model, different strategies for sending data to the <b>sink</b> are possible, namely, sending data to all the <b>sinks</b> (all <b>sink</b> notification), sending data to closest <b>sink</b> (closest <b>sink</b> notification) or sending data to interested <b>sinks</b> only (interested <b>sink</b> notification). Because {{in the first and}} last strategy the total amount of packets increases, the paper only focuses on the closest <b>sink</b> notification. In a first case of non-overlapping critical zones, they state that in a n-sink environment where the <b>sinks</b> serve an equal part of the network, the nodes in the critical zone deplete at the same time. However, for large networks still a large amount of energy is unutilised. If the <b>sinks</b> do not serve an equal part of the network, the network first will behave as one-sink networks which serve their part of the network and with equal initial energy capacity. Once the nodes in the critical zone of <b>sinks</b> get depleted, the network will behave as a network with only one <b>sink</b> with a smaller initial energy capacity. The adding of extra <b>sinks</b> on the same edge can lead to the overlapping of the critical regions. This situation is called the full-edge <b>sink</b> placement. In this situation still 50 % of the energy is not used. These results also apply on the multiple static <b>sinks</b> with random placement (MSRP) model for large networks with {{a relatively small number of}} <b>sinks.</b>|$|R

So three different levels from top to bottom of the dispersion were collected. Each part of the dispersion was centrifugated for 20 min. The precipitations were redispersed in octane-TOPO solution and sonicated for 10 min, respectively, as illustrated by the literature [30]. The UV-vis absorption spectroscopy of these nanowires with different diameters was measured by a UV-visible Spectrophotometer (UV-vis UV- 2501 PC, Shimadzu). The average diameter and aspect ratio of the nanowires dispersed in different levels were calculated by SEM images.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwave}} heating and ultrasound on {{the purity of}} the methyl ester phase was studied. During the transesterifications process triglyceride esters were turned into methyl esters (FAME), e. g., methanol replaces the glycerol: The process of FAME formation was complicated and went through the formation of diglycerides and monoglycerides, which were the by-products that reduce selectivity and increase the separation time. Glycerol produced as the heavier phase <b>sinked</b> to the bottom and biodiesel as the lighter phase floated on top and can be separated. Microwave heating did not give a considerable positive effect for transesterifications reactions with low catalyst concentration, however, ultrasound heating showed positive effect. At > 40 °C, ultrasound transesterification ran better than the reaction with convection heating and yielded product of higher purity even low catalyst concentration was used.

This cluster is <b>sinked</b> deep into the massive gas envelope produced in the collisions of the primary stellar population. The frequent collisions of remaining neutron stars in central stellar cluster result in a creation of ultrarelativistic fireballs and shock waves. They produce the rarefied cavern with external shell and quasi-stationary external shock. The particles are effectively accelerated in the cavern and, due to pp-collisions in the gas envelope, they produce high energy neutrinos. All high energy particles, except neutrinos, are absorbed in the thick envelope. Duration of active stage is ∼ 10 yr, the number of the sources can be ∼ 10 per cosmological horizon.

The architecture emphasizes network transparency and ease of customization/extensibility {{in support of the}} vastly different needs of various applications and devices that can benefit from remote I/O. Networked I/O is achieved via a networked device driver that is split into two parts, one {{on each side of the}} network.

Because of the paired nature of transformation modules, the system is capable of supporting the modification of the I/O stream in a variety of ways to compensate for network issues, one of the key problems of remote I/O, while remaining transparent to the application. We show that even with an implementation that operates almost entirely at user level (i. e., outside the operating system), good levels of performance that are adequate for even high intensity I/O, both in terms of efficiency and throughput, can be achieved.

40|$|Introduction The {{standard}} {{treatment of}} colo-vesical fistula is the exeresis of fistula, suture of bladder wall, colic resection {{with or without}} temporary colostomy. Usually the approach is open because conversion rates and morbidity are lower than laparoscopy. The aim of video is to show the steps of a new mini-invasive approach of colo-vesical fistula without colic resection. Materials and Methods A 69 years old male underwent laparoscopic conservative treatment of colo-vesical fistula due to endoscopic polipectomy in sigmoid diverticulum. 12 mm trocar for the camera was placed at the umbilicus, two 10 mm trocars were placed along bisiliac line and 5 mm port was placed along left emiclavear line; Trendelenburg position was 20 &# 176;. The fistulous loop was carefully isolated, clipped with Hem-o-lock&# 174; clips and removed. Since diverticular disease appeared slight and no inflammation signs were evident, colon resection was not performed. We sutured and <b>sinked</b> the sigmoid wall; after curettage of the fistula site, the bladder wall was sutured. Fat tissue was placed between sigmoid and bladder wall {{to reduce the risk}} of fistula recurrence. Results Operative time, estimated blood loss, catheterization time, time to flatus and hospital stay were respectively 210 minutes, 300 mL, 10 days, 48 h and 8 days. The histological examination showed colonic inflammatory and necrotic tissue. No complications or fistula recurrence occurred at 54 months follow-up.

The moving telescope assembly attaches to the interface baseplate with an open pivot frame through which flex leads from the receiver front end also pass.

40|$|With rise of both mobile {{devices and}} the cloud, we see users {{frequently}} turning to remote servers for both data storage and software services, including running applications. However, once applications {{are no longer}} co- located with devices, the traditional device driver architecture no longer facilitates communication between them. Frequently, applications must be rewritten {{in order to receive}} data from a remote, rather than local, device. The networked device driver architecture is designed to support input/output devices that are separated by the network from the application(s) to which they are supplying data. The introduction of the network between the device and application also introduces issues such as high latency, low bandwidth, and jitter. We wish to compensate for these problems by alling for the processing of the data sent between the device and application. We also want to maintain network transparency, so that applications {{do not need to be}} modified in order to use remote devices. The networked device driver is split into two parts, one on each side of the network. At one end is the device and its unmodified device driver, and on the other end is the unmodified application. An I/O stream that is sourced at one end and <b>sinked</b> at the other may be modified by a set of pipelined transformation modules.

40|$|International audienceThe silver mines of Laurion {{were the}} most {{important}} mining district of ancient Greece during the fifth and fourth centuries BC. These mineral resources highly contributed to the power of Athens. Even today, mining, ore dressing and metallurgical remains cover about 120 km 2. We focused on the most obvious traces left by the ancient miners in Laurion, namely the figure of the deep vertical shafts. In {{the southern part of the}} district, 4 km SW of Lavrio, fifteen shafts <b>sinked</b> in the Spitharopoussi plateau have been studied. They constitute the whole inventory of shafts in a given area. Among them, twelve are major deep shafts (65. 6 m in average, 101. 5 m for the deepest). One wonders how miners were able to breathe at such a depth. The location of the shaft heads, on the plateau surface, in roughly horizontal field, has only low level variations. According to the regularity of the geological structure, all these shafts are mainly open in the marbles of the Kamareza unit (Rosenthal and al. in this conference) with a broadly rectangular shaped section (average size : 1. 35 m x 1. 64 m). Subsequent field surveys and meteorological data, indicate uniform climatic conditions with the same distribution of wind directions. At ground level, against all the odds, the straight sections of shafts are not oriented according to the direction of prevailing winds, for the purpose of ventilation; their orientation depends on the natural slope. This gives a clue that a particular plan was followed in the arrangement of surface hoisting workshops. These shafts revealed heterogeneous characteristics : different depths, twisted sections, traces of notches on the sides. They also revealed different techniques of ventilation for deep workings that could have been applied at different times. In three cases, an auxiliary shaft was located closed to the main one; both are connected by one or more galleries (twin shafts or parallel shaft in literature). For the others, did the ancient miners take advantage of continuous blowing winds over the plateau to direct airflow into the depth, using different kinds of deflectors ? This study undertakes a return to the field, with new tracks, particularly on detailed study of surface hoisting workshops and requiring long term monitoring of climatic conditions over and under ground...|$|E
