60|$|Seizing this {{handful of}} straw with a death-grip, and bidding my three friends bury me honorably, I got upon my legs to save both countries, or perish in the attempt. The tables roared and thundered at me, and {{suddenly}} were silent again. But, as I have never happened to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> of greater dignity and peril, I deem it a stratagem of sage policy here to close these Sketches, leaving myself still erect in so heroic an attitude.|$|E
60|$|We {{have said}} that Darwins {{hypothesis}} is the natural complement to Lyells uniformitarian theory in physical geology. It is for the organic world what that is for the inorganic; and the accepters of the latter <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> from which to regard the former in the most favorable light. Wherefore the rumor that the cautious Lyell himself has adopted the Darwinian hypothesis need not surprise us. The two views are made for each other, and, like the two counterpart pictures for the stereoscope, when brought together, combine into one apparently solid whole.|$|E

6000|$|Unamiable as seems this find-fault mood, {{offensive}} as is this defiant attitude, we must {{beware of}} overlooking the truths enunciated, in dislike of the advocacy. It is an unfortunate hindrance to all innovation, that in {{virtue of their}} very function, the innovators <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> of antagonism; and the disagreeable manners, and sayings, and doings, which this antagonism generates, are commonly associated with the doctrines promulgated. Quite forgetting that whether the thing attacked be good or bad, the combative spirit is necessarily repulsive; and quite forgetting that the toleration of abuses seems amiable merely from its passivity; the mass of men contract a bias against advanced views, and in favour of stationary ones, from intercourse with their respective adherents. [...] "Conservatism," [...] as Emerson says, [...] "is debonnair and social; reform is individual and imperious." [...] And this remains true, however vicious the system conserved, however righteous the reform to be effected. Nay, the indignation of the purists is usually extreme in proportion as the evils to be got rid of are great. The more urgent the required change, the more intemperate is the vehemence of its promoters. Let no one, then, confound {{with the principles of}} this social nonconformity the acerbity and the disagreeable self-assertion of those who first display it.|$|E
60|$|But {{it seems}} to me that there is need of {{something}} more; {{it seems to}} me, and I think that it will seem so to you also, that you must go even further if you would be equal to the importance of the situation. If there are any among the Dissenters whose consciences are so far satisfied with the provisions of the recent Act that they could now return to your communion, to such, it must not be forgotten, you <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> of great delicacy. The conduct of these men you have so far justified; you have tacitly admitted that there was some ground for dissatisfaction with the former condition of the Church; and though you may still judge those to have been over-scrupulous who were moved by this imperfection to secede, instead of waiting patiently with you until it could be remedied by peaceful means, you must not forget that it is the strong stomach, according to St. Paul, that is to consider the weak, and should come forward to meet these brethren with something better than compliments upon your lips. Observe, I speak only of those who would now see their way back to your communion with a clear conscience; it is their conduct, and their conduct alone, that you have justified, and therefore it is only for them that your special generosity is here solicited. But towards them, if there are any such, your countrymen would desire to see you behave with all consideration. I do not pretend to lay before you any definite scheme of action; I wish only to let you understand what thoughts are busy in the heads of some outside your councils, so that you may take this also into consideration when you come to decide. And this, roughly, is how it appears to these: These good men have exposed themselves to the chance of hardship for the sake of their scruples, whilst you being of a stronger stomach, continued to enjoy the security of national endowments. Some of you occupy the very livings which they resigned for conscience' sake. To others preferment has fallen which would have fallen to them had they been still eligible. If, then, any of them are now content to return, you are bound, if not in justice, then in honour, to do all that you can to testify your respect for brave conviction, and to repair to them such losses as they may have suffered, whether for their first secession or their second. You owe a special duty, not only to the courage that left the Church, but to the wisdom and moderation that now returns to it. And your sense of this duty will find a vent not only in word but in action. You will facilitate their return not only by considerate and brotherly language but by pecuniary aid; you will seek, by some new endowment scheme, to preserve for them their ecclesiastical status. That they have no claim will be their strongest claim on your consideration. Many of you, if not all, will set apart some share out of your slender livings for their assistance and support: you will give them what you can afford; and you will say to them, as you do so, what I dare say to you, that what you give is theirs--not only in honour but in justice.|$|E
50|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to that of EyeToy: Play, in which players use their body to play a variety of minigames. However, while that game only picked up player's movement, Sega Superstars uses a more {{advanced}} system. Before the start of each game, a setup screen with an orange area is shown. In order to start the game, players have to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> where the orange area won't pick up any movement and select the continue button. This method determines what area is the background, allowing EyeToy to pick up the player's position, as opposed to just what areas are moving. This is particularly prominent in games like Puyo Puyo, which uses the player's entire body.|$|E

5000|$|It {{allows for}} {{realistic}} hitting angles and positions, {{and to establish}} a continuous rhythm of play. Continuous, flowing practices are more enjoyable for the student, however they often result in an unrealistic hitting angles. For example when feeding for a drop volley, coaches often <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> {{in front of the}} pupil. If the coach is skillful then this allows the practice to flow and be continuous, but unfortunately means the pupil is learning to hit the ball short off of a drive from the front court with their opponent in front of them - when in the game this shot is almost always played off of a length ball with the opponent behind. With a machine, coaches can set up continuous practices that are always using realistic angles and positions.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 My thesis {{examines}} a {{total of}} fourteen characters from The Portrait of a Lady and The Turn of the Screw. Primarily, I have discovered an overwhelming pattern in these two works by Henry James; when characters make direct entrances [...] that is {{when they are not}} described or discussed in absentia by either the narrator or other characters before appearing on the page [...] they consistently maintain their autonomies, {{which is to say that}} they are relatively free from external manipulations and exhibit a relatively high degree of personal freedom throughout the work. They are not transformed to any large degree and in many cases they seem to undergo no transformation whatever. Those characters that enter indirectly, or are described before the reader sees them on the page, consistently lose their autonomy. Often, this change is quite dramatic, particularly for Isabel and the governess. Chapter One examines nine characters in The Portrait of a Lady: Mr. Touchett, Gilbert Osmond, Ralph Touchett, Lord Warburton, Madame Merle, Countess Gemini, Mrs. Touchett, Henrietta Stackpole, and Isabel Archer. I discover that, of the characters I study, Isabel alone makes an indirect entrance and loses her autonomy. Other characters not only serve to change her but, along with James himself, write her story. In Chapter Two I discover a different balance in The Turn of the Screwâone that has to do with presence and nonpresence in the House of Bly. Here, characters are divided almost equally between those who make direct and those who make indirect entrances. Here I examine five characters, the governess, the manuscript, the uncle, Miles, and Peter Quint, the last of whom emerges as the lone character that commands not only himself but the Bly estate and, indirectly, the residents within. Because houses and architecture play key roles in both works, I couch my thesis in James's allusion to the House of Fiction, a major theme in his preface to the 1908 New York Edition of The Portrait of a Lady. The pattern I discern informs a re-envisioning of narrative privilege within the house of fiction, one in which James alone does not <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> of voyeuristic and literary power, but shares this privilege with certain characters who enter on their own terms, maintain their autonomies, and "write" the fates of those less fortunate...|$|E
