2500|$|General al-Sisi said: [...] "The president's <b>speech</b> <b>last</b> night {{failed to}} meet and conform with the demands [...] {{with some of the}} symbols of the {{national}} forces and the youths without excluding anyone. [...] that includes initial steps that realize the building of a strong and coherent Egyptian society that does not exclude any of its sons and currents and that end the state of conflict and division." [...] He added the army was standing apart from the political process but was using its vision as the Egyptian people were calling for help and discharged its responsibility. Al-Sisi named former Chief Justice Adli Mansour as the interim president and added that he would be sworn in on 4 July. The Shura Council was also dissolved.|$|E

6000|$|April 27.—A {{separate}} line {{to thank}} you for your more than kind [...] words about my rather Alexandrine <b>speech</b> <b>last</b> night; as to which I [...] can only admit that it contained one fine passage—six lines in [...] length.(69) Your “instincts” of kindliness in all personal matters [...] are known to all the world. I should be glad, on selfish grounds, [...] if I could feel sure that they had not a little warped your [...] judicial faculty for the moment. But this misgiving abates nothing [...] from my grateful acknowledgment.|$|E
60|$|THE CLERK. Well, what of it? We're at war now; and everything's changed. Besides, I should lose my {{job here}} if I stood {{drinking}} at the bar. I'm a respectable man and must buy my drink and take it home with me. And they won't serve me {{with less than a}} quart. If you'd told me before the war that I could get through a quart of whisky in a day, I shouldn't have believed you. That's the good of war: it brings out powers in a man that he never suspected himself capable of. You said so yourself in your <b>speech</b> <b>last</b> night.|$|E
60|$|We were often,--more than once, at least,--in {{the course}} of Judge Douglas's <b>speech</b> <b>last</b> night, {{reminded}} that this government was made for white men; that he believed it was made for white men. Well, that is putting it into a shape in which {{no one wants to}} deny it; but the Judge then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not warranted. I protest, now and forever, against that counterfeit logic which presumes that because I did not want a negro woman for a slave, I do necessarily want her for a wife. My understanding is that I need not have her for either, but, as God made us separate, we can leave one another alone, and do one another much good thereby. There are white men enough to marry all the white women, and enough black men to marry all the black women; and in God's name let them be so married. The Judge regales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the mixture of races; that the inferior race bears the superior down. Why, Judge, if we do not let them get together in the Territories, they won't mix there.|$|E

6000|$|This evening, Mr. Gladstone {{writes on}} the next day, Nov. 27, I went [...] to Lady Derby's evening party, where Lord Derby took me a little [...] aside and said he must take the {{opportunity}} of thanking me for the [...] tone of my <b>speech</b> <b>last</b> night, which he thought tended to place the [...] discussion on its right footing. It was evident from his manner, [...] and Lady Derby's too, that they were highly pleased with the issue [...] of it. I simply made my acknowledgments {{in terms of the}} common [...] kind, upon which he went on to ask me what in my view was to happen [...] next? The great object, he said, was {{to get rid of all}} personal [...] questions, and to consider how all those men who were united in [...] their general views of government might combine together to carry [...] on with effect. For himself he felt both uncertain and indifferent; [...] he might be able to carry on the government or he might not; but [...] the question lay beyond that, by what combination or arrangement of [...] a satisfactory nature, in the event of his displacement, the [...] administration of public affairs could be conducted.|$|E

6000|$|... "The reason I {{mentioned}} him," [...] said Mr. Brinsmade, {{lifting the}} blanket sheet and adjusting his spectacles, [...] "was because his name {{caught my eye}} in this paper. His <b>speech</b> <b>last</b> night at the Library Hall {{is one of the}} few sensible Republican speeches I have read. I think it very remarkable for a man as young as he." [...] Mr. Brinsmade began to read: [...] "'While waiting for the speaker of the evening, who was half an hour late, Mr. Tiefel rose in the audience and called loudly for Mr. Brice. Many citizens in the hall were astonished at the cheering which followed the mention of this name. Mr. Brice is a young lawyer with a quiet manner and a determined face, who has sacrificed much to the Party's cause this summer. He was introduced by Judge Whipple, in whose office he is. He had hardly begun to speak before he had the ear of everyone in the house. Mr. Brice's personality is prepossessing, his words are spoken sharply, and he has a singular emphasis at times which seems to drive his arguments into the minds of his hearers. We venture to say that if party orators here and elsewhere were as logical and temperate as Mr. Brice; if, like him, they appealed to reason rather than to passion, those bitter and lamentable differences which threaten our country's peace might be amicably adjusted.' Let me read what he said." ...|$|E
