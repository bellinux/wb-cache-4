40|$|Because <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> deaf or hard {{of hearing}} often {{struggle}} with reading comprehension, this research study asks “what strategies {{can be used to}} successfully support the development or improvement of reading comprehension of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> deaf or {{hard of hearing}}?” Using data collected from questionnaires, focus groups, and student scores before and after interventions, the conclusion was that there are several different strategies that are currently being used with <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> deaf or hard of hearing to support their reading comprehension. The implications of this study can be used to educate teachers of the deaf about which strategies support reading comprehension for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> deaf or hard of hearing...|$|R

He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series. Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902; he developed his own method to solve the quartic.

5|$|On April 11, 2007, Columbia University {{announced}} a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge {{to be used}} exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value {{will depend on the}} eventual value of Kluge's estate {{at the time of his}} death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia. Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and current <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.

Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face.

However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test.
