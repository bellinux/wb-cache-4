50|$|Money was {{extremely}} scarce, but help came from interested persons. The {{idea of an}} association and a hospital was mooted again, but the readings insisted on Virginia Beach, not <b>suiting</b> <b>most</b> of the <b>people.</b> Gertrude Cayce began to conduct all the readings. Morton Blumenthal, {{a young man who}} worked in the stock exchange in New York with his trader brother, became very interested in the readings, shared Cayce's outlook, and offered to finance the vision in the right spirit. He bought them a house at Virginia Beach.|$|R

60|$|Elizabeth's {{room had}} been set to rights for the {{accommodation}} of the visitor, so that it <b>suited</b> <b>most</b> <b>people's</b> ideas of comfort better just then, than in its usual state. A number of books and papers had been cleared from the table, to leave it free for Anne's toilette apparatus, and a heap of school girls' frocks and tippets, which had originally been piled up on two chairs, but, daily increasing in number, had grown top-heavy, fallen down and encumbered the floor, had that morning been given away, {{so that there was}} at least room to sit down. Elizabeth's desk and painting box were banished to the top of her chest-of-drawers, where her looking-glass stood in a dark corner, being by no means interesting to her. Near the window was her book-case, tolerably well supplied with works both English and foreign, and its lower shelf containing a double row of brown-paper covered volumes, and many-coloured and much soiled little books, belonging to the lending library. The walls were hung with Elizabeth's own works, for the most part more useful than ornamental. There were genealogical and chronological charts of Kings and Kaisars, comparisons of historical characters, tables of Christian names and their derivations, botanical lists, maps, and drawings--all in such confusion, that once, when Helen attempted to find the Pope contemporary with Edward the First, she asked Elizabeth why she had written the Pope down as Leo Nonus Cardinal, on which she was informed, with a sufficient quantity of laughter, that the word in question was the name of a flower, Leonurus Cardiaca, looking like anything but what it was intended for in Elizabeth's writing, and that Pope Martin the Fourth was to be found {{on the other side of}} the Kings of France and Spain, and the portrait of Charles the First. The chimney-piece was generally used as a place of refuge for all small things which were in danger of being thrown away if left loose on the table; but, often forgotten in their asylum, had accumulated and formed a strange medley, which its mistress jealously defended from all attacks of housemaids. In the middle stood a plaster cast of the statue of the Maid of Orleans, a present from her little brother Horace; above it hung a small Geneva watch, which had belonged to Elizabeth's own mother; and there were besides a few treasures of Horace's, too tender to be trusted in the nursery in his absence at school.|$|R
2500|$|Opposition to {{the park}} {{movement}} was eased when the Park Commission allowed residents to obtain lifetime leases and remain in their homes. [...] While some contested their condemnation <b>suits,</b> <b>most</b> simply took what was offered, as they were skeptical of lawyers and didn't think anything would be gained by going to court. [...] Many chose to remain on lifetime leases, but restrictions on farming and logging would force <b>most</b> <b>people</b> out of Cataloochee by 1943.

40|$|Does {{everybody}} lie? A dominant {{view is that}} lying is part {{of everyday}} social interaction. Recent research, however, has claimed, that robust individual differences exist, with <b>most</b> <b>people</b> reporting {{that they do not}} lie, and only a small minority reporting very frequent lying. In this study, we found <b>most</b> <b>people</b> to subjectively report little or no lying. Importantly, we found self-reports of frequent lying to positively correlate with real-life cheating and psychopathic tendencies.
