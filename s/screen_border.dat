50|$|The Last Ninja is {{a series}} of video games {{published}} by System 3. The first game in the series, titled The Last Ninja, was released in 1987 for the Commodore 64 {{and was one of the}} most successful games for the system. In 1988, System 3 released Last Ninja 2, and in 1991 the third game in the series, Last Ninja 3. In 1990, Last Ninja Remix was released for 8-bit systems. This was Last Ninja 2 with new music, a new introductory sequence, slightly changed graphics (most notably the <b>screen</b> <b>border)</b> and fixed bugs. Confusingly, the 16-bit versions of the original The Last Ninja game were also released in 1990 as Ninja Remix.|$|E
5000|$|Since the 40-column VIC-II display chip {{could not}} [...] "steal" [...] {{sufficient}} cycles when the CPU ran at double speed, video display in fast mode was available {{only with the}} 80-column VDC (unlike the VIC, which shares memory with the CPU, the VDC has its own dedicated video RAM in the C128). Some 40-column applications selectively disabled the screen when performing CPU-intensive calculations so that the additional speed could be utilized when the loss of video output was unimportant. A smaller speed gain, about 35%, was also possible while keeping the 40-column display active, by switching to 2 MHz only while the VIC-II is drawing the vertical <b>screen</b> <b>border,</b> since no RAM access by the VIC is needed during that time.|$|E
5000|$|The final {{significant}} change {{in the life of the}} CoCo 2 was made for the models 26-3134B, 26-3136B, and 26-3127B (16 kB standard, 16 kB extended, and 64 kB extended respectively). Internally this model was redesigned to use the enhanced VDG, the MC6847T1. This enhanced VDG allowed the use of lower case characters and the ability to change the text <b>screen</b> <b>border</b> color. For compatibility reasons neither of these features were used and were not enabled in BASIC, however the resourceful user could enable them by setting certain memory registers. Midway during the production run of these final CoCo 2s, the nameplate was changed from [...] "Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 2" [...] to [...] "Tandy Color Computer 2". The red, green, and blue shapes were replaced with red, green, and blue parallelograms.|$|E

50|$|The Player/Missile {{implementation}} by CTIA/GTIA {{is similar}} to the TIA's. A Player is an 8-bit value or pattern at a specified horizontal position which automatically repeats for each scan line or until the pattern is changed in the register. Missiles are 2-bits wide and share one pattern register, so that four, 2-bit wide values occupy the 8-bit wide pattern register, but each missile has an independent horizontal position and size. Player/Missile objects extend the height of the display including the <b>screen</b> <b>border.</b> That is, the default implementation of Player/Missile graphics by CTIA/GTIA is a stripe down the screen. While seemingly limited this method facilitates Player/Missile graphics use as alternate colored vertical borders or separators on a display, and when priority values are set to put Player/Missile pixels behind playfield pixels they can be used to add additional colors to a display. All Players and Missiles set at maximum width and placed side by side can cover the entire normal width Playfield.|$|E
50|$|While the Plus/4's CPU {{could run}} about 75% {{faster than the}} C64's, the {{computer}} was still designed with a shared memory architecture, in which screen data resided in main memory. This means that the video chip has to access the memory while it is displaying the picture, in effect slowing down the CPU to less than half its full speed in this screen area. Only during those periods when the video chip is displaying the <b>screen</b> <b>border</b> or putting out the horizontal and vertical retrace signals is the CPU able to run at full speed. This means that, on average, with standard 40x25 screen the Plus/4's CPU runs only about 25% faster {{than that of the}} C64. However, as mentioned the Plus/4 can be 75% faster than a C64 when using screen blanking mode. The Plus/4's PAL model may also be switched to NTSC mode by disabling the screen which sets the CPU frequency to 2.22 MHz (this is 115% faster than C64's maximum speed). So a Plus/4 (PAL) is one of the fastest 6502 based computers for raw calculations. This is true for programs in machine code but the Plus/4's BASIC is a bit slower than the C64's, the operations with strings are up to 100% slower. This result is caused by RAM/ROM switching procedures which should be called for with every byte of any BASIC program. The NTSC model of Plus/4 is about 10% slower than the PAL model displaying a standard screen but slightly faster with screen blank.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{horizontal}} graphics resolutions, [...] "lowres" [...] with 140 ns pixels and [...] "hires" [...] with 70 ns pixels, with a default of 320 or 640 horizontal pixels wide {{without using}} overscan. As the pixel output is {{regulated by the}} main system clock, which is based directly on the NTSC colorburst clock, these sizes very nearly fill {{the width of a}} standard television with only a thin [...] "underscan" [...] border between the graphics and the <b>screen</b> <b>border</b> when compared to many other contemporary home computers, for an appearance closer to a games console but with finer detail. On top of this, Denise supports reasonably extensive overscan; technically modes with enough data for upto 400 or 800 pixels (+25%) may be specified, although this is only actually useful for scrolling and special effects that involve partial display of large graphics, as a separate hardware limit is met at 368 (or 736) pixels, which is the maximum that will fit between the end of one blanking period and the start of the next - although it is unlikely that even this many pixels will be visible on any display other than a dedicated monitor that allows adjustment of horizontal scan width, as much of the image will, by design, disappear seamlessly behind the screen bezel (or, on LCDs, be cropped off {{at the edge of the}} panel). Because of the highly regular structure of the Amiga's timing in relation to scanlines and allocation of DMA resources to various uses besides normal [...] "playfield" [...] graphics, increased horizontal resolution is also a tradeoff between number of pixels and how many hardware sprites are available, as increasing the DMA slots dedicated to playfield video ends up stealing some (from 1 to 7 of the total 8) the sprite engine.http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Hardware_Manual_guide/node02D4.html. Vertical resolution, without overscan, is 200 pixels for an 60 Hz NTSC Amiga or 256 for a 50 Hz PAL Amiga. This can be doubled using an interlaced display, and, as with horizontal resolution, increased using overscan, to a maximum of 241 (or 483) for NTSC, and 283 (567) for PAL (interlaced modes gaining one extra line as the maximum is determined by how many lines are taken from the available total by blanking and sync, and the total scanlines in non-interlaced modes are half the original, broadcast-spec odd-numbered interlaced counts, rounded down).|$|E

In AmigaOS 1.x, programmed in ROMs known as Kickstart 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, the errors are always red. In AmigaOS 2.x and 3.x, recoverable alerts are yellow, except for some very early versions of 2.x where they were green.|$|R
