The first chapter {{provides}} an introduction to how Stursberg entered the CBC scene, how he viewed his role replacing the retiring Harold Redekopp as the executive {{vice president in charge}} of English services, and previews what challenges he would encounter. The second chapter covers his experience entering CBC <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> amid contract negotiations with its union, the resulting lock out during summer 2005, and the relations between what he labeled the Gang of Four (<b>senior</b> <b>management)</b> and the Central Committee (union representatives). In the third chapter, Entertainment, he explains his plan for re-orienting CBC television towards entertainment which would use audience numbers to gauge success. He cancelled critically acclaimed shows (Da Vinci's City Hall, This Is Wonderland, and Opening Night) which had low ratings and ordered what he expected would be more audience-friendly shows. Beginning in summer 2006, the first new show under Stursberg's strategy, , received very low ratings and was quickly cancelled. That Autumn's schedule, though, was successful, introducing Little Mosque on the Prairie, The Tudors, Heartland. The nest year's schedule introduced the successful The Border and Being Erica but also the unsuccessful MVP and jPod. Strusberg's move of Marketplace to Friday nights resulted in higher ratings but his plan to move The National to 11pm was denied by the CBC board of directors. In the fourth chapter, The French, he details his relationship with his French counterpart, the style differences between English and French television shows, the disproportionate funding given to the French services, and the lack of CBC Board members who can understand French. As a means of trying to bridge the two cultures, he ordered English versions of the popular Quebec shows Rumours and Sophie but both received low ratings in English Canada.|$|E

5|$|Castlevania was rebooted {{due to the}} team's {{concern over}} the poor sales in their latest Castlevania games. The team wished to expand the franchise's fanbase with this game. A number of prototypes in {{parallel}} development competed {{to become the next}} Castlevania title. Konami told MercurySteam the game would be an original intellectual property (IP) when it was first greenlit as a Castlevania title. Konami eventually asked them to cease work on Lords of Shadow while it was still in its early stages, until David Cox showed the Japanese <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> the game and was offered help by video game designer Hideo Kojima. Konami then chose the pitch for it as the next Castlevania entry. The original concept for the game was to remake the first Castlevania starring Simon Belmont, but it was later decided to make a reboot of the franchise. Lords of Shadow still drew inspiration from earlier titles in the series, most notably Castlevania for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Castlevania IV.|$|E
5|$|During 1938 and 1939, {{with war}} anticipated, an {{increasing}} part of Pick's {{time was spent}} in planning for the approaching conflict. The Railway Executive Committee was reconstituted in 1938 {{to act as a}} central coordinating body for the country's railways with Pick as the LPTB's representative. This role absorbed most of his time after the committee took over control of the railways on 1 September 1939. Following a disagreement {{with other members of the}} LPTB board over the government's proposals to limit the dividend that it could pay to its shareholders, Pick stated his intention to retire from the board at the end of his seven-year appointment in May 1940. Pick had previously suggested a reorganisation of the LPTB's <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> structure and hoped to be able to continue with the organisation in some sort of joint general manager position. Ashfield chose not to find such a continuing role for Pick and, on 18 May 1940, to the surprise of many within the organisation, Pick retired from the LPTB board, officially due to failing health. Pick's post of chief executive was abolished and replaced with a group of six heads of department.|$|E

40|$|Through a {{multiple}} case study design, this paper aims {{to explore the}} nature of management’s understanding and orientations toward TQM through analysing {{the findings of a}} recent research consisting of descriptive accounts of well trodden ground in TQM: prevention versus detection, proactive versus reactive strategies, and hard versus soft TQM. The findings reveal that the (in) consistency between <b>senior</b> <b>management’s</b> orientations and underlying assumptions of TQM is the major predictor when trying to explain the effectiveness of a TQM programme. Furthermore, the degree of consistency between middle and first line managers’ orientations towards TQM is significantly influcnced by <b>senior</b> <b>management’s</b> orinetations than any other factors. Together, these findings support the view that the degree of inconsistency between senior and middle managers’ orientations toward TQM can have serious detrimental effect on its success.

5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E

Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour, this article aims to understand the critical factors which influence <b>senior</b> <b>management’s</b> decision to adopt ‘green’ HR practices. Data were collected from 210 organisations in Australia using two separate surveys. Survey one, which was addressed directly to HR managers and directors, contained questions relating to HR policies (the dependent variables), while survey two, which was addressed directly to CEOs and senior managers, contained questions about environmental-related attitudes, subjective norms and perceived control (the independent variables). Results indicated that <b>senior</b> <b>management’s</b> environmental-related attitudes, subjective norms from stakeholders and perceived green resource readiness influenced their decision to adopt green HR initiatives. However, attitudes and green resource readiness in particular had greater impacts than subjective norms. Limitations, implications and future research are also outlined...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{multiple}} case study, {{this paper is}} concerned with assessing the impact of <b>senior</b> <b>management’s</b> approach and attitudes on service quality {{and its implications for}} middle and first line managers. Date from 52 semi-structured interviews representing a variety of managerial levels suggests that there exist many conflicts and differences in <b>senior</b> <b>management’s</b> orientation and approach toward QM with that of middle and first line managers. The results further indicate that getting such consistency appropriate to the needs of top, middle and first line management, and of the QM itself, {{is one of the key}} problems of current management of service quality. However, the findings highlights that where there is consistency between senior managers’ underlying approaches toward service quality goal with that of middle and first line managers, service quality programmes will highly likely produce expected results. Finally, the implications of these findings as well as future research are put forward. Key Words: Managing Service Quality; Service Sector; Case Study Research. ...|$|R
