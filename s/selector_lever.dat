25|$|After having built {{a number}} of prototypes and {{experimental}} vehicles, AvtoVAZ designers launched the first car entirely of their own design, the VAZ-2121 Niva, in 1977. This highly popular and innovative SUV was made with off-road use in mind, featuring a gearbox with a central differential lock lever {{as well as a}} low- and high-range <b>selector</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Glock 18 is a selective-fire {{variant of}} the Glock 17, {{developed}} {{at the request of}} the Austrian counter-terrorist unit EKO Cobra, and as a way to internally test Glock components under high strain conditions. Originally produced in 1986, this machine pistol–class firearm has a lever-type fire-control selector switch, installed on the serrated portion of the rear left side of the slide. With the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> in the bottom position, the pistol fires fully automatically, and with the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> in the top position, the pistol fires semiautomatically. The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 will function, with available capacities of 10, 17, or 19 rounds. Unlike all its other pistols, Glock is highly secretive about Glock 18 models, not featuring them on its official websites or its public catalogues, and because of the pistol's nature, it is only offered to military, law enforcement and government organizations, and its production details are highly classified. Early Glock 18 models were ported to reduce muzzle rise during automatic fire. A very early design introduced a longer ported barrel which was soon discarded as it would not fit in a holster. Another compensated variant was produced, known as the Glock 18C. It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, similar to the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the rapid-firing machine pistol.|$|E
25|$|The floor <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> {{also has}} an S position. When S is selected, sport mode is {{activated}} in the DSG. Sport mode still functions as a fully automatic mode, identical in operation to D mode, but upshifts and downshifts are made much higher up the engine rev-range. This aids a more sporty driving manner, by utilising considerably more of the available engine power, and also maximising engine braking. However, this mode does have a detrimental effect on the vehicle fuel consumption, when compared to D mode. This mode may not be ideal to use when wanting to drive in a sedate manner; nor when road conditions are very slippery, due to ice, snow or torrential rain — because loss of tire traction may be experienced (wheel spin during acceleration, and may also result in road wheel locking during downshifts at high engine rpms under closed throttle). On 4motion or quattro-equipped vehicles this may be partially offset by the drivetrain maintaining full-time engagement of the rear differential in S mode, so power distribution under loss of front-wheel traction may be marginally improved.|$|E
50|$|The MG5 is gas-operated and {{chambered}} for the 7.62×51mm NATO round. The weapon's {{operation is}} almost {{similar to that}} of the MG4 light machine gun. The safety and three-position fire rate <b>selector</b> <b>levers</b> are ambidextrous, the butt stock can be folded depending on the variant, and numerous Picatinny rails allow installation of optical sights and other accessories. The quick-change barrel has a heat shield and a carrying/barrel exchange handle. A hot barrel can be replaced without protective gloves. The iron sights consist of a collapsible front sight and a height and windage adjustable rear diopter sight. The charging handle is on the right side of the weapon. For feeding, 50-round belted ammunition pouches or 120-round belted ammunition boxes can be mounted on the left side. The MG5 can be installed on all mounts and tripods originally developed for MG3 machine guns, using additional adapters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{weapon is}} hammer-fired {{and has a}} trigger {{mechanism}} with a fire mode <b>selector,</b> whose <b>lever</b> (installed {{on the left side}} of the receiver, above the pistol grip) has three settings: [...] "0"—weapon is safe, [...] "1"—semi-automatic mode and [...] "20"—fully automatic fire. The [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger and the bolt in the forward position (by sliding the bolt catch lever upwards).|$|R
25|$|The {{fire control}} <b>selector,</b> with its <b>lever</b> {{located on the}} left side of the {{receiver}} wall, enables fully automatic fire (lever in the “C”-marked position), semi-automatic fire (“P”) and 3-round burst fire mode (“S”). The selector can be operated with the safety either engaged or disabled.|$|R
2500|$|In March 1970 it was {{announced}} that the Borg-Warner Model 8 automatic transmission, which the XJ6 had featured since 1968, would be replaced on the 4.2-litre-engined XJ6 with a Borg-Warner Model 12 unit. [...] The new transmission now had three different forward positions accessed via the <b>selector</b> <b>lever,</b> which effectively enabled performance oriented drivers to hold lower ratios at higher revs to achieve better acceleration. [...] "Greatly improved shift quality" [...] was also claimed for the new system.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{floor-mounted}} gear <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> is {{in position}} D, the DSG works in fully automatic mode, with {{emphasis placed on}} gear shifts programmed to deliver maximum fuel economy. That means that shifts will change up and down {{very early in the}} rev-range. As an example, on the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 GTI, sixth gear will be engaged around , when initially using the DSG transmission with the default ECU adaptation; although with an [...] "aggressive" [...] or [...] "sporty" [...] driving style, the adaptive shift pattern will increase the vehicle speed at which sixth gear engages.|$|E
2500|$|Minor styling changes {{took place}} again in 1969, with grilles gaining {{a pattern of}} finely spaced, slim {{vertical}} bars overlaid by two wider horizontal bars, which jutted forward at their inboard edges. Front marker lights became far shorter, and square. Inside, front outboard passengers received new headrests. [...] The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, and locked {{the steering wheel and}} <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> when the key was removed (a security feature which became mandatory for the 1970 model year). [...] Chrome side trim was revised, as well. At the rear, the reverse lights moved from the rear bumper to new three-section tail-light lenses. Sales for 1969 improved again, to 52,872.|$|E
50|$|The Stoner 63/63A LMG is an {{automatic}} weapon that fires {{from the open}} bolt and the trigger mechanism permits only fully automatic firing though burst size can be controlled by the shooter. The entire trigger unit has four trigger pins that give the unit its modularity. The front pin holds a flapper-type magazine catch/release (used in the Rifle/Carbine variants and the left-hand feed LMG with a 150-round drum-type belt container), a full dust cover (used with the top-feeding Automatic Rifle or vertically mounted ammo box on any belt-fed system) or a half size dust cover (used with the right-hand-feed bottom box carrier). The next two pins retain the timer and hammer, {{both of which are}} absent in the open bolt configurations. The final pin acts as the trigger’s axis shaft; the spring-loaded sear pivots on the <b>selector</b> <b>lever’s</b> axis pin. The selector is disconnected when firing from the open bolt and a sliding manual safety installed near the trigger guard disables the trigger when pushed to the rear. The rear portion of the trigger housing serves as a receiver end cap and is used to attach the shoulder stock. The black polycarbonate pistol grip is also attached to the trigger housing. The checkered grip is flared at the bottom to prevent the shooter’s hand from sliding off and has an internal storage compartment sealed by a hinged cover with a spring-loaded hatch.|$|R
50|$|A {{parking pawl}} is a device fitted to a motor vehicle's {{automatic}} transmission {{in order for}} it to lock up the transmission. It is engaged when the transmission shift <b>lever</b> <b>selector</b> {{is placed in the}} Park position, which is always the first position (topmost on a column shift, frontmost on a floor shift) in all cars sold in the United States since 1965 (when the order was standardised by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)) through SAE J915, and in most other vehicles worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The MP7 {{allows a}} {{conventional}} 20-round, 30-round or 40-round box magazine to be fitted within the pistol grip (the 20-round magazine being comparable {{in size to}} a 15-round 9×19mm magazine, while the 40-round magazine compares to a 30-round 9×19mm magazine). It features an ambidextrous fire <b>selector,</b> bolt catch <b>lever</b> and magazine release. It has an extendable stock and a folding front grip; it can be fired either one-handed or two-handed. It is compact and light, due {{to the use of}} polymers in its construction.|$|R
2500|$|The pinned and riveted {{sheet metal}} {{receiver}} of the Bizon {{is derived from}} the AKS-74 and has been modified at the front end, since the gas system was omitted. The handguard is a sheet metal stamping with three rectangular ventilation slots on each side. The magazine serves as the lower handguard and the current models of the magazine are ribbed to enhance grip. The Bizon also shares the same trigger and safety mechanisms of the AK-74 rifle. The <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> is placed {{on the right side of}} the receiver, above the trigger, and has three settings: the uppermost [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger and in this position the lever physically blocks the bolt's integral retracting handle; the middle position (marked [...] "АВ") enables fully automatic fire and the lowest position ("ОД") will activate the semi-automatic function of the trigger. An original five-piece anti-bounce device is built into the trigger unit and this functions as a rate reducer, delaying firing until the bolt has settled entirely into battery.|$|E
5000|$|Red {{contrasting}} topstitching on <b>selector</b> <b>lever,</b> {{centre console}} armrest and door panels ...|$|E
50|$|The fire {{selector}} {{is a large}} lever {{located on}} the right side of the rifle, it acts as a dust-cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe. It is operated by the shooter's right fore-fingers and has 3 settings: safe (up), full-auto (center), and semi-auto (down). The reason for this is that under stress a soldier will push the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> down with considerable force bypassing the full-auto stage and setting the rifle to semi-auto. To set the AK-47 to full-auto requires the deliberate action of centering the <b>selector</b> <b>lever.</b> To operate the fire <b>selector</b> <b>lever,</b> right handed shooters have to briefly remove their right hand from the pistol grip, which is ergonomically sub-optimal. Some AK-type rifles also have a more traditional <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip. This lever is operated by the shooter's right thumb and has three settings: safe (forward), full-auto (center), and semi-auto (backward).|$|E
50|$|The Model 28P is gas operated, locked placing {{breech block}} {{into the left}} of the {{receiver}}. It has a squared receiver with an integral optical sight and pistol gripped half stock. The trigger section with a rack and pinion and weight device to slow its rate of fire with its radial <b>lever</b> <b>selector</b> marked A for full auto, R for single shot and S for safety, {{on the left side of}} the stock alongside the receiver. Rifling came with 5 grooves right hand. The flash hider came as a grenade launcher and could use a bayonet No5 Pattern.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle was {{developed}} in the late 1980s in response to a requirement to replace the 7.62mm Rk 62 service rifle. Between 1988 and 1990 the SAKO company developed the M90 prototype, which was a substantially upgraded variant of the Rk 62. Changes to the original design included the fire control and safety <b>selector,</b> whose <b>lever</b> was transferred to {{the left side of the}} receiver housing, the cocking handle cut-out in the bolt carrier assembly was covered with a strip of metal, the cocking handle itself was placed at an upward angle (enhancing left-handed reloading), the rear sight assembly was installed on a sliding tangent with 150, 300 and 400 m range adjustments and the rifle was equipped with a folding tubular stock with a latch modeled on the locking solution employed in the SIG SG 540 rifle. The M90 was also equipped with a multifunction muzzle device and manual gas valve, enabling the use of rifle grenades. After undergoing further testing and implementing several changes (among them, the selector mechanism was reverted to the familiar Rk 62 configuration) the rifle was introduced into service with the Finnish Army as the 7.62 RK 95 TP (Finnish: Rynnäkkökivääri 95 Taittoperä or [...] "assault rifle 95 folding stock").|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: M2 Carbine, note: the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> on {{the left}} side, {{opposite}} of the bolt handle.|$|E
5000|$|Notably, the {{standard}} Kalashnikov-type combined safety lever / fire <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> arrangement {{has not been}} revised. In the original weapon, the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> was noted for its relatively uncommon safe-auto-semi options sequence (rather than the typical safe-semi-auto), but the only real problems were that the lever was made infamous for its characteristic [...] "Kalashnikov Clack" [...] and {{it could not be}} operated without letting go of either the pistol grip or the forearm. The use of the same <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> in a bullpup configuration adds further problems: the lack of any other form of fire selector device, which would ideally be placed as close to the trigger as possible, results in awkward handling with the weapon shouldered, especially when holding it left-handed; ...|$|E
50|$|The {{system uses}} a hammer-type striker and a trigger {{assembly}} {{equipped with a}} manual fire control selector (the fire <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> {{is located at the}} left side of the receiver, just above the pistol grip), that enables semi-automatic fire (selector switch in the “1” setting), continuous fire (“30”) and three-round burst mode (“3”). The fire <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> also operates the external safety mechanism (lever in the “0” position - weapon is safe). The rifle features an internal safety.|$|E
50|$|Many {{automatic}} transmissions lock the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> via a shiftlock solenoid {{to stop a}} driving range being selected if the brake pedal is not depressed.|$|E
5000|$|Another is the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) {{developed}} during the first World War. The BAR and its subsequent designs incorporated a variety of selective-fire functions. The first design (M1918) is a selective-fire, air-cooled automatic rifle that used a trigger mechanism with a fire <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> that enabled operating in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing modes. The <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> {{is located on the}} left side of the receiver and is simultaneously the manual safety (<b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> in the [...] "S" [...] position - weapon is [...] "safe", [...] "F" [...] - [...] "Fire", [...] "A" [...] - [...] "Automatic" [...] fire). The next version (M1918A1) had a unique rate-of-fire reducer mechanism purchased from FN Herstal with two rates of automatic fire. This reducer mechanism was later changed to one designed by the Springfield Armory. The final version (M1918A2) provided two selectable rates of fully automatic fire only.|$|E
5000|$|The M1918 is a {{selective}} fire, air-cooled automatic rifle using a gas-operated long-stroke piston rod actuated by propellant gases bled through a vent in the barrel. The bolt is locked by a rising bolt lock. The gun fires {{from an open}} bolt. The spring-powered cartridge casing extractor is contained in the bolt and a fixed ejector is installed in the trigger group. The BAR is striker fired (the bolt carrier serves as the striker) and uses a trigger mechanism with a fire <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> that enables operating in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing modes. The <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> {{is located on the}} left side of the receiver and is simultaneously the manual safety (<b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> in the [...] "S" [...] position - weapon is [...] "safe", [...] "F" [...] - [...] "Fire", [...] "A" [...] - [...] "Automatic" [...] fire). The [...] "safe" [...] setting blocks the trigger.|$|E
50|$|The KH2002 {{features}} a four-position fire <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> which is situated {{toward the rear}} of the left side butt-stock behind magazine housing. The weapon is not ambidextrous.|$|E
50|$|The front brakes became discs {{and from}} 1964 it gained a new gearbox with {{synchromesh}} on first gear. The optional Borg Warner automatic got a floor mounted <b>selector</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
50|$|The vz.58 uses {{a trigger}} {{mechanism}} with a lever-type fire mode selector, {{which is also}} a manual safety against accidental discharge. When the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> is placed in its rear position ("1"—single fire) the sear is disabled and the left hammer catch is rotated by the disconnector, which is depressed by the bolt carrier after every shot and is therefore disconnected from the hammer catch. The forward setting of the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> ("30"—automatic fire) disables the disconnector, and the left hammer catch meshes with the sear mechanism. The center ("safe") setting with the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> pointing vertically downwards, mechanically lowers the trigger bar and the disconnector so there is no connection between the trigger and the semi-automatic sear which holds the hammer. The rifle also has an internal safety, which prevents the weapon from discharging when out of battery. The right linear hammer catch disables it, and it can only be released by pulling the charging handle back and cocking the weapon.|$|E
5000|$|Interior: Complete {{interior}} (for {{example for}} the Mercedes-Benz SL and for the Maybach luxury limousine), side/roof/door trim panel (for example the FIS door module for the BMW 7 Series), center console, gearshift/transmission <b>selector</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
50|$|The MP5A4 (fixed stock) and MP5A5 (sliding stock) models, {{which were}} {{introduced}} in 1974, are available with four-position trigger groups. The pistol grips are straight, lacking the contoured grip and thumb groove of the MP5A1, MP5A2, and MP5A3. The <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> stops are marked with bullet pictograms rather than letters or numbers (each symbol represents the number of bullets that will be fired when the trigger is pulled and held rearward with a full magazine inserted in the weapon) and are fully ambidextrous (the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> is present {{on each side of}} the trigger housing). The additional setting of the fire selector, one place before the fully automatic setting, enables a two or three-shot burst firing mode.|$|E
5000|$|The AR-180 {{is capable}} of {{semi-automatic}} fire only and was externally identical in appearance to the AR-18 with one exception; the selector has only two positions, omitting the third [...] "AUTO" [...] position found on the AR-18. There are minor differences between the variants; to select [...] "FIRE" [...] on the Howa rifles the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> must be pivoted 180 degrees from [...] "SAFE" [...] so it is pointing forward towards the muzzle (where [...] "AUTO" [...] would be on a selective-fire rifle), while on the Sterling rifles, the [...] "SEMI" [...] position {{is the same as}} the [...] "SEMI" [...] position on a selective-fire rifle; 90 degrees from [...] "SAFE" [...] with the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> pointing down.|$|E
50|$|Transmissions {{available}} were four- or five-speed manual floor shift, or {{the much}} more popular three-speed automatic with the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> located either on the floor or the column in cars that seat six. In three-seat utilities and vans, the three-speed manual on the column was standard.|$|E
5000|$|The HK33 has a {{conventional}} hammer-type firing mechanism. In the standard version, the rifle comes {{equipped with an}} ambidextrous trigger group with a <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> that is simultaneously the weapon's safety (it has three positions: [...] "S" [...] or [...] "0"—weapon is safe, [...] "E"/"1"—semiautomatic fire, [...] "F"/"25"—continuous fire). The [...] "safe" [...] setting mechanically disables the trigger. The trigger groups can be swapped out to meet the user's specific mission requirements. H&K offers several different trigger assemblies: a three-shot burst fire control group with selector lever/safety (selector settings: [...] "0"—weapon is safe, [...] "1"—single fire, [...] "2"—2-round burst or [...] "3"—burst, 3-rounds; the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> is ambidextrous); a [...] "Navy" [...] trigger unit (three settings: safe, semi and full auto fire) and a four-position trigger group (selector settings: safe, single fire, 3-round burst and automatic fire).|$|E
50|$|The ZF 4HP16 {{transmission}} is an automatic transmission with 4 forward gears, one reverse and electronic hydraulic control. It {{is designed for}} use in a vehicle with front-wheel drive and a transverse engine. The {{transmission is}} operated via <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> and possibly also via switch. The 4HP-16 transmission has a hydrodynamic torque converter with a controller slip lock-up clutch.|$|E
50|$|After having built {{a number}} of prototypes and {{experimental}} vehicles, AvtoVAZ designers launched the first car entirely of their own design, the VAZ-2121 Niva, in 1977. This highly popular and innovative SUV was made with off-road use in mind, featuring a gearbox with a central differential lock lever {{as well as a}} low- and high-range <b>selector</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{external}} safety mechanisms on the Uzi. The {{first is}} the three-position <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> located {{at the top of}} the grip and behind the trigger group. The rear position is [...] "S", or [...] "safe" [...] (S = Sicher or Secure on the MP2), which locks the sear and prevents movement of the bolt.|$|E
5000|$|Fuze setter : He {{operates}} the equipment which sets the fuze time on projectiles with mechanical time fuzes. On a single enclosed mount, he sits below and just outboard of the Pointer's seat. Under the Pointer's seat, {{and in front}} the Fuse Setter, is the Fuse Indicator Regulator. (pictured) It is a box with a window, a hand crank, and a <b>selector</b> <b>lever.</b> On a twin mount, he and his Fuze Indicator Regulator sit next to the Sight Setter between the guns. When the mount is put in Automatic control, he flips the <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> to Auto, and this electrically powered Fuze Indicator Regulator automatically follows the fuze setting orders sent from the Fire Control System by synchro. In Local Control, he follows the Mount Captain's fuze orders by spinning the hand crank until the dials in the window read the correct fuze time.|$|E
5000|$|The SA80 {{family is}} hammer-fired {{and has a}} trigger {{mechanism}} with a fire-control selector that enables semi-automatic fire and fully automatic fire (the fire <b>selector</b> <b>lever</b> {{is located at the}} left side of the receiver, just aft of the magazine). A cross bolt type safety prevents accidental firing and is located above the trigger; the [...] "safe" [...] setting blocks the movement of the trigger.|$|E
