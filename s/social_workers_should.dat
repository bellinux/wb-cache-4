5000|$|Since 1994 Van der Lans has pled, {{together}} with Paul Kuypers in their Modern Paternalisme (Modern Paternalisme), against {{the culture of}} non-interference in social work. <b>Social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> intervene actively {{in the life of}} their clients without becoming moralist (as in the 1950s) or overly persistent (as in the 1970s). According to Van der Lans this culture of non-intervention {{is a result of the}} larger scale of social work and the increased respect for privacy of citizens. Professionals such as teachers, policemen and <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> <b>should</b> according to Van der Lans be freed from the increased bureaucracy in the public sector. In the eyes of Van der Lans, the increased bureaucracy is a result of the larger demand of the transparency in the civil service from the politics.

Within Moshi Municipality eighteen health facilities were selected. The target population was elderly people, health practitioners and people working with Non Government Organizations. The researcher employed mixed methods of research designs which were Quantitative and qualitative. The main methods employed by a researcher were questionnaires and semi structured interview. Findings for current study indicate that 85 % of the elderly people involved in the study fail to access important medications in health facilities. And 80 % of the elderly people also need to have their own window for their health services which will reduce wastage of time in health facilities. They would like to be involved in every stage of provision of knowledge on free medical treatments in health facilities. Also the findings indicate that elderly people take a long time waiting for health services including procedures of getting patient files. Also health practitioners explained that many elders arrive to the health facilities very late due to unavailability of transport. The researcher recommends that, the government should establish specific windows for health services to the elderly people so as to reduce time wastage in health facilities, <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>should</b> provide knowledge to elders on free medical treatment, moreover Public health facilities all over the country should possess enough important medication for elderly people so as to help them access easily, private health facilities owners should accept health services exemptions and elders health insurance funds, <b>Social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>should</b> cooperate with other stakeholders like doctors and nurses to advocate for the elders rights such as health services...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors study if and how persons with {{dementia}} are orally positioned by others, {{and how they}} position themselves while participating in assessment meetings held {{in order to discuss}} access to supportive services. We analysed five assessment meetings where two older persons (one diagnosed with dementia and one without a dementia diagnosis) participated to investigate whether the person with dementia is positioned differently than the other old person. Interactional phenomena used to position the person with dementia were identified by interactional analysis. The paperidentifies six phenomena that positioned the person with dementia as an individual with less interactional competence than the other participants: ignoring the person with dementia; voicing the feelings, capacity or opinion of the person with dementia; posing questions implying lack of competence; others' use of diagnosis; self-(re) positioning; and elderspeak. Persons with dementia are often orally positioned as less competent, indicating that they suffer further from discrimination than other older persons. We suggest that this has an impact on the participation of people with dementia in negotiations regarding their future care. The results indicate that <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> be made aware that negative positioning exists and how it may affect the ability of people with dementia to contribute to discussions about their everyday life. <b>Social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> be encouraged to find strategies to reduce negative positioning in interaction...|$|E

40|$|Death occurs {{often in}} the {{intensive}} care unit (ICU), which makes it a natural place for the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> to collaborate with the interdisciplinary team to provide end-of-life care to patients and families. However, the role of the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> in the ICU varies because <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> do not have a formal role in providing end-of-life care. This study utilized a qualitative approach to better understand how <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> perceive their role in the ICU managing patients and families at end-of-life. The goal of this study sought to uncover the factors that aid or impede the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> 2 ̆ 7 s ability to perform that role, as well as the ways education contributes to the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> competency in that role. The researcher interviewed 17 master’s degree level ICU <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> who are currently assigned to a minimum of one ICU unit on their caseload. This study found that participants perceive their role as discharge planners, counselors, advocate and educators. The major impediment to end-of-life care is heavy caseloads, time constraints, and lack of an ICU interdisciplinary team. The study also found inconsistency in the MSW programs and CEU opportunities for the participants. As a result, there was a breadth of comfort levels and perception on what the role of the ICU <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>should</b> be. Further research is needed to identify ways to improve the field of palliative care social work, potentially through interventions such as improved end-of-life care training in MSW programs, education about the social work role on an interdisciplinary team, in addressing end-of-life ethical dilemmas, and improve on-the-job training for <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> currently practicing in ICU...|$|R

A domain is a discourse about practice comprising narratives about how a <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>should</b> practise and which factors they should take most account of in their practice decision making.
