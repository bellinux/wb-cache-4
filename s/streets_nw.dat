25|$|A quirk of the {{numbering}} {{is that it}} {{was intended}} for addresses on numbered streets to begin at 100 (not 0) at Centre Street and Centre Avenue and move out accordingly.

The highest address numbers are found on north-south streets in the southernmost suburbs, where they approach 20000.|$|E

It was not until December 2006 that the city used its eminent domain powers to secure the land.|$|E
