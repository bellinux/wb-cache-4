50|$|Solid waste {{generated}} {{on a ship}} includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminium and steel cans, and plastics. It can be either non-hazardous or hazardous in nature. Solid waste that enters the ocean may become marine debris, and can then {{pose a threat to}} marine organisms, humans, coastal communities, and industries that utilize marine waters. Cruise ships typically manage solid waste by a combination of source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling. However, as much as 75 percent of solid waste is incinerated on board, and the ash typically is discharged at sea, although some is landed ashore for disposal or recycling. Marine mammals, fish, sea turtles, and birds can be injured or killed from entanglement with plastics and other solid waste that may be released or disposed off of cruise ships. On average, each cruise ship passenger generates at least two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day. With large cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers, the amount of {{waste generated}} in a day can be massive. For a large cruise ship, about 8 tons of solid waste are generated during a one-week cruise. It has been estimated that 24 percent of the solid waste generated by vessels worldwide (by weight) comes from cruise ships. Most cruise <b>ship</b> <b>garbage</b> is treated on board (incinerated, pulped, or ground up) for discharge overboard. When garbage must be off-loaded (for example, because glass and aluminium cannot be incinerated), cruise ships can put a strain on port reception facilities, which are rarely adequate to the task of serving a large passenger vessel.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} landfill proposal {{considering the}} Adams Mine for Toronto's garbage {{can be traced}} to 1989. The following year, the government of Metro Toronto selected the Adams Mine as the preferred site for replacing the Keele Valley Landfill in Vaughan which was rapidly reaching capacity. On 2 April 1991, Ruth Grier, then provincial Minister of the Environment, stated that the provincial government would not allow Toronto to send its garbage to the Adams Mine. In 1995, Metro Toronto began a formal assessment, and the project passed all environmental tests and assessments. The project was rejected at the final vote, in December 1996, to extend the Toronto option on the ownership of the mine because of erroneous information presented by Jack Layton in which he cited the cumulative cost of the project rather than the year by year costs. At the same vote, the Chair, Alan Tonks also changed his position from support of the project to voting against. The final vote was 19-13 against the proposal to extend Toronto's option to use the site. Ironically, it was this vote that eventually led to Toronto <b>shipping</b> <b>garbage</b> to the US.|$|R

50|$|By {{the time}} the Keele Valley site closed {{at the end of}} 2002, the city had made a new deal, to <b>ship</b> its <b>garbage</b> by truck to Carleton Farms Landfill in Michigan.

The Michigan contract survived a vote in February 2006 by the Michigan House of Representatives to ban out-of-state <b>garbage</b> from being <b>shipped</b> to the state from Ontario and other U.S. states, as it also required approval by the US federal government before it could be enforced by Michigan.

50|$|In 1987, the City of New York {{found that}} it had reached its {{landfill}} capacity. The city agreed to <b>ship</b> its <b>garbage</b> to Morehead City, North Carolina, where there were plans to convert it into methane. On March 22, 1987, the tugboat Break of Day towed the barge Mobro 4000 and its cargo of over 3,100 tons of trash. While it was in transit, a rumor spread that the 16 bundles of trash that contained hospital gowns, syringes and diapers was a contaminant that affected the entire load. As a result, the state of North Carolina {{refused to accept the}} waste. After an 11-day delay, the Mobro made its way to its home port in Louisiana, but that state, too, declined the waste. Similarly, Alabama, three other states, and the nations of Mexico, Belize, and the Bahamas refused the load before the operators abandoned the plan and returned to New York.|$|R

50|$|The NDP won a {{majority}} {{government in the}} 1990 provincial election and Grier won her riding handily. She was appointed as the Minister of the Environment on 1 October 1990.

The government eventually authorized the creation of three new landfill sites near Toronto, {{one of which was}} located on prime farmland. Grier also set limits on the amount of chlorine that pulp and paper mills could dump into rivers and lakes, and rejected one particular downtown Toronto housing project on the grounds that removing industrial waste from the region was prohibitively expensive. She also introduced an Environmental Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights gave Ontarians the right to sue polluters and it increased the protection for whistleblowing employees. It also created the office of Environmental Commissioner.|$|R
50|$|Adrift in {{deep space}} with a rapidly {{diminishing}} oxygen supply, Abelard Snazz is cryogenically preserved after a passing meteor ruptures his space suit’s thermostat and freezes his body. Two thousand years later, a passing race of morose, Viking-like beings, the Farbians, rescue Snazz and bring him and the corroded remains of Edwin aboard their ship. After Snazz is defrosted and gets his bearings, he gleefully disposes of Edwin’s remains via the <b>ship’s</b> <b>garbage</b> disposal chute. The Farbians take Snazz back to their home planet, Farbus. The Farbians believe that Snazz is a god-like being, the “Toglub of the Two-Fold Gaze,” and worship him accordingly. They also inform Snazz {{that he is the}} fulfillment of a prophecy - that the Toglub has been sent to deliver Farbus from three major calamities: their economic crisis, caused by the “Farbian Crottle” weed killing all their vegetation; their energy crisis, caused by a lack of fuel; and the crisis of a black hole’s imminent approach to the planet. Snazz is duly informed that, should the Toglub fail to solve these three problems in a single stroke, he will be thrown to the Piranha-Dogs. After much thought, Snazz discovers that the Farbian Crottle is overrun and fed on by the intelligent “Farbian Crottle-Worms” - “the most saintly and good-natured beings in known space.” Snazz creates a “virtue converter” to transform the worms’ good thoughts into an unlimited supply of energy - thus solving the energy crisis. Snazz theorises that other races will want to harness this source of energy, and the Farbians can sell abundant supplies of Farbian Crottle to them - thus solving the economic crisis. As for the black hole, Snazz comes {{up with the idea of}} stitching up the hole with a thread-like stream of “cohesive neutrinos” from a faster-than-light spaceship, piloted by himself and powered by Farbian Crottle-Worms. This plan initially works, until the Farbians praise the worms. An enraged Snazz declares that all the thanks should go to him, and that the worms are merely a bunch of “do-gooder maggots” and “mindless invertebrates.” The worms are so insulted that they lose their good thoughts, and thus the ship loses power - and is sucked into the black hole.|$|R
2500|$|When Miller {{was elected}} mayor, Toronto's garbage had {{for several years}} been shipped to Carleton Farms Landfill in Michigan, USA, through a {{contract}} with the firm Republic Services.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{follow up study}} which was carried out at the Linne University of Kalmar in 2008, which looked at garbage {{management}} and its integration between merchant vessels, port reception facilities and the local council. That study was undertaken by Lundgren Lindberg & Roysson. They focused their attention on the integration between vessels calling {{at the port of}} Kalmar, the port of Kalmar and Kalmar council. The {{purpose of this study is}} to see whether conditions at two other Swedish ports can be compared with the results which were achieved in the study of 2008 and to look at conditions five years on and see if things have improved or if the same problems still remain. It should be note that the international regulations concerning garbage management on board in the case of what and where may be discharged over board vessels have become more stringent with the implementation of the revised version of Marpol annex V, MEPC, 201 (62), as well as EMSA (European Maritime Safety Agency) directives on port reception facilities within the EU and which basically follow Marpol. On the other hand regulations concerning garbage management in Swedish ports are still regulated by SJÖFS. 2001 : 12 (Sjöfartsverkets Författningssamling) As with Lundgren Lindberg & Roysson study it has been difficult to find relevant literature on said topic apart from regulatory statutes and recommendations, therefore a qualitative study will be used and for the study so as it can be comparable to the previous one as well as fair. The questions asked will be of the same nature and character as were asked in Lundgren Lindberg & Roysson report and this for the same reasons as mentioned above. The main difference of the new study is that it will look at two ports, two councils and a number of vessels. The results that this study has reached vary from ship to ship, from port to port as well as from municipality to municipality. The one thing that everybody who took part in this study could agree on is that a single standard for the handling of <b>ship</b> generated <b>garbage</b> and its integration from merchant ships to port reception facilities and the local councils is missing. The systems which are in place today work satisfactorily but have certain problems with fractioning the different types of waste and are they sorted incorrectly, problems will arise all the way through the transportation chain. Certain principals have solved these problems by having manned port reception facilities and others have left it up to the crews on board the vessels that they will sort the garbage the way the port wishes it to be sorted. The problems do not seem to take any out of the ordinary proportions if only two ports are considered, but should the merchant fleet worldwide be considered, these proportions would grow alarmingly...|$|R
