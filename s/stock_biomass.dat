In his publication Marine fish larvae: Morphology, ecology, and relation to fisheries (1981), he points out, for example, the Peruvian anchovy fishery collapse that resulted from a dramatic decrease in population size during the early 1970s. [...] Officials and researchers from the Peruvian government and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization submitted that the causal factors were a combination of strong fishing pressure and weak year classes that resulted in insufficient reproduction and recruitment to support the fishery.

40|$|AbstractForest biomass is an {{important}} variable for calculating carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest fires in Brazilian Amazonia.

This study models the spatial distribution and original total <b>stock</b> of forest <b>biomass</b> (Aboveground+Belowground+Fine and coarse litter) in Brazil’s state of Roraima, taking advantage of data from georeferenced forest surveys in the region. Commercial volume (bole volume) from surveys was expanded to total biomass.

Forest biomasses in areas with shorter dry seasons were higher as compared to forests in regions with longer dry seasons.
