60|$|I am by {{profession}} a playwright. I {{have been}} in practice since 1892. I am {{a member of the}} Managing Committee of the Society of Authors and of the Dramatic Sub-Committee of that body. I have written nineteen plays, some of which have been translated and performed in all European countries except Turkey, Greece, and Portugal. They have been performed extensively in America. Three of them have been refused licences by the Lord Chamberlain. In one case a licence has since been granted. The other two are still unlicensed. I have suffered both in pocket and reputation by the action of the Lord Chamberlain. In other countries I have not come into conflict with the censorship except in Austria, where the production of a comedy of mine was postponed for a year because it alluded to the part taken by Austria in the <b>Servo-</b> Bulgarian war. This comedy was not one of the plays suppressed in England by the Lord Chamberlain. One of the plays so suppressed was prosecuted in America by the police in consequence of an immense crowd of disorderly persons having been attracted to the first performance by the Lord Chamberlain's condemnation of it; but on appeal to a higher court it was decided that the representation was lawful and the intention innocent, since when it has been repeatedly performed.|$|E

In the proposed method, the negative feedback to the image moments is used to control the vertical motion and rotation around the roll axis. On the other hand, the negative feedback cannot be used to control the horizontal motion due to under-actuation of a quadrotor. Thus, a novel control method is introduced to control the horizontal motion. Simulations are presented to validate the proposed method...|$|E

The project was undertaken {{in an effort to}} demonstrate the necessity of coupling the entire hydraulic power network for an accurate analysis of any of the subsystems rather than the current practice of treating a component loop as an isolated system. It was intended that the line model could be coupled with individual elements in modular computer programs to facilitate design and alteration decisions.

40|$|A {{procedural}} code (C++) simulation {{was developed}} to investigate potentials for mixture ratio control of pressure-fed spacecraft rocket propulsion systems by measuring propellant flows, tank liquid quantities, or both, and using feedback from these measurements to adjust propellant tank pressures to set the correct operating mixture ratio for minimum propellant residuals. The pressurization system eliminated mechanical regulators {{in favor of a}} computer-controlled, <b>servo-</b> driven throttling valve. We found that a quasi-steady state simulation (pressure and flow transients in the pressurization systems resulting from changes in flow control valve position are ignored) is adequate for this purpose. Monte-Carlo methods are used to obtain simulated statistics on propellant depletion. Mixture ratio control algorithms based on proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller methods were developed. These algorithms actually set target tank pressures; the tank pressures are controlled by another PID controller. Simulation indicates this approach can provide reductions in residual propellants...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} take {{advantage}} of the top speed of manipulators, vision can not be tightly integrated into the motion control loop. Past visual servo control systems have performed satisfactorily with this constraint, however it can be shown that the task execution time can be reduced if the vision system is de-coupled from the low level motor control system. For reaching, there is a trade-off between the accuracy of a motion and the time required to execute a motion. In studies of human motor control this tradeoff is quantified by Fitts Law, a relationship between the motion time, the target distance, and the target width. These studies suggest that vision is not used tightly within the control loop, i. e. as a sensor that is <b>servo-ed</b> on, but rather vision is used to determine where the reaching target is and whether target has been reached successfully. Through a simple robotic example we demonstrate that a similar trade off exists between motion accuracy and the motion execution time fo [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Despite {{the fact}} that {{minimally}} invasive robotic surgery provides many advantages for patients, complex tasks are still time-consuming, error-prone and lead to quicker fatigue of the surgeon. Automating recurrent tasks could greatly reduce total surgery time for patients. While surgeons gain {{most of the information}} which is necessary to perform the operation from the visual feedback of cameras, there is only little work on autonomous systems utilizing visual information to generate movement commands. A major step towards automated tasks is the autonomous positioning of surgical instruments with high precision inside the situs. In this paper, we tackle the challenges arising from automated positioning by employing visual servoing techniques in two ways: On one hand, a calibration of all system components has to be performed to enable position-based <b>servo-ing</b> in Cartesian space. On the other hand, lever effects which appear {{due to the nature of}} laparoscopic surgery and intrinsic system imprecisions may not be overcome with calibrations. Therefore, the instruments can also be servoed image-based. Combining both approaches to a switching scheme allows for autonomous high precision positing of surgical instruments in a complex setup with four robots.

40|$|Visual servoing {{has been}} proven to obtain bet-ter {{performance}} than encoders at comparable cost. However, the often computationally intensive vi-sion algorithms and the ever growing demands for higher frame rate make its realization very chal-lenging. This paper demonstrated the feasibility of achieving high frame-rate visual servoing appli-cations on the wide Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) processors. An industrial applica-tion, Organic-Light-Emitting-Diode (OLED) sub-strate localization, is chosen as a typical example. Firstly, we proposed an improved vision pipeline for repetitive structure localization, which is more robust, and also more friendly to embedded pro-cessors and FPGA/ASIC realization. Then, a highly-efficient SIMD processor for vision <b>servo-ing</b> is also proposed. The number of processing el-ements (PEs) in this proposed SIMD processor is dynamically reconfigurable, which (i) enables ef-ficient processing for different vector lengths; (ii) can easily adjust to the various performance re-quirements; and (iii) saves energy consumption. For input frames of 120 × 45 resolution, the pro-posed vision pipeline can process a frame within 275 µs, sufficient to meet the throughput require-ment of 1000 fps with a latency of less than 1 ms for the whole vision servoing system. Compared to the reference realization on MicroBlaze, the proposed SIMD processor achieves a 18 × perfor-mance improvement. ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{nonlinear}} {{approaches to}} model the nonlinear pneumatic <b>servo-</b> drive are presented. The three nonlinear approaches are: (1) the multi input-single output (MISO) approach, which describes the single input-single output (SISO) nonlinear plant using a MISO linear representation which allows replacement of the nonlinear analysis by a linear one without approximation, and is studied in both time and frequency domains; (2) piecewise linearization, which systematically replaces, using artiﬁcial neural network, the nonlinear surface representing the plant in the hyper input-output space {{by a number of}} linear planes that are continuous over the boundaries between them; and (3) Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), in which the fuzzy rules are placed in a neural network structure, and which consequently utilizes neural networks learning rules to systematically tune the nonlinear fuzzy model.

40|$|Haptic {{display is}} the process of {{applying}} forces to a human " giving the sensation of touching and interacting with real physical objects. Touch is unique among the senses because it allows simultaneous exploration and manipulation of an environment. A haptic display system has three main components. The rst is the haptic interface, or display device-generally some type of electro-mechanical system able to exert controllable forces on the user with one or more degrees of freedom. The second is the object model- a mathematical representation of the object containing its shape and other properties related tothe wayitfeels. The third component, the haptic rendering algorithm, joins the rst two components to compute, in real time, the model-based forces to give the user the sensation of touching the simulated objects. This paper focuses on a new haptic rendering algorithm for generating convincing interaction forces for objects modeled as rigid polyhedra (Fig. 1). We create a virtual model of the haptic interface, called the god-object, which conforms to the virtual environment. The haptic interface can then be <b>servo-ed</b> to this virtual model. This algorithm is extensible to other functional descriptions and lays the groundwork for displaying not only shape information, but surface properties such as friction and compliance. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Visual servoing, i. e., {{the use of}} {{the vision}} sensor in {{feedback}} control, has gained recently increased attention from researchers both in vision and control community. A fair amount of work has been done in applications in autonomous driving, manipulation, mobile robot navigation and surveillance. How-ever, theoretical and analytical aspects of the problem have not received much attention. Furthermore, the problem of estimation from the vision measurements has been considered separately from the design of the control strategies. Instead of address-ing the pose estimation and control problems separately, we attempt to characterize the types of control tasks which can be achieved using only quantities directly measurable in the image, bypassing the pose estimation phase. We consider the task of navigation for a nonholonomic ground mobile base tracking an arbitrarily shaped continuous ground curve. This tracking problem is formulated as one of controlling the shape of the curve in the image plane. We study the controllability of the system characterizing the dynamics of the image curve, and show that the shape of the image curve is controllable only up to its “linear ” curvature parameters. We present stabilizing control laws for tracking piecewise analytic curves, and propose to track arbitrary curves by approximating them by piecewise “linear” curvature curves. Simulation results are given for these control schemes. Observability of the curve dynamics by using direct measurements from vision sensors as the outputs is studied and an Extended Kalman Filter is proposed to dynamically estimate the image quantities needed for feedback control from the actual noisy images.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} servo-mechanisms {{as part of a}} tightly integrated homogeneous Wireless Multi- media Sensor Network (WMSN). We describe the design of our second generation WMSN node platform, which has increased image resolution, in-built audio sensors, PIR sensors, and <b>servo-</b> mechanisms. These devices have a wide disparity in their energy consumption and in the information quality they return. As a result, we propose a framework that establishes a hierarchy of devices (sensors and actuators) within the node and uses frequent sampling of cheaper devices to trigger the activation of more energy-hungry devices. Within this framework, we consider the suitability of servos for WMSNs by examining the functional characteristics and by measuring the energy consumption of 2 analog and 2 digital servos, in order to determine their impact on overall node energy cost. We also implement a simple version of our hierarchical sampling framework to evaluate the energy consumption of servos relative to other node components. The evaluation results show that: (1) the energy consumption of servos is small relative to audio/image signal processing energy cost in WMSN nodes; (2) digital servos do not necessarily consume as much energy as is currently believed; and (3) the energy cost per degree panning is lower for larger panning angles...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} dynamic {{behavior}} of a F 1 car gear selection hydraulic circuit, when involved in different shift transients. In {{the first part of the}} paper the actual circuit is described, and the main hypotheses adopted for the numerical modeling of the hydraulic power unit, of the control valves, of hydraulic pipes and of the actuators involved in the gear shift cycles are introduced. Particular attention is devoted to the actuators actual sequences, as applied by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to the <b>servo-</b> valves deputed to actuators control. The strategy to define each gear shift cycle in terms of actuators working position in time domain is chosen, using the frequency map of each servo-valve. A numerical versus experimental comparison of the behavior of the actuators involved in the gear selection (during about 50 ms for an up shifting and 100 ms for a down shifting) is performed, with the target to define the validity limits of the numerical model results.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} a 2 DOF end-effector that carries out a haptic tool consisting in a developable <b>servo-</b> actuated plastic strip. To overcome some drawbacks of conven- tional systems related {{to the use of}} point based force-feedback, tactile and glove devices we have developed the triangular mesh approach in the developable haptic interface. The developable haptic strip, has evolved {{as a result of this}} research. The haptic interface of our system consists of a haptic strip that is inspired by the deformable tape that designers use for creating and mod- ifying aesthetic shapes. The first step for designing the end ef- fector and the haptic strip mechanism has been the assignment of both the total length of the haptic strip and the number of tes- sellation triangles required to control the strip as a developable surface. The strip is aimed at haptically rendering medium sized design objects (vases, lamps, household appliances, etc.). Thus, the total length of the strip has been set to be 160 mm. This length value also ensures the possibility to easily manipulate the strip. Seven triangles have been assigned in order to maintain the haptic strip symmetric; this consideration is particularly im- portant because guarantees an adequate balancing of weight in the mechanism. The device is based on a modular architecture of elements that deform a plastic tape...|$|E

40|$|Relative {{humidity}} of air {{produced by}} simple compressors {{used to drive}} ventilators was measured at different working pressures. At normal working pressures, a relative humidity of 100 % was found and condensation occurred, mainly at the high pressure air/oxygen mixer valve. This resulted in blockages and loss of accuracy which could have serious consequences for patients. It was concluded that simple compressors are unsuitable and that medical air must be used. The Siemens <b>Servo-</b> 900 B ventilator is driven by gas derived from a high pressure air/oxygen mixer unit and requires a minimum operating pressure of 200 kPa. When medical air is not available, the ventilators are supplied with compressors which are of the reciprocating piston, oil-free type, without air drying facilities but fitted with cooling coils. Difficulties were encountered because of condensation and water collection in the mixer unit which affected the performance and reliability of the ventilator system.

40|$|Dynamic blast {{testing of}} armor {{components}} often requires explosives {{to generate the}} high pressure, wide area impulses. While explosives provide the most realistic loading conditions, they are difficult to replicate consistently and necessitate remote test facilities for safety. Non-explosive methodologies, such as gas guns and shock tubes, can produce high impulse dynamic events with higher repeatability and increased safety, but are often limited to smaller-sized targets. To impact wide area flexible armor panels with the blast characteristics of a close-in detonation, a non-explosive methodology was investigated using the U. C. San Diego Blast Simulator. The objective {{was to create a}} consistent, economical, and scalable methodology for comparing conventional steel and prototype sandwich panel performance with validation of damage modes and extent of damage using actual blast tests and finite element modeling. A tiled projectile array having spatially and temporally varying pressure pulses was developed to replicate the spherical loading profile of a close-in detonation. Using a high speed <b>servo-</b> hydraulic actuator, the projectile was launched at 23. 0 - 24. 6 m/s, equivalent to 7, 520 - 8, 460 Pa-s with less than 1. 9 % standard deviation over 43 tests. This was comparable to 1. 37 kg of C 4 at 305 mm standoff, which was also used to test five armor panels. Sandwich panel transmitted pressures, measured indirectly via transmission plate acceleration, showed up to 75 % reduction in maximum values compared to the steel armor panels, with up to 49 % weight savings. Deformation profiles of the non-explosive tested panels were similar in both shape and magnitude compared to the blast tested panels, but with more consistency and symmetry. Blast tested panels showed more extensive core crushing for the sandwich panels but no difference for steel. Finite element modeling predicted similar deformation profiles and transmission plate velocities and accelerations. The models showed higher core crush for the blast tested panels and stress concentrations that matched both sets of test results. The applied impulses for the non-explosive tests were also predicted to be higher than the blast tests.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{industry in the}} United States can be cited for numerous incidents of overdesign, incidents that increasingly threaten our ability to produce chemicals and chemically related products competitively with foreign manufacturers. Usually, overdesigns compensate for model uncertainties, allow for increases in capacity, and provide margins of safe operation. Less obvious are overdesigns that circumvent operation near or within complex operating regimes. However, {{with the development of}} more reliable model predictive controllers (MPCs), an important opportunity and challenge faces process designers: how to utilize nonlinear analysis to obtain more economical designs that are flexible and controllable in regimes characterized by greater sensitivities to modeling errors (process/model mismatch) and changes in set-points, and in which good control is more difficult to achieve. ^ This thesis presents a prototype computing system (PRODOC - PROcess Design, Operations, and Control) for the design and analysis of such highly nonlinear processes. Within this coordinated framework are several contributions, including a novel model predictive control algorithm that provides excellent <b>servo-</b> and regulatory control for nonlinear processes and a new optimization algorithm that transforms constrained, nonlinear programs (NLPs) to systems of nonlinear equations (NLEs) that are solved using robust homotopy-continuation algorithms. In the strategy presented, as the design optimization proceeds, the performance of the nonlinear MPC is evaluated in response to typical disturbances and the design objective function is penalized for poor controllability. MPCs have been shown to provide the best response to unmeasured disturbances, permit the inclusion of constraints, and be fairly insensitive to their tuning parameters, thus possibly allowing for an evaluation of the inherent controllability of the process. ^ This strategy has been applied to a bioreactor process that exhibits complex chemical and physical interactions and is characterized by hysteresis and periodic behavior for some ranges of its design parameters. A venture profit optimization of this process leads to a design that is highly constrained and unstable. It is demonstrated that alternative designs exist, exhibiting improved controllability, without retreating from the design constraints. This is counter-intuitive and contrary to the results of several case studies of controllability presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{accuracies}} of {{air bearing}} spindles in the sub-micrometre to nanometre range {{is required for}} the design, commissioning and operation of ultra-precise machine tools, measurement systems and other machines employing high precision rotational motion. In order to verify the dynamic performance of a spindle, measurement is required of its error motions in the unwanted five degrees of freedom (one axial, two tilts and two radial motions). Presentation of these error motions (eg in the form of polar charts) can then be used to provide critical spindle metrology data including total, asynchronous and average error motion rosette profiles and their average and peak values. This thesis describes a metrology system based on optical interferometry for measuring such unwanted error motions in three degrees of freedom involving motion along the spindle axis (axial rectilinear displacement and tilts about orthogonal axes), incurred with rotation of a precision air spindle over its specified speed-range. The system is not sensitive to orthoaxial translations which may be measured using alternative methods. Possible alternative techniques for measuring any of the degrees of freedom include an array of proximity sensors, (one for each translational degree of freedom and a further one for each of the other rotational degrees of freedom), to measure the run-out of an artefact. Proximity sensors based upon capacitive or optical fibre back-scatter techniques each offer the required single degree-of-freedom non-contacting capability and bandwidth. In the current work, a Fizeau interferometer is used to monitor the motion of the spindle of a vertical axis ultra-precision facing machine using a test-artefact. This is a mirror with less than one fringe departure from planarity from which interferogram. fringe-patterns are captured, digitised and analysed synchronously as the spindle rotates. The issue of the prediction of the dynamic form and motions of the observed interferograrn arises and the earlier theory is extended to optimise the set-up, including provision of automatic <b>servo-</b> alignment of the optical axis with the axis of the spindle. Measurement interferograrn data is sampled at selected angular incremental positions of spindle-rotation and image processing techniques used to filter the fringe pattern, enabling measurement of spindle tilt and axial displacement. Issues of sampling with respect to the anticipated spatial angular frequency of the spindle run-out are considered with respect to the speed/frequency capability of data-acquisition and processing arrangements. Essentially, with a spindle rotating at typical machining speeds of 300 - 3000 rev/min, for consistent error motions, the resolution of an error plot is principally a function of observational time. It is foreseen that the system will be applicable in research and production-support in ultra-precision machining production processes and in rotational metrology...|$|E
