40|$|Guatemalan <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> exports have {{experienced}} more import detentions at US ports-of-entry {{than any other}} supplier of snow peas to the US market. Guatemalan <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> exports to the United States were placed on automatic detention in March of 1992 and that import alert remains in effect today. The persistence of these detentions {{may have been a}} factor in the decline of Guatemala 2 ̆ 7 s competitive position as a supplier of fresh vegetables to the US market. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the impact of the prolonged import alert and automatic detention status on Guatemala 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness in the US <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> market. ^ The US <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> market is supplied by three dominant regions; California—domestically, and Guatemala and Mexico—internationally. The international supply is counter seasonal to the domestic supply, although both California and Guatemala ship snow peas year round. This research used an econometric model, a modified Armington demand model, to quantify the impacts of Guatemalan import detentions on Guatemala 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness with the other two major <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> supplying regions. The study also used US market participant interviews to evaluate the impact of automatic detention on buyer perceptions in the US market. ^ The findings from this research indicate that being on automatic detention has had a negative impact on Guatemala in US <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> market. Import detentions increase the costs of importing Guatemalan snow peas, cause delays that greatly reduce the marketability of those snow peas, and increase market volatility by detaining shipments at US ports of entry for prolonged periods. It was also found that some US importers stopped importing Guatemalan snow peas and now buy them from within the US market due to the increased difficulty associated with the import detention process. Findings from this research also indicate that at times Guatemala has an excess supply of snow peas in the US market. ^ These findings indicate that the Guatemalan <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> program would benefit from the development and implementation of USDA Good Agricultural Practices to address FDA food safety concerns. In addition, Guatemalan producers and exporters would benefit from the development of viable alternative exports crops for snow peas producers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of glyoxylate {{released as}} a result of ureide catabolism in the developing fruits of legumes was examined through an investigation of alanine-, glutamate- and serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in these tissues. A study of the distribution of these activities among the tissues of the developing fruits of two ureide-transporting legumes, French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and an amide-transporter, <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum), was conducted. Serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in each species was very low relative to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity. In all three species most of the aminotransferase activity was in the pods. In cowpea, alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity was high in the embryos relative to the seed coats, whereas in French bean and <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> the seed coats had higher activity than the embryos. Three glyoxylate aminotransferases were isolated and partially purified from extracts of French bean and <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> developing fruits. These were a serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT), which primarily catalyzes the serine glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction; a glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGAT), which catalyzes both the glutamate- and alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reactions; and an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT), which catalyzes the alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction. Sucrose-density gradient ultracentrifugation indicated that the SGAT and GGAT from French bean fruits are located in the peroxisomes, and that the AGAT is located outside the peroxisomes, probably in the mitochondria or chloroplasts. These results confirm the existence of an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT) as an enzyme distinct from the GGAT. The results of initial velocity kinetic studies of the enzymes isolated from French bean and <b>snow</b> <b>pea,</b> conducted at pH 7. 1, were consistent with a Ping Pong reaction mechanism involving pyridoxal phosphate as a co-enzyme. The Km values obtained for the substrates of the enzymes were in all cases higher for the amino acid than for glyoxylate. For the French bean enzymes the Km for the amino acids was about ten-fold higher than that for glyxoylate. The affinity of the <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> enzymes for glyoxylate was less than that of the French bean enzymes. Alanine--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity was associated with the GGAT and this activity was reversible, in contrast to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity of this enzyme. The reversible aspartate--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity of the French bean developing fruits was not catalyzed by the glyoxylate aminotransferases. The pH optimum of the GGAT and the SGAT from French bean was approximately 8. 3. The molecular weight of the GGAT and AGAT from French bean estimated by gel filtration was 104 kDa. 	The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} metabolic pathway of ureide catabolism, and its location within the fruits of different ureide transporting legumes...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether there are}} any beneficial effects of magnetic treatment of different irrigation water types on water productivity and yield of <b>snow</b> <b>pea,</b> celery and pea plants. Replicated pot experiments involving magnetically treated and non-magnetically treated potable water (tap water), recycled water and saline water (500 ppm and 1000 ppm NaCl for snow peas; 1500 ppm and 3000 ppm for celery and peas) were conducted in glasshouse under controlled environmental conditions during April 2007 to December 2008 period at University of Western Sydney, Richmond Campus (Australia). A magnetic treatment device with its magnetic field {{in the range of}} 3. 5 - 136 mT was used for the magnetic treatment of irrigation water. The analysis of the data collected during the study suggests that the effects of magnetic treatment varied with plant type and the type of irrigation water used, and there were statistically significant increases in plant yield and water productivity (kg of fresh or dry produce per kL of water used). In particular, the magnetic treatment of recycled water and 3000 ppm saline water respectively increased celery yield by 12 % and 23 % and water productivity by 12 % and 24 %. For snow peas, there were 7. 8 %, 5. 9 % and 6. 0 % increases in pod yield with magnetically treated potable water, recycled water and 1000 ppm saline water, respectively. The water productivity of snow peas increased by 12 %, 7. 5 % and 13 % respectively for magnetically treated potable water, recycled water and 1000 ppm saline water. On the other hand, there was no beneficial effect of magnetically treated irrigation water on the yield and water productivity of peas. There was also non-significant effect of magnetic treatment of water on the total water used by any of the three types of vegetable plants tested in this study. As to soil properties after plant harvest, the use of magnetically treated irrigation water reduced soil pH but increased soil EC and available P in celery and <b>snow</b> <b>pea.</b> Overall, the results indicate some beneficial effect of magnetically treated irrigation water, particularly for saline water and recycled water, on the yield and water productivity of celery and <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> plants under controlled environmental conditions. While the findings of this glasshouse study are interesting, the potential of the magnetic treatment of irrigation water for crop production needs to be further tested under field conditions to demonstrate clearly its beneficial effects on the yield and water productivity.

40|$|The {{effect of}} fungal {{infection}} by Metarhizium anisopliae on feeding and oviposition of adult Liriomyza huidobrensis was examined on three host plants, faba bean (Vicia faba), French bean (Phaseolus vuklgaris) and <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum) in the laboratory. Flies were contaminated with dry conidia {{and allowed to}} feed and oviposit on the different host plants. Mortality in L. huidobrensis varied between 14 % and 20 % in the controls and between 77 % and 100 % in fungal treatments 120 h post-infection for the three host plants. L. huidobrensis made more punctures (47. 3 – 52. 6 cm- 2) in the control than in the fungal treatments (23. 1 – 26. 9 cm- 2) for the three host plants. The cumulative average number of punctures cm- 2 /female by L. huidobrensis was higher in the controls than in fungal treatments from 72 h post-treatment in faba bean (12. 2 vs. 8. 2) and French bean (14. 8 vs. 8. 9), and from 48 h post-inoculation in <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> (8. 5 vs. 5. 7). Female L. huidobrensis laid more eggs in the control (0. 6 – 6. 1) than in fungal treatments (0. 2 – 1. 5) across the host plants tested. The cumulative mean number of eggs cm- 2 /female was significantly higher in the controls than in fungal treatments from 48 h post-treatment in faba bean (0. 4 vs. 0. 2) and French bean (0. 1 vs. 0), and 96 h post-inoculation in <b>snow</b> <b>pea</b> (0. 2 vs. 0. 1). The host plant {{did not affect the}} average total number of punctures but had a significant effect on egg laying, with faba bean harboring greater number of eggs in both control and fungal treatments.

In addition, a great consideration must be given to the target host plants prior to application of the fungus. [URL]...|$|E
