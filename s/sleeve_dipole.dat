30|$|The antennas that {{indicated}} good results were the 50 ohms dummy, the 17 and 20 mm mono-poles, the {{off the shelf}} router antennas (which have <b>sleeve</b> <b>dipole</b> construction internally), and the wire antennas. The PCB dipole and PCB bi-quad antennas presented high SWR bridge outputs. That is, their impedances were not close to the reference 50 ohms.|$|E
30|$|The location, where peak {{received}} {{signal was}} found, was quite sharp. This {{may have been}} due to lobes in the signal from the nanostation or multipath interference. Several commercial router antennas were tested, 15 dB grid and commercial router antennas inclusive. They all measured about the same. The results from the control antennas (15 dB grid, 8 dB Superpass and nominal 2 dB <b>sleeve</b> <b>dipole</b> commercial router antennas) were consistent with the expected values. The PCB dipole was not being actively considered, as there were several other antenna candidates that perform just as well at 2 dBi. The impedance match and gain results from the PCB bi-quad were poor, which suggested the antenna is not resonant at 2.4 GHz. In contrast, the wire bi-quad performance with a reflector was remarkable, nearly as good as the grid antenna that is a much larger antenna.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{comparison}} between Jerusalem Cross (JC) and Square Patch (SP) based Frequency Selected Surfaces (FSS) for low profile antenna applications is presented. The comparison is aimed at understanding the performance of low profile antennas backed by high impedance surfaces. In particular, an end loaded planar open <b>sleeve</b> <b>dipole</b> (ELPOSD) antenna is examined due to the various parameters within its configuration, offering significant design flexibility and a wide operating bandwidth. Measured data of the antennas demonstrate that {{increasing the number of}} unit cells improves the fractional bandwidth. The antenna bandwidth increased from 0. 8 % to 1. 8 % and from 0. 8 % to 2. 7 % for the JC and SP structures, respectively. The number of unit cells was increased from 48 to 80 for the JC-FSS and from 24 to 48 for the SP-FSS...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and performance is described of a high-gain antenna designed {{to serve on}} the Pioneer Venus Orbiter spacecraft as a backup to the principal high-gain antenna unit in the unlikely event the mechanically despun antenna mechanism malfunctioned. The final design, a center-fed standing wave array of six <b>sleeve</b> <b>dipoles</b> enclosed in a fiber glass radome, performed successfully, as did all the antennas, on the Pioneer Orbiter spacecraft which was launched on May 20, 1978, as part of the Pioneer Venus mission. Photographs of experimental models giving details of design and construction are included, as well as graphs showing measured pattern and impedance matching characteristics of the subject antenna...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the theory and}} limitations {{of a system that}} has been designed and constructed for the purpose of measuring the phase shift and attenuation of high-frequency (15 MHZ) electromagnetic waves propagating between two insulated antennas that have been lowered down air-filled boreholes (cased with PVC pipe) at San Xavier Mine, Pima County, Arizona. Both the transmitting and receiving antennas are center-fed, <b>sleeve</b> <b>dipoles</b> that have been tuned to approximately their resonant lengths. The insulated-sleeve dipole antenna is modelled as the inner conductor of a radiating, coaxial transmission-line, which allows simple transmission-line formulas to be used in approximating the antenna impedance and current distribution along the antenna. Experimental results at the San Xavier Mine indicate the analogy is valid. Consequently, the most easily interpreted and repeatable measurements have been made with the antennas centered in the borehole...|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} an antenna {{is related to}} the length of the radio waves used. The UHF antenna is stubby and short; at UHF {{frequencies}} a quarter-wave monopole, the most common omnidirectional antenna is between 2.5 and 25 cm long. UHF wavelengths are short enough that efficient transmitting antennas are small enough to mount on handheld and mobile devices, so these frequencies are used for two way land mobile radio systems, such as walkie-talkies, two way radios in vehicles, and for portable wireless devices; cordless phones and cell phones. Omnidirectional UHF antennas used on mobile devices are usually short whips, <b>sleeve</b> <b>dipoles,</b> rubber ducky antennas or the planar inverted F antenna (PIFA) used in cellphones. Higher gain omnidirectional UHF antennas can be made of collinear arrays of dipoles and are used for mobile base stations and cellular base station antennas.|$|R
40|$|The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{technique}} is being tipped {{as one of}} the most significant breakthroughs in wireless communications for achieving high data-rates with no cost of extra spectrum bandwidth. It is important to investigate the influence of the channel conditions on the actual capacity for the design and evaluation of indoor MIMO systems. To investigate the performance of MIMO wireless systems in realistic indoor environments, we performed indoor MIMO channel measurements inside different indoor environments at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS). The measurements were performed using a vector network analyzer (VNA) HP 8720 A at a centre frequency of 2. 45 GHz for vertical polarization propagation. Both the transmit and receive arrays were formed as synthetic arrays using commercially available <b>sleeve</b> <b>dipole</b> antennas in order to avoid mutual coupling and also to reduce the complexity and cost of the MIMO measurement. We have performed MIMO channel measurements for both line-of-sight (LOS) Ricean scenarios and NLOS Rayleigh cases in indoor environments for various transmitter-receiver positions. Based on measurements results, we aim to clarify how indoor propagation environments affect indoor MIMO performance, such as the richness of multipath, Ricean K factor and other channe...|$|E
40|$|The study {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} using high-frequency microwaves for tissue ablation by comparing {{the performance of a}} 10 GHz microwave ablation system with that of a 1. 9 GHz system. Two sets of floating <b>sleeve</b> <b>dipole</b> antennas operating at these frequencies were designed and fabricated for use in ex vivo experiments with bovine livers. Combined electromagnetic and transient thermal simulations were conducted to analyze the performance of these antennas. Subsequently, a total of 16 ablation experiments (eight at 1. 9 GHz and eight at 10. 0 GHz) were conducted at a power level of 42 W for either 5 or 10 minutes. In all cases, the 1. 9 GHz and 10 GHz experiments resulted in comparable ablation zone dimensions. Temperature monitoring probes revealed faster heating rates in the immediate vicinity of the 10. 0 GHz antenna compared to the 1. 9 GHz antenna, along with a slightly delayed onset of heating farther from the 10 GHz antenna, suggesting that heat conduction plays a greater role at higher microwave frequencies in achieving a comparably sized ablation zone. The results obtained from these experiments agree very well with the combined electromagnetic/thermal simulation results. These simulations and experiments show that using lower frequency microwaves does not offer any significant advantages, in terms of the achievable ablation zones, over using higher frequency microwaves. Indeed, it is demonstrated that high-frequency microwave antennas may be used to create reasonably large ablation zones. Higher frequencies offer the advantage of smaller antenna size, which is expected to lead to less invasive interstitial devices and may possibly lead to the development of more compact multi-element arrays with heating properties not available from single-element antennas...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1800 ’s, inventors have {{considered}} electromagnetic radiation {{as a medium}} for communications between ship and shore and base to mobile. Generally, these were narrow band services, supported by simple series fed arrays. These arrays are limited in bandwidth by an inherent tapered phase profile which exhibits an undesirable vertical beam angle shift with excessive change in frequency. With a symmetrical tapered or linear phase profile, the radiation pattern remains on the horizon over at least 10 % bandwidth. This thesis aims to presents {{the development of an}} antenna which has a unique compact planar architecture, and has achieved the performance required for broad band communications channels in the 900 MHz band. With low cost; volume manufacture, PIM and PIP considered. A major achievement in this work has been the development of a planar passive coupled dipole array with coplanar feed network presented on a single sided low cost flexible PCB. In this format, the array can be re produced accurately {{at a fraction of the}} cost of the conventional <b>sleeve</b> <b>dipole</b> arrays. Due to PCB processing limits for track spacing, the array has been designed with a main transmission line track spacing of 0. 65 mm resulting in a higher impedance of 86 Ohms. At this track spacing, the main transmission line can withstand a 2. 1 kV ionisation test allowing for a PIP value of 1 Kw. To compliment this planar array, a specially designed planar dipole; matched to the new feed network scheme. With slots to augment the radiation pattern for improved directivity and reduced azimuth ripple, and notches to stagger tune the dipole to cover a broader than otherwise band and compensate for the reactance associated with close proximity to the slotline tracks. This dipole meets broad bandwidth and omnidirectional pattern specifications similar to cylindrical sleeve dipoles, while still maintaining inter-stage isolation. To further compliment the array attributes, a robust coaxial cable connection to the thin and flexible substrate employs a novel passive coupler transition circuit. The proposed transition is electromagnetically coupled to source and ground terminals of the array, eliminating the need for soldering, resulting in low loss, low PIM “Passive intermodulation” typically &lt;- 148 dBc, This coupler also provides the impedance transformation from 70 Ohms to 50 Ohms. An omnidirectional six element “coplanar waveguide(CPW) ” fed collinear array was assembled from the planar feed network, dipole elements and passive coupler components, having a total length approximately 1. 8 meters. This large array has the unique attributes of wide band, less than 1 degree beam tilt over a frequency range of 850 to 960 MHz (for a measured reflection coefficient magnitude greater than 14 dB), with low measured passive intermodulation below - 140 dBc “Decibel power ratio relative to transmit carrier”. The prototype collinear array can also withstand a wind loading of 240 km/h. The resulting antenna array meets the desired frequency band and has extremely stable radiation pattern, with a gain of 10 dBi...|$|E
