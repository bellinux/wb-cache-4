5|$|On {{account of}} his {{increasingly}} failing health, Gilkeson spent the summer of 1921 in Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, to recuperate. About a week before his death, Gilkeson fell {{down a flight of}} porch <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> his vacation residence, fracturing a number of bones. He died on September 29, 1921, in Mountain Lake Park, and his funeral was held on the anniversary of his son's death on October 2, 1921. Gilkeson is interred with his wife Mary Katherine and son Henry, Jr., at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney, West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The hot carbon {{monoxide}} is the reducing {{agent for the}} iron ore and reacts with the iron oxide to produce molten iron and carbon dioxide. Depending on {{the temperature in the}} different parts of the furnace (warmest at the bottom) the iron is reduced in several <b>steps.</b> <b>At</b> the top, where the temperature usually is in the range between 200°C and 700°C, the iron oxide is partially reduced to iron(II,III) oxide, Fe3O4.|$|E

5|$|Rule 90 is an {{elementary}} cellular automaton. That {{means that it}} consists of a one-dimensional array of cells, each of which holds a single binary value, either 0 or 1. An assignment of values {{to all of the}} cells is called a configuration. The automaton is given an initial configuration, and then progresses through other configurations in a sequence of discrete time <b>steps.</b> <b>At</b> each step, all cells are updated simultaneously. A pre-specified rule determines the new value of each cell as a function of its previous value and of the values in its two neighboring cells. All cells obey the same rule, which may be given either as a formula or as a rule table that specifies the new value for each possible combination of neighboring values.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} took <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> taking the country {{out of its}} Ottoman vassalage; however, it differed from Conservatives in that they saw the main threat posed to Romania in Austria-Hungary. Liberals were of the generation that had truly brought Romanians in Transylvania to the country's attention; on the other hand, Catargiu had {{signed an agreement with}} the Austrian Monarchy that awarded it commercial privilege in Romania – while quieting its suspicion towards Romanian irredentism. Brătianu’s government did not disturb this climate after the Russian alliance proved unsatisfactory, and the two parties resorted to assisting Romanian cultural ventures in Transylvania (until World War I).|$|E

The AFM, whose name was taken from the Apostolic Faith Mission of the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, United States, was centred around the leadership of Sarah Jane Lancaster, founder of Good News Hall church in Melbourne and editor of Good News, and South African Evangelist Frederick Van Eyk.

25|$|In its {{southern}} portion, the waterfront {{is separated from}} inland Seattle by the Alaskan Way Viaduct, which continues northward through downtown. As one continues north, the land rises more rapidly away from the water, creating a sharper distinction between waterfront and uplands. There are several distinct passages between the Central Waterfront and the uplands: the Harbor <b>Steps</b> <b>at</b> University Street, leading to the Seattle Art Museum; the Pike Hill Climb from the Seattle Aquarium to the Pike Place Market; and, farther north, the Lenora Street and Bell Street Bridges. The last two are not heavily used, {{because they do not}} connect to any major upland destination.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 20% of all {{examined}} human tumor samples {{display a}} mutated B-Raf gene. The {{overwhelming majority of}} these mutations involve the exchange of a single amino acid: Val 600 into Glu,and this aberrant gene product (BRAF-V600E) can be visualized by immunohistochemistry for clinical molecular diagnostics The aberration can mimic the activation loop phosphorylation and - by jumping all control <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> normal activation - immediately render the kinase domain fully active. Since B-Raf can also activate itself by homodimerisation and c-Raf by heterodimerisation, this mutation has a catastrophic effect by turning the ERK1/2 pathway constitutively active, and driving an uncontrolled process of cell division.|$|E
25|$|The Lupu Bridge {{used to be}} {{a popular}} tourist {{attraction}} along the Huangpu River. The bridge itself was actually also an attraction, as tourists could have ascended to the observation deck {{at the top of the}} bridge. The attraction was known as Shanghai Climb, and involved riding a high-speed elevator from the base of the bridge, and then climbing 367 <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> high altitude along the arch of the bridge to the top. The attraction entrance was located on Luban Road, at the base of the Puxi side of the bridge. The observation area provides great views of Shanghai and the Expo 2010 site during the Expo. Currently (as of 03.05.2016) the bridge is closed for sightseeing.|$|E

25|$|The {{passage through}} the Gatehouse, crowned with the royal Bavarian coat of arms, leads {{directly}} into the courtyard. The courtyard has two levels, the lower one being defined to the east by the Gatehouse and to the north by {{the foundations of the}} so-called Rectangular Tower and by the gallery building. The southern end of the courtyard is open, imparting a view of the surrounding mountain scenery. At its western end, the courtyard is delimited by a bricked embankment, whose polygonally protracting bulge marks the choir of the originally projected chapel; this three-nave church, never built, was intended to form the base of a 90-metre (295-ft) keep, the planned centrepiece of the architectural ensemble. A flight of <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> the side gives access to the upper level.|$|E
25|$|Schwarzenegger signed another {{executive}} order on October 17, 2006, allowing California {{to work with}} the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009. In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.|$|E
25|$|The 4th Army {{had held}} on to the Gheluvelt Plateau in August but its {{casualties}} worsened the German manpower shortage. Haig transferred the main offensive effort to the Second Army on 25 August and moved the northern boundary of the Second Army closer to the Ypres–Roulers railway. More heavy artillery was sent to Flanders from the armies further south and placed opposite the Gheluvelt Plateau. Plumer continued the tactical development of the Fifth Army, during its slow and costly progress in August. After a pause of about three weeks, Plumer intended to capture the plateau in four <b>steps,</b> <b>at</b> six-day intervals to bring forward artillery and supplies. The Second Army attacks were to remain limited and infantry brigades re-organised to attack the first objective with a battalion each and the final one with two battalions, the opposite of the Fifth Army practice.|$|E
