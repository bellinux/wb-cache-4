5|$|Analysis of {{algorithms}} is {{a branch}} of computer science that studies the performance of algorithms (computer programs solving a certain problem). Logarithms are valuable for describing algorithms that divide a problem into <b>smaller</b> <b>ones,</b> and join the solutions of the subproblems.|$|E
5|$|Gas bubbles with a radius {{greater than}} 1 micron should float {{to the surface}} of a {{standing}} liquid, whereas <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> should dissolve rapidly due to surface tension. The Tiny Bubble Group has been able to resolve this apparent paradox by developing and experimentally verifying a new model for stable gas nuclei.|$|E
5000|$|Auctioneer: He auctions {{horses in}} the market. At first he is angered that the boy brings <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> onto the stage and {{slightly}} embarrasses him. However, when the boy tells him what <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> can do, the man changes his mind and is intrigued, especially when the boy tells him that <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> is [...] "good enough {{to be in a}} King's stable". With that, he decides to have some fun. He mocks and almost injures <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> with his weight. But when <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> sees his best friend pushed aside, he regains his strength and throws the man off of his back. The auctioneer then chases them away.|$|R

50|$|The boy and {{his father}} take the donkeys to work one morning, as they always do. Many times, the boy loads <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> with <b>small</b> sticks, since <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> can't carry heavy loads any more. <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> even has trouble {{carrying}} stacks of small sticks and the boy helps to carry them for him.|$|R
5|$|The largest bores occur {{around the}} times of the {{equinoxes}} but <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> can be seen throughout the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days. Because the bores {{are associated with the}} phases of the moon, one occurs between 7 a.m. and noon on bore days, and the other between 7 p.m. and midnight GMT, with the largest bores occurring between 9 and 11 in both the morning and evening. Maximum bores occur between one and three days after new and full moons, and <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> on the days that precede and follow the maxima.|$|E
5|$|The {{researcher}} {{might also}} measure the organisation by {{its use of}} communication, transportation, size, and distribution of power relative to the population. (Russell 1938:130,132-134) Improved abilities to communicate and transport tend to stabilise larger organisations and disrupt <b>smaller</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{study by}} Ragna Redelstorff e.a. {{concluded}} that the bone histology of Kentrosaurus indicated {{that it had a}} higher growth rate than reported for Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus, in view of the relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone. As Stegosaurus was larger than Kentrosaurus, this contradicts the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew quicker than <b>smaller</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E

50|$|Boy: He {{is about}} ten years old. Although he takes {{care of all the}} donkeys, <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> is his favorite. When his father tells him to sell <b>Small</b> <b>One,</b> the boy is devastated. Soon he accepts it. Though he loves the donkey, he accepts what his father tells him. He assures <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> will have a gentle and loving master and he does.|$|R
50|$|Father: The boy's {{father is}} not seen much at all. He {{is the one who}} sends the boy to sell <b>Small</b> <b>One.</b> He loves his son and deep down, he loves <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> too, but he knows they cannot afford to keep a donkey that cannot carry a large load. He owes money to the Three Merchants, which may impact his {{decision}} to profit from <b>Small</b> <b>One's</b> gradual enfeeblement.|$|R
5|$|Paris' {{cultural}} centre {{had begun to}} move to the Right Bank, after the draining of its former swampland made the land habitable and fit for crops. In 1137, a new city marketplace (where Les Halles is today) replaced the two <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> on the Île de la Cité and Place de la Grève (Hotel de Ville). The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris' first municipal government.|$|E
5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} most prominently by the incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive. The mechanics of a Peléan eruption {{are very similar}} to that of a Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure is able to withstand more pressure, hence the eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several <b>smaller</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{caissons}} {{are required}} to turn with the wheel {{in order to remain}} level. Whilst the weight of the caissons on the bearings is generally sufficient to rotate them, a gearing mechanism using three large identically sized gears connected by two <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> ensures that they turn at precisely the correct speed and remain correctly balanced.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, the boy takes <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> to {{the market}} in Nazareth. Unfortunately, nobody wants an old weak donkey but the tanner, and he only wants to kill <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> to make leather out of his hide. After failing to find another buyer, {{the boy and his}} donkey return to the tanner's shop. The boy weeps, and <b>Small</b> <b>One,</b> {{accepting}} his fate under the tanner's knife, tenderly consoles the boy.|$|R
50|$|The server {{provides}} two teacups {{for each}} diner: the bigger one for tea making, and the <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> for drinking. Patrons need to steep {{tea in the}} larger cup and pour it into to the <b>smaller</b> <b>one.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> is a 1947 Christmas novelette {{written by}} Charles Tazewell and {{illustrated}} by Franklin Whitman about a young boy who has to sell his donkey named <b>Small</b> <b>One.</b> It was adapted into the Disney featurette in Christmas 1978.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} other related unequivalent tilings, {{such as the}} hexagon-boat-star and MikullaRoth tilings. For instance, if the {{matching}} rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained. Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold {{but it is not}} a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with <b>smaller</b> <b>ones,</b> or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.|$|E
5|$|To {{fill the}} demand for other aircraft, {{especially}} <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> like the de Havilland Mosquito, the Air Ministry began looking at US manufacturers to supply the bombsight. Frederic Blin Vose of Sperry Gyroscope {{expressed an interest in}} the design and felt he could adapt the Mk. XIV to US production methods and have it in mass production rapidly. Sperry arranged for AC Spark Plug to take over manufacture, initially on a sub-contract basis and later for direct sales to the UK.|$|E
5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of <b>smaller</b> <b>ones.</b> The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 13.5-14.5 mm. The forewings are brownish grey {{with a dark}} fuscous scale tuft at one-third {{below the}} cell. There is also a large costal patch near the middle, a <b>small</b> <b>one</b> before the middle, {{as well as two}} to three <b>small</b> <b>ones</b> beyond it.|$|R

50|$|The three donkeys: <b>Small</b> <b>One's</b> barn mates. They seem jealous {{that the}} boy spends more time with <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> than them, but they {{understand}} {{that the boy}} represents a forerunner of the Christ {{in the tradition of}} John the Baptist, and they forgive the boy for his favoritism.|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into <b>smaller</b> <b>ones,</b> {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|Anthropogenic ecology {{refers to}} the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, to <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> like rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries might {{indicate}} that Mesa Verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa. Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that, {{with the exception of}} invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover, the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4,000 years.|$|E
5|$|As his {{businesses}} grew, {{he added}} to his fleet of ships, big ones to ship salmon to San Francisco and <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> for shallow waters and for towing larger ships {{in and out of}} the Rogue mouth. In 1879 he bought the steamer Varuna and the tug Mary Hume and started a shipyard at Ellensburg. In 1880 he added the steam schooner Mary D. Hume, the tug Pelican in 1883, the schooner Berwick in 1887, the steamer Thistle in 1888, and replacement craft in subsequent years. Returning ships brought goods for Hume's general store.|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} the growth of {{vegetative}} stadium of Amorphophallus titanum (Becc.) Becc. {{has been carried out}} in Cibodas Botanic Garden.

5|$|As in all oryzomyines, {{the upper}} molars all have one root {{on the inner}} (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar in Pseudoryzomys and some other species has another labial root. The first lower molar has large roots at {{the front and back}} of the tooth and two <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two roots at the front, one labial and one lingual, and another at the back.|$|E
5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park. Glaciers existed throughout the park area {{during most of the}} Pleistocene with <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> persisting at higher elevations until comparatively recent times. Lassen Peak is situated at a center from which many of these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is a type}} of computation {{in which}} many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into <b>smaller</b> <b>ones,</b> which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E
