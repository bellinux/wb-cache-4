The ITRs were also shown to be required for both integration of the AAV DNA into the host cell genome (19th chromosome in humans) and rescue from it, {{as well as for}} efficient encapsidation of the AAV DNA combined with generation of a fully assembled, deoxyribonuclease-resistant AAV particles.|$|E
2500|$|On the [...] "left side" [...] of {{the genome}} there are two {{promoters}} called p5 and p19, from which two overlapping messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) of different length can be produced. Each of these contains an intron which can be either spliced out or not. Given these possibilities, four various mRNAs, and consequently four various Rep proteins with overlapping sequence can be synthesized. Their names depict their sizes in kilodaltons (kDa): Rep78, Rep68, Rep52 and Rep40. Rep78 and 68 can specifically bind the hairpin formed by the ITR in the <b>self-priming</b> act and cleave at a specific region, designated terminal resolution site, within the hairpin. They were also shown to be necessary for the AAVS1-specific integration of the AAV genome. All four Rep proteins were shown to bind ATP and to possess helicase activity. It was also shown that they upregulate the transcription from the p40 promoter (mentioned below), but downregulate both p5 and p19 promoters.|$|E

To further characterise the role of NC protein of MoMuLV (NCp 10) in the replication of the viral genome, the influence of NCp 10 on <b>self-primed</b> versus primer-specific reverse transcription has been analysed in vitro. The results show that NCp 10 can enhance the specificity of proviral DNA synthesis by inhibiting <b>self-primed</b> cDNA synthesis while promoting primer-specific DNA synthesis within active NCp 10 -RNA nucleoprotein complexes. Retroviruses are known to show a high degree of variability and this prompted us to examine the possible implication of NCp 10 in the genetic variability of MoMuLV. The ability of reverse transcriptase (RT) to extend different mutated primers using an RNA or a DNA template has been investigated in the presence or in the absence of NCp 10.

This cycle can be started from either the forward or backward side of the strand using the appropriate primer.

The accumulation of hairpin DNAs in vivo might represent a side reaction of the CaMV reverse transcriptase although an essential role for them in the virus replication cycle cannot be discounted.

40|$|Cell cycle {{progression}} from G 2 phase into mitosis is regulated by a complex network of mechanisms, {{all of which}} finally control the timing of Cyclin B/CDK 1 activation. PLK 1 regulates a network of events that contribute to regulating G 2 /M phase progression. Here {{we have used a}} proteomics approach to identify proteins that specifically bind to the Polobox domain of PLK 1. This identified a panel of proteins that were either associated with PLK 1 in G 2 phase and/or mitosis, the strongest interaction being with the MAPK scaffold protein JIP 4. PLK 1 binding to JIP 4 was found in G 2 phase and mitosis, and PLK 1 binding was <b>self-primed</b> by PLK 1 phosphorylation of JIP 4. PLK 1 binding is required for JIP 4 -dependent p 38 MAPK activation in G 2 phase during normal cell cycle progression, but not in either G 2 phase or mitotic stress response. Finally, JIP 4 is a target for caspase-dependent cleavage in mitotically arrested cells. The role for the PLK 1 –JIP 4 regulated p 38 MAPK activation in G 2 phase is unclear, but it does not affect either progression into or through mitosis...|$|R
40|$|Cellular RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) are {{fundamental}} components of RNA silencing in plants {{and many other}} eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis thaliana genetic {{studies have demonstrated that}} RDR 2 and RDR 6 are involved in the synthesis of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from single stranded RNA (ssRNA) targeted by RNA silencing. The dsRNA is subsequently cleaved by the ribonuclease DICER-like into secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that reinforce and/or maintain the silenced state of the target RNA. Models of RNA silencing propose that RDRs could use primer-independent and primer-dependent initiation to generate dsRNA from a transcript targeted by primary siRNA or microRNA (miRNA). However, the biochemical activities of RDR proteins are still partly understood. Here, we obtained active recombinant RDR 2 and RDR 6 in a purified form. We demonstrate that RDR 2 and RDR 6 have primer-independent and primer-dependent RNA polymerase activities with different efficiencies. We further show that RDR 2 and RDR 6 can initiate dsRNA synthesis either by elongation of 21 - to 24 - nucleotides RNAs hybridized to complementary RNA template or by elongation of <b>self-primed</b> RNA template.

In addition, specific nuclear fluorescence has been seen in the epithelial cells in the small intestine of chickens infected experimentally at 1 day of age (Kisary, 1985 b).

Each nucleotide analogue {{consists of a}} different fluorophore attached to the base through a PC 2 -nitrobenzyl linker. We constructed a DNA microarray by using the 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition chemistry to site-specifically attach azido-modified DNA onto an alkyne-functionalized glass chip at room temperature under aqueous conditions. After verifying that the polymerase reaction could be carried out successfully on the above-described DNA array, we then performed a sequencing reaction on the chip by using a <b>self-primed</b> DNA template. In the first step, we extended the primer using DNA polymerase and dUTP-PC-Bodipy-FL- 510, detected the fluorescent signal from the fluorophore Bodipy-FL- 510, and then cleaved the fluorophore using 340 nm UV irradiation. This process was followed by extension of the primer with dCTP-PC-Bodipy- 650 and the subsequent detection of the fluorescent signal from Bodipy- 650 and its photocleavage. The same procedure was also performed by using dUTP-PC-ROX. The entire process was repeated five times by using the three fluorescent nucleotides to identify 7 bases in the DNA template. These results demonstrate that the PC nucleotide analogues can be incorporated accurately into a growing DNA strand during polymerase reaction on a chip, and the fluorophore can be detected and then efficiently cleaved using near-UV irradiation, thereby allowing the continuous identification of the template sequence...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{stereolithography}} has developed rapidly {{over the last}} 20 years, and commercially available systems currently have sufficient resolution for use in microengineering applications. However, they have not as yet been fully exploited in this field. This thesis investigates the possible microengineering applications of microstereolithography systems, specifically {{in the areas of}} active microfluidic devices and microneedles. The fields of micropumps and microvalves, stereolithography and microneedles are reviewed, and a variety of test builds were fabricated using the EnvisionTEC Perfactory Mini Multi-Lens stereolithography system in order to define its capabilities. A number of microneedle geometries were considered. This number was narrowed down using finite element modelling, before another simulation was used to optimise these structures. 9 × 9 arrays of 400 μm tall, 300 μm base diameter microneedles were subjected to mechanical testing. Per needle failure forces of 0. 263 and 0. 243 N were recorded for the selected geometries, stepped cone and inverted trumpet. The 90 μm needle tips were subjected to between 30 and 32 MPa of pressure at their failure point - more than 10 times the required pressure to puncture average human skin. A range of monolithic micropumps were produced with integrated 4 mm diameter single-layer 70 μm-thick membranes used as the basis for a reciprocating displacement operating principle. The membranes were tested using an oscillating pneumatic actuation, and were found reliable (> 1, 000, 000 cycles) up to 2. 0 PSIG. Pneumatic single-membrane nozzle/diffuser rectified devices produced flow rates of up to 1, 000 μl/min with backpressures of up to 375 Pa. Another device rectified using active membrane valves was found to <b>self-prime,</b> and produced backpressures of up to 4. 9 kPa.
