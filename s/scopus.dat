5|$|Barn owls are cavity nesters. They choose {{holes in}} trees, {{fissures}} in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds {{such as the}} hamerkop (<b>Scopus</b> umbretta) and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in the British Isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather. Trees tend to be in open habitats {{rather than in the}} middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in North America than in Europe because of possible predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor). No nesting material is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, she draws in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated pellets are composed, so that by the time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets. Oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.|$|E
5|$|The ship, with Stars of David {{painted on}} her funnels, {{pulled away from}} the dock at eight minutes before noon, nearly an hour later than her planned {{departure}} time, and headed to Haifa, with an intermediate stop in Naples. On board were some 400passengers from all over the United States and Canada, most of whom were tourists wanting to see the Holy Land. Many of the passengers, including a contingent from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, were also sailing in order to attend the dedication of the Hebrew University at Mount <b>Scopus</b> by former British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour. President Arthur also carried agricultural equipment and trucks to be used for farm development in Palestine. In addition, the liner featured Bernice P. Schmitt and Rebeccca Adelman, who, according to contemporary news reports, were the first ever female officers on an ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 1979, church {{president}} Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem {{to dedicate}} the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens, {{located on the}} Mount of Olives. The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area, and officials of the Jerusalem government were present at the occasion. It was at this dedication that Kimball announced the church's intent to build a center for BYU students in the city. Negotiations between {{the church and the}} Israeli government stretched from 1980-1984. The land the church wanted for the center, located at the northwestern margin of Mount Olivet, right next to the valley which separates it from Mount <b>Scopus,</b> had been acquired by Israel during the Six Day War of 1967 and could not be sold under Israeli law. The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead. Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land. Israeli officials saw the building of the center on the land as a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law. By August 1984, the church had the land on a 49-year lease, building permits had been obtained, and construction on the building began.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1967, the students numbered 12,500, spread among the two campuses in Jerusalem and the agricultural faculty in Rehovot. After the unification of Jerusalem, following the Six-Day War of June 1967, the University was {{able to return to}} Mount <b>Scopus,</b> which was rebuilt. In 1981 the construction work was completed, and Mount <b>Scopus</b> again became the main campus of the University.|$|E

25|$|Due to a nomenclatorial dispute, {{the generic}} name Scops {{is not used}} by either the scops or the screech owls (which when only a few species were known were placed together), nor by any other animal. In 1760, Mathurin Jacques Brisson had {{established}} the genus <b>Scopus</b> for the hammerkop, a peculiar African bird. Paul Möhring in 1758 had already used the name Scops for this bird however, and believing this name to be valid Morten Thrane Brünnich replaced <b>Scopus</b> with it in 1772. The scops and screech owls, which were placed in Otus by Thomas Pennant in 1769 (as he too believed that Moehring's Scops was valid) were moved to Scops by Marie Jules César Savigny in 1809. Lorenz Oken in 1817 changed this to <b>Scopus,</b> also {{under the impression that}} Scops was the older name for the hammerkop, and valid.|$|E

25|$|The land on Mt. <b>Scopus</b> was {{purchased}} before World War I from Sir John Gray-Hill, {{along with the}} Gray-Hill mansion. The master plan for the university was designed by Patrick Geddes and his son-in-law, Frank Mears in December 1919. Only three buildings of this original design were built: The Wolfson National Library, the Mathematics Institute, and the Physics Institute.|$|E

25|$|The {{cornerstone}} for {{the university}} was laid on July 24, 1918. Seven years later, on April 1, 1925, the Hebrew University campus on Mount <b>Scopus</b> was opened at a gala ceremony attended by {{the leaders of the}} Jewish world, distinguished scholars and public figures, and British dignitaries, including the Earl of Balfour, Viscount Allenby and Sir Herbert Samuel.

25|$|On 13 April, {{partly in}} revenge for the Deir Yassin massacre, a convoy that was driving towards Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital on Mount <b>Scopus</b> was {{attacked}} by hundreds of Arabs. In the seven-hour battle 79 Jews were killed including doctors and patients. Thirteen British soldiers were present, but they stood by, only putting in a perfunctory attempt at intervention in the last moments of the massacre.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Iran begun mass-producing ocular bio-implants named SAMT. Iran began {{investing}} in biotechnological projects in 1992 {{and this is}} the tenth facility in Iran. 'Lifepatch' is the fourth bio-implant mass-produced by Iran after bone, heart valve, and tendon bio-implants. 12 countries in the world produce bio-tech drugs, which Iran is one of them. According to <b>Scopus,</b> Iran ranked 21st in biotechnology by producing nearly 4,000 related-scientific articles in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} aim {{was also}} successful. In the North of the city, Jewish forces seized Arab-populated Sheikh Jarrah, made {{a connection with}} Mount <b>Scopus,</b> and took the villages surrounding the American colony. In the South, they ensured the connection of the German and Greek colonies with Talpiot and Ramat Rahel, after having taken the Allenby barracks. A Palmach unit even re-established contact with the Jewish district in the Old City via the Zion Gate.|$|E

25|$|Under his command, the IDF {{achieved}} {{victory over}} Egypt, Syria and Jordan in the Six-Day War in 1967. After the Old City of Jerusalem {{was captured by}} the IDF, Rabin {{was among the first}} to visit the Old City, and delivered a famous speech on Mount <b>Scopus,</b> at the Hebrew University. In the days leading up to the war, it was reported that Rabin suffered a nervous breakdown and was unable to function. After this short hiatus, he resumed full command over the IDF.|$|E
25|$|The QS rankings use {{peer review}} data {{collected}} (in 2016) from 74,651 scholars and academics and 37,781 recruiters. These two indicators are worth 40 per cent and 10 per cent of a university's possible score respectively. The QS rankings also incorporate citation per faculty member data from <b>Scopus,</b> faculty/student ratios, and international staff and student numbers. The citations and faculty/student measures are worth 20 per cent of an institution's total possible score {{and the international}} staff and student data five per cent each. QS has published online material about its methodology.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue line}} from Ramot to Gilo is {{currently}} served by buses moving {{on a dedicated}} bus lane, and is planned to be converted to light rail. It will include an underground section in the city center with three underground stops: Mea Shearim, Tzfania and Bar Ilan.The 23 km Blue Line would run from the Ramot district in the northwest, through the city centre up to Talpiot and Gilo, with branches to Malkha and Mount <b>Scopus.</b> It would have 42 stops and ridership is predicted at 250 000 passengers/day.|$|E
25|$|Albert Einstein visited Palestine in 1923 for 12 days, {{giving the}} first lecture at the Mount <b>Scopus</b> {{campus of the}} Hebrew University of Jerusalem—two years before the University opened in 1925. Menachem Ussishkin, the {{president}} of the Zionist Executive, invited Einstein to settle in Jerusalem, but this was the only visit that Einstein actually made to Jerusalem. However, Einstein {{was a member of the}} university's first board of governors. In 1925, the original 46-page manuscript of the general theory of relativity ended up at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 the zoo, {{which by}} now had 122 animals, {{relocated}} to {{a plot of}} land on Mount <b>Scopus</b> provided by Hebrew University. It remained there from 1947 to 1950. Its occupancy coincided with the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the siege of Jerusalem, when food for the city's population was at a premium. Zookeepers resorted to hunting down stray dogs near garbage dumps in order to feed the carnivorous animals. Many of the carnivores died anyway, and other, non-dangerous species had to be released.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Bernstein {{conducted}} in Tel Aviv {{for the first}} time, beginning a lifelong association with Israel. The next year he conducted an open-air concert for troops at Beersheba {{in the middle of}} the desert during the Arab-Israeli war. In 1957, he conducted the inaugural concert of the Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv; he subsequently made many recordings there. In 1967, he conducted a concert on Mount <b>Scopus</b> to commemorate the reunification of Jerusalem. During the 1970s, Bernstein recorded his symphonies and other works with the Israel Philharmonic for Deutsche Grammophon.|$|E
25|$|The Slopes of Mount <b>Scopus</b> {{national}} park is a 73.2-hectare (181-acre) park proposed for {{development in the}} hills between the Arab neighborhoods of Isawiya and at-Tur in East Jerusalem. Most {{of the land is}} privately owned by residents of the two neighborhoods. The proposal was opposed by city council member Meir Margalit, who called it a pretext for the future establishment of Israeli settlements. The Jerusalem Development Authority has said the park is important in order to preserve the Isawiya–a-Tur area's last remaining stretch of undeveloped land, to safeguard it from acts of vandalism, and to develop tourism.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the names}} {{established}} by Moehring pre-date the official start date of Linnean nomenclature in zoology as {{regulated by the}} ICZN, which is December 31, 1758 – {{the last day of}} the year in which the 10th edition of Linné's Systema Naturae was published. Hence, <b>Scopus</b> as established by Brisson is indeed the valid generic name of the hammerkop, and the first valid use of Scops was in 1772 by Brünnich – which according to modern rules of zoological nomenclature was unjustified however, as the name he believed to be reinstating had never been technically valid in the first place.|$|E
25|$|UiTM in Shah Alam main {{campus and}} its {{satellite}} campuses in the Klang Valley have been focusing on research excellence and postgraduate training since 2009 {{in response to}} the 10th Malaysia Plan, which included the Research and Development (R) Roadmap Action Plan. The UiTM R Roadmap specifically emphasized on two research performance indicators, namely to increase number of principal investigators and students to publish in Web of Science and <b>Scopus</b> journals. Research funding in UiTM has been steadily increasing from just over RM14 million in 2006 to RM50.4 million in 2011. Social science and humanities research made up around 20% of the secured funding.|$|E
25|$|On 27 March {{an attack}} on a convoy {{returning}} from the Gush Etzion settlement block south of Jerusalem left 15 Jews dead. In April, shortly after the Jewish attack on the Arab village of Deir Yassin west of Jerusalem which caused many civilian casualties, Arab forces attacked a Jewish medical convoy on its way to Hadassah Hospital on Mount <b>Scopus.</b> The British had provided no escort (as they had in previous months) and both they and Palmach forces were slow to intervene during the attack and help the ambushed Jews. After seven hours of fighting, the British {{put an end to the}} standoff; by then 78 Jews (mostly unarmed medical personnel) had been killed, as was one British soldier.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} General Allenby took Jerusalem from the Ottomans in 1917, the new city was a {{patchwork}} of neighborhoods and communities, each with a distinct ethnic character. This continued under British rule, as the New City of Jerusalem grew outside the old city walls and the Old City of Jerusalem gradually emerged {{as little more than}} an impoverished older neighborhood. Sir Ronald Storrs, the first British military governor of the city, issued a town planning order requiring new buildings in the city to be faced with sandstone and thus preserving some of the overall look of the city even as it grew. During the 1930s, two important new institutions, the Hadassah Medical Center and Hebrew University were founded on Jerusalem's Mount <b>Scopus.</b>|$|E
