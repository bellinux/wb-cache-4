50|$|In {{order to}} select the correct power it is {{necessary}} to first calculate the thermal energy required to raise the material to the required temperature in the time allotted. This can be done using the heat content of the material which is normal expressed in kW hours per tonne, the weight of metal to be processed and the time cycle. Once this has been established other factors such as radiated losses from the component, coil losses and other system losses need to be factored in. Traditionally this process involved lengthy and complex calculations in conjunction with a mixture of practical experience and empirical formula. Modern techniques use finite element analysis and other computer-aided manufacturing techniques, however as with all such methods a thorough working knowledge of the induction heating process is still required.

The aim of this work is to characterize and evaluate these wastes for recycling in quicklime production.

The RDIN reactivity of the resulted lime is changeable along <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> at 1000 ℃because of the microfabric of its crystallites. The lime of the “Solid” sample is preserving the original limestone microstructure that contributes in its higher RDIN reactivity values at all <b>soaking</b> <b>times.</b> The relatively higher degree of grain growth of lime crystallites in the “Sahala” sample leads to its lower reactivity.

A review of the BRUVS literature found that most adopted sampling designs from other studies were rarely designed from pilot studies. This potentially compromises their value for monitoring natural and anthropogenic variation. The aims of this study were: (i) to assess the suitability of BRUVS for sampling fishes in estuarine habitats (seagrass beds and unvegetated sediments) and (ii) to develop an optimal and cost effective sampling methodology for each habitat. Fishes in both habitats were sampled independently using BRUVS with soak times of 30, 60, 90 min (n = 4). Thirty five species of fishes were recorded including 18 species of economic importance. Mean number of species, mean total Max N and mean Max N of species did not differ among soak times.

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsThe {{purpose of}} the thesis was to examine if the {{material}} properties and/or the morphology of a martensitic ferritic stainless steel were altered if exposed to varying <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> at two distinct hardening temperatures. The background for the thesis was the need to analyze and verify the optimality of the hardening processes currently performed at NOMAC – Norwegian Material Center of Expertise AS. The analyzed steel was hot-forged S 165 M (W. nr. 1. 4418, X 4 CrNiMo 16 - 5 - 1). The two hardening temperatures were 1000 °C and 1030 °C. The <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> analyzed were 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 hours, for both temperatures. Both as-quenched and tempered samples were examined. Standardized mechanical testing was performed, and included tensile stress testing, hardness Vickers testing and Charpy-V impact testing. The mechanical properties remained statistically consistent. Neither the as-quenched nor the tempered samples showed any indication that the <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> directly altered said properties. The two different temperatures produced statistically equivalent results. The majority of the observed differences in properties between as-quenched and tempered samples were as expected. The gathered impact energy values did not differentiate between as-quenched/tempered samples, leading to a debate regarding their validity. The general conclusion is that the mechanical properties are not correlated with longer/shorter <b>soaking</b> <b>times.</b> The material morphology was analyzed using optical light microscopy, and SEM (including EDS and EBSD analysis). The use of different temperatures had little to {{no effect on the}} final microstructure. Morphologically, the material experienced substantial changes when exposed to longer <b>soaking</b> <b>times.</b> Longer <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> introduced the growth of the average martensitic (i. e. prior austenitic) grain diameters, where the growth exceeded 80 % after a <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> of 20 hours. The longer <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> also caused a reduced ferrite fraction for samples hardened at 1000 °C (the fraction of ferrite was 0. 19 in sample soaked for 1 hour, 0. 11 in samples soaked for 20 hours). This caused a subsequent increase in the martensite fraction. The general ferritic grain shapes were also affected with longer <b>soaking</b> <b>times,</b> transforming from lacy/vermicular grain shapes into globular grains. With regards to material properties, several of these changes counteract each other. It is therefore believed that the combination of the martensitic grain growth and the reduction of ferrite content yields approximately constant mechanical properties. How these morphological changes alter the mechanical properties when occurring individually is not examined. The results of the thesis indicate that S 165 M is a remarkably resistant alloy, producing consistent qualities regardless of the <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> and/or the hardening temperature...|$|R

At 100  °C, the IB retention of the MDI board did not reach the lower limit for <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> of 1 – 2  h, and 72  h was required to reach it. Thus a short-time soaking to reach the lower limit must be developed. In addition, because the reduction mechanism of {{the properties of the}} boards soaked in water is {{different from that of the}} boards exposed outdoors, it is difficult to predict the durability of outdoor exposure on the basis of the resultant durability of water soaking.|$|R
30|$|Figure  4 b {{shows the}} {{relationships}} between <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> and IB retention of the MDI board. Although IB retention at 100  °C for the PF board decreased to 19  % at 1  h, IB retention for the MDI board reached 73  % at 1  h, but decreased {{with an increase in}} the <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> and dropped to 47  % (the lower limit) at 72  h.|$|R
30|$|Figure  4 b {{shows the}} {{relationships}} between <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> and the LNR retention of the MDI board. An LNR retention that exceeded 100 % was recorded as 100 %. At 40  °C, the LNR retention was as high as 100 % irrespective of <b>soaking</b> <b>time.</b> At 70  °C, it was 100 % until 6  h and subsequently decreased slightly. At 100  °C, it decreased slightly with increasing <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> {{and it was as}} high as 86.9 % at 72  h. Thus, the lower limit must be approximately 90 %. Furthermore, the LNR retention of the MDI board was higher than that of the PF board and did not decrease significantly even with prolonged soaking at 100  °C.|$|R
