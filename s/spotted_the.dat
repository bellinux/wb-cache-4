5|$|Furthermore, when Rincewind <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> Luggage in the film, it {{was after}} he had {{attempted}} {{to jump into the}} River Ankh, whereas in the book he <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> Luggage when he was sitting in the Broken Drum.|$|E
5|$|After 17:30 Kamimura led his {{division}} in a fruitless pursuit {{of some of}} the Russian cruisers, leaving Tōgō's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō. His ships <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when the range closed to 8000–9000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20:08 as night was falling. The surviving Russian ships were <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Air Traffic Control Officer John Davis, who was {{responsible}} for Flight 712 and had first <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> port engine fire from the ground, was appointed MBE.|$|E

50|$|H. guttatopustulata is 7-9 mm in length, {{with the}} {{distinct}} rounded elytra or fore wings typical of ladybirds. Apart from their coloured <b>spots,</b> <b>the</b> elytra and pronotum are black, while the propleura, {{the sides of}} the prothorax, are yellow or yellowish brown. Each elytron bears three <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> <b>spot</b> on <b>the</b> top of the midline is reddish brown, as is <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> on <b>the</b> rear of <b>the</b> elytron. Another <b>spot</b> on <b>the</b> lower front part of the elytron also is yellow or yellowish brown.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} vocalizations are used and, like other corvids, grey jays may mimic other bird species, {{especially}} predators. Calls include a whistled quee-oo, and various clicks and chuckles. When predators are <b>spotted,</b> <b>the</b> bird announces {{a series of}} harsh clicks to signal a threat on the ground, or a series of repeated whistles to indicate a predator in the air.|$|E
5|$|After being <b>spotted,</b> <b>the</b> German {{ships in}} Førde Fjord sailed further up the fjord and {{prepared}} for an Allied attack. Z33 and several of her escorts anchored close to the steep southern slopes of the fjord {{near the village of}} Bjørkedal. Meanwhile, other ships moored near the northern shore after breaking up pack ice with gunfire. This anchorage was also protected by flak batteries on the shore of the fjord.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Amber Room {{was never}} seen in public again, though reports have {{occasionally}} surfaced stating that pieces of the Amber Room survived the war. Several eyewitnesses claimed to have <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> famous room being loaded on board the Wilhelm Gustloff, which left Gdynia on 30 January 1945, and was then promptly torpedoed and sunk by a Soviet submarine.|$|E

50|$|The common small flat has a {{wingspan}} {{or around}} 30-35 mm. It is a dull black or brown butterfly with a semi-transparent <b>spot</b> on <b>the</b> wings and sometimes with no visible <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> {{underside of the}} wings is grey brown with diffused dark <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> male and female are similar in shape and colour and with hardly any differentiation. Both sexes of the flat are similar in appearance, being dull brownish black above and greyer in colour below. The butterflies have small, semi-transparent discal, cell and apical <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> dark <b>spots</b> on <b>the</b> underside of the forewing are large, dark and diffused.|$|R
5|$|Because {{of the bad}} weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} surfaces of the plane, and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 16:30. The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Early in the afternoon, the North Korean {{aircraft}} {{returned in}} larger numbers {{to attack the}} air transports. A flight of eight Ilyushin Il-10s appeared in the airspace between Seoul and Inchon, attempting to ambush transport aircraft while still {{on the ground at}} the airfields. The F-80s <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> North Korean planes and engaged them. The North Korean aircraft split into two groups of four and quickly destroyed a Republic of Korea Air Force T-6 Texan parked on the tarmac at Kimpo.|$|E
5|$|French and British patrol frigates each <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> other's fleet around 9:30 am; both {{at first}} underestimated {{the size of}} the other fleet, leading each {{commander}} to believe the other fleet was the smaller fleet of Admiral de Barras. When the true size of the fleets became apparent, Graves assumed that de Grasse and Barras had already joined forces, and prepared for battle; he directed his line toward the bay's mouth, assisted by winds from the north-northeast.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. All crosslines are brown, indistinct, {{with a black}} costal <b>spot.</b> <b>The</b> terminal line is marked by black interneural <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> hindwing is dark brown. The underside is unicolorous brown.|$|R

50|$|Danaus dorippus is a {{medium-sized}} butterfly with a wingspan of about 60 - 80 mm. The body is black {{with a few}} white <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> wings are tawny and have a thin border of black enclosing a series of semicircular white <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> hindwing has three or four black <b>spots</b> around <b>the</b> center.|$|R
5|$|In October 1990, while {{flying a}} {{training}} route in eastern Colorado, B-1B (s/n 86-0128) from the 384th Bomb Wing, 28th Bomb Squadron, McConnell AFB, experienced an explosion as the engines reached full power without afterburners. Fire on the aircraft's left was <b>spotted.</b> <b>The</b> #1 engine {{was shut down}} and its fire extinguisher was activated. The accident investigation determined that the engine had suffered catastrophic failure, engine blades had cut through the engine mounts and the engine became detached from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|President drew {{away while}} her crew made hurried repairs of their own. Within two hours, {{one of her}} lookouts <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> {{remainder}} of the enemy squadron drawing near. President continued her escape attempt, but by nightfall HMS Pomone and Tenedos had caught up and began firing broadsides. Realizing his situation, Decatur surrendered President again, just before midnight.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese never <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> D-21B. The {{first one}} failed {{to turn around}} and {{continued}} straight on, crashing somewhere in the Soviet Union. Another test flight was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct any problems. The second operational mission, however, was not until 16 December 1970. The D-21B reached Lop Nor and back to the recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs.|$|E
50|$|The body of this goniodorid nudibranch is {{translucent}} {{white with}} red patches composed of small red dots partly coalesced into irregular shaped <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> rhinophores and gills are white {{with a few}} smaller red <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> oral tentacles, lateral papillae, gills, and tail have red <b>spots</b> at <b>the</b> base and yellow tips.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 42 mm. The forewings are yellow, {{with a pink}} costal area to beyond the middle. There is a subbasal pink <b>spot</b> below <b>the</b> cell and an antemedial <b>spot</b> in <b>the</b> cell and another further from the base below the cell, {{as well as a}} round <b>spot</b> in <b>the</b> cell towards the extremity and two small discoidal <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> inner margin is pink from the middle to the toruus and there is a postmedial series of pink spots, as well as a subterminal series of small <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> hindwings are pale yellow.|$|R
5|$|The convoy, {{moving at}} , was not {{detected}} for some time, because of two tropical storms that struck the Solomon and Bismarck Seas between 27 February and 1 March, but at about 15:00 on 1 March, {{the crew of}} a patrolling B-24 Liberator heavy bomber <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> convoy. Eight B-17 Flying Fortresses {{were sent to the}} location but failed to locate the ships.|$|E
5|$|When a mouse {{or other}} prey is <b>spotted,</b> <b>the</b> kite drops silently onto it, feet-first with wings raised high; {{sometimes}} in one long drop to ground level, {{more often in}} two or more stages, with hovering pauses at intermediate heights. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. Prey can either be eaten in flight or carried back to a perch. Birds will have a favoured feeding perch, beneath which accumulate piles of pellets or castings.|$|E
5|$|About an {{hour after}} Saratoga {{launched}} her airstrike, the Japanese launched theirs once they located the American carriers. Shōkaku contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while Zuikaku launched nine D3As and six Zeros. Reconnaissance SBDs from Enterprise <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> 1st Carrier Division shortly after the Japanese airstrike had taken off and five of Shōkakus Zeros stayed behind {{to deal with the}} Dauntlesses as they attacked Shōkaku. The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros, but their spot report was garbled and the enemy's location could not be understood. This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow-on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros.|$|E

50|$|The North-Chinese leopard {{was first}} {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a single tanned skin, which was fulvous above and pale beneath with large roundish, oblong black <b>spots</b> on <b>the</b> back and limbs, and small black <b>spots</b> on <b>the</b> head. <b>The</b> <b>spots</b> on <b>the</b> back, shoulders and sides formed a ring around a central fulvous <b>spot.</b> <b>The</b> black <b>spots</b> on <b>the</b> nape were elongated, and large ones on the chest formed a necklace. <b>The</b> tail was <b>spotted</b> and had four black rings at the tip.|$|R
5|$|As 9 Staffel {{crossed the}} coast they were fired at by Royal Navy patrol boats. The machine gun fire was ineffective. However, the Royal Observer Corps Post K3, {{situated}} {{on top of}} Beachy Head, <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> Dorniers. They immediately telephoned a warning to Observer Group Headquarters at Horsham and fighter sector stations in the area, including RAF Kenley. Wing Commander Thomas Prickman, the station commander at Kenley, noticed the low-flying Dornier plot appear on his situation map. They appeared to be heading away towards the west, and was unsure of their target. His controllers were organising Nos. 64 and 615 Squadrons to meet the high-altitude raid. Roth headed past Lewes until {{he picked up the}} Brighton–London rail line. He then turned north-west.|$|E
5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E
5|$|As {{the advance}} led by Gerhard Schöpfel {{made their way}} past the coast it <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> vic-formation of RAF fighters. They were Hurricanes of 501 Squadron which were {{conducting}} wide spirals to gain height. Schöpfel bounced them and shot down four in two minutes killing one pilot and wounding three others. As he departed {{other members of his}} Geschwader (Wing) dived on the Squadron and an inconclusive dogfight ensued. Schöpfel's victims were Donald McKay and Pilot Officers J.W Bland, Kenneth Lee and F. Kozlowski. Bland was the only one killed.|$|E
