40|$|The Finite Strip Method (FSM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{efficient}} methods for structural analysis of bridges, reducing the time required for analysis without affecting the degree of accuracy. The Finite strip method is therefore an ideal platform for the traditional time-consuming dynamic analysis of long span bridges. The dynamic behavior of a continuous long span bridge significantly depends on the properties of all the bridge structural components. However, the current practice of using the finite strip method is limited to the analysis of the bridge deck subjected to simulated boundary conditions over the supports. The interactions between different bridge structures cannot be modeled using conventional methods. In this regard, this study introduces an integrated analytical solution for continuous long span bridges by modeling all the bridge components together, using the spline finite strip method. The Column Strips are developed to model the cantilever-behaved piers and towers, and <b>Cable</b> <b>Strip</b> is developed for the cables in long span bridges. In addition, a special Transition Section is developed to combine different structures in the finite strip environment. By representing the whole bridge as a single integrated system, the actual dynamic behavior of the bridge can be studied using the conventional dynamic analysis method. Moreover, by using the Pseudo Excitation Method (PEM), which is a fast complete quadratic combination algorithm using power spectral density matrix for random responses, the dynamic analysis of a complicated continuous long span structure can be performed in minimal time. In the study, the development of the Column <b>Strips,</b> <b>Cable</b> <b>Strip</b> and the Transition Section are presented, and the application of the time-history analysis method and PEM in the finite strip environment is introduced. Furthermore, three numerical examples are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed solution...|$|R

50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the 3-ring system, variations in the design have raised safety concerns. For example, the move to mini rings and mini risers caused riser failures on some designs until riser strength was improved. The failure of some manufacturers to include stiff riser inserts and other hard housing cable guides to allow the free movement of the cutaway cable when risers and webbing are twisted has caused difficulty in cutting away from malfunctions with riser twists or harness deformations. The tolerance in the manufacture of the fabric risers and their connection to the rings is critical in maintaining the mechanical advantage of the 3-ring system and this has been compromised in some designs. Reversed risers placing the rings under the risers has prevented the rings moving freely and releasing under some cutaway scenarios.

50|$|DS3 {{interconnect}} cables {{must be made}} with true 75-ohm coaxial cable and connectors. Cables or connectors which are 50 ohms or which significantly deviate from 75 ohms will result in signal reflections which will lower {{the performance of the}} connection, possibly to the point of not working. GR-139-CORE, Generic Requirements for Central Office Coaxial Cable, defines type 734 and 735 cables for this application. Due to losses, there are differing distance limitations for each type of cable. Type 734 has a larger center conductor and insulator for lower losses for a given distance. The BNC connectors are also very important as are the crimping and <b>cable</b> <b>stripping</b> tools used to install them. Trompeter, Cannon, Amphenol, Kings, and Canare make some of the true 75 ohm connectors known to work. RG-6 or even inexpensive RG-59 cable may work temporarily when properly connectorized, though it does not meet telephony technical standards.

40|$|Abstract. Experimental work on {{electromagnetic}} streamflow {{measurements on}} the tidal Fraser River in British Columbia {{shows that the}} method of using the earth's magnetic field has two advantages: it gives an instantaneous value of the water velocity integrated over the entire {{cross section of the}} river and it is in-dependent of temperature. In the Canadian climate both factors are important. The instrumentation is relatively inexpensive and it consists of a digital to analog converter, <b>strip</b> chart recorder, <b>cable</b> and silver electrodes: The instrumentation is essential for noise filtering and signal amplification. However, the fin-al interpretation of the measured signal is quite difficult; it requires measurements from an electronic analog of the river cross section, resistivity of the ground below, conductivity of the water and a numer-. ical hydrodynamic model. The flow velocities obtained from the measurements of induced potentials, caused by the Fraser River flowing across the earth's magnetic field, compared favourably with velocities computed from a proven hydrodynamic numerical model.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{component of}} underground mining costs stems from ground {{support in the}} form of rock bolts, mesh and screen, cable bolts, and shotcrete. Should any of this support approach or reach failure (<b>stripped</b> or broken <b>cable</b> bolts, severe bagging of screen, large numbers of broken rock bolts, etc.) then the support needs to be rehabilitated. This rehabilitation is often much more expensive than the initial support installation, due not just to the cost of the support, but to loss of access, down-time of that area of the mine, potential for injuries, and possible lost mining revenues. Many mines use instrumentation in critical infrastructure, such as haulage drifts, crusher stations, intersections, etc., to monitor the displacement of the backs and/or walls, support loads, etc. Data is generally collected by hand from time-to-time and entered into a database, but is analysed only if there is a problem (i. e. reactive engineering). Most mines today also utilize numerical modeling. These models, normally linear-elastic, are often not up to date and modeling is often done only in reaction to a problem. In certain cases modeling of the underground mining environment requires software packages that employ non-linear constitutive models (i. e. models that allow for failure to occur). Linear elastic models unrealistically allow for stresses to build up far beyond those at failure and hence do not redistribute stresses away from failed zones. The challenge with non-linear models is that they require the input o...|$|R

Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.In 1995 the Government of the state of Victoria published a report on problems caused by long-billed corellas, sulphur-crested cockatoos and galahs, three species which, along with the little corella, have large and growing populations, having benefited from anthropogenic changes to the landscape. Subsequent to the findings and publication of the report, these three species were declared unprotected by a Governor in Council Order under certain conditions and are allowed to be destroyed where serious damage is being caused by them to trees, vineyards, orchards, recreational reserves and commercial crops. [...] Damage covered by the report included not only that to cereal crops, fruit and nut orchards and some kinds of vegetable crops but also to houses and communications equipment.

In South Australia, where flocks can number several thousand birds and the species is listed as unprotected, they are accused of defoliating red gums and other native or ornamental trees used for roosting, damaging tarpaulins on grain bunkers, wiring and flashing on buildings, taking grain from newly seeded paddocks and creating a noise nuisance.|$|R
40|$|Question In this work, heating of {{intracranial}} strip electrodes {{inside a}} MRI scanner was evaluated. Different {{factors that influence}} heating were examined. Methods Measurements were performed in a gel filled phantom. The gel simulated human tissue regarding electrical and thermal properties. All temperature measurements were performed on an Ad-Tech® <b>Strip</b> Electrode. Different <b>cables</b> and components were connected in different setups and were then positioned systematically in different distances to the MRI scanner wall to examine heating of the electrodes. For this, a Spin Echo sequence and an Echo Planar Imaging sequence were performed. Results Strongest heating of the strip electrode was measured at the most distal of the single electrodes. In the Spin Echo sequence, heating generally above recommended safety limits were measured. Single exception was the strip electrode positioned in the isocentre without any other components. In the Echo Planar Imaging sequence heating remained mostly within safety limits of less than 1 °C. It could be shown that the electrode tends to heat up more by being positioned closer to the scanner wall. There could not be shown any laws regarding the influence of any added components on heating. Conclusion Simultaneous use of intracranial EEG and MRI can lead to significant heating of intracranial EEG electrodes. Different factors can {{be influenced by the}} operator to minimize heating levels.

40|$|Actually, the Coriolis {{acceleration}} component {{experienced by}} axi-Downmagnetic tapes, paper sheets, textile fibers, band saws, aerial cable tramways, and crane hoist cables. Despite many advantages of these devices, noise and vibrations, particularly transverse vibra-tions, {{associated with the}} devices have limited their applications. For example, in magnetic tape drives, the vibration of a tape leads to signal modulation and accelerates the wear of the tape; in band saws, the vibration of a blade results in poor cutting quality. Therefore, understanding transverse vibrations of axially moving strings {{is important for the}} design of the devices. Furthermore, for high precision applications, it is desirable to introduce suitable control mechanisms to reduce vibrations of axially moving strings in order to improve performance of the devices. A string is a one-dimensional continuum that offers no resis-tance to bending. Since the gravitational force is sufficiently small compared with the tension force, the equilibrium configuration is a straight line. Many slender engineering elements such as belts, <b>cables,</b> <b>strips,</b> chains, tapes, ropes, and thread lines can be mod-eled as strings because their bending stiffness is relatively small. If slender engineering elements have rather large bending stiff-ness, they will be treated as moving beams. Slender engineering elements with curved equilibrium configurations will be treated as moving cables ~loose strings!. As for engineering elements that have considerable width, two-dimensional continuum models such as membranes, plates or shells should be used. The investigations on transverse vibrations and control of axi-ally moving strings have theoretical significance, because an axi-ally moving string is a simplest representative of distributed gy-roscopic systems. Axially moving strings, beams, cables, membranes, and plates all fall into the class of axially moving ally moving materials imparts a skew-symmetric or gyroscopic term to their governing equations. Due to particular characteristics of the gyroscopic term, the approaches developed in analysis and control of transverse vibrations of an axially moving string can be applied to other more complicated distributed gyroscopic systems.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{submarine}} power cables is {{the transport of}} electric current at high voltage. The electric core is a concentric assembly of inner conductor, electric insulation and protective layers. The conductor is made from copper or aluminum wires, the latter material having a small but increasing market share. Conductor sizes ≤ 1200 are most common, but sizes ≥ 2400 mm2 have been made occasionally. For voltages ≥ 12 kV the conductors are round. Three different types of electric insulation around the conductor are mainly used today.Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) is used up to 420 kV system voltage. It is produced by extrusion in insulation thickness of up to about 30 mm. 36 kV class cables have only 5.5 - 8 mm insulation thickness. Certain formulations of XLPE insulation {{can also be used}} for DC.Low-pressure oil-filled cables have an insulation lapped from paper <b>strips.</b> The entire <b>cable</b> core is impregnated with a low-viscosity insulation fluid (mineral oil or synthetic). A central oil channel in the conductor facilitates oil flow when the cable gets warm. Rarely used in submarine cables due to oil pollution risk at cable damage. Is used up to 525 kV.Mass-impregnated cables have also a paper-lapped insulation but the impregnation compound is highly viscous and does not exit when the cable is damaged. MI insulation can be used for massive HVDC cables up to 525 kV. Cables ≥ 52 kV are equipped with an extruded lead sheath to prevent water intrusion. No other materials have been accepted so far. The lead alloy is extruded onto the insulation in long lengths (over 50 km is possible). In this stage the product is called cable core. In single-core cables the core is surrounded by a concentric armoring. In three-core cables, three cable cores are laid-up in a spiral configuration before the armoring is applied.The armouring consists most often of steel wires, soaked in bitumen for corrosion protection. Since the alternating magnetic field in ac cables causes losses in the armoring those cables are sometimes equipped with non-magnetic metallic materials (stainless steel, copper, brass). Modern three-core cables, e.g. for the interconnection of offshore wind turbines) carry often optical fibers for data transmission or temperature measurement.|$|R
40|$|Precise {{manipulation}} of micro objects became {{great interest in}} engineering and science with the advancements in microengineering and microfabrication. In this thesis, a magnetically levitated microgripper is presented for microhandling tasks. The use of magnetic levitation for positioning reveals {{the problems associated with}} modeling of complex surface forces and the use of jointed parts or wires. The power required for the levitation of the microgripper is generated by an external drive unit that makes further minimization of the gripper possible. The gripper is made of a biocompatible material and can be activated remotely. These key features make the microgripper a great candidate for {{manipulation of}} micro components and biomanipulation. In order to achieve magnetic levitation of microrobots, the magnetic field generated by the magnetic levitation setup is simulated. The magnetic flux density in the air gap region is improved by the integration of permanent magnets and an additional electromagnet to the magnetic loop assembly. The levitation performance is evaluated with millimeter size permanent magnets. An eddy current damping method is implemented and the levitation accuracy is doubled by reducing the positioning error to 20. 3 µm. For a MEMS-compatible microrobot design, the electrodeposition of Co-Ni-Mn-P magnetic thin films is demonstrated. Magnetic films are deposited on silicon substrate to form the magnetic portion of the microrobot. The electrodeposited films are extensively characterized. The relationship between the deposition parameters and structural properties is discussed leading {{to an understanding of the}} effect of deposition parameters on the magnetic properties. It is shown that both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetized films can be obtained using electrodeposition with slightly differentiated deposition parameters. The levitation of the electrodeposited magnetic samples shows a great promise toward the fabrication of levitating MEMS devices. The end-effector tool of the levitating microrobot is selected as a microgripper that can achieve various manipulation operations such as pulling, pushing, tapping, grasping and repositioning. The microgripper is designed based on a bent-beam actuation technique. The motion of the gripper fingers is achieved by thermal expansion through laser heat absorption. This technique provided non-contact actuation for the levitating microgripper. The analytical model of the displacement of the bent-beam actuator is developed. Different designs of microgripper are fabricated and thoroughly characterized experimentally and numerically. The two microgripper designs that lead to the maximum gripper deflection are adapted for the levitating microrobot. The experimental results show that the levitating microrobot can be positioned in a volume of 3 x 3 x 2 cm^ 3. The positioning error is measured as 34. 3 µm and 13. 2 µm when electrodeposited magnets and commercial permanent magnets are used, respectively. The gripper fingers are successfully operated on-the-fly by aligning a visible wavelength laser beam on the gripper. Micromanipulation of 100 µm diameter electrical wire, 125 µm diameter optical fiber and 1 mm diameter <b>cable</b> <b>strip</b> is demonstrated. The microgripper is also positioned in a closed chamber without sacrificing the positioning accuracy...|$|R
