40|$|ABSTRACT: Self-sufficiency rate {{of food in}} South Korea {{is almost}} at the lowest level among OECD countries, and the {{decrease}} tend of farmland {{is expected to be}} continued. In this situation, the government has been revised the target self-sufficiency rate of food, and carried forward various policies in order to achieve it. One of those policies is the restoration business of idle farmland which is planned to carry forward after 2015. This study set up indicators evaluating effective use of idle farmland, and tried to apply in the field before carrying forward restoration business. The result of this study may be summarized as follows. First of all, it reset an evaluation indicator that was based on the evaluation indicator developed in order to set application directions of idle farmland. Next, it selected 30 idle farmlands with reset evaluation indicator among 11, 635 which were inspected nationwide in 2012. Before applying indicator, it measured the condition of recycling such as accessibility of farmland, condition of irrigation and drainage system, land state, and surroundings by field investigation. Then, it calculated composite score in each target area through applying indicators, and verified the indicator by comparing calculated result with the one which was decided from field investigation. Finally, it carried out field investigation, correct and upgrade some problems of the standard of score calculation that was found during applying previously set evaluation indicator to target area, and established the final <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> fo...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{approach}} to investigate the transformations curve of gearing safety. Two types of failure can occur on a gear namely the bending stress and the surface pitting failure. There are many standards for gearing in used worldwide such as AGMA, JGMA, ISO, DIN, etc. but {{the focus of this}} study will be on AGMA standard. The main data for this study is the torque value applied which can be distinguished into causing bending strength or surface pitting failure. The Autodesk Inventor spur gear component accelerator was used as a tool for data acquisition based on the AGMA <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculations.</b> Two gear materials with high value of allowable contact stress compared to its allowable bending stress was chosen for the study as they are predicted to have a transformation curve from surface durability to bending strength when its torque values are plotted against number of teeth.
