40|$|Objective: This paper’s {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} mission <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> the sponsoring <b>boards</b> and professional organizations of the primary care specialties. Methods: Mission statements were obtained from the Web sites <b>of</b> the specialty <b>boards</b> and academies {{for each of the four}} primary care specialties of pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology, general internal medicine, and family medicine. The mission statements were analyzed by two investigators, and the components <b>of</b> each mission <b>statement</b> were identified and categorized. Results: There were 29 distinct characteristics defined among all the mission <b>statements.</b> Three <b>of</b> the four primary care specialty organizations listed 10 components, while the American Academy of Pediatrics contained the fewest, with three components. The most commonly named characteristics were commitment to public health and education along with assuring high-quality standards. There was little overlap among the mission statements.

40|$|Purpose – The {{obfuscation}} hypothesis {{suggests that}} under-performing firms {{will tend to}} obscure the meaning of their corporate narratives by deliberately adopting a textual complexity, most readily apparent through poor readability {{and the use of}} unnecessarily difficult language. This paper seeks to add to the literature in the area by comparing the textual complexity of corporate narratives, notably the chairman 2 ̆ 7 s <b>statement,</b> <b>of</b> main <b>board</b> and second board companies on the Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange), with their financial performance, and also to examine the impact <b>of</b> company size, <b>board</b> membership and degree of statutory regulation on the readability of corporate narratives. Design/methodology/approach – Following the existing literature this paper uses readability as a proxy for textual complexity, in addition to more direct measures, and seeks to examine relationships between textual complexity and various measures of financial performance. Findings – The findings suggest that there are significant relationships between corporate language and financial performance, but that these are not consistent with the obfuscation hypothesis. Originality/value – The findings are consistent with the suggestion that increased regulation and statutory monitoring of disclosures are associated with improved readability of narrative. They do not provide support for the obfuscation hypothesis...|$|R

For policy statements to become effective instruments of leadership and empowerment, they must be written to reflect the overall vision <b>of</b> the school <b>board</b> and participants. A conclusion is that to fulfill their roles, school boards, particularly those in rural communities, need to tak [...] active leadership roles, one of which is policy formation. To achieve district goals, policy handbooks must be reviewed, reformulated, and rewritten so that they embody the goals and ideals shared by the board and its constituents and are written in terms of "superobjectives" [...] that is, objectives that go beyond the surface concerns which dominate the average policy handbook or guici and give coherence and meaning to the leader's performance.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityProblem: 	The {{problem of}} this {{dissertation}} is to appraise {{the use of}} certain Bible study units {{as a means for}} guiding children's conceptual thinking about Christian concepts of God, man, and their relationship, in light of present understandings concerning conceptual thinking of children. Procedure: 	The dissertation begins with a consideration of the rationale {{for the use of the}} Bible in Methodist Church School Curriculum as set forth in <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education and its editorial division. The body of the study consists of two approaches to the problem: a study is made of conceptual thinking with special reference to children's thinking and their concept capacities; then, an analysis of the biblical studies units of the Closely Graded Courses is made in terms of the concepts of God, man, and their relationship. The concept of God is analyzed for concepts of God as Creator, Provider, Revealer, Redeemer, and Sanctifier. The concept of man is analyzed in terms of the spiritual nature of man's conscious selfhood, his role as questor, and as responder to God. The concept of the relationship between God and man is analyzed in terms of the God-pupil relationships of love, trust, discipline, and the relationship in the community of the church. Next, the conceptual expectations indicated by the data of the analysis are examined in the light of the study of conceptual thinking. Then, in order that the appraisal might include how well pupils who study the Closely Graded Courses are able to indicate their understanding of content taught that would appear to be difficult to learn, a field research project is undertaken at the local church level.
