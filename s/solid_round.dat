25|$|The AWG {{tables are}} for a single, <b>solid,</b> <b>round</b> conductor. The AWG of a {{stranded}} wire {{is determined by the}} cross-sectional area of the equivalent solid conductor. Because there are also small gaps between the strands, a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} ASTM B258 - 02(2008) Standard Specification for Standard Nominal Diameters and Cross-Sectional Areas of AWG Sizes of <b>Solid</b> <b>Round</b> Wires Used as Electrical Conductors {{defines the}} ratio between successive sizes {{to be the}} 39th root of 92, or approximately 1.1229322. ASTM B 258-02 also dictates that wire diameters should be tabulated {{with no more than}} 4 significant figures, with a resolution of no more than 0.0001inches (0.1mils) for wires larger than No. 44AWG, and 0.00001inches (0.01mils) for wires No. 45AWG and smaller.|$|E

500|$|Cannon {{also saw}} {{use in the}} Tudor navy (where a cannon was a [...] "gun", and a {{cannonball}} a [...] "shot"). The French [...] "culverin" [...] was adapted for naval use by the English in the late 16th century, and had a significant advantage over the ballista {{that had previously been}} used in naval warfare. This cannon was of relatively long barrel and light construction, and fired <b>solid</b> <b>round</b> shot projectiles at long ranges along a flat trajectory. One of the first ships to be able to fire a full cannon broadside was the English carrack the Mary Rose, built in Portsmouth from 15101512, and equipped with 78 guns (91 after an upgrade in the 1530s). It was one of the earliest purpose-built warships to serve in the English Navy (thought never to have served as a merchant ship), and her crew consisted of 200 sailors, 185 soldiers, and 30 gunners.|$|E

60|$|The more Saxon saw of Mercedes Higgins {{the less}} did she {{understand}} her. That {{the old woman}} was a close-fisted miser, Saxon soon learned. And this trait she found hard to reconcile with her tales of squandering. On the other hand, Saxon was bewildered by Mercedes' extravagance in personal matters. Her underlinen, hand-made of course, was very costly. The table she set for Barry was good, but the table for herself was vastly better. Yet both tables were set on the same table. While Barry contented himself with <b>solid</b> <b>round</b> steak, Mercedes ate tenderloin. A huge, tough muttonchop on Barry's plate would be balanced by tiny French chops on Mercedes' plate. Tea was brewed in separate pots. So was coffee. While Barry gulped twenty-five cent tea from a large and heavy mug, Mercedes sipped three-dollar tea from a tiny cup of Belleek, rose-tinted, fragile as all egg-shell. In the same manner, his twenty-five cent coffee was diluted with milk, her eighty cent Turkish with cream.|$|E
60|$|Secondly, Sharpness of Edge: The {{edges of}} {{the bars of the}} upper clouds which are turned to the wind, are often the sharpest which the sky shows; no outline {{whatever}} of any other kind of cloud, however marked and energetic, ever approaches the delicate decision of these edges. The outline of a black thunder-cloud is striking, from the great energy of the color or shade of the general mass; but as a line, it is soft and indistinct, compared with the edge of the cirrus, in a clear sky with a brisk breeze. On the other hand, the edge of the bar turned away from the wind is always soft, often imperceptible, melting into the blue interstice between it and its next neighbor. Commonly the sharper one edge is, the softer is the other, and the clouds look flat, and as if they slipped over each other like the scales of a fish. When both edges are soft, as is always the case when the sky is clear and windless, the cloud looks <b>solid,</b> <b>round,</b> and fleecy.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the ROQF 75 mm, British tanks had been equipped with guns such as the QF 2 pounder (40-mm), and then the larger 57mm 6 pounder. These guns were designed to fire armour-piercing shot, small high-velocity <b>solid</b> <b>rounds</b> that were effective against tanks, but did little damage to groups of infantry or soft targets like trucks. Some tanks operating in the infantry support role were given howitzers firing HE shells, such as early models of the Churchill and CS (Close Support) versions of the Matilda II. The decision to equip British tanks with a gun capable of firing HE shells at soft targets was taken by the War Office.|$|R

The Tornado Crusher Punch is SKL's version of the Turbo Smasher Punch, with the difference being that Ken Kaido is able to guide them to their target after they are deployed. The Breast Triggers fire laser beams as opposed to <b>solid</b> <b>rounds.</b> The Rust Stream is SKL's version of the Rust Tornado from Mazinkaiser. The Thor Hammer Breaker allows SKL to shoot a huge bolt of lightning towards its target from the Ganzantou, similar to Great Mazinger's Thunder Break. Finally, the Inferno Blaster is SKL's most powerful attack, acting similar to the Fire Blaster from Mazinkaiser.|$|R
