500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on {{was very important to}} us last season was, there were <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E
500|$|So William of Champlitte and Geoffry of Villehardouin [...] {{departed}} from the host, and took with them about a hundred knights, and {{a great number of}} mounted sergeants, and entered into the land of Morea, and rode onwards till they came to the city of Modon. Michael heard that they were in the land with <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>people,</b> and he collected together a great number of people, a number that was marvellous, and he rode after them as one thinking they were all no better than prisoners, and in his hand. And when they heard tell that he was coming, they refortified Modon, where the defences had long since been pulled down, and there left their baggage, and the lesser folk. Then they rode out a day's march, and ordered their array with as many people as they had. But the odds seemed too great, for they had no more than five hundred men mounted, whereas on the other part there were well over five thousand. But events happen as God pleases; for our people fought with the Greeks and discomfited and conquered them. And the Greeks lost very heavily, while those on our side gained horses and arms enough, and other goods in very great plenty, and so returned very happy, and very joyously, to the city of Modon.|$|E

500|$|Fox was {{met with}} gale-force winds, heavy rain and a {{snowstorm}} {{in the first days}} of his run. He was initially disappointed with the reception he received, but was heartened upon arriving in Port aux Basques, Newfoundland, where the town's 10,000 residents presented him with a donation of over $10,000. Throughout the trip, Fox frequently expressed his anger and frustration to those he saw as impeding the run, and he fought regularly with Alward. By the time they reached Nova Scotia, they were barely on speaking terms, and it was arranged for Fox's brother Darrell, then 17, to join them as a buffer. Fox left the Maritimes on June 10 and faced new challenges entering Quebec due to his group's inability to speak French and drivers who continually forced him off the road. Fox arrived in Montreal on June 22, one-third of the way through his [...] journey, having collected over $200,000 in donations. Around this time, Terry Fox's run caught the attention of Isadore Sharp who was the founder and CEO of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts– and who had lost a son to melanoma in 1978 just a year after Terry's diagnosis. Sharp was intrigued by the story of a one-legged kid [...] "trying to do the impossible" [...] and run across the country; so he offered food and accommodation at his hotels en route. When Terry was discouraged because <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> were making donations, Sharp pledged $2 a mile [...] and persuaded close to 1,000 other corporations to do the same. Sharp's encouragement persuaded Terry to continue with the Marathon of Hope. Convinced by the Canadian Cancer Society that arriving in Ottawa for Canada Day would aid fundraising efforts, he remained in Montreal for a few extra days.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} {{team for}} Mega Man consisted of only six people. Inafune (credited as [...] "Inafuking") designed and illustrated {{nearly all of}} the game's characters and enemies, as well as the Japanese Rockman logo, box art, and instruction manual. He was also responsible for rendering these designs into graphical sprite form. [...] "We didn’t have [...] people, so after drawing character designs, I was actually doing the dotting (pixelation) for the Nintendo," [...] Inafune stated. [...] "Back then, people weren’t specialized and we had {{to do a lot of}} different things because there was <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>people,</b> so I really ended up doing all the characters." [...] Inafune was influenced by the eponymous protagonist of Osamu Tezuka's manga Astro Boy in his Mega Man designs. Mega Man is colored blue due to the NES console's technical limitations: the color has the most shades in the console's limited 56-color palette, and the expanded selection was used to enhance Mega Man's detail. Although he is often credited for designing the character, Inafune insists that he [...] "only did half of the job in creating him", as his mentor developed the basic character concept before Inafune's arrival. The basic sprites for Roll and Dr. Light were created before Inafune joined the project, and the designs for Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Guts Man were in process. Aside from normal enemies, Inafune's first character was Elec Man, inspired by American comic book characters. The artist has commented that Elec Man has always been his favorite design. The designs for Dr. Light and Dr. Wily were based on Santa Claus and Albert Einstein, respectively; the latter character was meant to represent an archetypal [...] "mad scientist".|$|E

50|$|Battle Mountain is {{accessible}} {{by a combination}} of road and trail. It is a popular summer tourist attraction and is especially noted for colourful alpine meadows. The access trail is longer and more strenuous than the one to nearby Trophy Mountain to the south, <b>so</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>people</b> visit Battle Mountain and the Caribou Meadows. The hike to the meadows can be accomplished as a day outing, but hikers who want to attain Fiftytwo Ridge and Battle Mountain summit should plan for two days and carry overnight equipment.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, the {{population}} reached {{a record high}} - over 103,000 people called Hilversum home. The current population hovers around 85,000. Several factors figure into the decline: one {{is the fact that}} the average family nowadays consists of <b>fewer</b> <b>people,</b> <b>so</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>people</b> live in each house; second, the town is virtually unable to expand because all the surrounding lands were sold by city architect W.M. Dudok to the Goois Natuurreservaat (nl). The third reason for this decline of {{the population}} was because the property values were increasing rapidly in that moment of time, and many people were forced to move to less expensive areas in the Netherlands.|$|R
2500|$|Holocaust {{historian}} Kenneth Waltzer {{said that}} it was disturbing that <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> had noticed and inquired about the obvious holes in his history over a decade of time. Waltzer and others have said that Rosenblat didn't need to embellish his story, which was already powerful enough by itself. Waltzer places part of the blame in all those [...] "culture makers" [...] that profited from the diffusion of the story and never doubted even the most implausible parts of it. It appears that the veracity of story was not questioned either by the book publisher or by Oprah Winfrey, and that no fact-checking was done to ensure the authenticity of the memoir prior to endorsing it soundly.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{reasons were}} the high losses by disease,]] Pina, , 3rd book, 1902, chapter CLXXX. {{especially}} fevers {{from the hot}} and also because the Luso-Castilian army included many Castilian contingents who easily and massively changed sides after the aborted expedition to Burgos and its consequent fall on 28 January 1476.

2500|$|Others {{have also}} {{suggested}} that press coverage contributed to a public confused and misinformed on both the nature and level of {{the threat to the}} U.S. posed by terrorism. In his book, Trapped in the War on Terror political scientist Ian S. Lustick, claimed, [...] "The media have given constant attention to possible terrorist-initiated catastrophes and to the failures and weaknesses of the government's response." [...] Lustick alleged that the War on Terror is disconnected from the real but remote threat terrorism poses and that the generalized War on Terror began as part of the justification for invading Iraq, but then took {{on a life of its}} own, fueled by media coverage. Scott Atran writes that [...] "publicity is the oxygen of terrorism" [...] and the rapid growth of international communicative networks renders publicity even more potent, with the result that [...] "perhaps never in the history of human conflict have <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> with so few actual means and capabilities frightened so many." ...|$|E

50|$|For the 1964 tax year, the top {{marginal}} {{tax rate}} for individuals was lowered to 77%, {{and then to}} 70% for tax years 1965 through 1981. In 1978 income brackets were adjusted for inflation, <b>so</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>people</b> were taxed at high rates. The top marginal tax rate was lowered to 50% for tax years 1982 through 1986. Reagan undid 40% of his 1981 tax cut, in 1983 he hiked gas and payroll taxes, and in 1984 he raised tax revenue by closing loopholes for businesses.
