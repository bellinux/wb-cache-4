5|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The giant otter shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the New World Lontra genus of otters: the neotropical river otter, the <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> and the marine otter. (The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The giant otter seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra provocax) is {{a species}} of otter that lives in Chile and Argentina. Although called a [...] "river otter", it inhabits both marine and {{freshwater}} environments. It sometimes is considered a subspecies of Lontra canadensis. The <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is listed as endangered, due to illegal hunting, water pollution, and habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|One {{survey in}} {{particular}} was performed to determine if any of this species live within these protected areas. The author surveyed three parks in Argentina: Lanin, Puelo, and Los Alerces National Parks. The surveyors spoke with people {{who live and work}} near these areas, and looked for prints and droppings of the <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> while also looking for signs of the American mink. The mink was introduced into this area and is thought to compete with the <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> for food resources and habitat space. The results showed signs of the <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> were found in 32 of the 275 surveyed sites within the three parks. Of the 32 confirmed sites, 31 were of dense forest with thick undergrowth near the shorelines of freshwater systems. These results suggest having shoreline vegetation for cover is vital for their survival.|$|E
40|$|Direct {{observation}} of <b>Southern</b> <b>River</b> <b>Otters</b> is difficult {{as they are}} largely nocturnal. Telemetry and radioactive isotopes were considered inappropriate {{for a study of}} this species in southern Chile. Instead, coloured sand which stains the paws and leaves coloured tracks was used, and some of the results of this are presented here. The method is simple and cheap...|$|R
50|$|Future {{directions}} for conserving this species include obtaining better {{information on the}} <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter’s</b> population numbers and locations. If conservationists know where the individuals and families live, enforcement of antipoaching laws, as well as focusing on maintaining and protecting their habitats, will be easier. Captive breeding programs would also be beneficial for this species, to later reintroduce individuals into the areas where they were previously found in.|$|R
50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> were vigorously {{hunted for}} their pelts {{throughout}} the last 100 years. This {{is the major}} cause of their current low population numbers and endangered conservation status. Since then, {{they have not been}} able to recover due to a number of other threats. At this point, only seven known populations of this species are found throughout Chile and Argentina, and all of the populations are isolated from each other.|$|R
50|$|Sea birds {{reported}} include petrels and albatrosses. Other notable fauna reported {{are several}} species of penguins, the South Andean deer or Huemul Hippocamelus bisulcus, and the <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> Lutra provocax.|$|E
50|$|Several {{surveys and}} {{studies have been}} {{performed}} on the <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> to better understand its declining population numbers {{to be able to}} prevent the species from becoming extinct. Several of the known populations are found within national forests.|$|E
50|$|The continual {{decrease}} in prey numbers also causes {{problems for the}} <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter.</b> Some invasive aquatic species that have been introduced into that area are limiting the mollusks and fish available for otter prey. This causes the otters to move to other freshwater systems to hunt for food.|$|E
5|$|The North American <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777.

50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> can {{be found}} in marine, freshwater, and {{terrestrial}} habitats, but are mostly found in freshwater lakes and rivers having a significant amount of dense vegetation, especially along the shorelines, which must be present to use as cover. Their habitats also need the root systems of mature trees, as well as fallen tree debris.|$|E
50|$|The Magellanic subpolar {{forests are}} home to the {{southern}} pudú, the world's smallest deer, which stands only 35-45 cm (14-18 inches) high at the shoulder. Other animal species include the cougar (Puma concolor) and the endangered <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra provocax). Endemic rodents include the Patagonian rat, the mole mouse, and the viscacha, a small rodent that looks almost like a rabbit with a long, bushy tail.|$|E
50|$|The fauna of the Andean Patagonian forest {{region is}} very varied with many endemic species. Predatory mammals include the cougar (Felis concolor), the culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus), the <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra provocax) and the Geoffroy's cat (Leopardus geoffroyi). Other mammals include Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus humboldtii), the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the south Andean deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and {{numerous}} species of rodents.|$|E
40|$|<b>River</b> <b>otters</b> (Lutra canadensis) {{are best}} known for their {{continuous}} and playful behavior, their aesthetic value, {{and the value of}} their durable, high-quality fur. <b>River</b> <b>otters</b> occur throughout North America except the arctic slopes, the arid portions of the Southwest, and the intensive agricultural and industrialized areas of the midwestern United States. The diet of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> throughout its range is primarily fish. The reproductive biology of <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> and all other weasels is complex because of a characteristic known as delayed implantation. The presence of <b>river</b> <b>otter(s)</b> around or in a fish hatchery, aquaculture, or fish culture facility is a good indication that a damage problem is imminent.

40|$|Populations of North American <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> (Lontra canadensis) {{declined}} throughout {{large portions}} of the continent during the early 1900 s due to habitat degradation and unregulated trapping. <b>River</b> <b>otters</b> had been extirpated in North Dakota (ND), but the Red River Valley has since been recolonized, with potential source populations including the neighboring states of Minnesota or South Dakota, or the Canadian province of Manitoba (MB). We genotyped 9 microsatellite loci in 121 samples to determine the source population of <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> in the Red River Valley of ND, {{as well as to}} assess population structure and diversity of <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> in central North America. Overall, genetic diversity was high, with an average observed heterozygosity of 0. 58. Genetic differentiation was low (FST < 0. 05) between <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> in ND and those of Minnesota, suggesting that eastern ND was recolonized by <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> from Minnesota. <b>River</b> <b>otters</b> from MB were genetically distinct from all other sampled populations. Low genetic differentiation (FST = 0. 044) between South Dakota and Louisiana (LA) suggested that reintroductions using LA stock were successful. The genetic distinctiveness of <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> from different geographic regions should be considered when deciding on source populations for future translocations...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to understand <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra canadensis) movement and activity patterns for successful management and reintroduction plans. As part of a <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> study conducted in the Killbuck Watershed, the largest wetland complex in Ohio, USA outside of the Lake Erie marshes, 11 <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> were radio-tagged and monitored for movements and activity patterns. Twenty-seven 24 -hour monitoring surveys were conducted during summer months (June-July) of 2002 and 2003. The mean movement distance of female <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> (MEAN = 1. 8 km, SE = 0. 23) was less (P = 0. 0012) than the mean movement distance of male <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> (MEAN = 5. 2 km, SE = 0. 73). <b>River</b> <b>otters</b> were more active than inactive from 2201 - 0400 hrs (71 % active), followed by 0401 - 1000 hrs (68 % active), and 1601 - 2200 hrs (45 % active); they were more inactive than active from 1001 - 1600 hrs (14 % active). These results show that <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> can move long distances and it {{is important}} to manage not only wetland systems but riparian corridors that aid in dispersal of <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> to other wetland complexes and watersheds...|$|R
50|$|Three {{native species}} of {{carnivores}} of the Mustelidae group inhabit the Park.

50|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to South American river otters, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The South American continent houses the Lontra genus of otters: the giant otter, the neotropical river otter, the <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> and the marine otter. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted.|$|E
50|$|The {{riparian}} {{forests and}} rivers {{in which these}} otters are mostly found have been disturbed by human presence. Dam and road construction, as well as stream canalization and drainage for agriculture destroy many acres {{of what could be}} habitat for this species.

50|$|Research done in {{the early}} 1990s by the Department of Biology of Kochi University in Japan {{revealed}} some interesting facts about the genes of the Japanese <b>River</b> <b>Otter.</b> For many years, {{it was thought that}} the Japanese <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> was a subspecies of the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra. However, the studies done in Kochi University revealed something different. By comparing the Mitochondrial Cytochrome b Gene of a mummified Japanese <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> corpse with Eurasian otters from Latvia and China, it was proven that the Japanese <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> was actually different, and was therefore not a subspecies.

50|$|The {{neotropical otter}} or neotropical river otter (Lontra longicaudis) is an otter species found in Central America, South America {{and the island}} of Trinidad. It is {{physically}} similar to the northern and <b>southern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> which occur directly {{north and south of}} this species' range. The length of the neotropical otter can range from 90 - 150 cm, of which the tail comprises about a third. Body weight ranges from 5 - 15 kg.

5|$|The <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. <b>River</b> <b>otters</b> characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. <b>River</b> <b>otters</b> have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|R
40|$|Reintroduced <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> (Lontra canadensis) are an {{important}} component of Ohio’s biological diversity, and are a key indicator of wetland and watershed health and quality.

5|$|Fish are {{the primary}} {{component}} of the <b>river</b> <b>otter's</b> diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> scats collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted in a central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the <b>river</b> <b>otter's</b> diet at certain times of the year. However, <b>river</b> <b>otters,</b> as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.|$|R
500|$|Molecular {{biological}} {{techniques have}} been used to determine when the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> and the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) of South America diverged.

Fossils of a giant <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> dating back 3.5Mya have been found in the US Midwest, however fossils of the modern <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> did not appear in North America until about 1.9Mya. The earliest known fossil of Lontra canadensis, found in the US Midwest, is from the Irvingtonian stage (1,800,000 to 300,000 years ago). The oldest fossil record of an Old World <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> comes from the late Pliocene epoch (3.6 to 1.8Mya). The New World <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> originated from the Old World <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> after a migration across the Bering Land Bridge, which existed off and on between 1.8 million and 10,000 years ago. The otters migrated to North America and southwards again across the Panamanian Land Bridge, which formed 3 Mya.|$|R
