50|$|In {{the field}} of workmen’s compensation, Labour succeeded in getting what Labour saw as an {{unsatisfactory}} bill withdrawn, and a new Bill introduced “to include single persons and to give improved allowances.” The new Workmen’s Compensation (<b>Supplementary</b> <b>Allowances)</b> Act, which came into effect in August 1940), provided a <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowance</b> not exceeding 5s a week to all disabled workers, together with a <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> 4s a week each {{for the first and}} second child, and 3s for each other child younger than 15. For a man with 3 children, the improvement represented 16s a week. For agricultural workers, a bill increasing the maximum unemployment benefit for agricultural workers by 3s a week was amended by Ernest Bevin, with a more generous increase of 6s a week introduced.|$|R

5000|$|Ambrose {{was born}} in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, where his father owned a farm {{machinery}} business, and attended the local grammar school. This business entitled his father to a <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowance</b> for fuel, which was rationed during the Second World War. Ambrose learnt to drive by accompanying his father on his visits to farms, initially sitting on his father's lap to steer whilst his father operated the pedals, and learning map-reading skills (signposts having been removed from roads for fear of invasion).|$|R
5000|$|The Attlee Government {{increased}} {{pensions and}} other benefits, with pensions raised {{to become more}} of a living income than they had ever been. War pensions and allowances (for both World Wars) were increased by an Act of 1946 which gave the wounded man with an allowance for his wife and children if he married after he had been wounded, thereby removing a grievance of more than twenty years standing. Other improvements were made in war pensions during Attlee’s tenure as prime minister. A Constant Attendance Allowance was tripled, an Unemployability Allowance was tripled from 10s to 30s a week, and a special hardship <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> up to £1 a week was introduced. In addition, the 1951 Budget made further improvements in the <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowances</b> for many war pensioners. From 1945 onwards, three out of every four pension claims had been successful, whilst after the First World War only one pension claim in three was allowed. Under the Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1948, employees of a body representative of local authorities or of the officers of local authorities could be admitted “on suitable terms to the superannuation fund of a local authority.” In 1951, a comforts allowance was introduced that was automatically paid to war pensioners “receiving unemployability supplement and constant attendance allowance.” ...|$|R

50|$|The SSRB further {{recommended}} that {{the leader of the}} next largest non-executive party should get a salary of £32,422 over and above the MSP’s salary (recommendation 6). This was not accepted by all the main political parties, with some preferring instead to consider a <b>supplementary</b> <b>allowance</b> to assist all non-executive party leaders (with more than 15 MSPs) in undertaking their duties. The accepted proposal was that leaders of parties with no Scottish Minister or Junior Minister amongst its members should receive a sum additional to their salary (see below). It was also proposed that the leader of the main non-Executive party should receive an additional £32,000. This became the Party Leaders' Allowances Scheme.|$|R
