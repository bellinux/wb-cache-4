40|$|Cross-domain {{information}} exchange is {{an increasingly important}} capability for conducting efficient and secure operations, both within coalitions and within single nations. A data guard is a common cross-domain sharing solution that inspects the <b>security</b> <b>labels</b> of exported data objects and validates that they are such {{that they can be}} released according to policy. While we see that guard solutions can be implemented with high assurance, we find that obtaining an equivalent level of assurance in the correctness of the <b>security</b> <b>labels</b> easily becomes a hard problem in practical scenarios. Thus, a weakness of the guard-based solution is that there is often limited assurance in the correctness of the <b>security</b> <b>labels.</b> To mitigate this, guards make use of content checkers such as dirty word lists as a means of detecting mislabeled data. To improve the overall security of such cross-domain solutions, we investigate more advanced content checkers based on the use of machine learning. Instead of relying on manually specified dirty word lists, we can build data-driven methods that automatically infer the words associated with classified content. However, care must be taken when constructing and deploying these methods as naive implementations are vulnerable to manipulation attacks. In order to provide a better context for performing classification, we monitor the incoming information flow and use the audit trail to construct controlled environments. The usefulness of this deployment scheme is demonstrated using a real collection of classified and unclassified documents. © 2017 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

40|$|Key Assignment Schemes (KASs) {{have been}} {{extensively}} {{studied in the}} context of cryptographically-enforced access control, where derived keys are used to decrypt protected resources. In this paper, we explore the use of KASs in entity authentication protocols, where we use derived keys to encrypt challenges. This novel use of KASs permits the efficient authentication of an entity in accordance with an authentication policy by associating entities with security labels representing specific services. Cryptographic keys are associated with each <b>security</b> <b>label</b> and demonstrating knowledge of an appropriate key is used as the basis for authentication. Thus, by controlling the distribution of such keys, restrictions may be efficiently placed upon the circumstances under which an entity may be authenticated and the services to which they may gain access. In this work, we explore how both standardized protocols and novel constructions may be developed to authenticate entities as members of a group associated to a particular <b>security</b> <b>label,</b> whilst protecting the long-term secrets in the system.

40|$|Abstract. A key {{assignment}} {{scheme is}} a model for enforcing an information flow policy using cryptographic techniques. Such schemes have been widely studied in recent years. Each <b>security</b> <b>label</b> {{is associated with a}} symmetric encryption key: data objects are encrypted and authorised users are supplied with the appropriate key(s). However, updates to encryption keys pose a significant problem, as the new keys have to be issued to all authorised users. In this paper, we propose three generic approaches to key assignment schemes that remove the problem of key redistribution following key updates. We analyse the overheads incurred by these approaches and conclude that these overheads are negligible in practical applications...|$|E
