The main newspaper's publishers are Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Nikkei Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun. According to a survey conducted by the Japanese Newspaper Association in June 1999, 85.4 per cent of men and 75 per cent of women read a newspaper every day. Average daily reading times vary with 27.7 minutes on weekdays and 31.7 minutes on holidays and Sunday.|$|E

25|$|This began {{a year of}} {{financial}} difficulty for the publication as some in the Washington Socialist movement moved {{to distance themselves from}} the radical Seattle paper. Part of Titus' financial difficulty was beyond the factional division of the Socialist Party of Washington and instead was related to Titus' stubborn insistence on maintaining a nominal <b>subscription</b> <b>rate</b> of just 50 cents per year, an artificially low price which mandated mass circulation akin to that of his rival, Wayland's Appeal to Reason: Titus declared it essential for his paper to expand to the 25,000 subscriber mark in order to survive at the current <b>subscription</b> <b>rate.</b> While this circulation target was not reached, The Socialist nevertheless managed to weather its difficult economic position for another year.|$|E

Besides the when-issued trading, there exists IPO grading, analyst recommendation, group affiliation, and the <b>subscription</b> <b>rates</b> in the bookbuilding process. We examine the impact of these activities and find three sequential factors that explain the IPO underpricing. Higher grades for an IPO lead to higher when-issued premiums, which in turn leads to higher <b>subscription</b> <b>rates.</b> Then, higher <b>subscription</b> <b>rates</b> lead to higher IPO underpricing.

25|$|Since the Stelo was the {{currency}} of Esperantists, {{a good example of}} its utility was the publication of a monthly magazine and the payment of rents and salaries. The publisher of a monthly magazine receives subscription money, requires the services of a printer, and must pay for stationery and postage, etc. Under the influence of inflation costs will tend to increase but not {{all at the same time}} and not all in proportion to the inflation rate. Eventually the publisher must contemplate an increase to the annual <b>subscription</b> <b>rate.</b> The new annual rate usually has to be announced in September before the next calendar year.|$|E

500|$|In {{a report}} on {{municipal}} wireless networks by The Wall Street Journal, Minneapolis's was singled out as being [...] "a success story", with the publication explaining {{that the concept of}} having the city as the anchor tenant was a good one. The article cited the wireless network in Philadelphia that was being set up around the same time that Minneapolis's was, but was being run and built by EarthLink, the other finalist in the bidding process to select a network for Minneapolis. EarthLink had relinquished control of its partially complete network in 2008, in part due to a low <b>subscription</b> <b>rate</b> of only 5,000 customers in May of that year. [...] Minneapolis, meanwhile, had 10,000 subscribers, and the network was nearing completion. In reference to the variety of stalled or failed wireless projects across the country, PC World cited USI Wireless as [...] "the only firm that got the numbers and engineering to add up for them so far." [...] A 2009 article in Computerworld noted that [...] "Minneapolis {{is one of the few}} large cities that has deployed Wi-Fi successfully."

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature in}} medicine investigates the health consequences {{of early childhood}} television watching. However, this literature {{does not address the}} issue of reverse causation, i. e., does early childhood television watching cause specific health outcomes or do children more likely to have these health outcomes watch more television? This paper uses a natural experiment to investigate the health consequences of early childhood television watching and so is not subject to questions concerning reverse causation. Specifically, we use repeated cross-sectional data from 1972 through 1992 on county-level mental retardation rates, county-level autism rates, and county-level children’s cable-television <b>subscription</b> <b>rates</b> to investigate how early childhood television watching affects the prevalence of mental retardation and autism. We find a strong negative correlation between average county-level cable <b>subscription</b> <b>rates</b> when a birth cohort is below three and subsequent mental retardation diagnosis rates, but a strong positive correlation between the same cable <b>subscription</b> <b>rates</b> and subsequent autism diagnosis rates. Our results thus suggest that early childhood television watching has important positive and negative health consequences. ...|$|R
500|$|The {{appointment}} of fellows was first authorised {{in the second}} charter, issued on 22 April 1663, which allowed the president and council, in the two months following the signing, to appoint as fellows any individuals they saw fit. This saw the {{appointment of}} 94 fellows on 20 May and 4 on 22 June; these 98 are known as the [...] "Original Fellows". After the expiration of this two-month period any appointments were {{to be made by}} the president, council and existing fellows. Many early fellows were not scientists or particularly eminent intellectuals; {{it was clear that the}} early society could not rely on financial assistance from the king, and scientifically trained fellows were few and far between. It was therefore necessary to secure the favour of wealthy or important individuals for the society's survival. While the entrance fee of £4 and the <b>subscription</b> <b>rate</b> of one shilling a week should have produced £600 a year for the society, many fellows paid neither regularly nor on time. Two-thirds of the fellows in 1663 were non-scientists; this rose to 71.6% in 1800 before dropping to 47.4% in 1860 as the financial security of the society became more certain. In May 1846, a committee recommended limiting the annual intake of members to 15 and insisting on scientific eminence; this was implemented, with the result being that the society now consists exclusively of scientific fellows.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} members of the Daughters of Bilitis, Helen Sandoz, took over the editorship, returning to a more apolitical and lighthearted stance, sometimes writing her editorials as her cat. Barbara Grier took over as editor in 1968, having previously contributed to the magazine {{under a variety of}} pseudonyms that included Gene Damon, Lennox Strong, and Vern Niven. She made her most significant contribution as a book reviewer, and when she became the editor sought to turn it more professional.

2500|$|Sociological {{research}} into pornography and LDS individuals has included one BYU study that showed of 192 male BYU students ages 18–27, 100% {{of the sample}} considered viewing pornography [...] "unacceptable". However, 35% reported having used pornography in the past 12 months, with 9.2% of the entire sample reporting viewing pornography {{at least once in}} the last month. No data was collected on female students. A nationwide study of paid porn subscriptions showed that the predominantly LDS state of Utah had the highest <b>subscription</b> <b>rate</b> of any state. The state's LDS governor Gary Herbert officially declared pornography to be a public health crisis in Utah in 2016. In 2017 the church school BYU released a study using data gathered online from nearly 700 unmarried English-speaking adults on the effects of religiosity on perceptions of porn addictiveness and relationship anxiety. The results showed that seeing oneself as addicted to pornography generated far more anxiety- and shame-related negative outcomes individually and in romantic relationships than any negative effects of consuming sexually explicit material. Additionally, more religious individuals were more likely to consider themselves addicted to porn regardless of their comparative usage rate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{subsequent}} issue featured {{an article}} by Debs titled [...] "To The Socialist and its Readers," [...] in which the party's leading orator came down firmly {{in support of a}} rate hike. Debs decried the inconsistency of Socialists who [...] "talk continually about 'education' while they let their own press starve to death" [...] and noted that The Socialist, at a rate of 50 cents per year, [...] "cannot pay legitimate expenses". Debs added, [...] "I want to see a substantial paper, the best that can be produced, and a reasonable price paid for it, instead of a flimsy sheet on crutches that manages to limp from one issue to another like a walking epitaph." [...] Then, in August 1904, at the semi-annual meeting of the Washington Socialists who assisted Titus with the publication of The Socialist, a different solution to the financial problem was chosen. They decided to change the name and focus of the publication, thereby boosting circulation to a level which could sustain the 50 cent <b>subscription</b> <b>rate.</b> Effective September 1, 1904, it was announced that the name of The Socialist would change to Next, and its orientation would change from a party paper [...] "published for Socialists first" [...] to a propaganda paper [...] "published primarily for non-Socialists".
