30|$|Our {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} Bradyrhizobium cells applied on soybean <b>seeds</b> during <b>inoculation,</b> die {{according to a}} mathematical function, and this phenomenon plus the selection of specific culture conditions could be useful to establish a trustworthy counting method for bradyrhizobia from seeds, and to design a new protocol for inoculant quality control. The aims of this work were: (1) to improve a selective media for the enumeration of B. japonicum obtained from inoculated soybean seeds; (2) to establish the most representative mathematical function for B. japonicum mortality on soybean seeds after inoculation; (3) to evaluate if some environmental or physiological conditions may modify B. japonicum mortality or survival capacity on soybean seeds; and (4) to propose a reliable method for quality control evaluation of soybean inoculants.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with barley in greenhouse conditions in order to investigate <b>seed</b> <b>inoculation</b> with 5 different N 2 -fixing (Bacillus licheniformis RC 02, Rhodobacter capsulatus RC 04, Paenibacillus polymyxa RC 05, Pseudomonas putida RC 06, and Bacillus OSU- 142) and 2 different phosphate-solubilising (Bacillus megaterium RC 01 and Bacillus M- 13) bacteria in comparison to control and mineral fertiliser (N and P) application. Among the strains used in the present study, 6 plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) stimulated indole acetic acid (IAA) production and 3 of them stimulated phosphate solubilisation; all bacterial strains fixed N 2 and significantly increased the growth of barley. Available phosphate in soil was significantly increased by <b>seed</b> <b>inoculation</b> with Bacillus M- 13 and B. megaterium RC 01. Maximum NO 3 -N was found in soil after inoculation with N 2 -fixing Bacillus OSU- 142, followed by P. polymyxa RC 05 and R. capsulatus RC 04. Total culturable bacteria count increased in all treatments with time, whereas N 2 -fixing bacteria decreased with time, except with B. megaterium RC 01 inoculation. The data suggest that <b>seed</b> <b>inoculation</b> of barley with plant PGPR increased root weight by 17. 9...|$|E
30|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{inoculation}} with A. brasilense strains CNPSo 2083 and CNPSo 2084 were tested. The first method consisted of <b>seed</b> <b>inoculation</b> at sowing {{and the second}} of leaf spray with the same inoculant at the V 3 stage (third leave developed).|$|E

40|$|Soybeans {{are grown}} {{extensively}} on the Grundy silt loam in southern Iowa. This soil usually requires from 2 to 3 tons of limestone to correct the acidity. Furthermore, it does not naturally contain the nitrogen-fixing soybean root-nodule bacteria. Hence, experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of liming and inoculation on the yield and quality of soybeans grown on typical Grundy silt loam. The experiments were conducted near Osceola in Clarke County. Quarry-run limestone was applied to different plots in varying amounts, ranging from 1 to 6 tons per acre. On other plots limestone of different degrees of fineness was applied. Two plots were left untreated to serve as checks. At planting time inoculated soybeans were sown on half of each plot and <b>seed</b> without <b>inoculation</b> on the other half...|$|R
30|$|As already stated, one of {{the major}} {{problems}} following soybean inoculation is fast bacterial death (Salema et al., 1982; Streeter, 2003). The seed storage temperature after inoculation is empirically considered the most important parameter related to rhizobial survival after seed treatment (Vriezen et al., 2005, 2006; Kremer and Peterson 1983). Moreover, temperature also directly affects the inoculated population desiccation rate generating a second stress condition (Streeter 2003 and 2007). Salinity and seed coat toxicity stress (Deaker et al., 2004) have a strong influence on bacterial survival; however, temperature and the consequent desiccation rate have been the major predicted cause of bacteria injury on seeds. Nevertheless, only few studies have involved the actual analysis of seed survival, perhaps due to contamination problems (Vincent et al., 1962; Bushby and Marshall, 1977; Jansen van Rensburg and Strijdom, 1980; Mary et al., 1986; Cliquet and Catroux, 2001, Kosanke et al., 1992; Vriezen et al., 2006). According to our results, <b>seed</b> storage after <b>inoculation</b> should be recommended at a temperature below 30 °C and preferably below 20 °C. We propose a survival factor percentage (SFP) defined as a single time parameter resulting from the number of bacteria recovered from seeds after the mortality function reached the plateau for decay, which in some way means when the survival bacterial population stabilized on <b>seeds</b> after <b>inoculation.</b> In our experiments, SFPs were defined 4 hours after inoculation. However, for research and development purposes, we suggest standardizing SFPs at 30 °C, as these may reduce the time required for product (or product variation) analysis.|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was done to}} {{study the effects of}} two types of plant growth regulator inoculums on growth and nutrient uptake in wheat under drought stress conditions. The {{experiment was}} conducted at the agricultural and natural resources research center of Tehran province (Iran) in 2010 - 11. The tests were arranged as a split plot layout within a randomized complete block design with three replications. Three irrigation treatments were tested in the main plots; normal irrigation, non-irrigation at the start of flowering stage (light stress) and non-irrigation at start of the grain filling stage (severe stress). <b>Seed</b> <b>inoculations</b> were tested in the subplots, as follows; no inoculation, VA mycorrhiza fungus, Azotobacter and a dual inoculation (fungus plus bacteria). The results showed that the effects of both light and severe drought stresses during the reproductive stage were significant on grain yield. Grain yield decreased from 6507 kg/ha under normal irrigation to 5492 kg/ha (15. 6 %) in light stress treatment and to 4564 kg/ha (29. 9 %) in severe stress treatment. The difference between all three irrigation treatments was significant. Inoculation with mycorrhiza fungi, Azotobacter and the dual inoculation, significantly increased wheat grain yields to 5936 (21. 6 %), 5532 (13. 3 %), and 5733 kg/ha (17. 5 %) respectively. Light stress treatment caused a non-significant increase for protein percentage but this was significant under severe stress treatment. The highest amount for protein percentage was from the dual inoculation treatment at 12. 4 %. There was a rapid decrease of the LAI curve that coincided with the maximum leaf area under severe stress treatment compared with the other two treatments. For each of the three inoculation treatments, the LAI curve had a more rapid increase than the test. In addition, the maximum LAI was higher in all three of the inoculation treatments compared with the test. The dual inoculation treatment was the best treatment in terms of yield, leaf production and grain protein in both normal and drought conditions...|$|R
