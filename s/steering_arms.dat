40|$|Abstract. Different process {{steps of}} the {{workpiece}} have different effects on the microstructure in the multi-stage forging. In this study, the effect of four different process steps of <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> on microstructure was studied by FEM. Results have showed that upsetting is beneficial to refine the microstructure as well as finish forging. Especially drawing can make the distribution of microstructure homogeneous while bending has less effect on it. The already-designed forging process for <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> was reasonable based on the simulation. Eventually, the grain size level of the <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> was tested as 6. 5 based on the conventional standard...|$|R

50|$|Other {{systems for}} {{steering}} exist, but are uncommon on road vehicles. Children's toys and go-karts often use a very direct linkage {{in the form}} of a bellcrank (also commonly known as a Pitman arm) attached directly between the steering column and the <b>steering</b> <b>arms,</b> and the use of cable-operated steering linkages (e.g. the capstan and bowstring mechanism) is also found on some home-built vehicles such as soapbox cars and recumbent tricycles.|$|E

50|$|Articulated {{steering}} is {{a system}} by which a four-wheel vehicle is split into front and rear halves which are connected by a vertical hinge. The front and rear halves are connected {{with one or more}} hydraulic cylinders that change the angle between the halves, including the front and rear axles and wheels, thus steering the vehicle. This system does not use <b>steering</b> <b>arms,</b> king pins, tie rods, etc. as does four-wheel steering. If the vertical hinge is placed equidistant between the two axles, it also eliminates the need for a central differential, as both front and rear axles will follow the same path, and thus rotate at the same speed. Long road trains, articulated buses, and internal transport trolley trains use articulated steering to achieve smaller turning circles, comparable to those of shorter conventional vehicles. Articulated haulers have very good off-road performance.|$|E
5000|$|The Coupé is a {{mid-engined}} two-seater {{sports car}} {{designed to give}} outstanding performance for its time, and impeccable handling. The design composed of two Mini front subframes, with traditional Mini rubber cone suspension, linked by a sheet steel semi-monocoque chassis. The chassis' deep centre tunnel backbone is supplemented by two generous sills. The car is mid-engined: the rear subframe contained the engine as in a Mini with the <b>steering</b> <b>arms</b> locked in position with adjustable rods and ball joints. This is {{held in place by}} a 1" [...] square tubular space frame, {{all the way from the}} rear bulkhead. The front subframe carried the steering rack, fuel tank and radiator. Brakes and wheels remained as per the options available to the Mini, post April 1982 GTM coupes being designed to allow fitment of 13" [...] wheel.|$|E
50|$|MBX-5 Pro SpecThe MBX-5 Pro Spec was {{an updated}} version of the MBX-5. It {{featured}} thicker shock towers, aluminum rear uprights, aluminum <b>steering</b> <b>arm,</b> front and rear chassis braces and titanium turn buckles. This was the first Mugen buggy to feature chassis braces.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{one end of}} {{the drag}} link is {{connected}} via the Pitman <b>arm</b> and <b>steering</b> gearbox to the steering wheel (providing the connection between the driver and the steering system); the other end is attached to the steering linkage, by the <b>steering</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ultimately {{its most}} popular form was an {{hour-glass}} shaped worm which engages with a double-toothed roller follower on the rocker shaft for the <b>steering</b> <b>arm.</b> The {{result is that}} substantially the same leverage is provided from one steering lock to the other.|$|R
5000|$|Rather {{than the}} {{preceding}} [...] "turntable" [...] steering, where both front wheels turned around a common pivot, each wheel gained its own pivot, {{close to its}} own hub. While more complex, this arrangement enhances controllability by avoiding large inputs from road surface variations being applied {{to the end of}} a long lever arm, as well as greatly reducing the fore-and-aft travel of the steered wheels. A linkage between these hubs pivots the two wheels together, and by careful arrangement of the linkage dimensions the Ackermann geometry could be approximated. This was achieved by making the linkage not a simple parallelogram, but by making the length of the track rod (the moving link between the hubs) shorter than that of the axle, so that the <b>steering</b> <b>arms</b> of the hubs appeared to [...] "toe out". As the steering moved, the wheels turned according to Ackermann, with the inner wheel turning further. If the track rod is placed ahead of the axle, it should instead be longer in comparison, thus preserving this same [...] "toe out".|$|E
50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four tie rods, one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between the tie rods), an idler arm on the passenger side, and a pitman arm on the driver side. The pitman arm attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side. The inner tie rods are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the <b>steering</b> <b>arms</b> and outer tie rods. All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{theoretical}} and experimental studies a method of fatigue life prediction for spot welded structures and components in automotive construction is presented. Computational load estimation starts from the cutting forces and cutting moments calculated on the finite element overall structural model of the component. Mechanical endurance tests on steel sheets, aluminium top hat profiles, delta <b>steering</b> <b>arms</b> and engine crossbars demonstrate that the proposed method of fatigue life prediction {{can be used in}} the design of spot welded components by comparing in the frame of damage calculations the results of local endurance tests with the load at the welding joints of the components.

40|$|Abstract—We present designs, theory, {{and results}} of {{fabrication}} and testing for a novel parallel microrobotic assembly scheme using stress-engineered MEMS microrobots. The robots are 240 − 280 µm × 60 µm × 7 − 20 µm insizeandcanbecontrolled to dock compliantly together, forming planar structures several times this size. The devices are classified into species {{based on the}} design of their steering arm actuators, and the species are further classified as independent if they can be maneuvered independently using a single global control signal. In this paper, we show that microrobot species are independent if the two transition voltages of their <b>steering</b> <b>arms,</b> i. e., the voltages at which the arms are raised or lowered, form a unique pair. We present control algorithms that can be applied to groups of independent microrobot species to direct their motion from arbitrary nondeadlock configurations to desired planar microassemblies. We present designs and fabrication for four independent microrobot species, each with a unique transition voltage. The fabricated microrobots are used to demonstrate directed assembly of five types of planar structures from two classes of initial conditions. We demonstrate an average docking accuracy of 5 µm and use self-aligning compliant interaction between the microrobots to further align and stabilize the intermediate assemblies. The final assemblies match their target shapes on average 96 %, by area.

40|$|To {{create an}} energy {{efficient}} vehicle {{there are a}} number of aspects that need to be optimized, namely; the drive train of the vehicle and energy source, aerodynamics and weight. Focusing on weight reduction, while still maintaining the desired performance and structural strength, many manufacturers are turning to advanced composites due to their superior strength to weight characteristics. Solar car racing provides a research platform that drives this innovation through technology development and efficiency. A lightweight vehicle suspension system design is being presented, together with an introduction into future testing. A suspension system is made up of a number of critical components which are dynamically loaded during standard operation due to undulating forces imposed by the road surface. Unidirectional cross-wound carbon fiber tubing is used for suspension and <b>steering</b> <b>arms.</b> The tubing is interfaced with small steel inserts and pivoting arm tie rod ends. Concerns within the design are the adhesive bonding of the carbon tubing to the steel inserts, and what type of tensile loading the interface can withstand. Due to forces imposed on the system during cornering and shock loading the components are required to withstand a minimum of 1. 2 times the weight of the overall vehicle, i. e. 258 kg. Tensile test results show that the mechanical properties of the adhesive joints rely somewhat on the surface characteristics and bond preparation. The target load of 258 kg was successfully obtained under static loading for two types of sample sets. The first based on the standard for describing the lap shear strength of adhesively bonded carbon fiber to aluminum, and the second based on the working component itself...|$|E
40|$|Subjected to {{the dynamic}} loading, truck {{components}} {{are exposed to}} fatigue loading. Hence the methods to improve the fatigue properties of the components are widely employed by manufacturers. One of the well known methods in this field is shot peening. Shot peening introduces compressive residual stresses in the surface zones and changes the work hardening state there. Compressive residual stresses provide higher resistance to crack initiation and may postpone the crack propagation. However the surface roughness is considerably increased by shot peening, {{which of course is}} not favourable for the fatigue durability. Steering arm as a truck component is the subject of present study. This component may be made of two different materials: medium carbon microalloyed steel or quenched and tempered steel. The former is continuously cooled leading to pearlitic-ferritic microstructure and the latter has a tempered martensite microstructure. Although the pearlitic-ferritic steering arm made of microalloyed steel is the main focus of this study, the tempered martensite microstructure was also investigated to a certain extent. Strain controlled, constant amplitude push-pull fatigue tests at different strain amplitudes were performed on cylindrical specimens. The specimens were machined out of the microalloyed steel <b>steering</b> <b>arms.</b> The specimens then were tested in two groups: one group in mirror finished condition and the other group in shot peened condition. The results showed that the life time of specimens at higher strain levels (higher plastic strain amplitudes) is not effected by shot peening. However at smaller plastic strain amplitudes the peened specimens exhibit a life time at least one order of magnitude longer than unpeened specimens. The residual stress relaxation and changes of work hardening state were also monitored at the surface and in depth for different strain amplitudes. The influence of plastic strain amplitude on relaxation of residual stresses was studied in detail as a function of fatigue cycle number. The fatigue behaviour in bending, including relaxation, was also studied for the tempered martensitic steel with different degrees of decarburisation and subsequent shot peening. Also in this case a positive influence of shot peening is mainly seen at small strain amplitudes. In parallel whole components were also tested in constant and variable amplitude loading fatigue, with and without shot peening. The results here also show a longer life time for the peened components...|$|E

50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion).
