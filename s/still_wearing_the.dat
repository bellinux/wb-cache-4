25|$|Police {{also often}} carry an impact weapon - a baton, {{also known as}} a nightstick. The common nightstick and the side handle baton have been {{replaced}} in many locations by expandable batons such as the Monadnock Auto-Lock Expandable Baton or ASP baton. One advantage of the collapsible baton is that the wearer can comfortably sit in a patrol vehicle while <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> baton on their duty belt. The side handle night stick usually has to be removed before entering the vehicle. Many departments also use less-lethal weapons like mace, pepper spray, electroshock guns, and beanbag shotgun rounds.|$|E

25|$|Although Bane {{had sworn}} off using Venom in Vengeance of Bane II in 1995, and his {{character}} is actually written as having kept {{that promise to}} himself, {{it is still not}} uncommon for artists to draw Bane as <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> tube leading from his old wrist device {{to the back of his}} head, as well as almost all media adaptations of the character show him actively using the Venom compound. Writer Gail Simone explained these lapses in the continuity of Bane's appearance in an issue of Secret Six, in which Deadshot remarked that Bane merely kept his old Venom equipment with him out of habit, even though Bane states that he would sooner die than use it again.|$|E

25|$|The numbers The Princesses' Khorovod and The Infernal Dance of King Katscheï {{were used}} in Bruno Bozzetto's {{animated}} film Allegro Non Troppo. The segment visualizes {{a variant of the}} Adam and Eve story. However, in this version, both Adam and Eve refuse to eat the apple offered by the Serpent, who then swallows it himself. Falling asleep, he is immediately plunged into a nightmare where he is first tormented by fiery demons and then plagued by things that are supposed to corrupt mankind (sex, alcohol, money, material objects, drugs, violence); he also somehow grows arms and legs and is magicked into a suit and fedora. When he wakes up, he is <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> suit and hat; after telling Adam and Eve his dream in a fast-motion and incomprehensible fashion, he sheds the suit (losing his arms and legs but keeping the hat) and spits up the still-whole apple.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the summer}} of 2016, the two former rivals found {{themselves}} facing off once more, rekindling the rivalry from 2014. The two faced off in a ten-minute, one fall match at the Arena México 60th Anniversary Show that ended with Rey Cometa defeating Cavernario. Afterwards Rey Cometa challenged Bárbaro Cavernario to put the Mexican National Welterweight Championship on the line at a later date, a match Bárbaro Cavernario agreed to a few weeks later. On June 10, 2016 Rey Cometa won the Mexican National Welterweight Championship as he defeated Bárbaro Cavernario two falls to one. During the introductions to a six-man tag team match on the June 17 Super Viernes show Rey Cometa dove onto Bárbaro Cavernario while <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> championship belt, striking Bárbaro Cavernario in the face by accident, leading to Bárbaro Cavernario being {{taken to the hospital}} to be checked out.

500|$|The Flukeman—also known affectionately as [...] "Flukey" [...] by {{the cast}} and crew—was portrayed by Darin Morgan, brother of {{executive}} producer Glen Morgan. He would become {{a staff writer for}} the show later in the second season. The Flukeman suit used by Morgan, which included flipper-like feet, yellow contact lenses, and fake teeth, took six hours to put on; this process was eventually sped up. Morgan wore the suit as much as 20 consecutive hours during shooting. As a result, he was forced to go to the bathroom while <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> suit. Morgan was rarely on set without being in full costume, and recalled that when he met up with David Duchovny again upon joining the series' writing staff, the actor had no idea who he was, despite having enjoyed an amiable relationship with the costumed Morgan previously. The suit dissolved in water, forcing special effects artist Toby Lindala to reconstruct the suit each day. Because the suit did not permit Morgan to breathe through his nose, he was unable to eat while wearing it. Carter described the character as [...] "the embodiment of everyone's sense of vulnerability, the idea of something that exists in the underworld of the sewer system and might in fact come to bite you in the least elegant of places". The original intention was showing even less of the Flukeman, but some angles and lighting ended up revealing more of the creature's design. Carter still felt it helped to [...] "get more creepy", as the Flukeman is not shown fully until the final scenes.|$|E

This was corroborated by police reports that one white attacker was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> make-up when apprehended. As in many other Dennison-related cases, no one was ever found guilty for their participation in the riot. A later grand jury hearing corroborated this claim, stating [...] "Several reported assaults on white women had actually been perpetrated by whites in blackface." [...] They went on to report that the riot was planned and begun by [...] "the vice element of the city." [...] The riot [...] "was not a casual affair; it was premeditated and planned by those secret and invisible forces that today are fighting you and the men who represent good government." ...|$|E

At her April 23, 2006, [...] "District Days" [...] event, Rep. McKinney was being interviewed by WGCL's Renee Starzyk, who repeatedly questioned her about the March 29 scuffle with a Capitol police officer. Frustrated, McKinney stood up and apparently forgot she was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> microphone. Her offscreen comments were captured on tape. She was heard saying, [...] "Oh, crap, now you know what ... they lied to , and Coz is a fool."

2500|$|In 1968, city {{officials}} condemned the building, declaring it a public nuisance and a fire hazard, and ordered it vacated. Except {{for a small}} Greyhound Lines terminal that was still operating in 1970, the building sat vacant for several years. A 1978 plan by the city to tear the building down was dropped when voters turned down a request for public funding {{to carry out the}} demolition. [...] The Clatsop County government took ownership in 1978 through tax foreclosure and sold the building at auction in early 1979.
