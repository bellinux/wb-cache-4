5|$|Carpenter's troopers then {{accomplished}} {{their primary}} task by <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> scouts {{to find the}} location of the 5th Cavalry. This was done without further incident and they arrived back to Fort Wallace on October 21.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield then {{enrolled}} at Stanford University, where he obtained a master's degree {{in political science}} in 1948. He returned to Salem and Willamette after Stanford and began working as {{an assistant professor in}} political science. During his tenure as professor, he built a political base by <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> messages and speaking at any public forum where he could get an invitation.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the Kampfgruppe Auschwitz (Combat Group Auschwitz) was {{organized}} {{with the aim}} of <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> information about what was happening. Sonderkommandos buried notes in the ground, hoping they would be found by the camp's liberators. The group also smuggled out photographs of corpses and preparations for mass killings in mid-1944.|$|E

5|$|In 2286, an {{enormous}} cylindrical probe moves through space, <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> an indecipherable signal and disabling {{the power of}} ships it passes. As it takes up orbit around Earth, its signal disables the global power grid and generates planetary storms, creating catastrophic, sun-blocking cloud cover. Starfleet Command sends out a planetary distress call and warns starships not to approach Earth.|$|E
5|$|In June 1832, {{after hearing}} that Atkinson was forming a new army, Black Hawk began <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> raiding parties. Perhaps hoping {{to lead the}} Americans away from his camp at Lake Koshkonong, he {{targeted}} areas to the west. The first major attack occurred on June 14 near present-day South Wayne, Wisconsin, when a band of about 30 warriors attacked a group of farmers, killing and scalping four.|$|E
5|$|Matheos {{suggested}} {{using an}} altered {{version of the}} United States passport for the album's cover art. The differences are that the arrows are double-headed, the olive branch is wilted, and the eagle's wings have been clipped. Matheos, Moore and Portnoy decided against <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> promotional copies of the album before its release date {{in order to prevent}} an early Internet leak of it. The album was released in Europe on February 17, 2003.|$|E

50|$|The Victorian Country Fire Authority in Australia used Twitter to <b>send</b> <b>out</b> regular alerts and updates {{regarding}} the February 2009 bushfires. The then Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd used his Twitter account to <b>send</b> <b>out</b> {{information on the}} fires, how to donate money and blood, and where to seek emergency help.|$|R
5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down to just a few hundred yards. From the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Tärnström, {{the first}} apostle and a 43-year-old pastor {{with a wife}} and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a Swedish East India Company ship headed for China. Tärnström never reached his destination, dying of a {{tropical}} fever on Côn Sơn Island the same year. Tärnström's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> younger, unmarried students after Tärnström. Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including Pehr Forsskål and Pehr Löfling.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms of Abercrombie {{begin with}} his {{reliance}} on relatively poor intelligence. Reports reached {{him that the}} French strength at Carillon was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected. Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them by <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> scouts or light infantry. Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort, a sign that a siege would have ended quickly.|$|E

5|$|The pitch {{invasion}} occurred while Gregory {{halted the}} match by not <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> {{a replacement for}} Murdoch. The New South Wales skipper called on Lord Harris to remove umpire Coulthard, whom he considered to be inept or biased, but his English counterpart declined. The other umpire, Edmund Barton, defended Coulthard and Lord Harris, saying that the decision against Murdoch was correct and that the English had conducted themselves appropriately. Eventually, Gregory agreed to resume the match without the removal of Coulthard. However, the crowd continued to disrupt proceedings, and play was abandoned for the day. Upon resumption after the Sunday rest day, Lord Harris's men won convincingly by an innings.|$|E
5|$|As Allied {{intelligence}} {{regarding the}} Japanese was still uncertain, Ramsay, who officially assumed {{command of the}} forces on New Britain on 27 November, adopted a cautious approach. Jacquinot Bay was built up as a base of operations and the Australians began <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> patrols to fight for information and harass the Japanese, with limited advances taking place on both {{the northern and southern}} coasts of the island, pushing east towards the Japanese strong hold around the Gazelle Peninsula. The AIB also continued to operate in the area, passing information to the 5th Division. The Japanese lacked information on the movements of Allied forces in New Britain, and only learned of the change in command from Australian radio broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Nolan {{designed}} the film's official website. As with the marketing strategy of The Blair Witch Project, the website {{was intended to}} provide further clues and hints to the story, while not providing any concrete information. After a short intro on the website, the viewer is shown a newspaper clipping detailing Leonard's murder of Teddy. Clicking on highlighted words in the article leads to more material describing the film, including Leonard's notes and photographs as well as police reports. The filmmakers employed another tactic by <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> Polaroid pictures to random people, depicting a bloody and shirtless Leonard pointing at an unmarked spot on his chest. Since Newmarket distributed the film themselves, Christopher Nolan edited the film's trailers himself. Sold to inexpensive cable-TV channels like Bravo and A, and websites such as Yahoo and MSN, the trailers were key to the film gaining widespread public notice.|$|E

5|$|Promoted to {{captain in}} August 1917, Cole was posted to France as a flight {{commander}} with No.2 Squadron AFC (also known until 1918 as No.68 Squadron RFC). Flying S.E.5 fighters on the Western Front, he {{was credited with}} destroying or <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> of control ten enemy aircraft between July and October 1918, making him an ace. In a single sortie over the Lys Valley on 19August, Cole shot down two German fighters and narrowly avoided being shot down himself immediately afterwards, when he was attacked by five Fokker Triplanes that were being pursued by Allied Bristol Fighters. On 24 September, he led into battle a patrol of fifteen S.E.5s that destroyed or damaged eight German fighters over Haubourdin and Pérenchies, claiming one Pfalz D.III for himself.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{over control}} of the {{northern}} sector from the 7th Brigade, which was subsequently transferred to the southern sector {{to take part in the}} main offensive, the 11th Brigade advanced along the coast from Kuraio Mission, <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> patrols into the interior to flush the Japanese out of their positions in the mountains as they went. The 31st/51st Infantry Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Kelly and roughly 800-strong, formed the vanguard of the advance, its main body moving along the coast road towards Amun, Sipaai and Rukussia, while patrols were sent inland from Totokei towards Lalum and Soraken, both of which were considered key Japanese positions. By 16 January 1945, the lead company of the 31st/51st reached Rukussia, having encountered no Japanese up until that point.|$|E
5|$|Advancing in bounds, occupying company {{bases and}} <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> patrols, the {{battalion}} began its move south on 15 January 1945. Throughout {{the rest of}} the month, the battalion was involved in a number of relatively minor engagements with the Japanese as they carried out patrolling and ambush operations along the Australian line of advance. By the start of February they reached Mosina and after receiving intelligence that a Japanese force had been detected at Warapa, they sent out to raid their camp. Upon reaching Warapa the patrol set fire to the huts in which the Japanese force was billeted and then withdrew. Later reconnaissance determined that 15 Japanese had died in the blaze. By 12 February the battalion married up with patrols from the 25th Battalion that were moving along the Tavera River and then later, as the battalion continued on towards Mosigetta, one company linked up with patrols from the 9th Battalion on 17 February.|$|E

5|$|Hatfield {{graduated}} from Salem High School (now North Salem High School) in 1940 and then enrolled at Willamette University, also in Salem. While attending Willamette, Hatfield became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega and Kappa Gamma Rho, which he later helped become {{a chapter of}} Beta Theta Pi. In college he also worked part-time for then Oregon Secretary of State Earl Snell, where {{he learned how to}} build a political base by <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> messages to potential voters after reading about life changes posted in newspapers, such as deaths and graduations. He also sketched out a political career path beginning with the state legislature and culminating in a spot in the United States Senate, with a blank for any position beyond the Senate. Hatfield {{graduated from}} Willamette in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree after three years at the school. While at the school he lost his only election, for student body president.|$|E
5|$|In Norfolk, {{the revolt}} {{was led by}} Geoffrey Litster, a weaver, and Sir Roger Bacon, a local lord with ties to the Suffolk rebels. Litster began <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> {{messengers}} across the county in a call to arms on 14 June, and isolated outbreaks of violence occurred. The rebels assembled on 17 June outside Norwich and killed Sir Robert Salle, {{who was in charge}} of the city defences and had attempted to negotiate a settlement. The people of the town then opened the gates to let the rebels in. They began looting buildings and killed Reginald Eccles, a local official. William de Ufford, the Earl of Suffolk fled his estates and travelled in disguise to London. The other leading members of the local gentry were captured and forced to play out the roles of a royal household, working for Litster. Violence spread out across the county, as gaols were opened, Flemish immigrants killed, court records burned, and property looted and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{sought to}} ingratiate himself with Mehmed by <b>sending</b> <b>out</b> orders to commanders and castellans to surrender, {{enabling}} his captor to take command {{of more than}} 70 towns in one week. Mehmed, however, {{had no intention of}} sparing Stephen's life and summoned him on 25 May. Stephen fearfully brought Angelović's document, but Mehmed's Persian-born mullah, Ali al-Bistami, issued a fatwah declaring that the Sultan was not bound to keep the promise made by his servant without his knowledge. As if to demonstrate the validity of his fatwah, the elderly mullah took out his sword and beheaded Stephen in front of Mehmed. The chronicler Benedetto Dei, who claimed to {{have been part of the}} Sultan's retinue, recorded that Mehmed himself decapitated Stephen. According to later accounts, Mehmed had Stephen flayed or used as a shooting target. The execution of the King, his uncle, cousin and two noblemen took place in a field next to Jajce, which has since been known as Carevo Polje ("the Emperor's Field").|$|E
