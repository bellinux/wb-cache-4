30|$|For {{making the}} {{pressure}} points, the <b>steel</b> <b>tap</b> of 1.0  mm internal diameter is {{inserted into the}} hole drilled on the model surface such that its one end flushes to the outer side of the model surface. Another end of the <b>steel</b> <b>tap</b> {{is connected to the}} vinyl tubing of 1.2  mm internal diameter. The free end of vinyl tubing is connected to Baratron pressure gauge to measure the fluctuating wind pressure at a particular point. The wind pressure on various surfaces of the building models are measured using the Baratron pressure gauge from MKS Corporation Ltd. It is a capacitance-type pressure transducer capable of measuring extremely low differential pressure heads. The gauge provides the pressure reading on particular tapping on its analog scale after adjusting it to a suitable sensitivity range, which is called Baratron range. The tubing system was dynamically calibrated to determine the amplitude and phase distortion. The analog surface pressure reading from the Baratron is converted to digital reading with solid-state integrator and subsequently the mean, rms, maximum and minimum pressures (N/m 2) are recorded in the computer using the data logger. Each tap is sampled for 15  s at 200  Hz.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As {{high-speed}} <b>steel</b> <b>tap</b> {{is incapable}} of small-hole tapping (M 3) in hardened steel, vibration tapping is introduced in this paper to solve this problem. Theoretic analysis with fracture mechanics indicates that the impact effect of the tap on the workpiece results in extended micro cracks and a much lower tapping torque. And the torsional rigidity of the tap is enforced in vibration tapping as proved by dynamic analysis. The experimental results show that with well chosen amplitudes, tapping torque decreases as vibration frequency increases and increases {{with the increase of}} net cutting time ratio, with the latter being the more significant influencing factor. In vibration tapping of hardened steel, 24 threads can be machined with a single tap. Vibration tapping is then proved to be a practical {{solution to the problem of}} small-hole tapping in hardened steel...|$|E

The flank wear on the cutting egde tends to be S-shaped with an initial wear, a steady state phase and a fast increasing wear just before tap breakage. Workpiece material adheres in grinding scratches on the rake face.

Use of carbon steel or mild steel as a construction material is taken as an onus despite its poor corrosion resistance properties at ambient temperature. This is because of its abundance, easy availability, low cost, good formability and workability and remarkable strength. The corrosion in steel structures is generally controlled by 3 methods, viz., cathodic protection, coating or use of an inhibitor. For pipe lines, storage tanks or similar structures, silicate or silicate based materials {{have been used as}} inhibitor for more than 70 years. Silicate in water provides protection to iron and steel by prohibiting its anodic dissolution. In this project, tests were carried out to study the corrosion prevention properties of Sodium silicate supplied by Adwan Chemical Industries.

40|$|The {{production}} EAF of Avesta Works, Outokumpu Stainless AB, {{has been}} used to perform smelting reduction trials of briquettes consisting of oily mill scale sludge, carbon and other wastes. The trials were among several important activities in studies on waste recycling by EAF smelting carried out jointly by Avesta Works and MiMeR, the Minerals and Metals Recycling Research Centre, at Luleå University of Technology. A total of 7 briquette smelting trials were performed. The heats were processed smoothly smelting 3 tonnes of briquettes or 3, 4 % of the weight for metal charges. Quantities of FeSi powder and O 2 gas injected and electric energy supplied were increased while the briquette weight was increased to 6 tonnes. No impacts were found on analyses of the crude stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tapped</b> from the EAF during the trials. Results of the briquette smelting have been evaluated by referring to the data from the reference heats and results from early laboratory tests. The recovery of Cr, Ni and Fe elements from the briquettes was nearly complete and was found to occur mainly through carbon reduction. Positive effects of briquette smelting on protecting metallic charges against gaseous oxidation have also been identified. This protection was through CO gas, generated from solid state C-O reaction in the briquettes, reacting with oxygen in the intruding air. The protection reduced losses of Cr, Ni and Fe elements from metallic charges to the slag. The slag weights were not increased in three trials as compared with the reference heats. There were moderate increases in the slag weights in four trial heats. The increases were, nevertheless, lower by 52 - 69 % than the slag weights generated by a Si-reduction of the briquette oxides. By smelting 6 -tonnes of briquettes in the trials, reliable information and results on C-O reactions in the briquettes for recovery of metal elements in the production EAF were obtained. After the trials, carbon-waste briquettes amounting to 1 - 3 tonnes were smelted very smoothly in many of the EAF heats at Avesta Works to recycle the oily mill scale sludge and other wastes from stainless steel production.

The memories allow him to overcome his mental subjugation and attack Galactus, who then strips him of the Power Cosmic. The Fantastic Four locates Reed, who prevents Henshaw from co-opting any of Galactus' technology for his own use. While Susan, Ben and Johnny struggle to fend off Galactus, Reed and Superman reverse the mechanics of the planet-devouring machine—causing it to transfer energy from Galactus to the planet. They restore the machine to normal only after Galactus agrees to feed only upon uninhabited planets in the future. When Superman demands that Galactus also pay for destroying Krypton, Galactus denies playing any role in the planet's destruction. Ben correctly deduces that Henshaw tampered with the Kryptonian crystal containing the message from Jor-El. Henshaw confesses that he created the false message to prompt Superman to seek out Galactus, hoping to follow the Man of <b>Steel</b> and then <b>tap</b> into Galactus' power himself. Galactus departs, but first punishes Henshaw by transmuting him into a small rectangular metal alloy, most likely without thought or consciousness.|$|R
40|$|The {{cleanliness}} {{of steel}} {{with respect to}} non-metallic inclusions and the precise alloy compositions in the steel products have always been of great concern in steel making technology. The development of steel making process to meet the compositional requirements for specific mechanical properties such as ductility, toughness, fatigue and machinability requires dynamic and continuous investigations. The refining of molten steel in the ladle furnace to meet the required compositional range requires the optimisation of the process parameters. For sulphur removal control, parameters such as argon gas flow rate through the porous plugs, inductive stirring effect, vacuum pressure of the tank degasser, amount & composition of the top slag should be optimised. In this thesis project an investigation was carried out on {{the factors that influence}} the top slag composition before vacuum treatment and also to optimise the top slag composition for precise sulphur removal. 12 heats were followed during the project: slag samples, steel samples, temperature and oxygen activities were taken at eight different process stages at Ovako steel mill. A relatively large variation was observed for all the oxide components of the slag phase before vacuum treatment in all the heats followed. A PLS analysis made shows that topslag composition before degassing is influenced by the amount of slag former added, oxygen potential at tapping, the yield of Al and Si deoxidants into the <b>steel</b> at <b>tapping.</b> The model has a poor predictability because some important parameters such as ladle glaze condition, amount of EAF slag tapped and refractory wear could not be measured. An alternative solution of extra slag practice was suggested instead of modelling the composition and mass of carry over slag left after slag removal. The extra slag practice involves the addition of lime during tapping so as to aid the removal of all the slag before ladle refining and thus optimisation of the new synthetic slag for precise sulphur removal could be easily achieved. Finally the investigation of the desulphurisation process shows that degassing time, argon gas flow rate through the porous plugs are as well important as the slag mass and composition in order to achieve a precise sulphur removal.

40|$|The hydrogasodynamics and {{technology}} a of melt treatment out of furnace by high-implused jets of neutral gas were studied. The {{conception of a}} jet synthesis, blowing regimes and devices to solve problems of melt treatment in ladle was developed. The appropriatenesses of melt degassing and homogenizig in ladle at the blowing by trans- and ultrasonic jets of neutral gas were obtained experimentaly. The approptiatenesses of gas-powder jets outflow were studied and {{a new class of}} blowing regimes and devices for powder material injection was developed. The principles of construction and optimization of regime parameters of blowing devices, regimes and devices for melt degassing by trans- and ultrasonic jets of neutral gas to inject the powder materials in a melt, technological decisions, concerning the correction of the chemical composition and temperature of a melt in ladle were developed. The principles of a temperature melting regime optimization were developed. The results obtained were applied in the West-Siberian Metallurgical works. The increase of the metal quality allowed to decrease the reject by 20 - 30 %. The yield of steel was increased by 0, 1 - 0, 3 %, the <b>steel</b> temperature on <b>tap</b> was decreased by 10 - 25 % the specific expense of cast iron was decreased by 2 - 4 kg/t, the ferroalloy expense was reduced by 3 - 8 %.
