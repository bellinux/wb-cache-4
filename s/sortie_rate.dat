5|$|Despite these Iraqi threats, the Coalition {{launched}} a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991. Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day, Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the Iraqi air defense systems and effectively destroyed the Iraqi Air Force, whose daily <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> plummeted from a prewar level {{of an estimated}} 200 per day to almost none by 17 January. On {{the third day of}} the campaign, many Iraqi pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed. The air campaign also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, railroads, and petroleum storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|The average {{operational}} <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> of one per serviceable fighter was {{not spread}} evenly throughout the command, however. Nos 12 and 13 Groups in the Midlands {{and north of}} Britain, with {{a third of the}} serviceable fighters between them, put up 129 (or only 15 per cent) of the day sorties, and of these only three made contact with the enemy. No. 11 Group put up one-third of the serviceable fighters in 600 sorties, or {{more than two-thirds of the}} total; on average. Each of the serviceable Spitfires and Hurricanes flew 1.7 operational sorties. No. 43 squadron flew the most sorties: 63 operations including five each from the 13 serviceable at the beginning of the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the 11 November bombing halt was that the average daily <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> over southern Laos rose to 620 per day before the new campaign had even begun. The freeing of aircraft (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) {{that had previously been}} participating in Rolling Thunder, when combined with those from Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound (which were both superseded by Commando Hunt), promised to create an interdiction effort of unprecedented scale. The new sensor-directed effort would see, for the first time, continuous round-the-clock bombing of the communist logistical system. During daylight, the missions would be performed by propeller-driven and jet fighter-bombers and B-52s. At night, fixed-wing gunships would prowl for prey. The new effort would also be supported by aerial defoliation missions (Operation Ranch Hand) and the cloud-seeding weather modification effort known as Operation Popeye (see Ho Chi Minh Trail). On 15 November 1968 the Seventh Air Force was granted authorization for launch of Commando Hunt.|$|E
5000|$|While in this command, Reeves {{worked hard}} to develop carrier {{aviation}} tactics, seeking to increase <b>sortie</b> <b>rates</b> {{and the use of}} dive-bombing. He proved these concepts by the success of his pilots and aircrew during the Navy's annual fleet exercises (known as [...] "Fleet Problems").|$|R
50|$|The {{increase}} in the B-52 Arc Light <b>sortie</b> <b>rates</b> over Vietnam necessitated relocation of additional KC-135's which provided PACAF fighter support. In February 1968 the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command 4220th Air Refueling Squadron deployed to CCK, bringing KC-135 tankers formerly based at Takhli RTAFB, Thailand and Kadena AB Okinawa.|$|R
5|$|Along the way, Rolling Thunder also fell prey to {{the same}} {{dysfunctional}} managerial attitude as did {{the rest of the}} American military effort in Southeast Asia. The process of the campaign became an end unto itself, with sortie generation as the standard by which progress was measured. <b>Sortie</b> <b>rates</b> and the number of bombs dropped, however, equaled efficiency, not effectiveness.|$|R
25|$|In April 1973, the {{armistice}} was breached, and the RLAF resumed combat operations. However, {{it was a}} force in decline, as its available T-28s dwindled to 40 and its monthly <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> declined to about 2,000. Two of the eight Spooky gunships were removed from action; the remainder were then disarmed and reverted to transports.|$|E
25|$|By August 1965, RLAF <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> had {{drastically}} {{increased as}} attack aircraft inventory {{had built up}} to 24 T-28s, augmented by 3 RT-28s and several C-47s. The latter were used as improvised gunships/bombers, being armed with 0.50 caliber machine guns and equipped with a roller system to trundle 250 pound bombs out the cargo door during flight. This successful field expedient was eventually cancelled however, as it interfered with opium smuggling activities {{by some of the}} Royal Lao high command.|$|E
25|$|IV Corps enjoyed close {{air support}} from fighter-bombers and dive bombers of 221 Group of the RAF. Allied fighter bombers and medium bombers shot up and bombed enemy concentrations, supply dumps, transport, roads and bridges {{all the way to}} the Chindwin river. The monsoon in no way diminished their activity. The RAF Third Tactical Air Force {{increased}} their <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> to 24,000 sorties during the worst four months of the monsoon, nearly six times the figure of the previous year’s record.|$|E
40|$|Battle damage repair (BDR) {{can play}} a key role in the outcome of a war. Promptness, reliability, and {{effectiveness}} of repairs affect the availability of aircraft for combat. In an air combat, an efficient Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR) is a key element in maintaining high <b>sortie</b> <b>rates</b> considering the limited availability of spares. Figure 1 (Ref. 1 - 2) shows the availability of aircraft for combat with and withou...|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{weight was}} so reduced after unloading that a downwind takeoff was trivially accomplished, saving {{the time and}} fuel needed to taxi to the upwind end of the middle runway. In cases of very high winds, the center runway would {{be used as a}} taxiway to return the aircraft {{to the ends of the}} two outer runways for takeoff. This would reduce <b>sortie</b> <b>rates.</b> Likewise, at the loading end of the route, the aircraft would land downwind, load, and takeoff upwind.|$|R
25|$|This led {{naturally}} {{to the second}} issue, involving the <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> of the aircraft. In the initial calculations they had assumed similar sortie rates as commercial aircraft like the Boeing 747, flying long multi-hour flights from the oil fields in Alaska to California. However, the sortie rates of commercial aircraft are based on customer preferences on what times they want to fly, not the actual ability of the aircraft. Assuming much shorter routes and 24-hour operation, sortie rates {{on the order of}} 18 to 20 flights a day seemed possible. This greatly reduced the number of aircraft that were needed to provide any particular level of service.|$|E
25|$|By 9 November 1966, Operation Waterpump had {{graduated}} 42 new Lao T-28 pilots. However, because of defections and casualties, only 24 still {{remained on the}} RLAF rolls. In an attempt to project RLAF needs into the future, Ambassador William H. Sullivan predicted that perhaps seven defecting Lao pilots could be recovered from Thailand, and that six more Lao pilot cadets were about to graduate from training. Sullivan foresaw a need for 55 to 60 Lao pilots to man 44 to 48 T-28s. He noted {{the importance of having}} T-28 pilots with a common language with Lao ground troops, for whom the RLAF flew close air support. Until a sufficient number of Lao pilots had been trained, Thai pilots, whose language was akin to Lao, would fill the close air support role, leaving U. S. Air Force planes free to strike interdiction targets. By the end of 1966, over half of the year's combat sorties had been flown by B Team pilots. The B Team pilots had begun using Muang Soui as an advanced base near the Plaine des Jarres, cutting their sortie time and raising their <b>sortie</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} constituent of the Royalist {{strength was}} tactical air power. The Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF), backed by an all out effort by their Air Commando advisers, doubled their daily <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> to 44. 7th Air Force (7th AF) committed 48 daily sorties, with 12 more held ready {{as a quick}} reaction force. This was a {{sharp contrast to the}} 200 sorties per day of U.S. tactical air that had been available just a few months prior during Kou Kiet. There was a concerted effort to more efficiently use such U.S. air power as was received. For air strike control, the U.S. Air Attaché promulgated a designated battle area (DBA) containing the Communist units threatening Long Tieng. The main Communist gun parks and troop staging areas could be bombed by jets using all-weather methods under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) in certain areas. Communist bases on the Plain of Jars, down to Ban Ban, and east along Route 7 to the North Vietnamese border were free fire zones. All other air strikes would be under the existing rules of engagement, which included targets being acquired, marked and directed by Raven Forward Air Controllers operating from Long Tieng's 20 Alternate airfield.|$|E
50|$|During and {{immediately}} following the PAVN offensive, U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps aviators had flown 18,000 sorties in the four northern provinces of South Vietnam and dropped 40,000 tons of ordnance in the Battle of An Lộc. Between March and May, B-52 <b>sortie</b> <b>rates</b> had climbed from 700 to 2,200 per month and they had dropped 57,000 tons of bombs in Quảng Trị Province alone. During Freedom Train and Linebacker proper, B-52s had dropped 150,237 tons of bombs on the North while Air Force and Navy tactical aircraft had flown 1,216 sorties and dropped another 5,000 tons of ordnance.|$|R
5000|$|The US Navy aims to use modern {{equipment}} and extensive automation {{to reduce the}} crew size and {{the total cost of}} future aircraft carriers. The biggest visible difference from earlier supercarriers will be the more aft location of the island (superstructure). Ships of the Ford class are intended to sustain 160 sorties per day for 30-plus days, with a surge capability of 270 sorties per day. [...] Director of Operational Testing Michael Gilmore has criticized the assumptions used in these forecasts as unrealistic and has indicated <b>sortie</b> <b>rates</b> similar to the 120/240 per day of the Nimitz class would be acceptable.|$|R
50|$|The Patriots {{returned}} to their first ship, the USS John F. Kennedy, for another combat deployment in 2002, during which the Patriots detached to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and achieved a 100% combat <b>sortie</b> completion <b>rate.</b>|$|R
25|$|After the {{breakout}} {{from the}} Pusan Perimeter in November 1950, the 8th flew daily strike missions out of Iwakuni {{and at times}} recovering at Taegu AB (K-2), which forced the crews to fly long, arduous missions that sometimes lasted more than six hours. When the Chinese Communists attacked in the Spring of 1951, FEAF requested that the light bomber wings increase their nightly <b>sortie</b> <b>rate.</b> The {{only way to do}} this was to double up some of the missions. For several months, the crews flew from Iwakuni to their patrol sectors in North Korea, completed their mission, and then flew to the K-2 Airfield. Landing a B-26 at night at Taegu was no easy feat because the Pierced Steel Planking on the runway had begun to deteriorate. The B-26s landing there tore up dozens of tires, {{and more than a few}} accidents resulted. Also, the tires were in short supply, so each one lost at K-2 was hard to replace. If the B-26 crews got down at Taegu without incident, they could find a place to grab a quick catnap as their planes were readied for the next mission. About an hour later, they were airborne and heading north to their next target area. Four hours later, utterly exhausted, they were back in Japan, after up to ten hours of flight and combat.|$|E
25|$|The IAF {{was able}} to conduct {{a wide range of}} {{missions}} – troop support; air combat; deep penetration strikes; para-dropping behind enemy lines; feints to draw enemy fighters away from the actual target; bombing; and reconnaissance. In contrast, the Pakistan Air Force, which was solely focused on air combat, was blown out of the subcontinent’s skies within {{the first week of the}} war. Those PAF aircraft that survived took refuge at Iranian air bases or in concrete bunkers, refusing to offer a fight. Hostilities officially ended at 14:30 GMT on 17 December, after the fall of Dacca on 15 December. India claimed large gains of territory in West Pakistan (although pre-war boundaries were recognised after the war), and the independence of Pakistan's East wing as Bangladesh was confirmed. The IAF had flown over 16,000 sorties on both East and West fronts; including sorties by transport aircraft and helicopters. while the PAF flew about 30 and 2,840. More than 80 percent of the IAF's sorties were close-support and interdiction, and according to neutral assessments about 45 IAF Aircraft were lost while, Pakistan lost 75 aircraft. Not including any F-6s, Mirage IIIs, or the six Jordanian F-104s which failed to return to their donors. But the imbalance in air losses was explained by the IAF's considerably higher <b>sortie</b> <b>rate,</b> and its emphasis on ground-attack missions. On the ground Pakistan suffered most, with 9,000 killed and 25,000 wounded while India lost 3,000 dead and 12,000 wounded. The loss of armoured vehicles was similarly imbalanced. This represented a major defeat for Pakistan. Towards the end of the war, IAF's transport planes dropped leaflets over Dhaka urging the Pakistani forces to surrender, demoralising Pakistani troops in East Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, the F-22 {{reportedly}} maintained 97% <b>sortie</b> <b>rate,</b> flying 102 out of 105 tasked sorties while amassing a 144-to-zero {{kill ratio}} during [...] "Northern Edge" [...] air-to-air exercises in Alaska. According to Lieutenant Colonel Wade Tolliver, squadron {{commander of the}} 27th Fighter Squadron, the stealth coatings of the F-22 are more robust than those used in earlier stealth aircraft, being less sensitive to weather and wear and tear. However, rain caused [...] "shorts and failures in sophisticated electrical components" [...] when F-22s were posted to Guam.|$|E
50|$|In mid-2011 the {{squadron}} returned to Aviano Air Base {{in support of}} Operation Unified Protector, and NATO operations over Libya. Throughout this deployment, {{the squadron}} maintained a 100% <b>sortie</b> completion <b>rate</b> while compiling 164 sorties and 1086 combat hours.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} amassed over 650 {{flight hours}} consisting of combat missions over Afghanistan and Iraq. During their 2007 WESTPAC, the four EA-6B ICAP III Prowlers of VAQ-138 logged over 1,700 flight hours, and achieved a 96% combat <b>sortie</b> completion <b>rate.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 2. To have {{numerical}} superiority in the air, {{which implies}} {{the need for}} lower procurement cost, lower maintenance cost, and higher reliability. Not even {{taking into account the}} sometimes superior combat capability of lighter aircraft based on surprise and maneuverability, the pure numbers issue of lower cost and higher reliability (higher <b>sortie</b> <b>rates)</b> also tends to favor light fighters. It is a basic outcome of Lanchester's laws, or the salvo combat model, that a larger number of less-sophisticated units will tend to be successful over a smaller number of more advanced ones; the damage dealt is based on the square of the number of units firing, while the quality of those units has only a linear effect on the outcome. This non-linear relationship favors the light and lightweight fighter.|$|R
500|$|The Marines Corps' {{concept for}} {{deploying}} the Harriers in a land-based expeditionary role focused on aggressive speed. Harrier forward bases and light maintenance facilities {{were to be}} set up in under 24 hours on any prospective battle area. The forward bases, containing one to four aircraft, were to be located [...] from the forward edge of battle (FEBA), while a more established permanent airbase would be located around [...] from the FEBA. The close proximity of forward bases allowed for a far greater <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> and reduced fuel consumption.|$|E

The last large carriers proposed for the Royal Navy, the CVA-01 programme, were cancelled by the then Labour government in the 1966 Defence White Paper. In November 2004, giving evidence to the House of Commons Defence Committee, First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Alan West explained that the <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> and interoperability with the United States Navy were factors in deciding {{on the size of the}} carriers and the composition of the carriers' air-wings: ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{achieve the}} {{required}} <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> {{needed to make}} the [...] "flying pipeline" [...] concept work, Boeing designed an airport around the aircraft. This featured three parallel runways that would operate at the same time. Aircraft landed on the two outer runways, and then taxied along large operational aprons {{at either end of the}} runways. Here they dropped their cargo pods and picked up empty ones for the return flight. Two such transfer stations were located at either end, in order to maintain the required <b>sortie</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

Also, Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 71 (HSM-71), a new component to Carrier Air Wing Nine (CVW-9), {{is the first}} squadron of its kind to embark on board a carrier {{as part of a}} carrier air wing [...] (pictured). The squadron flew more than 4,690 hours with a 95 percent <b>sortie</b> completion <b>rate</b> and earned the right to fly the Enlisted Aviation Warfare Pennant. [...] The highlight for the squadron occurred during the undersea warfare exercise (USWEX) when HSM-71 deployed multiple aircraft to simulate engagements with U.S. and Japanese submarines. [...] The squadron kept three helicopters aloft throughout the entire four-day exercise for a total of 222 flight hours and conducted 28 simulated attacks on two U.S. and two Japanese submarines.|$|R
5000|$|From June through December 1994, 28 BW B-1Bs {{participated in}} a Congressionally {{directed}} operational readiness assessment known locally as [...] "Dakota Challenge." [...] Towards {{the end of the}} exercise the wing deployed a squadron to Roswell, NM, to simulate flying from an austere location at wartime <b>sortie</b> <b>rates.</b> This test proved the B-1B to be a versatile weapon system. Excellent results were obtained. However, World Airpower Journal argued that 'it could be argued that the excellent results were meaningless, because they were so unrepresentative. Spare parts, equipment and people were brought in from the 7th and 384th Bomb Wings, at last bringing up the 28th up to 100% in all three respects. This was done at the expense of degrading the other two wings. It did however show what was possible, given funding and commitment.'. The journal favorably quoted General John M. Loh in this regard.|$|R
2500|$|By June 1968, {{because of}} T-28 losses, pilot losses, and {{resultant}} low morale, RLAF tactical air was diminished to flying its lowest <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> in four years. The [...] "civilian" [...] aviation specialists supplied from the USAF were increased to ten per Air Operations Center, {{taking charge of}} all T-28 support functions for a gain in short term efficiency. As a result, RLAF strike sorties for December tripled over January's score, totaling 1,522 missions. By year's end, the RLAF T-28s had flown approximately 10,000 combat sorties. By contrast, the RLAF's transport C-47s were still brazenly misused for opium and gold smuggling, and chartered out as civilian airliners.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{the first}} two weeks, the IAF had carried out more than 4,000 sorties in East Pakistan and [...] {{provided}} successful air cover for the advancing Indian army in East Pakistan. IAF also assisted the Indian Navy in sinking several Pakistani naval vessels in the Bay of Bengal. In the west, the airforce demolished scores of tanks and armoured vehicles in a single battle - the Battle of Longewala. The IAF pursued strategic bombing by destroying oil installations in Karachi, the Mangla Dam and gas plant in Sindh. As the IAF achieved complete air superiority over the eastern wing of Pakistan within a few days, [...] the ordnance factories, runways, and other vital areas in East Pakistan were severely crippled. In the end, the IAF {{played a pivotal role}} in the victory for the Allied Forces leading to the liberation of Bangladesh. In addition to the overall strategic victory, the IAF had also claimed 94 [...] Pakistani aircraft destroyed, with some 45 of their own aircraft admitted lost. The IAF had however, flown over 7000 combat sorties on both East and West fronts and its overall <b>sortie</b> <b>rate</b> numbered over 15000. Comparatively the PAF was flowing fewer sorties (though PAF had qualitative advantage; its Mirage III fighter/bombers could fly at night, where no IAF fighter had that capability—the only aircraft in IAF with this capability was the Canberra bomber) by the day fearing loss of planes. Towards the end of the war, IAF's transport planes dropped leaflets over Dhaka urging the Pak forces to surrender; East Pakistani sources note that as the leaflets floated down, the morale of the Pakistani troops sunk.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his tenure}} as COMTAC, General Robert Dixon revamped the way TAC {{personnel}} trained. It was under his command that the Red Flag training exercises were started at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada in order to more realistically simulate the expected combat environment and to reduce the high casualty rate experienced during the early phases of offensive operations in the Vietnam War. Another driver was the lessons learned during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where the use of Soviet-supplied integrated air defense systems by the Egyptians and the Syrians had severely restricted the capability of the Israeli Air Force to support the ground forces. Dixon developed a close friendship with {{the commander of the}} Israeli Air Force, Major General Benny Peled that facilitated the prompt supply of US replacement systems to Israel and also of Israeli-captured Soviet equipment to the US. Dixon also decentralized aircraft maintenance in order to improve aircraft availability and combat <b>sortie</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
