Although {{still present}} in the popular imagination, {{the idea that the}} Brazilian terri-tory is devoid of {{earthquakes}} and tradition that structures designed in this region do not re-quire special considerations on this phenomenon are losing <b>strength.</b> <b>Standards</b> for the seis-mic design of structures were recently developed and reports of seismic phenomena in the country are not rare. The Brazilian seismic activity is low but not non-existent. Earthquakes of significant magnitudes have been recorded and seismic history of this region is still little known. Greater understandings of seismology, the availability of new records of earthquakes and seismic observations of the behavior of structures have shown that a strong earthquake could induce a significant dynamic amplification, capable of possible structural damage in concrete dams. The evaluation of seismic safety of dams is a growing concern, because acci-dents involving this type of structure have catastrophic consequences, with human and ma-terial losses. This paper provides contributions to an analytical-numerical study on the dam-reservoir interaction problem. The separation of variables method is employed in the closed form solution of the bidimensional Laplace equation over rectangular domains, assuming an infinite reservoir in the longitudinal direction.

However, insufficient evidence exists to inform on the occupational strength requirements of firefighters. This study aimed to determine optimum <b>strength</b> <b>standards</b> for operational duty by examining the relationship between criterion tasks and surrogate gym-based exercises. Generic firefighting tasks that required the largest applications of physical strength and minimum acceptable performance of these tasks were identified and endorsed by a technical panel comprising operationally experienced experts. Fifty one (26 male, 25 female) civilian (non-firefighter) volunteers (mean (±SD) : age 24 (± 6) y, mass 74 (± 15) kg, height 1. 72 (± 0. 1) m, BMI 25 (± 4) kg. m- 2, estimated body fat 21 (± 8) %) completed a series of tasks in a randomised order. Discrete performance (pass/fail) was assessed on three criterion tasks; a ladder lift, a ladder “extend-to-lower” and a ladder extension. Maximum performance was also measured on surrogate representative gym-based tasks; 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) seated barbell overhead press, 1 RM rope pull-down and a repeated 28 kg rope pull-down (repetitions to failure). Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to determine optimum performance standards that were mathematically closest to maximising sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (false positive rate). Mean (±SD, range) shoulder press 1 RM of those who passed (n= 31) and failed (n= 20) the ladder lift test were 53 (± 13, 35 - 75) kg and 25 (± 5, 20 - 32. 5) kg, respectively. Mean (±SD, range) single rope pull-down 1 RM of those who passed (n= 39) and failed (n= 12) the ladder extend-to-lower test were 76 (± 19, 46 - 109) kg and 48 (± 9, 30 - 60) kg, respectively. Mean (±SD, range) repetitions to failure of 28 kg rope pull-down of those who passed (n= 36) and failed (n= 15) the ladder extension test were 37 (± 16, 10 - 68) and 13 (± 9, 1 - 34), respectively. Optimal performance standards were calculated as 35 kg for shoulder press (sens/spec: 1. 00 / 1. 00), 60 kg for single rope pull-down (sens/spec: 0. 76 / 0. 92) and 23 repetitions for the 28 kg repeated pull-down (sens/spec: 0. 81 / 0. 93). Surrogate gym-based strength tests were investigated as predictors of performance on strength and muscular endurance tasks critical to firefighting, resulting in obtainment of suitable performance measures. These findings facilitate the use of normal gym-based practices for testing optimal strength for operational duty as a firefighter. Since the physical demands of firefighting roles are multi-faceted, combining these findings with cardiorespiratory demands could aid firefighting populations in the maintenance of appropriate fitness for work...|$|E
