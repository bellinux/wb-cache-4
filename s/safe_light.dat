50|$|Lara finally {{travels to}} Giza, where {{the forces of}} Seth have {{gathered}} to block the way to Horus, since the Millennial Constellation is in position. Lara, after fighting her way through those forces and climbing the Great Pyramid, finds her way down into the Temple of Horus and, fitting the armour and amulet to the statue, summons Horus. Horus partially completes his transfer, but Seth arrives and destroys the armour, though the amulet remains undamaged. Lara makes her way out, avoiding Seth’s attacks until in the <b>safe</b> <b>light</b> of the constellation. Then she locks the doors into the temple with the amulet, trapping Seth inside forever. Making her way out completely exhausted, Lara sees Von Croy at the entrance. Unsure about whether he is free of Seth’s influence, she is unwilling to take his arm as the temple begins to collapse around her. Von Croy tries to save her as she hangs from a ledge, but is forced to rush out, leaving Lara to her presumed death.

A flat photodiode-based dosimetry system is compared with an isotropic detector-based system in patients undergoing IP PDT. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Flat photodiodes and spherical detectors were placed {{side by side in}} the abdomen, for simultaneous light dosimetry in 19 patients. Tissue phantom experiments were per-formed to provide a preliminary estimate of the tissue optical proper-ties of the peritoneum. Results: The conversion factor between systems for 630 -nm light was found to be 1. 7 ± 0. 12. The meff of the tissues in the abdomen is estimated to vary between 0. 5 cm− 1 to 1. 4 cm− 1 assuming a ms * = 7 cm− 1. Conclusions: The measured conversion factor should allow for com-parison of light fluences with future clinical protocols that use an iso-tropic-based detector system.

A relationship was obtained between the quality of these parameters and the analysis of characteristic curves (H and D curves) of images produced at each facility.
