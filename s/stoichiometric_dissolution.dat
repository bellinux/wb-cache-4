Within this ideal model, the saturation curves and the uid evolution of a simple reacting system may be displayed conveniently in chemical potential diagrams. The simulation of a geochemical system, constituted of a glauconitic sandstone aquifer in ltrated through by a sea water enriched in carbonates, allows to analyze the impact of taking into account two ferro-magnesian solid solutions, a calcite and a chlorite, on Fe-Mg exchanges during carbonates dissolution. The model accounts well for the tendency of solid solutions to dissolve congruently before precipitation starts and drives the uid composition towards equilibrium...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCalcium {{silicate}} hydrate (C-S-H) alteration was {{studied with}} flow-through experiments at 25 °C and pH 9. 2. Three materials with apparent Ca/Si ratios (C/S ratios) of 1. 47, 1. 38 and 0. 86 were investigated. Physical (thermogravimetric analyses/differential thermal analysis), mineralogical (X-ray diffraction) and chemical (electron probe microanalysis, transmission electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry) {{analyses were performed}} to characterize the reacting minerals. Initial stoichiometric C/S ratios were 1. 22, 1. 22 and 0. 85, respectively. The excess of Ca is attributed mainly {{to the presence of}} calcium hydroxide intimately mixed in with C-S-H particles. The C-S-H chemical compositions were monitored during flow-through experiments {{in order to determine the}} mineral stoichiometry needed for reaction kinetics. Under our experimental conditions the stoichiometric C/S ratios decreased continuously with time. A close to <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>dissolution</b> was observed after 2 days of experiments. Using an integrated approach, the kinetics was found to be a function of the C/S. A decrease in layer-to-layer distance in the early stage of the alteration process is interpreted as interlayer Ca/Na exchange (Na being part of the pH buffering solution). A second dissolution step, marked by a close to stoichiometric release of Ca and Si, undoubtedly results from layer dissolution. The structural similarity of C-S-H and tobermorite was confirmed...|$|E
40|$|Mixtures of {{oxalic acid}} with nitric acid {{have been shown}} to be {{superior}} to oxalic acid alone for the dissolution of iron-rich High Level Waste sludge heels. Optimized conditions resulting in minimal oxalate usage and <b>stoichiometric</b> iron <b>dissolution</b> (based on added oxalate ion) have been determined for hematite (a primary sludge iron phase) in oxalic/nitric acid mixtures. The acid mixtures performed better than expected based on the solubility of hematite in the individual acids through a synergistic effect in which the preferred 1 : 1 Fe:oxalate complex is formed. This allows for the minimization of oxalate additions to the waste stream. Carbon steel corrosion rates were measured in oxalic/nitric acid mixtures to evaluate the impacts of chemical cleaning with these solutions on waste tank integrity. Manageable corrosion rates were observed in the concentration ranges of interest for an acid contact timescale of 1 month. Kinetics tests involving hematite and gibbsite (a primary sludge aluminum phase) have confirmed that {ge} 90 % solids dissolution occurs within 3 weeks. Based on these results, the chemical cleaning conditions recommended to promote minimal oxalate usage and manageable corrosion include: 0. 5 wt. % oxalic acid/ 0. 175 M nitric acid mixture, 50 C, 2 - 3 week contact time with agitation...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} success of coral reefs {{depends on a}} positive balance of calcium carbonate production exceeding dissolution, erosion, and material export. As a result of ocean acidification, coral reefs could transition from net accretion to net erosion owing to decreasing rates of calcification and increasing rates of chemical dissolution and bioerosion. Here, I present a fundamental paradigm that aims to explain the main driver of carbonate sediment dissolution on coral reefs based on theory and a new empirical dataset of pore water carbonate chemistry from the Bermuda coral reef platform. The paradigm shows that carbonate sediment dissolution is most strongly controlled by the extent of organic matter decomposition in the sediments, but that the magnitude of dissolution is influenced by how much decomposition is required to reach pore water undersaturation {{with respect to the}} most soluble bulk carbonate mineral phase present in the sediments, a condition defined as the Carbonate Critical Threshold (CCT). Decomposition of organic matter beyond the CCT under aerobic conditions results in <b>stoichiometric</b> proportional <b>dissolution</b> of carbonate sediments. As ocean acidification proceeds over the next several decades, the extent of organic matter decomposition required to reach the CCT will decrease, carbonate dissolution will increase, and subsequently the accumulation of carbonate sediments will decrease. Since drastic reductions in anthropogenic CO 2 emission are unlikely in the foreseeable future, the paradigm shows that active controls and reduction of organic matter input to coral reefs at the local scale might be an effective mitigation strategy to prevent or delay coral reefs transitioning to a state of net dissolution...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSteady-state {{pyroxene}} dissolution {{rates in}} aqueous solutions have been measured at temperatures from 25 to 374 °C at a pressure of 23 MPa and at neutral pH. The pyroxene is hedenbergitic clinopyroxene, of composition Na 0. 04 Ca 0. 95 Mg 0. 3 Fe 2 + 0. 64 Fe 3 + 0. 06 Al 0. 04 Si 1. 97 O 6. All experiments were performed at conditions far from equilibrium in Ti-alloy mixed-flow reactors. In most runs, the reactive solutions were undersaturated {{with respect to}} pyroxene and secondary minerals were rarely found at the reacted surface. The dissolution is non-stoichiometric in most cases, while the different chemical elements of the pyroxene are released at different rates. <b>Stoichiometric</b> steady-state <b>dissolution</b> was obtained in neutral solution at 100 °C. The release rates of the different elements vary with temperature and solution chemistry. The dissolution rates (r Si) in neutral pH conditions increase with temperature from 25 to 300 °C, reach a maximum at 300 °C, and then decrease with continued temperature increase. At a given temperature, the rates decrease significantly with increasing pH of the reactive fluid and are also affected by the activities of Ca, Mg, Fe in the solution. At neutral pH, the dependence of the pyroxene dissolution rates on activities of Ca, Mg, Fe and H + in the fluid can be expressed by the relation: log r + (T, ai) = log (A - E a /(2. 303 RT) + α log (a H+) Zi / a Mi Zi+) where r + is the far-from-equilibrium dissolution rate, R the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, Z i valence of metal M i and a i represents {{the activity of the}} subscript aqueous species. E a equals 22. 667 kJ/mole/K and A = 2. 011 × 10 − 7 mole/cm 2 /s; α is the empirical reaction rate order, which can be derived from the experimental results. At temperatures below 300 °C, the exchange reactions 2 H + ↔ M i 2 +, where M i 2 + refers to divalent cations Mg 2 +, Fe 2 + or Ca 2 +, dominate in the dissolution. The following evolution of the dissolution with temperature is proposed: at 300 °C, the tetrahedral Si-O bonds break after the M i 2 + −O bonds in adjacent octahedral positions have been removed by proton exchange reaction, whereas, above 300 °C, the breaking of the octahedral M i 2 + −O bonds occurs after adjacent tetrahedral Si-O bonds have been broken...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Our {{group have}} shown in an {{experiment}} performed in the carotid artery of a living swine that magnetic gradients generated by a clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system could propel and navigate untethered medical microdevices and micro-nanorobots in the human vasculature. The main problem with these devices is that the metal necessary for magnetic propulsion may corrode and induce cytotoxic effects. The challenge, then, is to find an alloy with low corrosion yet providing an adequate magnetization level for propulsion in often stringent physiological conditions. Because of their high magnetization, we studied the corrosion behavior of two iron-cobalt alloys, Permendur (49 % Fe, 49 % Co, 2 % V) and Vacoflux 17 (81 % Fe, 17 % Co, 2 % Cr), in physiological solution by potentiodynamic polarization assay, surface analysis, and corrosion electrolyte analysis. Both alloys exhibited low corrosion parameters such as a corrosion potential (Ecorr) of 20. 57 V/SCE and Ecorr of 20. 42 V/SCE for Vacoflux 17. The surface of Permendur samples was homogenously degraded. Vacoflux 17 surface was impaired by cracks and crevices. Both alloys had a <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>dissolution</b> in the electrolyte, and they released enough cobalt to induce cytotoxic effects. This study concluded that Fe-Co alloys could be used preferably in medical microdevices if they were coated {{so as not to}} come in contact with physiological solutions. &apos...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissolution}} of Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) pilot plant calcines was examined to determine solubility of calcine matrix components in acidic media. Two representatives pilot plant calcine types were studied: Zirconia calcine and Zirconia/ Sodium calcine. Dissolution of these calcines was evaluated using lower initial concentrations of nitric acid than used in previous tests {{to decrease the}} [H+] concentration in the final solutions. Lower [H+] concentrations contribute to more favorable TRUEX/SREX solvent extraction flowsheet performance. Dissolution and analytical results were also obtained for radioactive calcines produced using high sodium feeds blended with non-radioactive A 1 (NO 3) 3 solutions to dilute the sodium concentration and prevent bed agglomeration during the calcination process. Dissolution tests indicated > 95 wt. % of the initial calcine mass can be dissolved using the baseline dissolution procedure, with the exception that higher initial nitric acid concentrations are required. The higher initial acid concentration is required for <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>dissolution</b> of the oxides, primarily aluminum oxide. Statistically designed experiments using pilot plant calcine were performed {{to determine the effect}} of mixing rate on dissolution efficiency. Mixing rate was determined to provide minimal effects on wt. % dissolution.

Their structure allows for variety of substitutions in both cationic and anionie positions. The {{purpose of this study}} is low temperature synthesis, mineralogical and thermodynamic characterization of fluorpyromorphite (FPY) and determination of its solubility product based on the results obtained from the dissolution experiment. FPY was synthesized by dropwise mixing of solutions containing Pb(NO 3) 2, K 2 HPO 4 and NaF at 25 °C. The only product of synthesis is FPY within the detection limits of X-ray diffraction. Calculated unit cell parameters are a = 9. 7427 Å, c = 7. 3216 Å. Homogeneous character of the precipitate was confirmed further with the use of scanning electron microscopy. Dissolution experiments were conducted in triplicates, open to the air, at 5, 25, 45 °C and 65 ºC and at pH = 2. 0. An aliquot of about 250 mg of FPY was placed in 250 mL of 0. 05 M KNO 3 with the pH adjusted using 0. 1 M HNO 3. Periodically taken samples were analyzed for [Pb] using atomic absorption spectrometry AAS as well as for [PO 4] and [F] using colorimetry. Calculations of solubility products were performed with the aid of computer program PHREEQC with modified MINTEQ thermodynamic database.

40|$|Phosphate is an {{essential}} element for life on Earth, and therefore if life exists or ever existed on Mars it may have required phosphate. Amorphous Al- and Fe-phosphates rapidly precipitate from acidic solutions and amorphous Al-phosphates likely control phosphate concentrations in some natural waters on Earth. Amorphous phases {{may be even more}} important on Mars than on Earth, and amorphous phosphates are therefore likely important in the phosphate cycle on Mars. Despite this importance, however, few dissolution rates exist for amorphous Al- and Fe- phosphates. In this study, dissolution rates of amorphous Al- and Fe-phosphates were measured in flow-through reactors from steady state concentrations of Al, Fe and P. A pH -dependent rate law was calculated from the dissolution rates log R = log k - npH, where Ri s the dissolution rate, k is intrinsic rate constant and n is the rate dependence on pH. For amorphous Al-phosphate, log k= - 6. 539 ± 1. 529, and n= 2. 391 ± 0. 493. For amorphous Fe-phosphate, log k= - 13. 031 ± 0. 558, and n= 1. 376 ± 0. 221. Amorphous Al-phosphate dissolves stoichiometrically under all conditions, and amorphous Fe-phosphate dissolves non-stoichiometrically, approaching <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>dissolution</b> as pH decreases, due potentially to Fe-oxides precipitating and armoring grain surfaces. Perhaps due to these effects, amorphous Al-phosphate dissolution rates are approximately three orders of magnitude faster than amorphous Fe-phosphate dissolution rates. Amorphous Al-phosphate dissolution rates measured in this study are also faster than published variscite dissolution rates. Dissolution rates of amorphous Al- and Fe-phosphates in this study therefore imply rapid phosphate release into acidic environments, suggesting phosphate mobility under Mars-relevant conditions...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) BACKGROUND Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that harder enamel with higher contents of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) and fluorine (F) coupled with lower contents of carbonate (C), magnesium (Mg) and nitrate (N) {{was found to be}} more resistant to demineralization. Additionally, the hardness of dental enamel was found to have a strong correlation with its chemical content. However, yet to be established is the relation between the physical and chemical structure of enamel and its response to de- and remineralizing conditions. OBJECTIVES The aims of this laboratory study were: 1) To investigate the hardness and chemical content of sound enamel and their influence on demineralization; 2) To investigate these properties in demineralized enamel and their influence on remineralization; and 3) To investigate these properties in sound enamel and their influence on remineralization. MATERIALS AND METHODS Incipient subsurface caries lesions were created in 94 bovine enamel specimens using Carbopol C 907 using three demineralization times. The specimens were then pH-cycled and treated using either 367 ppm F sodium fluoride or a placebo. Knoop surface microhardness (SMH), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Transverse microradiography (TMR) were performed on the specimens at all stages and compared between them. TMR variables included integrated mineral loss (ΔZ), Lesion depth (L) and maximum mineral density of the surface zone (SZmax). Data were analyzed using three- and four-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. RESULTS 	SMH, ΔZ, L and SZmax were significantly different among stages, demineralization times and treatment. The weight% of F at the surface was significantly affected by treatment, irrespective of demineralization time. A statistically significant moderate correlation was found between SZmax and ΔZ and SZmax and L after pH cycling. SMH also correlated weakly to moderately with TMR data. CONCLUSIONS SMH and SZmax decreased while ΔZ and L increased with increased demineralization time. Both fluoride and non-fluoride specimens were able to remineralize, which emphasizes the role of saliva in mineralization. The Ca:P ratio remained stable at various stages, indicating the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>dissolution</b> and redeposition of minerals. The greatest deposition of F was at the surface and its increase led to an increase in SMH and SZmax. SMH values showed that harder specimens at baseline and after demineralization remained hard after demineralization and pH-cycling, respectively, although this correlation was weak. Additionally, harder lesions showed less L and ΔZ and greater SZmax. RELEVANCE This in-vitro study will help better understand the caries process and the impact of physical and chemical characteristics of enamel on de- and remineralization challenges...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to develop and {{optimize}} chemical cleaning methods {{for the removal of}} sludge heels from High Level Waste tanks, solubility tests have been conducted using nonradioactive, pure metal phases. The metal phases studied included the aluminum phase gibbsite and the iron phases hematite, maghemite, goethite, lepidocrocite, magnetite, and wustite. Many of these mineral phases have been identified in radioactive, High Level Waste sludge at the Savannah River and Hanford Sites. Acids evaluated for dissolution included oxalic, nitric, and sulfuric acids {{and a variety of other}} complexing organic acids. The results of the solubility tests indicate that mixtures of oxalic acid with either nitric or sulfuric acid are the most effective cleaning solutions for the dissolution of the primary metal phases in sludge waste. Based on the results, optimized conditions for hematite dissolution in oxalic acid were selected using nitric or sulfuric acid as a supplemental proton source. Electrochemical corrosion studies were also conducted (reported separately; Wiersma, 2010) with oxalic/mineral acid mixtures to evaluate the effects of these solutions on waste tank integrity. The following specific conclusions can be drawn from the test results: (1) Oxalic acid was shown to be superior to all of the other organic acids evaluated in promoting the dissolution of the primary sludge phases. (2) All iron phases showed similar solubility trends in oxalic acid versus pH, with hematite exhibiting the lowest solubility and the slowest dissolution. (3) Greater than 90 % hematite dissolution occurred in oxalic/nitric acid mixtures within one week for two hematite sources and within three weeks for a third hematite sample with a larger average particle size. This dissolution rate appears acceptable for waste tank cleaning applications. (4) <b>Stoichiometric</b> <b>dissolution</b> of iron phases in oxalic acid (based on the oxalate concentration) and the formation of the preferred 1 : 1 Fe to oxalate complex is possible with the addition of a supplemental hydrogen ion source (HNO{sub 3 } or H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 }) and pH control. (5) Sulfuric acid is nearly twice as effective as nitric acid (on a molar basis) at promoting hematite dissolution in oxalic acid solutions, most likely due to the fact that it is diprotic. (6) The greater the oxalic acid concentration, the greater the demand for supplemental H{sup +} to promote optimal dissolution. Minimum mineral acid concentrations required for optimal oxalic acid utilization based on hematite solubility tests are provided. (7) Corrosion studies conducted (reported elsewhere) with 1 wt. % oxalic acid revealed that carbon steel corrosion rates are manageable at lower mineral acid concentrations (0. 1 M HNO{sub 3 } and 0. 05 M H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 }) and lower temperatures (45 C). (8) Proposed conditions for waste tank heel dissolution based on the solubility and corrosion test results are 0. 5 wt. % oxalic acid and 0. 18 M HNO{sub 3 } or 0. 09 M H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } at 50 C. (9) The OLI Thermodynamic Model appears to over-predict the solubility of the iron phases studied in oxalic acid and oxalic/nitric acid mixtures. The predictions show better agreement with experimental results at higher pH and in sulfuric/oxalic acid mixtures. (10) Oxalic, nitric, and sulfuric acids are effective at quickly dissolving gibbsite ({ge} 86 % dissolution in 2 weeks), with oxalic/sulfuric acid mixtures being particularly effective. (11) Limited dissolution tests conducted with carbon steel coupons revealed that the presence of metallic iron can, in some cases, result in dramatically different results. Additional studies in this area are recommended. Based on the current results, the optimal approach for the removal of sludge heels for HLW tanks would include the following steps: (1) removal of the maximum possible amount of heel materials by mechanical means; (2) neutralization and acidification of the heel using dilute mineral acid (This step should promote significant dissolution of certain metal hydroxides and salts, including gibbsite.); and (3) dissolution of the residual heel material at 50 C using an acid mixture containing 0. 5 wt. % oxalic acid and 0. 18 M nitric acid (This step should dissolve the iron phases. ...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Soils and sediments {{containing}} iron sulfides or {{the products}} of sulfide oxidation are known as acid sulfate soils (ASS). These soils possess significant environmental risks due to their potential capacity to produce copious amounts of sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) on their exposure to atmosphere. The accumulation of large deposits of sulfidic material has been identified in the past 10 to 12 years in saline-inland wetlands in Australia. Extended periods of natural as well as human-induced drying events {{in many of these}} wetlands have resulted in highly saline conditions (e. g. dominated by NaCl and sulfate containing salts) and the exposure (oxidation) of sulfidic material. The oxidation of sulfidic material results in the release of H 2 SO 4 and the precipitation of a range of secondary iron minerals (e. g. goethite, ferrihydrite, schwertmannite. Under highly acidic conditions (pH < 4) found in sulfuric material of the ASS, dissolution of layer silicates or phyllosilicate minerals is the only realistic process that can provide a long-term acid neutralisation in these soils; particularly in many Australian soils which have small quantities of weatherable primary minerals and carbonates. It is vital to investigate the mineralogical composition and dissolution mechanisms of layer silicates or phyllosilicate minerals existing in these ASS environments to develop effective management strategies for these soils. The dissolution rate of illite, a common phyllosilicate mineral in Australian soil, was determined using flow-through reactors at 25 ± 1 °C, in solutions with two different ionic strengths of 0. 25 M and 0. 01 M (maintained using NaCl), and pH ranging from 1 – 4. 25 (H 2 SO 4). The results from the illite dissolution experiments showed a rapid release of cations {{at the onset of the}} experiments and a relatively slower release at the steady state. Close to <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>dissolution</b> of illite was obtained at pH 1 – 4 in the higher ionic strength solutions and at pH 1 – 3 in the lower ionic strength solutions. The experiment at pH 4. 25 in the lower ionic strength solution exhibited RAl < RSi, resulting from a possible adsorption of dissolved Al on the illite surface. Illite dissolution rates showed strong pH dependence, with decreased dissolution rates with increasing pH. The proton reaction orders obtained for dissolution in the higher and lower ionic strength solutions were 0. 32 and 0. 36, respectively. From the relative cation release data, it was concluded that the dissolution of illite proceeded with the removal of interlayer K followed by the dissolution of octahedral cations, whereas the dissolution of Si was the rate limiting step in the dissolution process. The dissolution rate of illite, kaolinite and montmorillonite was compared in flow-through reactors at 25 ± 1 °C and at the two ionic strengths, as described earlier. Kaolinite dissolution rates were close to stoichiometric at pH 1 and 2 in the higher ionic strength solutions and at pH 1 – 4 in the lower ionic strength solutions. RAl values greater than RSi were obtained for kaolinite dissolution experiments at pH 3 and 4 in the higher ionic strength solutions. Kaolinite dissolution rates were strongly dependent on pH at pH ≤ 3, whereas kaolinite rates showed a little pH dependence at pH 3 – 4. 25, and the point of zero charge (PZC) of the mineral appears to have affected the dissolution rate at these pH values. Kaolinite dissolution rates at pH 1 and 2 (H 2 SO 4) in this study were greater than the previously reported rates in HCl and HClO 4 solutions, which was ascribed to the complexation of Al by sulfate ions in the solutions. For montmorillonite dissolution, RAl values greater than RSi were obtained in the higher ionic strength solutions at pH 1 – 4, whereas an opposite trend was observed in the lower ionic strength solutions at pH 2 – 4. A reduced RAl in the lower ionic strength solutions from montmorillonite dissolution resulted from (apparent) adsorption of dissolved Al on mineral exchange sites, possibly due to the availability of more interlayer exchange sites for Al re-adsorption and a decreased cation (Na+) competition for exchange sites in these systems. The dissolution rate of the clay fraction of soil cores from an inland ASS at Bottle Bend (BB) in south-western New South Wales (NSW, Australia) was determined under similar experimental conditions to pure minerals described earlier. Clay dissolution experiments were also conducted at 35 and 45 °C at pH 1 and 4 to determine the effect of temperature on dissolution rates. The clay sample comprised of smectite (40...|$|E
