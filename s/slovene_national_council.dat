2500|$|Faced {{with the}} {{challenges}} of Yugoslavism and Austro-Hungarian dissolution, Pittoni called {{for the creation of}} an independent Istrian state or a [...] "Republic of Venezia Giulia". It was to demand protection from the League of Nations, but Pittoni also spoke of other diplomatic alternatives, including an American or a Bolshevik occupation. In late 1918, as the <b>Slovene</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> prepared to assume control of the region, he publicized the manifesto of Emperor Charles, which proposed an Austrian confederation and a special role for Trieste. However, he faced increased opposition within the Trieste socialist movement from the Giuseppe Tuntar–Ivan Regent faction (which favoured an Italo-Slavic Soviet Republic) and from irredentist or [...] "socialist-nationalists" [...] such as Edmondo Puecher, who had organised the strike of January 1918. He responded by purging Il Lavoratore staff of suspected irredentists, including writer Bruno Piazza.|$|E
5000|$|Maister {{was born}} in the Upper Carniolan {{commercial}} town of Kamnik, then part of Austria-Hungary. A career soldier, during World War I, he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1917, he was sent to Graz promoted to the rank of a major. In 1918, {{near the end of the}} war when it was obvious that Austria-Hungary was losing, the city council of Maribor proclaimed the annexation of Maribor to Austria. Maister organized Slovene volunteer forces of 4000 soldiers and 200 officers and in the night of 23 November 1918 seized control of the city of Maribor and the surrounding region of Lower Styria. This date has been recognized as a state holiday in Slovenia since 2005. The <b>Slovene</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> for Lower Styria awarded him the rank of general on November 1. The German-speaking city was thus secured for the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which united with the Kingdom of Serbia into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on December 1. Maister's rank as a general was confirmed by the National Government of the Slovene part of the Kingdom as a [...] "lieutenant with the title and character of a general" [...] on 11 December 1918, which was later also confirmed by the Belgrade Government.|$|E

50|$|The {{anniversary of}} Prešeren's death first became a {{prominent}} date during World War II in 1941, when 7 February was celebrated {{as the day}} of all-Slavic unity. The proposal to celebrate 8 February as the Slovene cultural holiday was put forward in January 1945, during World War II, in Črnomelj by the Slovene Liberation Front's cultural worker Bogomil Gerlanc. It was officially proclaimed a cultural holiday with a decree passed by the Presidency of the <b>Slovene</b> <b>National</b> Liberation <b>Council</b> on 28 January 1945 and published in the Slovenski poročevalec newspaper on 1 February 1945. It remained a public holiday during {{the era of the}} Socialist Republic of Slovenia within the SFR Yugoslavia and was celebrated also by the Carinthian Slovenes and the Slovenes in Italy. It was marked with many cultural festivals and remembrances and with school excursions to culturally significant institutions.|$|R
50|$|In many ways, the {{folklore}} of Upper Carniola {{is considered}} the prototype of <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> folklore. The Upper Carniolan folk costume is frequently used as {{the representation of the}} <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> costume.In the mid 19th century, during the <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> revival, the <b>Slovene</b> <b>nationals</b> took the national costume from Bled and transformed it in the Slovenian national costume.Upper Carniola is also important for Slovene folklore because of the music. In the 1950s, the folk musician Slavko Avsenik popularized a modernized version of the Upper Carniolan folk music.|$|R

50|$|Slovenian <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (:Slovenski narodni svet) was {{the first}} {{executive}} council established in Slovenia, though it never became Slovenian parliament. The Council named on the 31. of October 1918 the first <b>slovene</b> <b>National</b> government (:Narodna vlada). Knight Josip Pogačnik was named as the first slovene prime minister in the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (SHS). The government, that had full organizational capabilities, took care of peace and order, economy, transport, education, food, science, culture and other public affairs. The Cabinet consisted of 12 departments called poverjeništva, that were led by representatives of all major Slovenian parties at the time. The government was active until 20. January 1919, when it was relieved by the new government of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in Belgrade.|$|R
50|$|Dežman {{began his}} {{political}} career in the <b>Slovene</b> <b>National</b> Movement, but in the mid-1850s, he became alienated from it, disenchanted with the conservatism and pragmatism of its leaders Janez Bleiweis and of Lovro Toman. Nevertheless, he was elected as a Slovene nationalist MP at the Austrian Parliament in 1861. He however did not join the <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> caucus, but joined the Bohemian federalists. He supported the peaceful coexistence of Slovene and German culture in the Slovene Lands. In 1862, Dežman's break with the <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> movement became manifest when he published a brochure entitled 'The German Culture in Carniola' (Das Deutschtum in Krain), in which he argued {{it is the duty}} of German culture to civilize and bring economic and political progress to Carniola, without Germanizing it.|$|R
50|$|In 1855, {{he moved}} to Ljubljana, where he opened a legal practice. He joined the <b>Slovene</b> <b>National</b> Movement, {{and became one of}} the leaders of its {{conservative}} stream. He was elected to the Carniolan Provincial Diet, and to the Austrian Imperial Council. Between 1864 and 1869, he served as the first Slovene nationalist mayor of Ljubljana; when he was elected in June 1864, the <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> flag was flown on the Ljubljana town hall. His mayorship was utterly unsuccessful, and helped to lay the path to the Austrian Centralist victory in the elections of 1869. After the late 1860s, Costa became one of the most unpopular <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> politicians, and the main target of criticism by the <b>national</b> liberal Young <b>Slovenes.</b>|$|R
