5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the <b>same</b> <b>reasons,</b> it is used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in Apple's PowerBook line).|$|E
5|$|According to Tino's account, {{on the day}} of the election, Selvo was {{attending}} mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, an island in the Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under construction at the time, but the new church was also spacious enough to hold a fairly large number of people. The location also proved ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very <b>same</b> <b>reasons.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze {{challenged the}} generic name Banksia L.f., {{on the grounds}} that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.serrata as Sirmuellera serrata. English botanist James Britten proposed the genus name Isostylis in 1905, and hence called it Isostylis serrata, for the <b>same</b> <b>reasons</b> as Kuntze. The challenges failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Like other primates, lemurs groom {{socially}} (allogroom) to ease {{tensions and}} solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, {{between mother and}} infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances. Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb. Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and for the <b>same</b> <b>reasons</b> as anthropoids.|$|E
5|$|Once {{it became}} clear that the {{locomotives}} would be used further afield than the West Country, a decision was made to name the remainder after RAF squadrons, airfields, commanders and aircraft that had participated in the Battle of Britain over Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 'Battle of Britain' nameplates incorporated the name of the locomotive with the class name below, in a design that resembled the wings of an aircraft. This was painted Air Force blue, though other colours were sometimes substituted for the <b>same</b> <b>reasons</b> as above. An enamelled crest of the aircraft, personality or squadron was placed below the nameplate, in the same position as the West Country class equivalent.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the mid-1950s, new car {{introductions}} in {{the fall}} once again became an anticipated event, as all dealers would reveal the models for the upcoming year each October. In this era before the popularization of computerization, {{the primary source of}} information on new models was the dealer. The idea was originally suggested in the 1930s by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, as a way of stimulating the economy by creating demand. The idea was reintroduced by President Dwight Eisenhower for the <b>same</b> <b>reasons,</b> and this method of introducing next year's models in the preceding autumn lasted well into the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The 1660 Restoration {{was popular}} in Scotland since it ended the Union and an {{expensive}} military occupation, although ironically it was welcomed in England for the <b>same</b> <b>reasons.</b> Scottish Parliamentary elections installed a Royalist majority which passed {{a series of}} acts giving greater power to the Crown, the most significant being the Rescissory Act of March 1661. This returned Scotland to the constitutional position of 1633, restoring the legal system and Parliament but imposing the Episcopalian structure on the Kirk rejected in 1638. Many were prepared to accept this since continuing divisions within the Presbyterian Kirk made it seem impossible they could create a unified church.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the <b>same</b> <b>reasons,</b> the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E

When informed by his commanding officer, Commander Kerr, of the intention to recommend him, Hichens requested that the recommendation be dropped as he now felt he had endangered two of the boats in the flotilla trying to rescue his friends. Kerr, respecting his views, dropped the recommendation, only {{for it to be}} resubmitted six weeks later after his death. The recommendation was endorsed by Commander Kerr, Admiral Lyon (the Commander-in-chief at Nore) and Rear Admiral Rogers (the Flag officer in charge at Harwich). The recommendation was rejected by the Admiralty, citing the <b>same</b> <b>reasons</b> Hichens had himself given.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, Adams {{was elected}} Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts {{and served in}} that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting {{governor}}. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, {{the first of four}} annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's Jeffersonian Republicans, who were opposed to the Federalist Party. Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 for the <b>same</b> <b>reasons</b> that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion. Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the Jay Treaty in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist. In that year's U. S. presidential election, Republicans in Virginia cast 15 electoral votes for Adams {{in an effort to make}} him Jefferson's vice-president, but Federalist John Adams won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice-president. The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the <b>same</b> <b>reasons</b> as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E

5|$|On 20 June, Company C, 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry (C/2-503) {{discovered}} {{the bodies of}} a Special Forces CIDG unit that had been missing for four days on Hill 1338, the dominant hill mass south of Dak To. Supported by A/2-503, the Americans moved {{up the hill and}} set up for the night. At 06:58 the following morning, Alpha Company began moving alone up a ridge finger and triggered an ambush by the 6th Battalion of the 24th PAVN Regiment. Charlie Company was ordered to support, but heavy vegetation and difficult terrain made movement extremely difficult. Artillery support was rendered ineffective by the limited range of visibility. Close air support was impossible for the <b>same</b> <b>reasons.</b> Alpha Company managed to survive repeated attacks throughout the day and night, but the cost was heavy. Of the 137 men that comprised the unit, 76 had been killed and another 23 wounded. A search of the battlefield revealed only 15 dead North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the <b>same</b> <b>reasons</b> as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
5|$|Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka {{flew from}} Tokyo on 5 April to Tokuyama {{in a final}} attempt to {{convince}} the assembled commanders of the Combined Fleet—including Admiral Itō—to accept the plan. Upon first hearing of the proposed operation (it had been kept secret from most of them), the Combined Fleet commanders and captains unanimously joined Admiral Itō in rejecting it for the <b>same</b> <b>reasons</b> that he had expressed. Admiral Kusaka then explained that the Navy's attack would help divert U.S. aircraft away from the Army's planned kamikaze attacks on the U.S. fleet at Okinawa. He also explained that Japan's national leadership, including the emperor, were expecting the Navy to make their best effort to support the defense of Okinawa.|$|E

5|$|Responding to Peng's {{concern over}} the troops' conditions, Mao limited {{the scope of the}} Third Phase Campaign to pin down the South Korean forces along the 38th {{parallel}} while inflicting as much damage as possible. Upon noticing that the US units were not interspersed between the South Korean formations, therefore unable to support the South Koreans, Mao ordered the PVA 13th Army to destroy the ROK 1st Infantry Division, the ROK 6th Infantry Division and the ROK III Corps. Following Mao's instruction, Peng placed the PVA 38th, 39th, 40th and 50th Corps of the 13th Army in front of the ROK 1st and 6th Infantry Division, while the 42nd and the 66th Corps of the 13th Army were moved into ROK III Corps' sector. The start date of the offensive was set to 31 December in order {{to take advantage of the}} night assault under a full moon and the anticipated low alertness of the UN soldiers during the holiday. For the <b>same</b> <b>reasons</b> Ridgway had predicted that 31 December would be the likely time for the new Chinese offensive. Believing that the destruction of the South Korean forces at the 38th parallel would render the UN forces incapable of counterattacks in the future, Mao promised to pull all Chinese troops off the front line for rest and refit by the end of the campaign.|$|E
