50|$|Strawberries are a high cost-high value crop {{with the}} {{economics}} supporting mechanisation. In 2005, picking and hauling costs were estimated at $594 per ton or 51% {{of the total}} grower cost. However, the delicate nature of fruit make it an unlikely candidate for mechanisation in the near future. A <b>strawberry</b> <b>harvester</b> developed by Shibuya Seiki and unveiled in Japan in 2013 is able to pick a strawberry every eight seconds. The robot identifies which strawberries are ready to pick by using three separate cameras and then once identified as ready, a mechanised arm snips the fruit free and gently places it in a basket. The robot moves on rails between the rows of strawberries which are generally contained within elevated greenhouses. The machine costs 5 million yen. A new <b>strawberry</b> <b>harvester</b> made by Agrobot that will harvest strawberries on raised, hydroponic beds using 60 robotic arms {{is expected to be}} released in 2016.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the development of}} a stationary robotic <b>strawberry</b> <b>harvester</b> that was combined with a movable bench system as part of {{the development of a}}n industrially production system for a strawberry in a plant factory. At first the difficulty of approaching target fruit was investigated using table-top plants cultured in a greenhouse. Then the maximum force needed to separate fruit from the peduncle was measured. Based on these results, an end-effector was designed with three unique functions; (1) suction cup was vibrated to minimize the influence of the adjoining fruits at the time of approach; (2) compressed air was blown toward the adjoining fruits to force them away from the target fruit; (3) peduncle was removed with the motion of tilting and pulling the target fruit. Next, an optical system to equip the machine with the ability to detect and determine the position and coloration of strawberry fruit was constructed. The position of the fruit was detected from below with a stereo-camera. The coloration measurement unit was set against the bed of the movable bench system at fruit level to capture images of target fruit. Considering the spectral reflectance characteristics of strawberry fruit, the coloration measurement unit was equipped with red, green, and white LEDs. Finally the stationary robot was tested in an experimental harvesting system in which the robot was combined with a movable bench unit. In the experiment system, the stationary robot enabled highly stable harvesting operation.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} state of the art and future {{perspective}} of greenhouse mechanization. Driving forces for mechanization are identified. Dutch greenhouse crop production is used as an example. Analysis of a generic crop production process combined with a review of {{the state of}} the art in greenhouse mechanization revealed that the first phases of plant production such as seeding, cutting, grafting and transplanting as well as the final phase of crop production including sorting and packing the harvested produce are mechanised. Those tasks do not require much human intelligence and/or fast and accurate eye-hand coordination. The available machines are largely based on principles of industrial automation consisting of mechanical solutions with only a limited amount of sensors and `intelligence¿ used. The next ten years, the available line of machines will be redesigned, extended and optimised. The middle phase of crop production including crop maintenance and harvest does not show much automation yet. Maintaining the crop and harvesting do rely on human intelligence and ability and are much more difficult to automate. The next ten years will show the advent of the next generation machines that will be based on the principles of mechatronics and robotics, combining smart mechanical design with sensors and `artificial intelligence¿ to achieve the fast and accurate eye-hand coordination needed for these difficult tasks. This trend is supported by the commercial development of a <b>strawberry</b> <b>harvester</b> in Japan and a rose harvesting robot and tomato de-leafing robot in the Netherlands. It is concluded that the slow progress in the field of robotic harvesting is to a large extent due to uncertainty in the working environment of the robot as a result of biological variability and the typical structure of the growing systems used. Progress in the field of greenhouse robotics therefore will not only rely on innovations in the field of robot technology but also on necessary innovations in the field of growing systems and plant breeding to reduce variability and thus to simplify the tas...|$|E

A diffracted red laser is used to project a straight horizontal line onto the bed, and is viewed by a video camera positioned at an angle to the laser. Using filtering techniques and the Hough transform, the distance to the bed can be calculated accurately at many points simultaneously, allowing the harverster's navigation system to determine both its position and angle relative to the bed.

40|$|Background: Although {{leptospirosis}} is a reemerging zoonosis {{of global}} importance, outbreaks related to agricultural exposures are primarily situated in tropical countries. In July 2007, a suspected leptospirosis outbreak was recognized among <b>strawberry</b> <b>harvesters</b> from Eastern Europe {{who were working}} in Germany. An investigation was initiated to identify the outbreak source and the risk factors for infection. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with use of a questionnaire administered to harvesters by health authorities in Romania, Slovakia, and Poland. Collected serum samples were tested by microscopic agglutination test and immunoglobulin M enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. A case patient {{was defined as a}} person who worked in the strawberry field during the period 5 June– 8 September 2007 and had leptospirosis‐compatible symptoms and either an antibody titer 1 : 800 and a positive immunoglobulin M enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay result (for a confirmed case) or no serological confirmation (for a suspected case). Local rodents were examined for leptospirosis. Results: Among 153 <b>strawberry</b> <b>harvesters,</b> we detected 13 confirmed case patients who had test results positive for antibodies against Leptospira species serogroup Grippotyphosa and 11 suspected case patients (attack rate, 16 %). Risk of disease increased with each day that an individual worked in the rain with hand wounds (odds ratio, 1. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 04 – 1. 14) and accidental rodent contact (odds ratio, 4. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 5 – 15. 9). Leptospires of the serogroup Grippotyphosa were isolated from the kidneys of 7 (64 %) of 11 voles. Conclusions: This is, to our knowledge, the largest leptospirosis epidemic to occur in Germany since the 1960 s. Contact between hand lesions and contaminated water or soil and infected voles was the most likely outbreak source. The unusually warm winter of 2006 – 2007 supported vole population growth and contributed to this resurgence of leptospirosis in Germany. Because of ongoing climate change, heightened awareness of leptospirosis in temperate regions is warranted...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of pesticides in California is commonly viewed as a significant public health concern. Exposure is particularly a concern for workers who use pesticides in agriculture or who are exposed to them during the harvesting of fruits and vegetables. Previous {{research has shown that}} direct dermal and clothing contact with foliar residues is primarily responsible for pesticide exposures among harvesters. These exposures occur primarily due to hand contact with treated leaf surfaces while picking the fruit. The overall objective of our research was to conduct detailed, systematic evaluations of <b>strawberry</b> <b>harvester</b> exposures for periods extending up to 3 weeks after the application of malathion, an organophosphate insecticide, and fenpropathrin, a pyrethroid insecticide. Since exposure occurs primarily through the workers' hands, we decided to also investigate the effectiveness of rubber latex gloves as sampling dosimeters to measure the transfer and dissipation of malathion and fenpropathrin. During the first phase of our studies, we conducted controlled field studies on turf using rubber latex gloves to define the factors that could influence the transfer of pesticides to the glove and that would affect their use as a residue monitoring device. We developed a novel sampling device called the Brinkman Contact Transfer Unit (BCTU) to study the glove characteristics and residue transfer and accumulation under controlled conditions on turf. A validation of the use of rubber latex gloves as a residue sampling dosimeter was performed by comparing pesticide transfer and dissipation from the gloves with the transferable turf residues sampled using the validated California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) roller, a standard measure of residue transfer. The observed correlation between the two methods were 0. 93 for malathion and 0. 87 for fenpropathrin, indicating that the BCTU is a useful surrogate tool for studying available residue transfer to rubber latex gloves under experimental conditions. In the second phase of our studies, we investigated the transfer of pesticide residues from foliage to strawberry harvesters under normal work conditions in the field. In addition, foliar residue dissipation from the leaves and gloves was measured using five independent sampling methods. Malathion and fenpropathrin residues, sampled by measuring dislodgeable foliar residues or the transfer of foliar residues to cotton cloth dosimeters, decayed by 90 % within 7 days after pesticide application. When harvesters picking fruit wore rubber latex gloves for food safety and hygiene reasons, the gloves accumulated pesticide residues. Within 7 days, the recovery of residues on the gloves decreased by 75 %. Though this decline is slightly slower than that seen with the foliar residues, both reached low stable levels. Quantitative measurements of end-of-shift harvester hand washes and 16 hour harvester urine samples were also collected from barehanded and gloved harvesters to study hand exposures and internal exposures as absorbed daily dosages, respectively. Hand wash residue levels decayed by 90 %, within 7 days after pesticide application, and less than 2 % of measured residues penetrated the latex gloves to reach the harvester hands. Based on these measures, the gloved harvesters had 45 % lower internal exposure than the barehanded harvesters, demonstrating that rubber latex gloves are a protective barrier to surface residues. Overall, the absorbed daily doses of malathion for barehanded and gloved harvesters were lower than 0. 005 mg/kg-day. However, the decline in excreted urine metabolites were only 43 % in gloved harvesters and 33 % in barehanded harvesters, which was slower and more prolonged than expected based on our observations from other sampling techniques. Our results indicate that there were likely other sources of exposure such as malathion breakdown products present on the foliar surfaces after the dissipation of malathion itself. This is consistent with recent studies that have shown that malathion degradation products are present for prolonged periods on foliar surfaces. Overall, our studies demonstrate that latex gloves can be useful as dosimeters of pesticide residues and show that malathion and fenpropathrin themselves dissipate relatively quickly from strawberry fields...|$|E
40|$|Hands are an {{important}} route of dermal exposure to agricultural pesticides during strawberry harvesting. Direct dosimeters that trap pesticide residues as they contact workers during harvesting may be valuable sources for estimates of exposure. Latex gloves as hand dosimeters have been evaluated in two settings: 1) commercial strawberry farms, and, 2) controlled studies using a surrogate contact transfer device and malathion-treated turf. 	With the assistance of field operators from a commercial <b>strawberry</b> farm, <b>harvester</b> glove samples were collected and obtained via overnight shipping for extraction and analysis of pesticide residues. Harvester gloves accumulated multiple pesticide residues during normal work periods (2 to 2. 5 h). Thirteen different pesticide active ingredients were found on harvester gloves at different times. Pesticide residues can accumulate on rubber latex gloves up to ~ 20 mg/pair by intermittent contact during normal work. 	To evaluate the accumulation of surface pesticide residues on light rubber latex gloves, a surrogate model system, the Brinkman Contact Transfer Unit (BCTU), was developed. The BCTU consisted of latex gloves fitted on mannequin hands mounted in a wheeled chassis that could be pushed across a grid of treated turf. Using the BCTU on malathion-treated turf (2 lbs/A), residues accumulated on gloves (0. 14 - 398 µg/glove) over a 13 d study period. Turf residues dissipated biphasically over 13 d and the malathion first-order half-life was 1. 4 d. The percent transferred and recovered residue from treated turf to a gloved mannequin hand (assuming 420 cm 2 surface area) ranged from < 1 % to 10 % based on measurements of deposition applied to turf. Concurrent applications of malathion and fenpropathrin (data not shown) to turf showed that gloves can accumulate multiple pesticide residues. 	Transferable turf residues (TTRs) were also measured using the CDFA (California) roller and cotton cloth dosimeters. Residues accumulated on cotton cloths ranged from 0. 002 - 0. 117 µg /cm 2 for days 1 through 13. When PGRs (µg/glove) were plotted {{as a function of}} TTRs (µg/cm 2), a strong linear regression correlation was observed (R 2 = 0. 5 - 1. 0) and an empirical transfer factor of 1548 cm 2 /glove was derived from the slope...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{harvesting}} {{of strawberries}} {{has been at}} the experimental stage since the early l 960 's, but has not attained any commercial success until recently. One of the main problems has been that the strawberries ripen successively during a couple of weeks, and that most harvesters are based on the once-over principle. This results in a decrease in yield {{at the same time as}} a relatively large quantity of green strawberries is harvested. It has frequently been considered profitable to hand-pick the first large berries and then harvest mechanically about one week later. Another approach frequently used by growers is to hand-pick several times and then harvest the remaining berries by machine. When a late harvesting of this kind is carried out, there are very few berries left, many of which are over-ripe or have not been picked because they are mouldy. In such a situation there are not only too few berries to pay for the machine-costs, but r also the berries are of such poor quality that extensive sorting is needed before they can be used. This type of mechanical harvesting has been found very unprofitable. The early trials are all centered on harvesting in normal row crops. During he l 960 's, prototype harvesters were developed at several universities in the USA and in Canada. All prototypes worked on the principle of stripping the berries from the plant. Fingers made of plastic or metal, placed at suitable intervals, combed through the plant and removed the strawberries. Tests were made of stripping forwards, backwards, and sideways, etc. Almost all possible approaches have been tested. Similar machines have been constructed also in Holland, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Denmark. The Danish machine is only a couple of years old, and this harvesting method is being tested actively in Denmark. One of the large problems with the stripping <b>strawberry</b> <b>harvesters</b> is their low capacity. Driving speeds are normally only 300 - 400 metres per hour. In order to be able to drive faster, the fingers which strip off the berries must also move faster, and then the number of berries thrown out and lost increases. Another problem is that the runners easily become entangled in the fingers and are pulled off, thus hindering the harvesting. In the late l 960 's, harvesters working on the principle of cutting off the entire plant started to appear. This method was developed simultaneously by the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering (NIAE) in England, and by growers and universities in Oregon, USA. The fundamental principle is as follows: strawberries and leaves are located on different stems, and if the plant is cut off close to the soil, the berries and leaves can be separated by blowing away the leaves and other light material. This harvesting method allows a considerable increase in the driving speed. Similar harvesters are being (or have been) developed also in Canada, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Other methods than the two described above have been tested: vibrating the stems of the plants, causing the ripe strawberries to fall off, for example; or lifting the berries with a net laid out on the ground in the spring. Whatever method is used, it has become apparent that growing technique must be modified if harvesting is to be carried out satisfactorily. There is probably no existing field that can be successfully harvested mechanically without modifications. In some cases, harvest-efficiency has been increased from 50 to 90 %, simply by removing stones etc. and levelling out the beds. It became apparent that one of the largest problems is the lifting of the berries from the soil so they can be harvested. A large number of the berries lie on the outer edge of the row. Also, if the soil between the rows has been compressed by tractor wheels, this worsens matters. Great efforts have been made to breed varieties with an erect growth habit, but with little success. Various solutions have been tried for lifting the berries from the soil, different types of brushes and reels, for example. Fingers which comb through the plant (similar to the crop-lifter on a combine-harvester) are commonly used on the cutting harvesters. Air has also been used, both as a negative pressure (the vacuum cleaner principle) and by blowing compressed air from the sides of the row. Most of these methods have caused undesirable damage to the berries. Another problem with harvesting strawberries cultivated in rows, is the varying degrees of ripeness due to uneven exposure to sunlight. Berries on the outside of the rows ripen 3 - 4 days earlier than those in the middle. It is therefore difficult to find the optimum time of harvesting, with the maximum of ripe berries, but without any being over-ripe. A complete system of cultivation, of which the harvester is an integrated part, has been developed by Michigan State University in the USA. In this system, the strawberries are grown in a field without rows, thus covering the entire field. This solves a number of problems encountered in row-cropping. The increased number of plants (the aim is to have 150 established crowns per square metre in a fully-grown population) results in the straw-berries being raised higher from the soil, since the stems support the fruit. Moreover, the ripening is more uniform when all the berries are shaded beneath the foliage. Another important advantage is that the yield, according to American results, is twice as high as that obtained in the conventional row system. The rows cover only 40 % of the field as opposed to the 100 % coverage with the new system. This also means that the harvester doubles its capacity at the same driving speed and cutting width. Also, in the USA there are fewer problems with diseases as the berries do not lie directly on the soil. The fields are harvested with a machine developed at Michigan State University which cuts off the plant very close to the soil, preferably closer than 2 cm from the ground. To make this possible, it is vital that the field be absolutely level. The harvest is facilitated by crop-lifters which lift up the berries, and a reel which also lifts up the berries in front of the cutter bar, and feeds them into the harvester. Conveyors transport the straw-berries backwards into the machine, where they fall onto a grid conveyor. As they fall, they pass through a powerful current of air which blows away leaves and other light material. The grid conveyor transports the berries over two more fans which blow air from below, and raise the stems while the berries remain on the grid. A double-sickle shortens the stems to 3 - 4 cm. Bunches of berries are thus separated, giving individual berries with short stems. These fall onto a conveyor which transports them sideways out to storage boxes. Under normal conditions, the harvester has a capacity of approximately 2 tonnes per hour, and can harvest one hectare in approximately 6 - 8 hours. The harvesting efficiency is frequently higher than 90 %. This figure can be compared with manual harvesting, where efficiency is often as low as 75 %, ie one fourth of the strawberries are left in the field. Irrespective of whether the harvesting is done by stripping or by cutting, the berries must undergo further treatment before they can be frozen or processed in a factory. The harvester which gives the cleanest product is probably the one developed by Michigan State University. When these strawberries are to be used for making puree, for example, they can simply be tipped from the boxes into a tank of water for washing, after which all mouldy fruit is removed manually from an inspection belt. The remainder is fed into a puree-press. If the berries are to be IQF-frozen, a product which has a higher price, and probably also a wider market, both stem and cap must be removed. This can be done in a decapping machine. There are different types of decappers, one of which uses counter-rotating rubber rollers. When the stem is caught between two rollers, it is pulled off. On most varieties of strawberries the cap remains on the berries and they cannot be used for jam, for example. Another type of decapper has been developed at Michigan State University. This uses a conveyor with a number of smooth plastic-covered, counter-rotating rollers. When the stem is caught between two rollers it is held in place and transported past a band knife (a band saw without teeth) which cuts off the stem and cap. The capped berries can then be IQF-frozen, or used in making, for example, jam...|$|R
