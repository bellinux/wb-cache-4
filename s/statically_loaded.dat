In this study, static and dynamic loads were applied on 10 mm long implants (Brånemark System, Nobel Biocare, Sweden) installed bicortically in rabbit tibiae to investigate the bone response. Each of 10 adult New Zealand black rabbits had one <b>statically</b> <b>loaded</b> implant (with a transverse force of 29. 4 N applied on a distance of 1. 5 mm {{from the top of}} the implant, resulting in a bending moment of 4. 4 Ncm), one dynamically loaded implant (with a transverse force of 14. 7 N applied on a distance of 50 mm {{from the top of the}} implant, resulting in a bending moment of 73. 5 Ncm, 2. 520 cycles in total, applied with a frequency of 1 Hz), and one unloaded control implant. The loading was performed during 14 days. A numerical model was used as a guideline for the applied dynamic load. Histomorphometrical quantifications of the bone to metal contact area and bone density lateral to the implant were performed on undecalcified and toluidine blue stained sections. The histological picture was similar for <b>statically</b> <b>loaded</b> and control implants. Dense cortical lamellar bone was present around the marginal and apical part of the latter implants with no signs of bone loss. Crater-shaped bone defects and Howship's lacunae were explicit signs of bone resorption in the marginal bone area around the dynamically loaded implants. Despite those bone defects, bone islands were present in contact with the implant surface in this marginal area. This resulted in no significantly lower bone-to-implant contact around the dynamically loaded implants in comparison with the <b>statically</b> <b>loaded</b> and the control implants. However, when comparing the amount of bone in the immediate surroundings of the marginal part of the implants, significantly (P < 0. 007) less bone volume (density) was present around the dynamically loaded in comparison with the <b>statically</b> <b>loaded</b> and the control implants.

This uncertainty will make any evaluation or prescription of lower-limb prosthesis technology based upon their stiffness incorrect. In addition, the peak calculated stiffness at the expected bodyweight induced ground impact load of a runner is judged the most representative assessment method.

GLB is applicable both to problems that are easily load-balanced via static scheduling and to problems that are hard to <b>statically</b> <b>load</b> balance. GLB hides the intricate syn- chronizations (e. g., inter-node communication, initialization and startup, load balancing, termination and result collection) from the users. GLB internally uses a version of the lifeline graph based work-stealing algorithm proposed by Saraswat et al. Users of GLB are simply required to write several pieces of sequential code that comply with the GLB interface. GLB then schedules and orchestrates the parallel execution of the code correctly and efficiently at scale. We have applied GLB to two representative benchmarks: Betweenness Centrality (BC) and Unbalanced Tree Search (UTS). Among them, BC can be statically load-balanced whereas UTS cannot.

40|$|The {{construction}} of cofferdams to protect building pits nearby rivers against high water dis-charges {{is part of}} the history in development of geotechnical engineering. Today cofferdams with a total height up to 25 m and a width up to 30 m and more are to be built as a part of quaywalls in modern marine terminals for bulk-goods and containers. The calculation methods for this high specialised constructions are world wide very different. The goal of all calculations is to minimize the dimensions and in consequence of this the costs of the quay wall. German geotechnical engineers normally use the method of JELINEK which is proposed in the recommendation R 100 of the EAU 1990. Applying this recommendation for the planning of a sea-lock for ocean-going vessels up to 150, 000 dwt it was found out that there are some differences in calculation between cofferdams used as protection elements against flood levels and cofferdams used as quay walls with a very complexe load of different dynamic influences of several live loads and water-pressure at one side and bulkhead weight, passive earth pressure and the support body as <b>statically</b> <b>load</b> on the other side. The comparison of the results for some cofferdam cross-sections of the improved JELINEK-method by using the diagrams with the results, won by using other calculation methods are sufficient. So the found out method for cofferdam calculation can be generally recommended to geotechnical engineers. At last a comparison is given about needed steel for sheet-piles and surface to be driven into the subsoil under the future dredging level for cellular cofferdams and double-wall cofferdams.
