5|$|Neutering or <b>spaying,</b> which {{involves}} removing {{some of the}} reproductive organs, is often carried out {{as a method of}} birth control in household pets. Many animal shelters require these procedures as part of adoption agreements. In large animals the surgery is known as castration.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spaying</b> or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found neutered male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|E

2500|$|The exact {{causes for}} the {{development}} of canine mammary tumors are not fully understood. However, hormones of the estrous cycle seem to be involved. Female dogs who are not <b>spayed</b> or who are <b>spayed</b> later than the first heat cycle are more likely to develop mammary tumors. Dogs have an overall reported incidence of mammary tumors of 3.4 percent. Dogs <b>spayed</b> before their first heat have 0.5 percent of this risk, and dogs <b>spayed</b> after just one heat cycle have 8 percent of this risk. The tumors are often multiple. The average age of dogs with mammary tumors is ten to eleven years old. Obesity at one year of age and eating red meat have also been associated with an increased risk for these tumors, as has the feeding of high fat homemade diets.|$|R
25|$|Surgical removal is the {{treatment}} of choice, but chest x-rays should be taken first to rule out metastasis. Removal should be with wide margins to prevent recurrence, taking the whole mammary gland if necessary. Because 40 to 50 percent of dog mammary tumors have estrogen receptors, <b>spaying</b> is recommended by many veterinarians. A recent study showed a better prognosis in dogs that are spayed {{at the time of}} surgery or that had been recently spayed. However, several other studies found no improvement of disease outcome when <b>spaying</b> was performed after the tumor had developed. Chemotherapy is rarely used.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{essential}} for a female dog to either experience a heat cycle or have puppies before <b>spaying,</b> and likewise, a male dog does not need the experience of mating before neutering.|$|E

25|$|<b>Spaying</b> and castrating {{cats and}} dogs may {{increase}} the risk of obesity if nutritional intake is not reduced to reflect the lower metabolic requirements of neutered animals. In cats, a decrease in sex hormone levels seems to be associated with an increase in food intake. In dogs, the effects of neutering as a risk factor for obesity vary between breeds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spaying</b> (females only) and neutering (both genders {{but more}} {{commonly}} males) {{refers to the}} sterilization of animals, usually by removal of the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability to procreate, and reduce sex drive.

25|$|Early-age neutering, {{also known}} as {{pediatric}} <b>spaying</b> or prepubertal gonadectomy, is {{the removal of the}} ovaries or testes before the onset of puberty. It is used mainly in animal sheltering and rescue where puppies and kittens can be neutered before being adopted out, eliminating non-compliance with sterilization agreement, which is typically above 40%. The American Veterinary Medical Association, American Animal Hospital Association and the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association support the procedure for population control, provided that the veterinarian uses his/her best knowledge when making the decision about the age at neutering.|$|E
25|$|Stump {{pyometra}} is {{a serious}} health condition that may occur in female dogs that underwent ovariohysterectomy (<b>spaying),</b> particularly if there is residual functional ovarian tissue. In this condition, the remaining stump of the resected uterus becomes infected and filled with a purulent fluid. The symptoms {{are similar to those}} of true pyometra. The risk of this condition is significantly reduced if no ovarian tissue remains from the original ovariohysterectomy. Diagnosis of a stump pyometra may be challenging as pyometra is often discounted as a possibility if the dog has been previously spayed.|$|E
25|$|A mammary tumor is a {{neoplasm}} {{originating in}} the mammary gland. It is a common finding in older female dogs and cats that are not spayed, but they are found in other animals as well. The mammary glands in dogs and cats are associated with their nipples and extend from {{the underside of the}} chest to the groin {{on both sides of the}} midline. There are many differences between mammary tumors in animals and breast cancer in humans, including tumor type, malignancy, and treatment options. The prevalence in dogs is about three times that of women. In dogs, mammary tumors are the second most common tumor (after skin tumors) over all and the most common tumor in female dogs with a reported incidence of 3.4%. Multiple studies have documented that <b>spaying</b> female dogs when young greatly decreases their risk of developing mammary neoplasia when aged. Compared with female dogs left intact, those spayed before puberty have 0.5% of the risk, those spayed after one estrous cycle have 8.0% of the risk, and dogs spayed after two estrous cycles have 26.0% of the risk of developing mammary neoplasia later in life. Overall, unspayed female dogs have a seven times greater risk of developing mammary neoplasia than do those that are spayed. While the benefit of <b>spaying</b> decreases with each estrous cycle, some benefit has been demonstrated in female dogs even up to 9 years of age. There is a much lower risk (about 1 percent) in male dogs and a risk in cats about half that of dogs.|$|E

25|$|In June 1999, the Iriomote Wildlife Protection Center {{conducted}} an investigation among 50 house and feral cats and 23 Iriomote cats {{in order to}} see if FIV was being transmitted within the populations. FIV was not seen in any of the Iriomote cats, but three of the house and feral cats tested positive. Because of the fears regarding transmission of the disease, starting in 2001 Taketomi Town enacted the Cat Breeding Ordinance which required all residents to register their pet cats. In June 2008, the ordinance was revised to include mandatory FIV testing and vaccinations, <b>spaying</b> and neutering, and microchipping. A new limit to the number of pets allowed per owner was also added.|$|E
25|$|Trap-neuter-return (TNR) {{involves}} trapping feral cats, <b>spaying</b> or neutering them, {{and then}} returning {{them to the}} place where there were originally trapped. When neutered, the cats receive vaccinations against rabies and other medical care, such as dental care and parasite treatment. TNR programs are prevalent in several countries, including England, Italy, Canada, and the United States, supported by many local and state governments. Various long-term studies have shown that TNR is effective in stopping reproduction and reducing the population over time. TNR results in fewer complaints, as nuisance behaviors diminish following neutering, and {{the quality of life of}} the cats is improved. The practice is reported to save money and garner more public support and better morale than efforts that involve killing cats.|$|E
25|$|Acromegaly (also {{known as}} hypersomatotropism) is a {{hormonal}} condition resulting from over-secretion {{of the growth}} hormone somatotropin from the pituitary gland. The hormone is responsible for growth from birth to adulthood. Normally in adulthood, the growth plates of the bones close and the secretion of the hormone slows considerably. Because the bone plates close when entering maturity, the continued growth of acromegaly is not of normal proportions. Most dogs with the disease are unspayed females, but the condition can come about with use of medications containing progesterone. Acromegaly patients often also have diabetes mellitus. There is a transient form of acromegaly which can affect females at the diestrus portion of the reproductive cycle. This condition is {{brought about by the}} mammary glands excreting excess growth hormone, which is triggered by progesterone from the ovaries. As with non-transient acromegaly, <b>spaying</b> is necessary. The symptoms can include overgrowth or enlargement of gums with wide spaces between teeth, increased drinking, increased urination, thickening of the skin and skin folds, enlargement of the tongue and excessive panting. Acromegaly is also possible from a somatotroph adenoma. The hormone somatostatin can also be useful in treatment. Since hypothyroidism is connected with the release of excess growth hormone, hypothyroidism can be mistaken for acromegaly.|$|E
