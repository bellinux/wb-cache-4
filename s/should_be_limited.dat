5|$|As part of Strasburg's {{rehabilitation}} {{from his}} Tommy John surgery, {{and as a}} precaution due to his low innings total in 2011, the Nationals decided {{to limit the number}} of innings Strasburg would throw in the 2012 season. Although the number was never official, rumors started that Strasburg's limit would be between 160 and 180 innings. It was also decided that Strasburg's shutdown would be final; he would not pitch in the playoffs. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the surgeon who operated on Strasburg's elbow, agreed in 2011 that Strasburg's 2012 innings total <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited,</b> although he did not consult with Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo or Strasburg during the season. Teammate Jordan Zimmermann underwent a similar process the year before.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes trace fossils {{have been}} {{referred}} to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus Megalosauripus. In 1997, a famous group of fossilised footprints (ichnites) {{was found in a}} limestone quarry at Ardley, twenty kilometres northeast of Oxford. They were thought to have been made by Megalosaurus and possibly also some left by Cetiosaurus. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the lawn of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. One track was of a theropod accelerating from walking to running. According to Benson, such referrals are unprovable, as the tracks show no traits unique to Megalosaurus. Certainly they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to finds that are of the same age as Megalosaurus bucklandii.|$|E
5|$|At {{the meeting}} with Roosevelt on October 9, 1941, Bush {{advocated}} cooperating with the United Kingdom, and he began corresponding with his British counterpart, Sir John Anderson. But by October 1942, Conant and Bush agreed that a joint project would pose security risks and be more complicated to manage. Roosevelt approved a Military Policy Committee recommendation stating that information given to the British <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to technologies that they were actively working on and should not extend to post-war developments. In July 1943, {{on a visit to}} London to learn about British progress on antisubmarine technology, Bush, Stimson and Bundy met with Anderson, Lord Cherwell and Winston Churchill at 10 Downing Street. At the meeting, Churchill forcefully pressed for a renewal of interchange, while Bush defended current policy. Only when he returned to Washington did he discover that Roosevelt had agreed with the British. The Quebec Agreement merged the two atomic bomb projects, creating the Combined Policy Committee with Stimson, Bush and Conant as United States representatives.|$|E

25|$|People with A-T have an {{increased}} sensitivity to ionizing radiation (X-rays and gamma rays). Therefore, X-ray exposure <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to times when it is medically necessary, as exposing an A-T patient to ionizing radiation can damage cells {{in such a way}} that the body cannot repair them. The cells can cope normally with other forms of radiation, such as ultraviolet light, so there is no need for special precautions from sunlight exposure.|$|E
25|$|Sucrose can {{contribute}} to the development of metabolic syndrome. In an experiment with rats that were fed a diet one-third of which was sucrose, the sucrose first elevated blood levels of triglycerides, which induced visceral fat and ultimately resulted in insulin resistance. Another study found that rats fed sucrose-rich diets developed high triglycerides, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. A 2004 study recommended that the consumption of sucrose-containing drinks <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> due to the growing number of people with obesity and insulin resistance.|$|E
25|$|Charge {{generation}} increases {{at higher}} fluid velocities and larger pipe diameters, becoming quite significant in pipes 8inches (200mm) or larger. Static charge generation in these systems is best controlled by limiting fluid velocity. The British standard BS PD CLC/TR 50404:2003 (formerly BS-5958-Part 2) Code of Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity prescribes pipe flow velocity limits. Because water content {{has a large}} impact on the fluids dielectric constant, the recommended velocity for hydrocarbon fluids containing water <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to 1 meter per second.|$|E

Preventive care is the best method of preserving human remains in the long term, as active conservation work <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> both by conservators' policy to interfere as little as possible and the beliefs of many indigenous tribes and groups who disapprove of altering human remains.|$|E
25|$|Tree {{metabolic}} energy harvesting {{is a type}} of bio-energy harvesting. Voltree has developed a method for harvesting energy from trees. These energy harvesters are being used to power remote sensors and mesh networks as the basis for a long term deployment system to monitor forest fires and weather in the forest. Their website says that the useful life of such a device <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> only by the lifetime of the tree to which it is attached.

Abortion <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to serious cases where the birth would cause serious danger or suffering either to the family or the child. Such cases should be defined in legislation, which is the case in Finland. However, the woman pondering abortion should get all possible support before and after the decision, regardless of its outcome.|$|E
