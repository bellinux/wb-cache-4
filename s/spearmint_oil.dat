40|$|Black spot {{caused by}} the fungus Diplocarpon rosea Wolf. is the most {{widespread}} disease in ornamental roses. Frequent applications of environmentally non-benign chemical fungicides are necessary to effectively prevent and control this disease. Ecological and environmental concerns about frequent fungicide applications are growing, and public demand for safer alternatives to fungicides is increasing. This study evaluated water extracts and essential oils from holy basil (Ocimum gratissimum L.), sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), English thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), and ‘Scotch’ spearmint (Mentha x gracilis Sole) for suppression and control of black spot disease in roses as compared with a commonly used fungicide. The results revealed that weekly treatments with essential <b>oils</b> of ‘Scotch’ <b>spearmint</b> and English thyme produced significantly lower black spot rating as compared with a water control, and the fungicide treatment had lower black spot rating than all treatments, except the ‘Scotch’ <b>spearmint</b> essential <b>oil</b> and the English thyme essential oil. Our results demonstrate that essential oils of English thyme and ‘Scotch’ spearmint hold promise as biopesticides for control of black spot on roses {{as an alternative to}} chemical fungicides.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityThis study {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} water stress levels on the yield, quality, water use efficiency and grower returns of drip irrigated native spearmint and four subsurface drip irrigated hop cultivars: Mt. Hood, Columbus, Chinook and Willamette. For native spearmint, stress levels were applied at different times during the growing periods. For hops, each stress level was applied throughout the growing season. The field experiments were carried out for two years at the Washington State University Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Prosser WA. Mint results showed that biomass production decreased with increasing water stress as is expected. However, mint oil yield and quality {{were not significantly different}} across treatments. This suggests that deficit irrigating native <b>spearmint</b> might enhance <b>oil</b> accumulation. This is further supported by the observed increase in oil concentration as water stress increased. A number of mint production costs were affected by the reduction in applied water thus reducing the total mint production costs. Since oil yields were similar across treatments, revenues were not significantly affected. This resulted into increase in net farm income. Also, water stress improved the water use efficiency in native spearmint. Hop results showed that the dried hop cone yield decreased with increasing water stress in all the cultivars. The hop cone quality however did not change significantly across treatments. In the full year of production, water stress improved water use efficiency in hop production across all the cultivars. In the Yakima Valley, reduction in amount of water applied only affects the cost of pumping of the irrigation water which is minimal when compared to the total cost of producing hops. The yield reductions due to applying less water to hops caused reductions in revenues that were higher than the savings in the cost of producing hops due to pumping less water. This decreased the net farm income. The study observed how the subsurface drip irrigation system coupled with scientific irrigation scheduling can substantially reduce hop water use. This study also provides production functions for irrigation optimization of native spearmint and four hop cultivars. Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State Universit...|$|R
