2500|$|The goal of clock tree {{synthesis}} (CTS) is {{to minimize}} skew and insertion delay. Clock is not propagated before CTS {{as shown in the}} picture. After CTS hold slack should improve. Clock tree begins at [...]sdc defined clock source and ends at <b>stop</b> <b>pins</b> of flop. There are two types of <b>stop</b> <b>pins</b> known as ignore pins and sync pins. ‘Don’t touch’ circuits and pins in front end (logic synthesis) are treated as ‘ignore’ circuits or pins at back end (physical synthesis). ‘Ignore’ pins are ignored for timing analysis. If clock is divided then separate skew analysis is necessary.|$|R

25|$|In {{the lock}} back, {{as in many}} folding knives, a <b>stop</b> <b>pin</b> acting on the top (or behind) the blade {{prevents}} it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a torsion bar.

50|$|Most {{feathering}} {{systems for}} reciprocating engines sense {{a drop in}} oil pressure and move the blades toward the feather position, and require the pilot to pull the propeller control back to disengage the high-pitch <b>stop</b> <b>pins</b> before the engine reaches idle RPM. Turboprop control systems usually utilize a negative torque sensor in the reduction gearbox which moves the blades toward feather when the engine is no longer providing power to the propeller. Depending on design, the pilot may have to push a button to override the high-pitch stops and complete the feathering process, or the feathering process may be totally automatic.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a new wide-range digital speed measurement method with jitter removal technique {{and using the}} direct memory access (DMA) terminal count register (TCR). Our work also supports a multi node interfacing from different measure ends. The multiple measure ends are interfaced with DMA channels through pipelines to improve hit ratio. Here hit ratio indicates the exact identification of encoder pulses without any fail or miss. But the conventional pipeline system is facing problems due to improper synchronization of clock pulses. This is a universal problem in all the digital systems mostly called jitter or skew. Here a new system is implemented {{in the path of}} the clock to remove or reduce the clock skew. The jitter is also introduced in the pipeline due to different clock paths to the parallel pipelines. While one pipeline access the encoder pulses the remaining pipelines remain in idle state as single clock pulse is used to fed encoder pulses. And it creates a big challenge if multiple clock pulses are given to individual pipeline systems. This can be overcome using parallel ports as clock signals. The DMA method is based on both pulses counting in the constant sampling time at terminal count <b>stop</b> <b>pin</b> of a DMA controller. The hardware configuration and algorithms for a microcontroller implementation are also presented. The proposed method is suitable in systems using microcontrollers with DMA controller and timers. Limitations and sources of errors are discussed in details. The DMA Terminal count register method is suitable for real-time speed control systems. ...|$|R

50|$|In outline, Federation and Empire {{is fairly}} typical {{for a grand}} {{strategy}} game. Players take alternating turns, managing the resources of their side to build ships and defenses, and maneuver their ships (or fleets) to attack the enemy and then resolve the resulting combats; his opponent then does the same on his turn. In detail, {{it is a bit}} more sophisticated. During movement enemy ships can react a short distance onto moving ships. There are rules for the interaction of these forces, which may force {{some or all of the}} moving ships to <b>stop,</b> being <b>pinned</b> by the reacting enemy. After movement, the non-moving player can also move a few limited reserves of ships to battles so as to shore up the defense of critical points. After combat, the moving player retrogrades or moves ships that were in combat back to source of supply or repair, and finally moves a limited number of ships vast distances to prepare for the coming enemy turn.|$|R

50|$|Two-piece plain {{bearings}}, {{known as}} full bearings in industrial machinery, {{are commonly used}} for larger diameters, such as crankshaft bearings. The two halves are called shells.

For large, thick shells a button <b>stop</b> or dowel <b>pin</b> is used. The button stop is screwed to the housing, while the dowel pin keys the two shells together. Another less common method uses a dowel pin that keys the shell to the housing through a hole or slot in the shell.|$|R
