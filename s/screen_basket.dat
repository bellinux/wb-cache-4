50|$|Screen scroll {{centrifuge}} is a filtering centrifuge which separates solids {{and liquid}} from a solid-liquid mixture. This type of centrifuge {{is commonly used}} with a continuous process in which slurry containing both solid and liquid is continuously fed into and continuously discharged from the centrifuge. In a typical screen scroll centrifuge, the basic principle is that entering feed is separated into liquid and solids as two products. The feed is transported from small to larger diameter end of frustoconical basket by the inclination of the <b>screen</b> <b>basket</b> and slightly different speed of the scraper worm. The solid material retained on the screen is moved along the cone via an internal screw conveyor while the liquid output is obtained due to centrifugal force causes the feed slurry {{to pass through the}} screen openings. Furthermore, screen scroll centrifuge may rotate either in horizontal or vertical position.|$|E
40|$|Impurities in {{harvested}} stumps are {{a quality}} problem because {{high levels of}} mineral contaminants decrease the effective heating value of the stump wood, and can also affect ash melting behaviour during combustion, leading to sintering and drift problems. The aim of this case study was to clarify the productivity and screening efficiency of the Kompetech Crambo 6000 low-speed double-shaft grinder equipped with a Komptech star screen, in the integrated grinding and screening of Norway spruce and Scots pine stumps for fuel at a roadside landing, when using two different sieve sizes (250 x 320 mm and 180 x 180 mm screen baskets). Furthermore, we studied the fuel consumption of the Crambo 6000 grinder, ash content and particle size distribution of ground stump wood, and ash content and particle size distribution of the screening reject. In addition, the heating value of the produced hog fuel and screening reject were analysed. During {{the time of the}} studies, both the grinder and star screen were operating well and there were no delays due to machine breakdowns. The mobile Crambo 6000 grinder was also capable of operating well in constricted roadside landings. The quality of the produced hog fuel was high, due to low ash content (0. 4 – 2. 3 %), and this highlights the significance of screening to guarantee sufficient quality when processing stump fuel. The ash content of the screening reject was 32. 4 – 74. 7 %, and the effective heating value was 5. 2 – 13. 4 MJ/kg. The effective heating value of the produced hog fuel was 17. 9 – 19. 9 MJ/kg. The average grinding productivity, when using the 250 x 320 mm <b>screen</b> <b>basket,</b> was 162 loose m 3 per effective hour, and the fuel consumption of the grinder was 0. 44 litres per loose m 3. With a narrower screen, the average grinding productivity was 101 loose m 3 per effective hour, and the fuel consumption of the grinder was 0. 75 litres per loose m 3...|$|E
50|$|Date palm {{leaves are}} used for Palm Sunday in the Christian religion. In North Africa, they are {{commonly}} used for making huts. Mature leaves are also made into mats, <b>screens,</b> <b>baskets</b> and fans. Processed leaves {{can be used for}} insulating board. Dried leaf petioles are a source of cellulose pulp, used for walking sticks, brooms, fishing floats and fuel. Leaf sheaths are prized for their scent, and fibre from them is also used for rope, coarse cloth, and large hats. The leaves are also used as a lulav in the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.|$|R
50|$|Similar to a {{vertical}} screen scroll centrifuge, a horizontal screen scroll centrifuge is constructed of several main parts: <b>screen,</b> scroll, <b>basket,</b> housing, and helical screw. The <b>screen</b> and the <b>basket</b> with frustoconical geometry are assembled into the housing in a horizontal axis. Inside the frustoconical structure {{there is a}} tubular wall. Inside the tubular wall there is a cylinder of helical screw which flight on scroll pass. The tubular wall will have a slightly different angular speed to the helical screw.|$|R
5000|$|Screen Basket- Also {{known as}} the screen [...] "bed" [...] {{it is the most}} {{important}} part of the machine, it is responsible for transferring the shaking intensity of the machine, measured in [...] "G's", while keeping the [...] "shaking" [...] motion even throughout the entire basket. It must do all that while holding the screens securely in place, eliminating drilled solids bypass to the hopper and allowing for easy operation and maintenance of the machine. Different brands of shakers have different methods of fulfilling these demands by using specialized screen tensioning apparatus, rubber seals around the <b>screens,</b> <b>basket</b> reinforcement to limit flex, rubber Float Mounts rather than springs, rubber Deck seals and selective vibrator placement.|$|R

50|$|The {{solid liquid}} mixture is {{fed into the}} closed {{rearward}} portion of the scroll. The rotation movement of the scroll, <b>screen,</b> and <b>basket</b> allows the liquid to pass through from the openings on the screen (via centrifugal force). The solid remains will be separated according to size due to the difference of the angular velocity of the helical screw and the basket. The helical screw pushes the solid material to be discharged to the forward end of the scroll. The processing time depends on helical screw pitch and the angular velocity difference. It may also {{be influenced by the}} design of the scroll feed opening. The solid particles exiting are usually collected via a conveyor in the collection unit.|$|R
50|$|Vertical screen scroll {{is built}} {{with the main}} {{components}} of <b>screen,</b> scroll, <b>basket,</b> housing, and helical screw. Feed containing liquid and solid materials is introduced into vertical screen scroll centrifuge from the top. This is sped up by centrifugal acceleration produced from the rotating parts contacted. As such, centrifugal force slings liquids through the openings, while solids are held on the screen surface as they cannot pass through because of granular particles larger than the screen pores or due to agglomeration. Movement of solids across the screen surface is manipulated by flights. Liquids that have gone through screen are obtained and discharged through effluent outlet from the side of machine, while solids collected from the screen fall by gravity through the bottom discharge of the machine.|$|R
2500|$|Offensive plays {{are more}} varied, {{normally}} involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player without {{the ball to}} gain an advantageous position {{is known as a}} cut. A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a screen or pick. The two plays are combined in the pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then [...] "rolls" [...] away from the pick towards the <b>basket.</b> <b>Screens</b> and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork, which can lead to a successful basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur.|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} of urban {{stormwater}} runoff disposal has traditionally been to provide structurally-sound drainage systems to carry runoff from many different surfaces without considering water quality at outfall. This {{has contributed to the}} decline of water quality in rivers and lakes and other receiving bodies. According to Lord (1987), "stormwater management is primarily concerned with limiting future flood damages and environmental impacts due to development, where as flood control aims at reducing the extent of flooding that occurs under current conditions". Recent developments in stormwater pollutant trap (SPTs), which are generally end-of-the-line devices designed to capture and store gross pollutants, for subsequent removal and disposal. During the last few decades, use of SPTs as a source of collecting and removing pollutants from stormwater (which carries many different types of chemicals and nonchemical pollutants that contaminates our rivers, lakes and other receiving bodies) has increased considerably. Wide-ranging efforts and attempts have been made in both academic and industrial research {{to improve the quality of}} stormwater by improving the use of gross pollutant traps (GPTs – known as hydrodynamic separators) by utilising and improving available experimental and modelling techniques. The use of vortex phenomena has always been a challenging problem and available data is rare and complicated in the literature. This research focuses on detailed investigation by experimental means. The generated vortex in this experiment is created in a cylindrical chamber above the level of a cylindrical <b>screening</b> <b>basket.</b> In addition, the research analyses the processes involved in this separation technique. One scale model of a Versa Trap (Type A) was experimentally analysed to investigate and establish the relationship between headloss and flow rate and hydraulic characteristics of a weir in a diversion weir pit. The Versa trap Type A storm pollutant traps are usually used as off-line traps in city and urban areas to capture and store debris – especially those which are captured from surfaces such as rooftops, paved streets, highways, parking lots, lawns, and paved and gravelled roads (Allison et al., 1998). The Versa Trap Type A utilises an upstream diversion weir pit to divert the design treatment flow (DTF) into the treatment chamber. Treated flow returns to the diversion pit downstream of the weir, where it re-enters the drainage system. Peak flow in excess of the DTF bypasses the SPT over the weir into the pipeline downstream. It has been demonstrated that the aggregate of all flows of three months average recurrence interval (ARI) and less represented the majority (up to 97. 5 %) of the total flow generated by a stormwater drainage catchment (Works, 2006). There is some conjecture as to the veracity of the ‘first flush’ theory, which holds that most of the pollutants in the catchments are transported during the first flush of the storm event (Lee et al., 2007). However, it is generally accepted that SPTs should be sized so as to treat only a portion of the peak flow, with excess flows bypassing the trap. The three month ARI peak flow is commonly taken as appropriate for establishing the minimum DTF required of the SPT. The measurement of headloss across a scale model of a VT Type A storm pollutant trap at a range of flow rates through the SPT, provide data from which a mathematical relationship between flow rate and the headloss cab be established for the device. The resultant relationship then can be used in another part of the experiment to establish the hydraulic characteristics of a weir across a cylindrical chamber, as used for the upstream diversion weir pit in conjunction with the Type A VT range of SPTs. By varying the weir height in a scale model of a diversion weir pit and measuring the flow rates associated with headlosses determined from the previously established relationship, the relationship between weir height and diverted flow can be established. This allows the designer to specify the weir height required to divert the flow rate associated with a specific peak flow or treatment flow of SPT design. Two main characteristics which determine the performance of a gross pollutant trap are trapping efficiency and required maintenance. The trapping efficiency is defined as the portion of the total mass of gross pollutant transported by stormwater that is retained by the trap. A low trapping efficiency means that gross pollutants pass through the trap and reach downstream waters. A poorly-maintained trap will be inefficient at trapping pollutants and is also a potential source of pollutants as trapped materials break down. The experiment parts of this project were tested at Curtin University of Technology’s Hydraulic Laboratory. To replicate typical in-situ conditions, the VT Type A was tested for 0, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66 and 77 % simulated blocked screen conditions for trapping efficiency. Data analysis has demonstrated that the headloss increases in proportion to flow rates and screen blockage condition. The results were scaled up to provide data on the full range of unit sizes. This research describes the testing and scaling methodologies in detail, with graphical representation of headloss and other hydraulic parameters at various conditions. The study’s findings have capabilities to optimise any other types of stormwater treatment systems. These types of traps’ are used in commercial and residential environment. This experiment is in continuation of the experiment which was conducted by Muhammad Ismail on industrial gross pollutant traps using double basket to trap the debris for industrial application. Also another good reference for pollutant build up and wash off modelling of impervious surfaces in Perth area, is done by Saadat Ashraf in his PhD thesis.
