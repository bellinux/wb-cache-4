5000|$|SEPTA uses a mixed {{fleet of}} General Electric and Hyundai Rotem [...] "Silverliner" [...] {{electric}} multiple unit (EMU) cars, used on all Regional Rail lines. SEPTA also uses push-pull equipment: coaches built by Bombardier and Pullman Standard, hauled by AEM-7 or ALP-44 (and {{soon to be}} ACS-64) electric locomotives {{similar to those used}} by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit (NJT) respectively. The push-pull equipment is used primarily for peak express service because it accelerates slower than EMU equipment, making it less suitable for local service with close <b>station</b> <b>spacing</b> and frequent stops and starts.|$|E
50|$|The express line {{is planned}} to run north-south {{west of the}} city centre, between Lines 16 and 4, through Haidian, Xicheng and Fengtai Districts. The line is planned {{to have at least}} 10 stations, at least eight of which are {{interchange}} stations, over 22.4 km. The line was envisioned as a major relief line for the overcrowded Line 4 and more direct link to the Financial Street commercial district. The high anticipated demand prompted planners to suggest the line to use high capacity 8 car type A trains. The trains have a maximum service speed of 100 km/h and combined with its long <b>station</b> <b>spacing</b> allows journey times from Mudanyuan to Xingong Stations to be only 11 min.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, {{commuter}} rail systems have extensive network and frequent service and are heavily used. In many cases, Japanese {{commuter rail}} is operationally {{more like a}} typical metro system (with very high operating frequencies, an emphasis on standing passengers, short <b>station</b> <b>spacing)</b> than it is like commuter rail in other countries. Japanese commuter rail also tends to be heavily interlined with subway lines, with commuter rail trains continuing into the subway network, and then out onto different commuter rail systems {{on the other side}} of the city. Many Japanese commuter systems operate several levels of express trains to reduce the travel time to distant locations, often using station bypass tracks instead of dedicated express tracks. It is notable that the larger Japanese commuter rail systems are owned and operated by for-profit private railway companies, without public subsidy.|$|E

The success of the bus service may be attributed to the distances between subway stops in Etobicoke; Royal York is over 1 km west of Old Mill, and Islington is over 1 km west of Royal York. (By comparison, stops at Montgomery, Prince Edward and Old Mill would all be within 1 km of each other, as are all stops on the Bloor-Danforth from Old Mill through Main Street, an east-west corridor served almost entirely by the subway line.) The local bus service was discontinued in 1984, although the long <b>station</b> <b>spacing</b> remains; only at night are buses still seen along this stretch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{take full}} {{advantage}} of urban rail transit (URT), it needs the cooperation of bus from capacity, <b>station</b> <b>spacing,</b> network, and hub. The compute method to match transport capacity was brought forward. In addition, based on minimal traveling time, the optimum <b>station</b> <b>spacing</b> between bus and URT was determined. And the guiding principles are formulated for the restructuring and optimization of the networking system for public buses and URT. Finally, hubs between URT and bus were classed three sub-grades, and their layout was planned, and the design method of transfer channels method was proposed...|$|E

40|$|The {{geophysical}} {{techniques of}} gravity, magnetics, induced polarisation (IP) and radiometrics {{were carried out}} in Madhlambudzi about 120 km west of Bulawayo from May to June, 2006. The area is overlaid by Kalahari sand and is suspected to conceal massive sulphide deposits which host precious and base metals. The Kupa exploration grid consisted of 17 lines, ranging from 1, 7 km to 2 km long, running northâ€“south with one long line of approximately 3, 8 km. The gravity survey was done using a 25 m <b>station</b> <b>spacing</b> on 5 lines. It revealed a steeply dipping, dense, NE â€“ SW trending body with a density-thickness product of 3, 09 x 105 kg/m 2 {{at a depth of}} 246 m. The ground magnetic survey was done at a 12, 5 m <b>station</b> <b>spacing</b> over 15 lines. This defined an ENE â€“ WSW trending magnetic anomaly in the southern corner of the grid with weaker sub-parallel magnetic features to the north. This was found to be consistent with banded iron formations (BIF) at depths of 24 m and 90 m. The radiometric survey was conducted on 6 lines with a <b>station</b> <b>spacing</b> of 25 m. It only managed to pick out the clay soils of the banks of the braided Chamata river system. However, it is suspected that a northern eastâ€“west trending anomaly could indicate a shallow buried granite, delineating the northern greenstone-granite contact as proposed by the local geology. Three infill IP lines were done with a <b>station</b> <b>spacing</b> of 50 m. The data was combined with previously surveyed lines to reveal a bimodal occurrence of the anomalies along each line. The anomalies indicate both disseminated and massive sulphide signatures. It was found that the geophysical data is consistent with the massive volcanogenic sulphide (VMS) deposit model proposed by company geologists...|$|E

30|$|At {{the urging}} of {{scientific}} groups and organizations, the Federal and state governments funded the installation of an improved real-time monitoring network {{and the development of}} an EEW system, ShakeAlert. It now covers a broad range along the West Coast of the United States (Given et al. 2014; Strauss and Allen 2016; Cochran et al. 2017), but the station distribution is not homogeneous as shown in Fig. 3 b. In the populated areas with high seismic risk, i.e., the greater Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay, and Seattle areas, the <b>station</b> <b>spacing</b> is about 10  km. The installation goal for other areas with low population but high hazard risk is 20  km between stations.
