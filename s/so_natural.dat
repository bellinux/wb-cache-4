5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, <b>so</b> <b>natural</b> selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} of science Sharon Kingsland, in a 1978 paper on Abbott Thayer and the protective coloration debate, uses Beddard repeatedly {{to illuminate the}} different strands of the argument. She quotes Beddard (p.94) on how difficult the question of animal coloration seemed in the 1890s. Thayer — an artist, not a scientist — had dived head-first into the debate. One of the protagonists, notes Kingsland, was Joel Asaph Allen, who had reviewed Beddard's book, and who believed that the environment directly influenced animal coloration — Kingsland cites Beddard p.54 here —, <b>so</b> <b>natural</b> selection seemed to him an unlikely factor, and {{he pointed out that}} blending inheritance would dilute the effect of selection. Furthermore, argues Kingsland, again citing Beddard (p.148), another major protagonist, Alfred Russel Wallace, was emphasizing the problem of conspicuous markings, which could be selected for as warning coloration.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe {{is widely}} popular in Asia, {{particularly}} Japan. In 2000, TV Asahi {{identified him as}} the swimmer {{likely to be the}} most successful at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, so they selected him as the event's marketing figurehead. In the lead-up, Thorpe visited Japan to promote Asahi in a series of television events, and upon returning for the competition, he was mobbed at the airport by youthful crowds 25m deep; hundreds camped outside the Australian team's hotel. He was also praised by older sections of Japanese society as a role model for youth, due to what they interpreted as his humility and work ethic. It was estimated that more than 80% of the Japanese public watched his races on television. In 2002, {{in the wake of a}} tourism slump after 11 September terrorist attacks, Thorpe agreed to be an ambassador for the Australian Tourism Commission in Japan. The high-profile campaign included a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The marketing drive resulted in an upturn in Japanese tourism to Australia, which was credited to Thorpe. In 2005, Yakult released a 'Thorpedo' energy drink—which featured a picture of the swimmer on the bottle—in Japan. This was part of an equity deal with the <b>So</b> <b>Natural</b> food group, in which Thorpe was given a 5% stake in the company—at the time worth A$1.1m—in return for the use of his name and image on their products. The 15-year deal covers East and Southeast Asia and Thorpe's share in the venture could increase to 50% depending on its success.|$|E

25|$|If a river, {{subject to}} tides, {{constituted}} {{the boundary of}} a State, and at flood {{the waters of the}} river flowed through a narrow channel, round an extensive body of land, but receded from that channel at ebb, so as to leave the land it surrounded at high water, connected with {{the main body of the}} country; this portion of territory would scarcely be considered as belonging to the State on the opposite side of the river, although that State should have the property of the river. The principle that a country bounded by a river extends to low water mark, a principle <b>so</b> <b>natural,</b> and of such obvious convenience as to have been generally adopted, would, we think, apply to that case. We perceive no sufficient reason why it should not apply to this.|$|E
25|$|Shortages {{of natural}} gas for project fuel were {{forecast}} {{to be a problem}} for Canadian oil sands production a few years ago, but recent increases in US shale gas production have eliminated much of the problem for North America. With the increasing use of hydraulic fracturing making US largely self-sufficient in natural gas and exporting more natural gas to Eastern Canada to replace Alberta gas, the Alberta government is using its powers under the NAFTA and the Canadian Constitution to reduce shipments {{of natural gas}} to the US and Eastern Canada, and divert the gas to domestic Alberta use, particularly for oil sands fuel. The natural gas pipelines to the east and south are being converted to carry increasing oil sands production to these destinations instead of gas. Canada also has huge undeveloped shale gas deposits in addition to those of the US, <b>so</b> <b>natural</b> gas for future oil sands production {{does not seem to be}} a serious problem. The low price of natural gas as the result of new production has considerably improved the economics of oil sands production.|$|E

500|$|... {{summarizes}} {{the early history}} of linear probing. It was the first open addressing method, and was originally synonymous with open addressing. According to Knuth, it was first used by Gene Amdahl, Elaine M. McGraw (née Boehme), and Arthur Samuel in 1954, in an assembler program for the IBM 701 computer. The first published description of linear probing is by , who also credits Samuel, Amdahl, and Boehme but adds that [...] "the system is <b>so</b> <b>natural,</b> that it very likely may have been conceived independently by others either before or since that time". Another early publication of this method was by Soviet researcher Andrey Ershov, in 1958.|$|E
500|$|The {{experience}} {{of listening to}} the ESL {{is often described as}} non-fatiguing or listenable.

There are no boxy colorations because there are no boxes". Its superior sonic characteristics were offset by its moderate power handling, and the need for a relatively large space in which to [...] "breathe". Its usable frequency response is from 40Hz to well past 20kHz, and is occasionally criticised for being bass light. Its moderate bass extension is considered adequate for classical music fans, although later incarnations are said to deliver better bass performance.|$|E

[...] Suzi Feay, for the Financial Times, stated [...] "Quietly powerful, consistently surprising, Pure is a fine addition to a substantial body of work" [...] and also noted that [...] "Miller's portraits {{of women and the}} poor are thoughtful and subtle." [...] Writing for the Daily Express Vanessa Berridge found the novel to be [...] "very atmospheric, if not to say positively creepy at times" [...] and stated that [...] "Miller's eloquent novel overflows with vitality and colour.

[...] Reviewing for the Daily Mail Clare Colvin stated that the novel [...] "draws you in with hallucinatory power" [...] and that she found that [...] "Miller evokes the underside of Parisian society with assured, vivid detail so that images remain in your mind long after you reach the last page.
