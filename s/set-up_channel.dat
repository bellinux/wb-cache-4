The DTM network is based on bandwidth reservation and supports dynamic reallocation of bandwidth. It is designed to support real-time multimedia applications and high-speed computer communication.

Deadlock-free routing strategies have been developed, allowing the implementation of fast hardware routers that reduce the communication bottleneck.

This paper develops the theoretical background {{for the design of}} deadlock-free adaptive routing algorithms for wormhole networks. Some basic definitions and two theorems are proposed, developing conditions to verify that an adaptive algorithm is deadlock-free, even when there are cycles in the channel dependency graph.

The modern dolphin skeleton has two small, rod-shaped pelvic bones thought to be vestigial hind limbs.

40|$|This work {{considers}} communication over Gaussian interference channels with processing energy cost, which explicitly {{takes into}} account the energy expended for processing when transmitters are on. In the presence of processing energy cost, transmitting all the time as in the conventional no-cost case is no longer optimal. For a two-user Gaussian interference channel with processing energy cost, assuming that the on-off states of transmitters are not utilized for signaling, several transmission schemes with varying complexities are proposed and their sum rates are compared with an interference-free upper bound. Moreover, the very strong interference regime, under which interference does not incur any rate penalty, is identified and shown to be larger than the case of no processing energy cost for certain scenarios of interest. Also, extensions to a three-user cascade Gaussian Z interference channel with processing energy cost are provided, where scheduling of user transmissions based on the <b>channel</b> <b>set-up</b> is investigated.

40|$|The {{existing}} {{access scheme}} {{used in the}} Reverse Access Channel (R-ACH) in IS- 95 A/B {{is based on a}} Slotted Aloha protocol. The mobile sends a probe and waits for an acknowledgement from the base station. If no acknowledgement is received, the mobile increases power and tries again. This type of access scheme requires a large probe power to guarantee detection and presents high delays. Data applications require a connectionless packet service capability and a low latency access protocol. The bursty nature of data communications requires many more transitions from idle state to active state than voice communications.

40|$|Bitcoin, Ethereum {{and other}} blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, as {{deployed}} today, cannot scale for wide-spread use. A leading approach for cryptocurrency scaling {{is a smart}} contract mechanism called a payment channel which enables two mutually distrustful parties to transact efficiently (and only requires a single transaction in the blockchain to <b>set-up).</b> Payment <b>channels</b> can be linked {{together to form a}} payment network, such that payments between any two parties can (usually) be routed through the network along a path that connects them. Crucially, both parties can transact without trusting hops along the route. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of payment channels, called Sprites, that reduces the worst-case "collateral cost" that each hop along the route may incur. The benefits of Sprites are two-fold. 1) In Lightning Network, a payment across a path of ℓ channels requires locking up collateral for Θ(ℓΔ) time, where Δ is the time to commit an on-chain transaction. Sprites reduces this cost to O(ℓ + Δ). 2) Unlike prior work, Sprites supports partial withdrawals and deposits, during which the channel can continue to operate without interruption. In evaluating Sprites we make several additional contributions. First, our simulation-based security model is the first formalism to model timing guarantees in payment channels. Our construction is also modular, making use of a generic abstraction from folklore, called the "state channel," which we are the first to formalize. We also provide a simulation framework for payment network protocols, which we use to confirm that the Sprites construction mitigates against throughput-reducing attacks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the ECCE protocol, a new distributed, probabilistic, cooperative protocol {{to establish a}} secure pair-wise communication channel between any pair of sensors in it wireless sensor network (WSN). The main contributions of the ECCE protocol are: to allow the set-up of a secure channel between two sensors (principals) that do not share any pre-deployed key. This feature is obtained involving a set of sensors (cooperators) in the channel establishment protocol; to provide probabilistic authentication of the principals {{as well as the}} cooperators. In particular, the probability for the attacker to break authentication check decreases exponentially with the number of cooperators involved; to trade off the memory space required to store the pre-deployed encryption keys with the number of cooperators involved in the protocol. Hence, memory storage call be used to store keys built with the ECCE protocol, which helps amortizing the (limited) overhead incurred in the ECCE key set-up; to be adaptive to the level of threat the WSN is subject to. We provide analytical analysis and extensive simulations of ECCE, which show that the proposed solution increases both the probability of a secure <b>channel</b> <b>set-up</b> and the probability of channel resilience with respect to other protocols.

40|$|The {{provision}} of efficient high speed packet data services {{is probably the}} most important challenge for third generation systems (3 G). The efficiency of such services mainly depends on the radio interface. The UMTS W-CDMA radio interface is characterized by great flexibility and a variety of different physical and logical channel types: for example, on the downlink, the Dedicated Channels (DCH) offer circuit switching, and the Downlink Shared Channel (DSCH) and Forward Access Channel (FACH) use packet switching, the former with closed loop power control. Furthermore, the choice of suitable parameters, such as spreading factors, code rates and ARQ schemes make possible several user rate and protection options. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of UMTS packet data services over dedicated channels and shared channels through detailed simulations. In particular, we study the effect of several parameters (spreading factor, code rate, <b>channel</b> <b>set-up</b> delay, etc.) on the system capacity by means of the delay-throughput curves and show that the setting of parameters may be critical with respect to system performance and stability. Finally, in order {{to improve the quality of}} the offered packet service, we propose a simple but effective flow control mechanism which is able to limit interference on the shared resource. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} dibaryons with S = - 2 is {{important}} to support the understanding of aspects of the quark model and to interpret phenomena in astrophysics. To observe these states the SAPHIR" 1 detector set-up is a well adapted instrument and production of these states near threshold and the detection of final state particles is possible with nearly 4 #pi# acceptance. Due to the very small estimated cross sections {{for the production of}} these states a highly efficient detection of charged kaons is absolutely necessary. SAPHIR allows kaon identification via time-of-flight measurements. Due to the limited timing resolution the separation between pions and kaons is limited to particle momenta below 0. 8 GeV/c. The extension in particle identification to higher momenta can be done using Cerenkov detectors. In our case an Aerogel threshold detector could be an instrument to serve as #pi#-K-separator. This work reports the study of a possible detector set-up, an Aerogel threshold Cerenkov detector with wavelengthshifter-lightguide read-out and alternatively a reflection box type read out using newly developed Fine Mesh photomultiplier tubes. Measurements of the properties of the components are performed and in addition Monte Carlo simulations of different geometries are described. After these preparations different modules were built which can be used at the SAPHIR experiment. Their light output has been optimized. An analysis of the reaction channel #gamma#p #-># #DELTA#"+"+#pi#"- was made to get more information about the behavior of the SAPHIR detector <b>set-up.</b> This <b>channel</b> was chosen as reference because double pion production has a similar signature as the dibaryon production with two charged kaons if the negative charged pion is not reconstructed. Due to the large statistics the data of the reference channel allow determination of detector calibration data and other properties like time-of-flight accuracy. The reference channel is also the most important background channel for the dibaryon search; here it is used to illustrate the efficiency of background rejection using time-of-flight #pi#-K-separation and especially the improvement with the Cerenkov detector described in this work.

40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that the most {{important}} limiting factors of the performance of next-generation Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) will be the power efficiency and the available communication speed between cores. Photonic Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have been suggested as a viable route to relieve the off- and on-chip interconnection bottleneck. Low-loss integrated optical waveguides can transport very high-speed data signals over longer distances as compared to on-chip electrical signaling. In addition, with the development of silicon microrings, photonic switches can be integrated to route signals in a data-transparent way. Although several photonic NoC proposals exist, their use is often limited to the communication of large data messages due to a relatively long set-up time of the photonic channels. In this work, we evaluate a reconfigurable photonic NoC in which the topology is adapted automatically (on a microsecond scale) to the evolving traffic situation by use of silicon microrings. To evaluate this system's performance, the proposed architecture has been implemented in a detailed full-system cycle-accurate simulator which is capable of generating realistic workloads and traffic patterns. In addition, a model was developed to estimate the power consumption of the full interconnection network which was compared with other photonic and electrical NoC solutions. We find that our proposed network architecture significantly lowers the average memory access latency (35 % reduction) while only generating a modest increase in power consumption (20 %), compared to a conventional concentrated mesh electrical signaling approach. When comparing our solution to high-speed circuit-switched photonic NoCs, long photonic <b>channel</b> <b>set-up</b> times can be tolerated which makes our approach directly applicable to current shared-memory CMPs...|$|R
