40|$|Stress-induced {{regulatory}} networks {{coordinated with}} a procaryotic developmental program were revealed by two-dimensional gel analyses of global gene expression. Four developmental stages {{were identified by}} their distinctive protein synthesis patterns using principal component analysis. Statistical analyses focused on five stress <b>stimulons</b> (induced by heat, cold, salt, ethanol, or antibiotic shock) and their synthesis during development. Unlike other bacteria, for which various stresses induce expression of similar sets of protein spots, in Streptomyces coelicolor heat, salt, and ethanol <b>stimulons</b> were composed of independent sets of proteins. This suggested independent control by different physiological stress signals and their corresponding regulatory systems. These stress proteins were also under developmental control. Cluster analysis of stress protein synthesis profiles identified 10 different developmental patterns or “synexpression groups. ” Proteins induced by cold, heat, or salt shock were enriched in three developmental synexpression groups. In addition, certain proteins belonging to the heat and salt shock <b>stimulons</b> were coregulated during development. Thus, stress regulatory systems controlling these <b>stimulons</b> were implicated as integral parts of the developmental program. This correlation suggested that thermal shock and salt shock stress response regulatory systems either allow the cell to adapt to stresses associated with development or directly control the developmental program.

40|$|We propose {{two-dimensional}} {{gel electrophoresis}} (2 -DE) and mass spectrometry to define the protein components of regulons and <b>stimulons</b> in bacteria, including those organisms where genome sequencing is still in progress. The basic 2 -DE protocol allows high resolution and reproducibility and enables the direct comparison of hundreds or even thousands of proteins simultaneously. To identify proteins that comprise <b>stimulons</b> and regulons, peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis is the first option and, if results from this tool are insufficient, complementary data obtained with electrospray ionization tandem-MS (ESI-MS/MS) may permit successful protein identification. ESI-MS/MS and MALDI-TOF-MS provide complementary data sets, and so a more comprehensive coverage of a proteome can be obtained using both techniques with the same sample, especially when few sequenced proteins of a particular organism exist or genome sequencing is still in progress...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of the marine Vibrio sp. strain S 14 to starvation for carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorus and to simultaneous depletion of all these nutrients (multiple-nutrient starvation) was examined with respect to survival, stress resistance, quantitative and qualitative alterations in protein and RNA synthesis, and the induction of the stringent control. Of the conditions tested, carbon starvation and multiple-nutrient starvation both promoted long-term starvation resistance and a rapid induction of the stringent control, as deduced from the kinetics of RNA synthesis. Carbon- and multiple-nutrient-starved cells were also found to become increasingly resistant to heat, UV, near-UV, and CdCl 2 stress. Nitrogen- and phosphorus-starved cells demonstrated a poor ability {{to survive in the}} presence of carbon and did not develop a marked resistance to the stresses examined. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus starvation <b>stimulons</b> consisted of about 20 proteins each, while simultaneous starvation for all the nutrients elicited an increased synthesis of 42 polypeptides. Nine common proteins were found to be induced regardless of the starvation condition used and were tentatively termed general starvation proteins. It was also demonstrated that the total number of proteins induced in response to multiple-nutrient starvation was not a predictable sum of the different individual starvation <b>stimulons.</b> Multiple-nutrient starvation induced 14 proteins which were not detected at increased levels of expression in response to individual starvation conditions. Furthermore, four out of five phosphorus starvation-specific polypeptides were not induced during simultaneous starvation for phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon.

Here, we investigated the mechanism of fusaricidin antibacterial activity toward Bacillus subtilis and characterized the pathways responsible for drug resistance. We found that sw, an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor, {{plays an important role in}} the resistance to fusaricidins during the initial 5 minutes of drug addition. Approximately 18 genes were induced more than 3 -fold, of which 66. 7 % are known to be regulated by sw. Over the following 3 h, fusaricidins induced 194 genes more than three-fold, and most were associated with classes of antibiotic-responsive <b>stimulons.</b> Moreover, the fusaricidin treatment increased the catabolism of fatty and amino acids but strongly repressed glucose decomposition and gluconeogenesis. In summary, our data provide insight into the mechanism of fusaricidin activity, on which we based our suggested strategies for the development of novel antibiotic agents...|$|R

40|$|The transglycosylation step of {{cell wall}} {{synthesis}} {{is a prime}} antibiotic target because it is essential and specific to bacteria. Two antibiotics, ramoplanin and moenomycin, target this step by binding to the substrate lipid II and the transglycosylase enzyme, respectively. Here, we compare the ramoplanin and moenomycin <b>stimulons</b> in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. Ramoplanin strongly induces the LiaRS two-component regulatory system, while moenomycin almost exclusively induces genes {{that are part of}} the regulon of the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor σM. Ramoplanin additionally induces the ytrABCDEF and ywoBCD operons, which are not part of a previously characterized antibiotic-responsive regulon. Cluster analysis reveals that these two operons are selectively induced by a subset of cell wall antibiotics that inhibit lipid II function or recycling. Repression of both operons requires YtrA, which recognizes an inverted repeat in front of its own operon and in front of ywoB. These results suggest that YtrA is an additional regulator of cell envelope stress responses...|$|R
40|$|Bacillus subtilis {{exhibits}} a complex adaptive response to {{low levels of}} peroxides. We used global transcriptional profiling to monitor the magnitude and kinetics {{of changes in the}} mRNA population after exposure to either hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) or tert-butyl peroxide (t-buOOH). The peroxide <b>stimulons</b> could be largely accounted for by three regulons controlled by the PerR, σB, and OhrR transcription factors. Three members of the PerR regulon (katA, mrgA, and zosA) were strongly induced by H 2 O 2 and weakly induced by t-buOOH. The remaining members of the PerR regulon were only modestly up-regulated by peroxide treatment. Overall, the magnitude of peroxide induction of PerR regulon genes corresponded well with the extent of derepression in a perR mutant strain. The σB regulon was activated by 58 μM H 2 O 2 but not by 8 μM H 2 O 2 and was strongly activated by either t-buOOH or, in a control experiment, tert-butyl alcohol. Apart from the σB regulon there was a single gene, ohrA, that was strongly and rapidly induced by t-buOOH exposure. This gene, controlled by the peroxide-sensing repressor OhrR, was not induced by any of the other conditions tested...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{technique}} of Mu d 1 (Ap lac) -directed lacZ operon fusions, several oxygen-regulated genetic loci were identified in Salmonella typhimurium. Thirteen anaerobically inducible and six aerobically inducible operon fusions were identified. Based on control by the oxrA and oxrB regulatory loci, the anti-lacZ fusions were grouped into three classes: class I loci were regulated by both oxr loci, class II genes were regulated by oxrA only, and class III loci were not affected by either regulatory locus. Several of the anti-lacZ fusions required growth in complex medium before they exhibited the inducible phenotype. While the expression {{of some of these}} loci was repressed when organisms were grown in nitrate, others were stimulated by nitrate. Fusions into the hyd and phs loci were identified among the isolated anti-lacZ fusions. Six oxygen-inducible (oxi) operon fusions were also identified. Two of the oxi loci mapped near oxygen-regulatory loci: oxiC near oxrA and oxiE near oxyR. However, neither fusion appeared to occur within the regulatory locus. The data presented serve to further define the aerobic and anaerobic <b>stimulons</b> of S. typhimurium but indicate additional regulatory circuits above those already defined...|$|R
40|$|Genome-wide {{transcriptional}} profiling {{studies of}} the response of Staphylococcus aureus to cell wall-active antibiotics {{have led to the}} discovery of a cell wall stress <b>stimulon</b> of genes induced by these agents. msrA 1, encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase, is a highly induced member gene of this <b>stimulon.</b> In the present study we show that msrA 1 induction by oxacillin is common to all methicillin-susceptible strains studied but did not occur in two homogeneous and two heterogeneous methicillin-resistant strains. However, msrA 1 was induced by vancomycin and/or d-cycloserine in methicillin-resistant strains. Lysozyme and lysostaphin treatment did not induce msrA 1 expression. Oxacillin-induced msrA 1 expression was enhanced by ca. 30 % in a SigB+ derivative (SH 1000) of the SigB-defective RN 450 (NCTC 8325 - 4) strain. msrA 1 expression was not affected in mutants in the global regulatory systems agr and sar. Glycerol monolaurate, an inhibitor of signal transduction, inhibited the oxacillin-induced transcription of msrA 1 and other cell wall stress <b>stimulon</b> member genes, vraS and dnaK. These observations suggest that the cell wall stress <b>stimulon</b> is induced by inhibition of the process of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and the inhibitory effects of glycerol monolaurate indicate that gene expression is dependent on a signal transduction pathway...|$|E
40|$|Daptomycin is a lipopeptide {{antibiotic}} {{that has}} recently been approved for treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. The mode of action of daptomycin is not yet entirely clear. To further understand the mechanism transcriptomic analysis of changes in gene expression in daptomycin-treated Staphylococcus aureus was carried out. The expression profile indicated that cell wall stress <b>stimulon</b> member genes (B. J. Wilkinson, A. Muthaiyan, and R. K. Jayaswal, Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Infect. Agents 4 : 259 - 276, 2005) were significantly induced by daptomycin and by the cell wall-active antibiotics vancomycin and oxacillin. Comparison of the daptomycin response of a two-component cell wall stress <b>stimulon</b> regulator VraSR mutant, S. aureus KVR, to its parent N 315 showed diminished expression of the cell wall stress <b>stimulon</b> in the mutant. Daptomycin has been proposed to cause membrane depolarization, and the transcriptional responses to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and nisin were determined. Transcriptional profiles of the responses to these antimicrobial agents showed significantly different patterns compared {{to those of the}} cell wall-active antibiotics, including little or no induction of the cell wall stress <b>stimulon.</b> However, there were a significant number of genes induced by both CCCP and daptomycin that were not induced by oxacillin or vancomycin, so the daptomycin transcriptome probably reflected a membrane depolarizing activity of this antimicrobial also.

40|$|To {{cope with}} {{oxidative}} stress, the metabolic network of plant cells must be reconfigured either to bypass damaged enzymes or to support adaptive responses. To characterize {{the dynamics of}} metabolic change during oxidative stress, heterotrophic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cells were treated with menadione and changes in metabolite abundance and (13) C-labeling kinetics were quantified in a time series of samples taken over a 6 h period. Oxidative stress {{had a profound effect}} on the central metabolic pathways with extensive metabolic inhibition radiating from the tricarboxylic acid cycle and including large sectors of amino acid metabolism. Sequential accumulation of metabolites in specific pathways indicated a subsequent backing up of glycolysis and a diversion of carbon into the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Microarray analysis revealed a coordinated transcriptomic response that represents an emergency coping strategy allowing the cell to survive the metabolic hiatus. Rather than attempt to replace inhibited enzymes, transcripts encoding these enzymes are in fact down-regulated while an antioxidant defense response is mounted. In addition, a major switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism is signaled. Metabolism is also reconfigured to bypass damaged steps (e. g. induction of an external NADH dehydrogenase of the mitochondrial respiratory chain). The overall metabolic response of Arabidopsis cells to oxidative stress is remarkably similar to the superoxide and hydrogen peroxide <b>stimulons</b> of bacteria and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), suggesting that the stress regulatory and signaling pathways of plants and microbes may share common elements...|$|R
40|$|Dual channel {{imaging and}} warping of {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) protein gels {{were used to}} visualize global changes of the gene expression patterns in growing Bacillus subtilis cells during entry into the stationary phase as triggered by glucose exhaustion. The 2 D gels only depict single moments during the cells' growth cycle, but a sequential series of overlays obtained at specific points of the growth curve facilitates visualization of the developmental processes at the proteomics scale. During glucose starvation a substantial reprogramming of the protein synthesis pattern was found, with 150 proteins synthesized de novo and cessation of the synthesis of almost 400 proteins. Proteins induced following glucose starvation belong to two main regulation groups: general stress/starvation responses induced by different stresses or starvation stimuli (ςB-dependent general stress regulon, stringent response, sporulation), and glucose-starvation-specific responses (drop in glycolysis, utilization of alternative carbon sources, gluconeogenesis). Using the dual channel approach, {{it was not only}} possible to identify those regulons or <b>stimulons,</b> but also to follow the fate of each single protein by the three-color code: red, newly induced but not yet accumulated; yellow, synthesized and accumulated; and green, still present, but no longer being synthesized. These green proteins, which represent a substantial part of the protein pool in the nongrowing cell, are not accessible by using DNA arrays. The combination of 2 D gel electrophoresis and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry with the dual channel imaging technique provides a new and comprehensive view of the physiology of growing or starving bacterial cell populations, here for the case of the glucose-starvation response...|$|R
40|$|At least 22 {{proteins}} in Escherichia coliW 3110 {{were found to}} increase a minimum of 2 -fold after cells were shocked with 0. 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Among these 22 proteins, 5 were not observed during normal growth, they were only synthesized during SDS stress thus making them unique. These 22 proteins were also found to follow a time-dependent pattern in their synthesis, with various proteins being synthesized at their peak levels within 10 minutes of SDS shock. Other proteins did not appear in elevated quantities until 1 hour after SDS shock. The SDS shock proteins did not show significant overlap {{with any of the}} established shock <b>stimulons,</b> however the DnaK chaperonin protein and the Universal Shock Protein have been tentatively identified as being SDS shock proteins. The SDS resistant phenotype could be at least partially eliminated by transposon mutagenesis to create a mutant strain of Escherichia coli which grew poorly after SDS shock. This mutant strain also failed to show a wild-type pattern of protein synthesis after SDS shock. Only 3 of the 22 SDS shock proteins showed significant increases in synthesis after SDS shock, all of the others increased very little or not at all. The synthesis of proteins, including the SDS shock proteins, was not found to be required for survival of E. coli after SDS shock. Cultures treated with chloramphenicol, which halted protein synthesis, showed no decrease in viability after 4 hours of SDS shock. This result may indicate that SDS resistance is a constitutive property of enteric bacteria and that the SDS shock proteins may serve to facilitate growth in an SDS containing environment, but are not essential for short term survival when cells are exposed to detergents. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Dickeya dadantii and Pectobacterium atrosepticum are phytopathogenic {{enterobacteria}} {{capable of}} facultative anaerobic growth {{in a wide}} range of O 2 concentrations found in plant and natural environments. The transcriptional response to O 2 remains under-explored for these and other phytopathogenic enterobacteria although it has been well characterized for animal-associated genera including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Knowledge of the extent of conservation of the transcriptional response across orthologous genes in more distantly related species is useful to identify rates and patterns of regulon evolution. Evolutionary events such as loss and acquisition of genes by lateral transfer events along each evolutionary branch results in lineage-specific genes, some of which may have been subsequently incorporated into the O 2 -responsive <b>stimulon.</b> Here we present a comparison of transcriptional profiles measured using densely tiled oligonucleotide arrays for two phytopathogens, Dickeya dadantii 3937 and Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI 1043, grown to mid-log phase in MOPS minimal medium (0. 1 % glucose) with and without O 2. Results More than 7 % of the genes of each phytopathogen are differentially expressed with greater than 3 -fold changes under anaerobic conditions. In addition to anaerobic metabolism genes, the O 2 responsive <b>stimulon</b> includes a variety of virulence and pathogenicity-genes. Few of these genes overlap with orthologous genes in the anaerobic <b>stimulon</b> of E. coli. We define these as the conserved core, in which the transcriptional pattern as well as genetic architecture are well preserved. This conserved core includes previously described anaerobic metabolic pathways such as fermentation. Other components of the anaerobic <b>stimulon</b> show variation in genetic content, genome architecture and regulation. Notably formate metabolism, nitrate/nitrite metabolism, and fermentative butanediol production, differ between E. coli and the phytopathogens. Surprisingly, the overlap of the anaerobic <b>stimulon</b> between the phytopathogens is also relatively small considering that they are closely related, occupy similar niches and employ similar strategies to cause disease. There are cases of interesting divergences in the pattern of transcription of genes between Dickeya and Pectobacterium for virulence-associated subsystems including the type VI secretion system (T 6 SS), suggesting that fine-tuning of the <b>stimulon</b> impacts interaction with plants or competing microbes. Conclusions The small number of genes (an even smaller number if we consider operons) comprising the conserved core transcriptional response to O 2 limitation demonstrates the extent of regulatory divergence prevalent in the Enterobacteriaceae. Our orthology-driven comparative transcriptomics approach indicates that the adaptive response in the eneterobacteria is a result of interaction of core (regulators) and lineage-specific (structural and regulatory) genes. Our subsystems based approach reveals that similar phenotypic outcomes are sometimes achieved by each organism using different genes and regulatory strategies. </p...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the fusidic acid <b>stimulon</b> of a fusidic acid-susceptible strain of Staphylococcus aureus (SH 1000). Methods: S. aureus microarrays and real-time PCR determined transcriptome alterations occurring in SH 1000 grown with fusidic acid. The Staphylococcus aureus microarray meta-database (SAMMD) com-pared and contrasted the SH 1000 fusidic <b>stimulon</b> with 89 other S. aureus transcriptional datasets. Fusidic acid gradient analyses with mutant-parent strain pairs were used to identify genes required for intrinsic fusidic acid susceptibility identified during transcriptional analysis.

The expression ratios of a total of 232 genes were < 0. 75 in all three strains (the supplemental data are shown at [URL] suggesting that the PhoP/PhoQ system is involved directly or indirectly in the transcription of these genes. Of those, 26 contained the PhoP box-like sequences with the direct repeats of (T/G) GTTTA within 500 bp upstream of the initiation codon. Furthermore, S 1 nuclease assays of 26 promoters were performed to verify six new Mg 2 + <b>stimulon</b> genes, hemL, nagA, rstAB, slyB, vboR, and yrbL, in addition to the phoPQ, mgrB, and mgtA genes reported previously.

40|$|The {{response}} of non-differentiating bacteria to nutrient starvation {{is complex and}} includes the sequential synthesis of starvation-inducible proteins. Although starvation for different individual nutrients generally provokes unique and individual patterns of protein expression, some starvation <b>stimulons</b> share member proteins. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the synthesis of a small (13. 5 kDa) cytoplasmic protein in Escherichia coli was greatly increased during growth inhibition caused by the exhaustion of any {{of a variety of}} nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, phosphate, sulphate, required amino acid) or by the presence of a variety of toxic agents including heavy metals, oxidants, acids and antibiotics. To determine further the mode of regulation of the protein designated UspA (Üniversal stress pUrotein A) we cloned the gene encoding the protein by the technique of reverse genetics. We isolated the protein from a preparative two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel, determined its N -terminal amino acid sequence, and used this sequence to construct a degenerate oligonucleotide probe. Two phages of the Kohara library were found to contain the gene which then was subcloned from the DNA in the overlapping region of these two clones. The amino acid sequence, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the uspA gene, shows no significant homology with any other known protein. The uspA gene maps at 77 min on the E. coli W 3110 chromosome, and is transcribed in a clockwise direction. The increase in the level of UspA during growth arrest was found to be primarily a result of transcriptional activation of the corresponding gene. The induction was independent of the RelA/SpoT, RpoH, KatF, OmpR, AppY, Lrp, PhoB and H-NS proteins during stress conditions that are known to induce or activate these global regulators.

40|$|Transcriptional {{profiles}} of P. syringae pv. syringae B 728 a (Pss) were obtained during both epiphytic and endophytic phases of colonization of its host plant Phaseolus vulgaris {{as well as}} the conditions of water stress, oxidative stress, iron limitation, and nitrogen limitation in culture, mimicking the challenges faced in an on plants. The transcript {{profiles of}} Pss B 728 a support a model in which leaf surface sites specifically favor flagellar motility, swarming motility requiring HAA surfactant production, and chemosensing and chemotaxis, indicating that cells actively relocate on leaves after immigration. Phenylalanine degradation is also induced in cells on leaves, which may help them counteract phenylpropanoid-based defenses prior to leaf entry. In contrast, intercellular sites favor the high-level expression of genes for gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) metabolism, the degradation of which would attenuate GABA-dependent host defenses. In addition, the synthesis of phytotoxins, two novel secondary metabolites, and syringolin A is induced in Pss cells in intercellular spaces, apparently contributing to its virulence. Syringolin A may also suppress host plant defenses as well as stomatal closure. The prominent catabolism of various non-sugar compounds, and the elaborations of secondary metabolites by Pss underscores the complexity of the chemical interface between it and host plants. A comparison of the transcriptome of Pss recovered from plants to that of cells exposed to osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and iron and nitrogen limitation in culture revealed that gene expression of cells in and on leaves was most similar to that of cells experiencing water stress in culture. Surprisingly, water was apparently more limiting in the apoplast than on the leaf surface. Global gene expression of mutants of Pss in which the global regulators gacS, retS, salA, rpoN, rpoE, rpoS, hrpL, ahlR and aefR were disrupted was also assessed in these same seven conditions to determine the roles of these regulators in mediating transcriptional responses to such stimuli. Complex patterns of gene expression were observed that revealed that the regulons differed greatly in size, and had variable overlap between other regulons and with the various <b>stimulons.</b> Genes enabling responses to water stress such as those for compatible solute synthesis and other osmoprotection mechanisms, which are strongly expressed both on the surface of leaves and within leaves, are rpoE -dependent. This reveals that rpoE is a key regulator mediating water stress responses and fitness on plants. Because of our particular interest in quorum sensing, we focused our analyses upon the ahlR and the aefR regulons. AefR was found to be a repressor of a variety of efflux pumps. The most prominent feature of the aefR regulon is that it oppositely regulates two sets of genes; while the ahlR regulon is positively regulated by aefR, genes encoding orthologs of the MexEF-OprN Resistance Nodulation Division multidrug efflux pump are repressed by aefR. This juxtaposition is especially striking in light of finding that mexS is a positive regulator of ahlI and thus quorum sensing, as mexS mutants induce expression of mexEF-oprN via MexT in P. aeruginosa. MexT/MexS is responsive to disulphide stress, a condition distinct from that conferred by reactive oxygen intermediates. Another regulator (Psyr_ 1729), likely a repressor of the adjacent genes encoding efflux pumps, positively regulates the expression of ahlI. The probable role of such efflux pumps is to export toxic, electrophilic oxidized products from cells. Such a scenario leads to the model that expression of multidrug efflux pumps, under the control of aefR, modulates quorum sensing indirectly through a change in cellular redox status. aefR is unique from other Pss regulators studied, in that its regulon overlaps little with that of global regulators such as gacS, salA, or rpoN. A distinct stimulus for the aefR regulon remains elusive, while we expect such a stimulus would be present during host interactions since an aefR mutant was impaired in apoplastic growth in plants. The ahlR (Psyr_ 1622) regulon was small, with only eight genes that are positively regulated, and all were in two adjacent, divergent operons. One operon is initiated by the ahlI promoter, to form a transcript sense to ahlI that extends into genes encoding a truncated pyruvated dehydrogenase E 1 subunit, pdhT (Psyr_ 1623) as well as one encoding a full length pyruvate dehydrogenase E 1 subunit, pdhQ (Psyr_ 1625), thus producing a transcript of over 5 kb that is antisense to both ahlR and qrpR. Pyruvate accumulated in a pdhQ mutant and pyoverdine-dependent fluorescence was altered or quenched. The other ahlR -regulated operon originates from the same intergenic region as ahlI (Psyr_ 1621), and extends, on the opposite strand, through five genes (Psyr_ 1620 -Psyr_ 1616). This second operon was termed the pao operon (paoABCDE), as it was necessary for the accumulation of pyruvate that occurs when pdhQ is deleted. GC-MS and HPLC-MS profiling revealed that at least five unidentified compounds, as well as pyruvate accumulated in cells in the absence of pdhQ, but only when the pao operon was expressed. High accuracy mass spectrometry reveals {{that at least one of}} these compounds with the chemical formula C 10 H 8 O 2 is probably an oxidized phenolic. Elevated levels of oxidized glutathione, methionine sulfoxide, and methanethiol in an ahlR ahlI double mutant in stationary phase cultures are consistent with the AhlR regulon contributing to cellular redox equilibrium. Both ahlR and qrpR have their own active promoters and their expression is not responsive to AHL. AhlR can positively regulate its target promoter(s) even in the absence of its ligand 3 oxoC 6 -AHL, but its activity is greatly enhanced upon ligand interaction. Given the position of AhlR in the phylogeny of LuxR homologs, at a clade branch equidistant between apo-repressors and ligand-dependent activators, it is noteworthy that it has ligand-independent, yet ligand-responsive activator activity. QrpR is a MarR-family repressor of the promoter of pdhQ. The ligand needed to de-repress QrpP is not known, but it is not 3 oxoC 6 -AHL. In the absence of AhlR and AhlI, pdhQ expression is strongly de-repressed in the presence of a paoABCDE transcript. We posit that a compound originating from these enzymes is the ligand that elicits QrpR-dependent de-repression of pdhQ. Exogenous application of pyruvate did not de-repress pdhQ. Phylogenetic assessment indicates that QrpR orthologs form a clade distinct from other well-described MarR homologs. The second ortholog of the pyruvade dehydrogenase complex E 1 subunit in Pss B 728 a, Psyr_ 0518, exhibits constitutive expression in a variety of genetic backgrounds and growth conditions. The pH of the medium is greatly decreased in a Psyr_ 0518 mutant but this phenotype is reversed by expression of pdhQ, in trans. Mutants blocked in expression of ahlR -dependent genes did not exhibit altered growth on the surface of host plants, or in the interior of host or non-host plants, while mutants in the housekeeping pyruvate dehydrogenase E 1 ortholog (Psyr_ 0518) had greatly impaired apoplastic growth which could be restored by overexpression of the quorum-controlled ortholog pdhQ. These data taken together are consistent with a model whereby a redox stress, a potential inducing stimulus of the ahlR regulon, can be eliminated by expression of efflux pumps under the control of MexEF-OprN at low cell densities, whereas at high cell densities efflux is inadequate for this process since cellular activity needed for the process is low and the products exported by the pumps will accumulate in the vicinity of the cells. Under such circumstances, the AhlR regulon mediates metabolism of these toxic compounds. The presumed toxic effects of certain breakdown products on the pyruvate dehydrogenase E 1 subunit are circumvented by expression of a toxin-resistant quorum-controlled enzyme PdhQ. The regulation of this metabolism by AHL signaling, QrpR, and transcriptional read-through events is exquisitely complex, as may be required to ensure cell density- or environmental porosity-dependent expression of this metabolism in anticipation of cellular stress, while avoiding endogenously generated cytotoxicity when more effective strategies are appropriate. We also dissected the effects of iron on ahlI expression using both promoter-probe fusions and transcript abundance, to ascertain independently, the effects of iron on AHL production and AHL perception, and to resolve the effects of iron on these processes over time. Initial iron limitation does not alter ahlI expression, but another event linked with iron starvation that occurs after the central iron homeostasis limitation response is initiated, influences ahlI expression. Site-directed mutagenesis of loci encoding central iron homeostasis regulators Fur, PrrF 1, and PrrF 2, reveals that they are not required for the dependence of ahlI on iron availability...|$|R

The mechanisms applied by bacteria and eukarya to combat phosphate limitation are fairly well understood. However, it is not known how archaea sense phosphate limitation or which genes are regulated upon limitation. We conducted a microarray analysis to explore the phosphate-dependent gene expression of Halobacterium salinarum strain R 1. We identified a set of 17 genes whose transcript levels increased up to several hundredfold upon phosphate limitation. Analysis of deletion mutants showed that this set of genes, the PHO <b>stimulon,</b> is very likely independent of signaling via two-component systems.

40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} {{strongly}} implicated {{in a number}} of diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disorders, and atherosclerosis, and its emerging {{as one of the most}} important causative agents of mutagenesis, tumorigenesis, and aging. Recent progress on the genetics and molecular biology of the cellular responses to oxidative stress, primarily in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, is summarized. Bacteria respond to oxidative stress by invoking two distinct stress responses, the peroxide <b>stimulon</b> and the superoxide <b>stimulon,</b> depending on whether the stress is mediated by peroxides or the superoxide anion. The two stimulons each contain a set of more than 30 genes. The expression of a subset of genes in each <b>stimulon</b> is under the control of a positive regulatory element; these genes constitute the OxyR and SoxRS regulons. The schemes of regulation of the two regulons by their respective regulators are reviewed in detail, and the overlaps of these regulons with other stress responses such as the heat shock and SOS responses are discussed. The products of Oxy-R- and SoxRS-regulated genes, such as catalases and superoxide dismutases, are involved in the prevention of oxidative damage, whereas others, such as endonuclease IV, play a role in the repair of oxidative damage. The potential roles of these and other gene products in the defense against oxidative damage in DNA, proteins, and membranes are discussed in detail. A brief discussion of the similarities and differences between oxidative stress responses in bacteria and eukaryotic organisms concludes this review...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{proteins}} synthesized in Escherichia coli during steady-state growth in media with ample inorganic phosphate (Pi), upon limitation for Pi (without an alternative phosphorous compound), and during steady-state growth in media containing phosphonate (PHN) {{as the sole}} P source was examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Of 816 proteins monitored in these experiments, all those with differential synthesis rates greater than 2. 0 or less than 0. 5 upon phosphate limitation (P limitation) or during growth on PHN compared with their rates in the cultures with Pi were classified as belonging to the PL or PHN <b>stimulon,</b> respectively. The PL <b>stimulon</b> included 413 proteins, 208 showing induced synthesis and 205 showing repressed synthesis. The PHN <b>stimulon</b> was smaller: it included 257 proteins; 227 showed induced synthesis and 30 showed repressed synthesis. The overlap of the two stimulons included 137 proteins: most (118) were ones showing induced synthesis. The promoter regions of genes for several of the proteins with induced or repressed synthesis contained sequences which resembled the consensus sequence for PhoB binding. The aggregate mass of proteins responding to P limitation or growth on PHN was 30 to 40 % of the cells ’ total mass. By comparing the proteins responding to P limitation with those responding to growth on PHN, one can speculate which proteins are likely involved in adapting cells to new P sources or in preparing cells to survive stationary phase...|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that low-shear modeled microgravity (low-shear MMG) serves {{to enhance the}} virulence of a bacterial pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The Salmonella response to low-shear MMG involves a signaling pathway that we have termed the low-shear MMG <b>stimulon,</b> though {{the identities of the}} low-shear MMG <b>stimulon</b> genes and regulatory factors are not known. RpoS is the primary sigma factor required for the expression of genes that are induced upon exposure to different environmental-stress signals and is essential for virulence in mice. Since low-shear MMG induces a Salmonella acid stress response and enhances Salmonella virulence, we reasoned that RpoS would be a likely regulator of the Salmonella low-shear MMG response. Our results demonstrate that low-shear MMG provides cross-resistance to several environmental stresses in both wild-type and isogenic rpoS mutant strains. Growth under low-shear MMG decreased the generation time of both strains in minimal medium and increased the ability of both strains to survive in J 774 macrophages. Using DNA microarray analysis, we found no evidence of induction of the RpoS regulon by low-shear MMG but did find that other genes were altered in expression under these conditions in both the wild-type and rpoS mutant strains. Our results indicate that, under the conditions of these studies, RpoS is not required for transmission of the signal that induces the low-shear MMG <b>stimulon.</b> Moreover, our studies also indicate that low-shear MMG can be added to a short list of growth conditions that can serve to preadapt an rpoS mutant for resistance to multiple environmental stresses...|$|E

40|$|The Yersinia pestis low-Ca 2 + {{response}} <b>stimulon</b> {{is responsible}} for the temperature- and Ca(2 +) -regulated expression and secretion of plasmid pCD 1 -encoded antihost proteins (V antigen and Yops). We have previously shown that lcrD and yscR encode proteins that are essential for high-level expression and secretion of V antigen and Yops at 37 degrees C in the absence of Ca 2 +. In this study, we constructed and characterized mutants with in-frame deletions in yscC, yscD, and yscG of the ysc operon that contains yscA through yscM. All three mutants lost the Ca 2 + requirement for growth at 37 degrees c, expressed only basal levels of V antigen and YopM in {{the presence or absence of}} Ca 2 +, and failed to secrete these proteins to the culture supernatant. Overproduction of YopM in these mutants failed to restore YopM export, showing that the mutations had a direct effect on secretion. The protein products of yscC, yscD, and yscG were identified and localized by immunoblot analysis. YscC was localized to the outer membrane of Y. pestis, while YscD was found in the inner membrane. YscG was distributed equally between the soluble and total membrane fractions. Double mutants were characterized to assess where YscC and YscD act in low-Ca 2 + response (LCR) regulation. lcrH::cat-yscC and lcrH::cat-yscD double mutants were constitutively induced for expression of V antigen and YopM; however, these proteins were not exported. This finding showed that the ysc mutations did not directly decrease induction of LCR <b>stimulon</b> genes. In contrast, lcrE-yscC, lcrG-yscC, lcrE-yscD, and lcrG-yscD double mutants as well as an lcrE-lcrD double mutant expressed only basal levels of V antigen and YopM and also failed to secrete these proteins to the culture supernatant. These results indicated that a functional LCR secretion system was necessary for high-level expression of LCR <b>stimulon</b> proteins in the lcrE and lcrG mutants but not in an lcrH::cat mutant. Possible models of regulation which incorporate these results are discussed...|$|E
