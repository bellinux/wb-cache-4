5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> father determining the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child.|$|E

The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
