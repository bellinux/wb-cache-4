5|$|In Cocoon, the {{citizens}} of the town of Bodhum are being evicted, or Purged, after coming in contact with something from Pulse. Over the course of the game, the player is shown flashbacks of the events of the previous thirteen days, which began when a fal'Cie from Pulse was discovered near Bodhum. Lightning's sister Serah had found the fal'Cie from Pulse and been changed into a l'Cie by it. Lightning and Sazh derail a Purge train bound for Pulse in an attempt to save Serah. As Snow leads his resistance group NORA to rescue the Purge exiles, several of them are killed. Heading to the fal'Cie Anima to save Serah, Snow is joined by two of the exiles: Hope and Vanille. The two parties meet at the fal'Cie, and find Serah just as <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> crystal. Anima then brands them as l'Cie and they are cast out into a different part of Cocoon.

Lightning ends up traveling with Hope. During their time together, Lightning inadvertently summons Odin, and she unknowingly supports Hope's plan to assassinate Snow by protecting and training him. Throughout the game, Lightning struggles to deal with her nature as a l'Cie, her anger at being made Cocoon's enemy, and her guilt at disbelieving Serah's story. After overcoming these issues, she acknowledges Snow's relationship with Serah and his faith that they will restore her. When they kill the Sanctum fal'Cie Orphan to save Cocoon, Lightning, Serah and the party except for Vanille and Fang are allowed to return to their normal lives: Vanille and Fang form a crystal pillar to stop Cocoon from colliding with Gran Pulse.|$|E
