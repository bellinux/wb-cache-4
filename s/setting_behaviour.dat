The study adopted a descriptive research design to select three hundred secondary school students. Three instruments used were used for the study, emotional knowledge, self efficacy scale, parental involvement scale and Goal <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> scales. Three research Questions were raised and answered in the study at 0. 05 level of significant. The results showed that there was significant relationship among the three independent variables (emotional knowledge, self efficacy and parental involvement) on adolescents ’ goal <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> and that the three independent variables (emotional knowledge, self efficacy and parental involvement) both jointly and relatively contributed significantly to the prediction adolescents ’ goal <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour.</b> On the basis of these findings, it was stressed and advocated that there is need to enlighten the adolescents on how to improve on their emotional knowledge, self efficacy and parental involvement,, because their level of efficacy has a long way to influence their goal <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> and general wellbeing, and that the parents need to be trained on the need to be actively involved in the adolescents ’ development and give adequate emotional caring and guidance in terms of goal setting in the society.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Widespread {{empirical}} evidence of price discrimination in markets for {{goods and services}} suggests that national markets should be viewed as segmented rather than integrated. Yet, this research is almost entirely driven by studies of price <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> in developed countries. This thesis extends the empirical literature by providing new evidence on price <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> and product market integration in developing countries using a unique data set of monthly product prices at the retail outlet level or regional level for Lesotho, South Africa and Botswana over the period 2002 to 2009. The thesis is comprised of three main chapters. The first chapter provides evidence that none of the time-dependent or state dependent theories of price <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> are entirely consistent with the empirical features found in the data. Therefore, it is difficult to find one theory that can explain pricing behaviour economy-wide. Improvements can be made on the current theories of price setting to incorporate different characteristics of price setting that are specific to developed and developing countries. The second chapter examines the relationship between inflation and the frequency of price change and suggests that goods are characterised by state-dependent pricing andservices are characterised by time-dependent pricing, consistent with the presence of menucosts in goods and not in services. The dominance of South African retail chains in the Lesotho retail sector affects price <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> in Lesotho. Product markets are more integrated, between Lesotho and South Africa, in the more tradable sectors. The differentia limpact of local, national and regional inflation on price <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> suggests that product markets remain segmented, despite Lesotho’s membership of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and the Common Monetary Area (CMA) ...|$|E

The significant sector gaps do not vanish after controlling for relevant firm characteristics influencing the incidence of wage freezes and wage cuts, notably coverage by collective agreements {{and the degree of}} price competition on the product market.

40|$|MBA Thesis (WBS) There is {{currently}} no significant research that explores {{the influence that}} key risk indicators (KRIs) have on managers‟ goal <b>setting</b> <b>behaviours</b> in the financial industry in South Africa. A tremendous amount of {{research has been conducted}} on both KRIs as a formal operational risk monitoring tool and on managers‟ goal setting behaviours; however, there is limited literature that explores this relationship. As a result, senior management and Operational Risk Managers are unaware of the constructs that affect this dynamic which limits their ability to cultivate or maintain an acceptable risk profile, one which would propel an organisation forward in its pursuit to remain sustainable and profitable while also adhering to regulatory obligations. This research report aims to provide clarity to senior management and Operational Risk Managers on the influence that KRIs have on managers‟ goal <b>setting</b> <b>behaviours.</b> A manifest and content analysis was conducted on the responses obtained from an in-depth semi-structured interview process. It involved 15 respondents who were all managers responsible for the management of KRIs within their respective business units at Investec Bank Limited. The constructs identified during the literature review were explored to provide an understanding of their influence the KRIs and on managers‟ subsequent goal <b>setting</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The research findings indicated that some constructs considered had an influence on managers‟ KRI process and goal <b>setting</b> <b>behaviours.</b> All constructs are discussed in depth in Chapter four of this research report. The key message of this report is that financial institutions should continuously consider all the constructs that were investigated and align their internal KRI process. This is to ensure they reap the full benefits of the ORM process in their quest to manage their risk profiles more effectively. The findings of this research report will assist managers in leveraging their risk management tool to better manage organisational risk profiles. By realising the full benefits of a sophisticated risk management framework, all depositors, debtors, shareholders and clients are protected and the stability and effectiveness of the financial system considerably enhance...|$|R

This is the first paper to {{provide detailed information on}} the pressures, manner and frequency with which Irish firms adjust their output prices. Using survey information from almost a thousand Irish firms, we present a number of stylised facts on price <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour.</b> One of the first of these relates to the level of control firms have over their pricing strategy – the most common approach for firms is to set a price based on costs and a self-determined profit margin.

The most distinctive feature of the Dutch survey is its broad coverage {{of the business community}} (seven sectors and seven size classes), including the service sector and small firms.

Small firms in particular adopt more rigid pricing policies, and the weaker the competition a firm faces, the stickier a company's price will be. Furthermore, we find that wholesale and retail prices are more flexible than those for business-to-business services. The survey suggests that explicit and informal contracting are the most important sources of price stickiness. Menu costs and psychological pricing-two prominent explanations of price stickiness in the literature-are of minor importance.

40|$|This paper {{discovers the}} driving forces behind firms' {{decisions}} to adjust prices by using various panel logit models, which explain {{the probability of}} observing price change by a broad set of exogenous variables. The results of the models show that the consumer price formation in Latvia {{is a combination of}} both state-dependent and time-dependent behaviour. On the one hand, frequency of price changes depends on inflation, demand conditions, and the size of last price changes. On the other hand, we observe some elements of time-dependent price setting, e. g. price truncation and strong seasonal pattern. We also find several important differences in the price <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> for cases of price increases and decreases. The fact that frequency of price changes in Latvia depends on inflation as well as demand and supply conditions could be seen as a prerequisite for faster price adjustment process in the event of distortions in the economy. In the case of economic imbalances, statedependent price formation changes flexibility of prices and ensures a faster adjustment process towards equilibrium. price <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour,</b> Latvia's consumer prices, frequency of price change, sales, time-dependent pricing, state-dependent pricing, panel logit model...|$|E

40|$|Since the Finnish {{unemployment}} rate has rocketed {{to a very}} high level {{in the beginning of the}} 1990 ?s it is worth to study to what extent the {{unemployment rate}} prevailing today is due to cyclical or to structural reasons. In this paper we try to estimate two different indicators that represent the structural part of unemployment, the NAWRU and the NAIRU. The NAWRU (non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment) measures the structural unemployment simply by relating unemployment to wage inflation. The estimated NAWRU follows very closely the actual unemployment in Finland indicating that it is not the proper measure for the structural unemployment. The NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) in this paper is based on structural estimates of the price <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> of firms and the wage <b>setting</b> <b>behaviour</b> of trade unions. The estimated NAIRU was at a low level up to the end of eighties. Since then both the actual unemployment rate and the NAIRU have rocketed.
