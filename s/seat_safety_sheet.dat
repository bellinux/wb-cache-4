The required exposure scenarios for substances need to be attached as an annex to the <b>safety</b> data <b>sheet.</b> Suppliers of mixtures, who do not need to prepare exposure scenarios themselves, can choose: either they can attach the relevant exposure scenarios as an annex to their <b>safety</b> data <b>sheets</b> or they can incorporate the relevant items of information in sections 1 to 16.|$|R

40|$|<b>Safety</b> Data <b>Sheets</b> are {{the primary}} source of hazard {{information}} on chemical substances and mixtures and are used to inform risk assessments. It is imperative to ascertain the quality of this primary source of information in informing risk based decision making. The content of <b>Safety</b> Data <b>Sheets</b> (SDS) is governed by regulatory requirements outlined under the Globally Harmonised System for the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). However, regulation in itself does not provide assurance {{of the quality of the}} content of the SDS. This study assesses and creates an awareness of the quality of <b>Safety</b> Data <b>Sheets</b> and establishes the criteria for ranking the quality of various sections in the SDS. 200 <b>Safety</b> Data <b>Sheets</b> have been selected from the aerospace sector and assessed for their quality. A review of the 200 SDS has identified significant statistical differences between the various sections of the SDS and the quality of information between hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals.

40|$|Motor vehicle {{injuries}} {{are one of}} the leading causes of preventable deaths in children in the United States. The increased use of <b>safety</b> <b>seats,</b> booster seats, and seat belts have been extremely efficacious in reducing morbidity and mortality in this population. However, there is evidence suggesting that children ages 4 and older {{are less likely to be}} adequately secured in a car than younger children, and subsequently have worse outcomes in motor vehicle accidents. While there is copious information on car <b>seat</b> <b>safety</b> in infants and toddlers, parents often find themselves confused about the appropriate type of car safety mechanism for their old children.

The problem is how to measure the institutionalization of partisan <b>seat</b> <b>safety</b> in a time-series. The model proposed by Sprague is somewhat awkward and complicated in measuring it.

50|$|A Material <b>Safety</b> Data <b>Sheet</b> (MSDS), <b>Safety</b> Data <b>Sheet</b> (SDS), or Product <b>Safety</b> Data <b>Sheet</b> (PSDS) is an {{important}} component of product stewardship and occupational safety and health. These are required by agencies such as OSHA in its Hazard Communication Standard, 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200. It provides workers with ways to allow them to work in a safe manner and gives them physical data (melting point, boiling point, flash point, etc.), toxicity, health effects, first aid, reactivity, storage, disposal, protective equipment, and spill-handling procedures. The MSDSs differ from country to country, as different countries have different regulations. In some jurisdictions, it is compulsory for the SDS to state the chemical's risks, safety, and effect on the environment.|$|R
40|$|Child <b>safety</b> <b>seats</b> are {{the best}} {{practice}} for protecting child occupants. In western world, a significant reduction of child deaths in motor vehicle crashes has occurred over the past years. However, the use of child <b>safety</b> <b>seats</b> will be obligatory in Turkey from 2010 onwards. We aimed to determine the prevalence of <b>safety</b> <b>seat</b> use and survey the opinions of parents about children <b>safety</b> <b>seat</b> use in traffic. Materials and methods: A survey was conducted in Kars province of Turkey. A questionnaire was handed out to parents who were employees in a university. The first part of questionnaire was concerned with the personal properties of participants. The second part was designed to evaluate the level of parents’ knowledge on child <b>safety</b> <b>seat.</b> Results: Of the 600 questionnaires distributed, 516 (86 %) were returned and {{included in the final}} analysis. This study showed that 266 participants were having children and automobile. The ownership of child <b>safety</b> <b>seat</b> was only 13. 5 % among them. The parents reported that the lack of knowledge about child <b>safety</b> <b>seats</b> was the main reason for not having <b>safety</b> <b>seats.</b> Majority of parents stated that they would be more careful in the future about child safety in traffic. Conclusion: This study showed that most parents were uninformed about the necessity of child <b>safety</b> <b>seats.</b> The authorities have to develop new strategies to increase the rate of child <b>safety</b> <b>seat</b> use.
