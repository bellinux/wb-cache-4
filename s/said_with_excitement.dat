6000|$|Mr. Click {{stared at}} me in a scared sort of a way, but said nothing until we had walked a street's length. He then stopped short, and <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> {{on the part of}} his forefinger: ...|$|E
6000|$|Somerset as {{a friend}} of the family had had a seat {{reserved}} for him next to that of Mrs. Goodman, and turning to her he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> some <b>excitement,</b> 'I understood that Mr. Mild had agreed to take that part?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Ernest {{bent his}} head slowly. 'You're {{very kind to}} argue out the matter with me so, Mr. Lancaster,' he <b>said,</b> {{trembling}} <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b> 'Yes, I suppose I must bury my scruples. I'll write a leader about these Bodahls, and let {{you deal with it}} afterwards as you think proper.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the bee-hives," [...] <b>said</b> Flower, pale <b>with</b> <b>excitement,</b> as {{he heard}} Mrs. Tipping and Dick {{coming up from the}} cellar. [...] "Make haste; {{somebody}} might take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{both come}} down," [...] <b>said</b> Ned, dancing <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> {{on the slope}} underneath, while Nat held out his arms, in the wild hope of {{breaking}} the fall.|$|R
6000|$|I heard a {{slipping}} and {{clatter of}} pebbles near me, and discovered Fred Maxim at my side. [...] "Look!" [...] he <b>said,</b> hoarse <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b> [...] "Already!" [...] He {{pointed to a}} string of dim little figures galloping helter-skelter over the neck and down {{the gap in the}} hills towards us.|$|R
6000|$|Her eyes, still {{resting on}} his face, assumed an {{expression}} of suspicious inquiry, which Percy was entirely {{at a loss to}} understand. Suddenly, she started to her feet, as if a new idea had occurred to her. [...] "Wait here," [...] she <b>said,</b> flushing <b>with</b> <b>excitement,</b> [...] "till I come back: I insist on it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only in name apparently," [...] <b>said</b> Clym <b>with</b> rising <b>excitement.</b> [...] "I {{believe she}} means to elope tonight with Wildeve. I am {{just going to}} look to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{remember}} it, auntie," [...] I <b>said,</b> wearied out <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b> [...] "But I {{think you}} did wrong, all the same. In a case like this, it's everybody's first duty to tell all he knows, {{in the interests of}} justice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Irony?" [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> all the <b>excitement</b> {{he could}} have {{imagined}} or desired. [...] "Nothing of the kind. It's a leading, {{if ever there was}} one. It will be the easiest thing in the world to find Burnamy. And out there she can sit on her steps!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be, father," [...] <b>said</b> Benjy, <b>with</b> {{increasing}} <b>excitement,</b> [...] "but {{nobody ever}} saw {{a bit of}} seaweed swim with the activity of a gigantic eel like that. Why, I have counted its coils as they rise and sink, and I'm quite sure it's {{a hundred and fifty}} yards long if it's an inch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I perish {{under your}} hand, O Rajah of the sea, if my words are not true!" [...] <b>said</b> Babalatchi, <b>with</b> {{reckless}} <b>excitement.</b> [...] "You {{are here in}} the midst of your enemies. He the greatest. Abdulla would do nothing without him, and I could do nothing without Abdulla. Strike me--so that you strike all!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{spite of}} the limited product {{selection}} and minimal customer service, the first No Frills store, which advertised “the lowest overall food prices in Toronto”, proved successful from the initial launch. Opening day drew more shoppers than the store could handle:“The rush never stopped,” Robert St. Jean, eastern Ontario division manager said in an interview. “We had to close the doors at 10:30 this morning and let people in as other people left,” he <b>said,</b> giggling <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> as cash registers rang in the background. “We’re really excited about it... really excited,” he said from the store’s second floor at Victoria Park and St. Clair Avenues." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{got some}} of his band <b>with</b> him," [...] <b>said</b> Jack, thrilled <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b> [...] "Mescal, they're down off the upper range, and grazing along easy. The wind favors us. That whistle was just plain fight, judging from what Naab told me of wild stallions. He came to the hilltop, and whistled down {{defiance}} to any horse, wild or tame, that might be below. I'll slip round through the cedars, and block the trail {{leading up to the}} other range, and you and Piute close the gate of our trail at this end. Then send Piute down to tell Naab we've got Silvermane." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is as bad. It is, indeed, {{the same}} thing. Why should {{she want to}} conquer {{what we call the}} world? She ought to want to {{entertain}} my friends because they are my friends; and if from my public position I have more so-called friends than would trouble me in a happier condition of private life, why, then, she must entertain more people. There should be nothing beyond that. The idea of conquering people, as you call it, by feeding them, is to me abominable. If it goes on it will drive me mad. I shall have to give up everything, because I cannot bear the burden." [...] This he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> more <b>excitement,</b> <b>with</b> stronger passion, than his friend had ever seen in him before; {{so much so that the}} old Duke was frightened. [...] "I ought never to have been where I am," [...] said the Prime Minister, getting up from his chair and walking about the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Behold {{the goddess}} and do homage," [...] <b>said</b> Juanna <b>with</b> mock solemnity, {{although}} Leonard {{could see that}} she was trembling <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
6000|$|His {{incredible}} rashness silenced his wife. There he stood; {{his round}} eyes {{staring at the}} cheque-book, his fat cheeks quivering <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b> [...] "You mustn't do it," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> a first and last outburst of courage. [...] "Give me a minute, my dear--oh, good gracious, give me a minute!" ...|$|R
6000|$|To {{this brief}} summary, given <b>with</b> much <b>excitement,</b> Miss Deemas listened with quiet composure, and then <b>said</b> <b>with</b> grim sarcasm, and very slowly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're in wrong, Shorty," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> cold deliberation. [...] "I'm {{not going}} to throw eggs at her. Why, man," [...] he cried, <b>with</b> growing <b>excitement,</b> [...] "I {{want to give them}} eggs to her, on a platter, shirred--that's the way she likes 'em." ...|$|R
60|$|Powers, though {{outwardly}} cool, {{was trembling}} <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
60|$|His secretary, still quivering <b>with</b> <b>excitement,</b> again {{answered}} yes.|$|R
60|$|Sophy Gerard said nothing. Her {{cheeks were}} pink <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
60|$|Grahame devoured every word. His {{eyes lit}} up <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
60|$|Barker sprang after him, {{sword in}} hand, and shaking <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
60|$|Betty had whipped round again. Her {{face was}} white <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
60|$|My host now {{appeared}} to be almost beside himself <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
60|$|Amenche said nothing, but {{her cheeks}} were flushed <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> and pleasure.|$|R
60|$|At the Gildersleeves', too, {{the house}} that day was alive <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|And <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> it was barking savagely, and leaping like a frog; ...|$|R
60|$|And {{wondering}} at {{what their}} eyes had seen, {{they went down}} into the city and purchased garments and clothed themselves. And when they would have passed on, the merchant bit the coins which they had given him, with his teeth, and turned them about and looked curiously upon them, and cast them upon his counter, and listened if they rang; and then he said, These be bogus. And they said, Depart thou to Hades, and went their way. When they were come to their houses, they recognized them, albeit they seemed old and mean; and they rejoiced, and were glad. They ran to the doors, and knocked, and strangers opened, and looked inquiringly upon them. And they <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> great <b>excitement,</b> while their hearts beat high, and the color in their faces came and went, Where is my father? Where is my mother? Where are Dionysius and Serapion, and Pericles, and Decius? And the strangers that opened said, We know not these. The Seven said, How, you know them not? How long have ye dwelt here, and whither are they gone that dwelt here before ye? And the strangers said, Ye play upon us with a jest, young men; we and our fathers have sojourned under these roofs these six generations; the names ye utter rot upon the tombs, and they that bore them have run their brief race, have laughed and sung, have borne the sorrows and the weariness that were allotted them, and are at rest; for nine-score years the summers have come and gone, and the autumn leaves have fallen, since the roses faded out of their cheeks and they laid them to sleep with the dead.|$|R
60|$|He leant {{with his}} arms across the table, his eyes {{glittering}} <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{sat down}} on the side of my bed, {{actually}} quivering <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Shelby sat {{perfectly}} silent, pale <b>with</b> <b>excitement,</b> while Sam {{told his}} story.|$|R
60|$|Trembling <b>with</b> <b>excitement,</b> I {{watched him}} push the hand round as he described.|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} sat down round the fire, all their faces radiant <b>with</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|R
60|$|Our hearts beat <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> at {{the very}} thought of seeing human faces again.|$|R
