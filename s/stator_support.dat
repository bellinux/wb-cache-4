40|$|With {{increasing}} {{fuel prices}} and {{growing interest in}} environmentally friendly transportation the aerospace industry has set ambitious targets for all electric flight. At {{the same time there}} is growing interest in the rotorcraft market that is expected to grow significantly in the next decades. Although the technology for all-electric flight is not yet mature, hybrid solutions for aircraft and rotorcraft are suggested. A hybrid helicopter concept has been suggested by Airbus Group Innovations, which is designed to reduce the operational fuel costs through a serial hybrid powertrain. One of the main components of such a powertrain is the main rotor electric drive. The main limiting factor of using electrical machines for aerospace propulsion however is the limited torque density of electrical machines. Electrical machines consist of the active material and structural support material that keeps a machine together and both parts are of great importance in achieving high torque densities. A solution consisting of a high pole number, segmented stator, large diameter, low air-gap, flux switching machine has been suggested as the main motor of the hybrid helicopter. Stator segments of this machine are individually suspended utilizing air-bearings. This thesis focuses on examining the behavior of such a <b>stator</b> <b>support</b> concept and the feasibility of achieving a very low air-gap in a large diameter machine through coupled electromagnetic and structural finite element simulations. First an electromagnetic finite element model of the machine is created and a thorough analysis of different resulting forces for various air-gap lengths and operating conditions is conducted. After the electromagnetic forces are investigated, a structural model of the machine and the existing support structure is created. Structural behavior is examined with a weak coupling between the structural and the electromagnetic models. Modal analysis of the structure is also conducted to get an overview of the dynamic behavior. The simulation results in standstill are then compared to experimental measurements. Finally, using the conclusions of the investigation, a new lightweight support concept is designed and analyzed. Total machine weight and performance estimation with this new concept is performed.

40|$|The stator {{inlet flow}} field in a {{multistage}} compressor varies in the pitchwise direction due to upstream vane wakes {{and how those}} wakes interact with the upstream rotor tip leakage flows. If successive vane rows have the same count, then vane clocking {{can be used to}} position the downstream vane in the optimum circumferential position for minimum vane loss. This paper explores vane clocking effects on the suction side vane boundary layer development by measuring the quasi-wall shear stress on the downstream vane at three spanwise locations. Comparisons between the boundary layer transition on Stator 1 and Stator 2 are made to emphasize the impact of rotor-rotor interactions which are not present for Stator 1 and yet contribute significantly to transition on Stator 2. Vane clocking can move the boundary layer transition in the path between the wakes by up to 24 % of the suction side length at midspan by altering the influence of the Rotor 1 wakes in the 3 /rev modulation from rotor-rotor interactions. The boundary layer near the vane hub and tip experiences earlier transition and separation due to interactions with the secondary flows along the shrouded endwalls.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Rub-impact between rotors and stators is a widely studied phenomenon due to its deleterious effects on rotating machinery. When large amplitudes of vibration are developed in rotors due to either imbalance or triggered instabilities, the possibility of contact between the rotor elements and static components of these machines will always arise. Therefore, rub rings or rotordynamic bumpers are incorporated to protect hardware, such as seals, compressor blades and bearings by preventing abnormal contact conditions of parts in motion with stators. In this project, flexibly supported rub rings have been tested to evaluate their capability to reduce the amplitude of vibration developed by a rotor running throughout its first critical speed. New materials with improved characteristics against wearing and suitable coefficients of friction were selected to build the rub rings. Materials with low coefficients of friction for the rub rings were used in an attempt to avoid the generation of dry friction whirl, which is a deleterious operating condition of rotating machinery undergoing rubbing effects. For the rub rings support, a material made out of woven metal strands was used. This material has shown promising characteristics providing predictable stiffness and damping for other applications such as bearing dampers. The testing of the proposed bumper design, carried out for different rotor configurations, showed a particular rotor response characteristic. For most of the cases the bumper reduced the rotor response amplitude at its critical speed during the coast-downs. However, for the run-ups the bumper performed in a less regular and effective manner. After investigating some of the bumper design aspects that would cause this characteristic it was concluded that the system was showing a behavior such as has been described in the literature for vibrating systems with a hardening spring characteristic. Computer simulations support the experimental results and this explanation. The mathematical model is a single-wheel rotor mounted on flexible supports with the wheel surrounded by a flexibly <b>supported</b> <b>stator</b> simulating the presence of the bumper...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to provide {{additional}} data to supplement the work reported in NASA/CR- 2015 - 218868 (Berdanier and Key, 2015 b). The aim of that project was to characterize the fundamental flow physics and the overall performance effects due to increased rotor tip clearance heights in axial compressors. Data have been collected in the three-stage axial research compressor at Purdue University with a specific focus on analyzing the multistage effects resulting from the tip leakage flow. Three separate rotor tip clearances were studied with nominal tip clearance gaps of 1. 5 percent, 3. 0 percent, and 4. 0 percent based on a constant annulus height. Overall compressor performance was previously investigated at four corrected speedlines (100 percent, 90 percent, 80 percent, and 68 percent) {{for each of the}} three tip clearance configurations. This study extends the previously published results to include detailed steady and time-resolved pressure data at two loading conditions, nominal loading (NL) and high loading (HL), on the 100 percent corrected speedline for the intermediate clearance level (3. 0 percent). Steady detailed radial traverses of total pressure at the exit of each <b>stator</b> row are <b>supported</b> by flow visualization techniques to identify regions of flow recirculation and separation. Furthermore, detailed radial traverses of time-resolved total pressures at the exit of each rotor row have been measured with a fast-response pressure probe. These data were combined with existing three-component velocity measurements to identify a novel technique for calculating blockage in a multistage compressor. Time-resolved static pressure measurements have been collected over the rotor tips for all rotors with each of the three tip clearance configurations for up to five loading conditions along the 100 percent corrected speedline using fast-response piezoresistive pressure sensors. These time-resolved static pressure measurements reveal new knowledge about the trajectory of the tip leakage flow through the rotor passage. Further, these data extend previous measurements identifying a modulation of the tip leakage flow due to upstream stator wake propagation. Finally, a novel instrumentation technique has been implemented to measure pressures in the shrouded stator cavities. These data provide boundary conditions relating to the flow across the shrouded stator knife seal teeth. Moreover, the utilization of fast-response pressure sensors provides a new look at the time-resolved pressure field, leading to instantaneous differential pressures across the seal teeth. Ultimately, the data collected for this project represent a unique data set which contributes to build a better understanding of the tip leakage flow field and its associated loss mechanisms. These data will facilitate future engine design goals leading to small blade heights in the rear stages of high pressure compressors and aid in the development of new blade designs which are desensitized to the performance penalties attributed to rotor tip leakage flows...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{phenomena}} of whip and whirl for a rigid rotor contacting at two bearing locations. The idea originated from an anemometer {{consisting of a}} rotor with an elastically <b>supported</b> <b>stator</b> undergoing the phenomena of dry friction whip and whirl at the two bushing contacts. To analyze the behavior, a mathematical model similar to the anemometer is developed and analyzed assuming two possible solutions, Mode 1 (normal reaction forces in phase at two contacts) and Mode 2 (normal reaction forces out of phase at two contacts). Analytical solutions are only possible for the models with same RCl (Radius to Clearance ratio) at the two rub locations. A simulation model is constructed using the Texas A&M University (TAMU) Turbomachinery Laboratory rotordynamics software suite XLTRC? comprised of Timoshenko beam finite elements to form multiple degrees of freedom rotor and stator models. The nonlinear connections at the rub surface are modeled using Hunt and Crossley?s contact model with coulomb friction. Dry friction simulations are performed for three separate models depending on the rotor?s mass disk location {{with respect to the}} contact locations. The three models used have (1) Disk at center location (2) Disk at 3 / 4 location (3) Disk at overhang location. The adequacy of the analytical solution is investigated using the above simulations. Also, cases are explored where the general assumed solution would not solve the mathematical model, e. g. different RCl ratios at the two contacts. Simulations are performed for increasing as well as decreasing running speeds. There is partial agreement between simulation predictions and the analytical solutions for the cases with the mass center at centered and at 3 / 4 location. First, whirl-to-whip transitions occur at near the combine rotor-stator bounce frequency for both disk at center and disk at 3 / 4 location. The case with overhang mass disk predicts the two contacts to whip and at different frequencies simultaneously. Neither of the analytical solutions predicts a case where precession occurs at two different frequencies at the two contact points. Predictions for models with different RCl on the Backward Precessional (BP) graph imitate whirling. The BP graph predicts increasing BP frequency with increasing rotor speeds which is a characteristic of whirling, whereas investigation of individual contact velocities suggest that they are slipping at all conditions, one of them slipping more than the other netting a whirling like motion. For the overhang model with different RCl, apart from whipping at different frequency the two contacts also whirl at different frequencies corresponding to the RCl at the respective contacts. Simulations for decreasing rotor speed predict jump down from whirl- to-whip different BP frequency as compared to the jump up from whip-to-whirl for the speed up...|$|R
40|$|Summary A {{hierarchical}} {{overview of}} the currently available data storage systems for desktop computer systems can be visualised as a pyramid in which the height represents both the price per bit and the access rate. The width of the pyramid represents {{the capacity of the}} medium. At the bottom slow, cost effective mass data storage media (tape) and at the top fast, expensive media for storage of small amounts of data (FLASH, MRAM) can be found, while the middle section is the domain of the hard disk. Although hard disk development is rapidly reaching the limits of the current design, none of the current storage media can take its place. A new type of data storage technology, called probe storage or probe recording, is currently under development. This technology uses the parallelism of a large array of read/write heads in its advantage. The probe array is positioned above a data storage medium and small movements of either the array or the medium position the probes for reading and writing. This technology would ultimately bring forth a system that stores data at the densities exceeding that of hard disks, but with the form factor of FLASH. The capacity of such a system is limited {{by the size of the}} probe array. Because the realisation of a probe array of several square centimeters would be difficult and too expensive, such a system can not substitute a hard disk. In this work, the first small step is taken towards an alternative that decouples the array size from the size of the storage area, so that a large storage area (tile) of several tens of cm 2 can be realised. This opens up the possibility to create probe recording systems with the capacity of a hard disk. In the approach, the probe array is divided into small sub-arrays that are distributed over the surface on which data is stored. The need for large actuators to move the probe array is eliminated and instead, each sub-array is equipped with a wirelessly powered, 2 -DOF actuator, fabricated by silicon micromachining, enabling it to move freely over the tile like a miniature storage robot or StoBot. Probe based data storage without a fixed positioning system results in a more effective use of surface area and opens up new degrees of freedom in data handling. The StoBot architecture is fully scalable in size and the number of active StoBots on the tile, as well as the number of probes per StoBot. In case one StoBot 200 Summary ceases to function, others can take its place and ensure the functionality of the system. Intelligent file systems can be designed in which the number of active StoBots is adapted to the system load and power requirements. The first milestone on the way towards such a system is to develop a propulsion system for a StoBot. The propulsion system requires a microactuator that can be operated wirelessly and is able to move in arbitrary directions over the tile. In this research, the suitability of wireless and steerable Scratch Drive Actuators (SDA) and a 2 -DOF version of the Image Charge Stepping Actuator (ICSA) is investigated. Both these actuators operate by electrostatic forces and although the principles of operation are very different, both actuators can be wirelessly driven and operated in 2 D motion. Scratch Drive Actuators (SDA) This type of actuator is shaped like a capital L, rotated 90 ° clockwise. The long side of the L (plate) can be electrostatically attracted, and bent. This bending makes the end of the short side of the L (bushing) move forward. When the attraction stops the long side relaxes and the resulting movement is converted into forward motion. A qualitative model for the SDA has been developed, based on the cyclic motion of the actuator plate. If the actuation part of its cycle would be equal and opposite to the relaxation part, the SDA would be unable to output power. Therefore, it should go through a hysteresis loop. Two sources of hysteresis in the actuation cycle of the SDA have been identified. The first is based on the influence of the friction force of the bushing on the curvature of the plate. Because the this friction force always opposite to the direction of movement, the curvature of the plate during actuation therefore differs from the curvature during relaxation. The second springs from plastic deformation of the bushing under load. Due to the high pressures involved, the surface of the bushing deforms, thereby raising the coefficient of friction. The behaviour of this friction coefficient may introduce hysteresis. Although several parameters of the model can, within the scope of this thesis, not be determined, the model provides a new view on how an SDA moves. Several versions of the SDA, including wireless designs, were realised. Experiments with these devices showed that an SDA is subject to wear, which confirms the assumption that the bushing plastically deforms under load. A small investigation into SDA wear showed that the SDA, and especially the bushing, wears down rapidly, which led to the conclusion that the SDA is better suited for short-term use than for long-term use. This aspect makes it a less suitable candidate for StoBot propulsion. Summary 201 Image Charge Stepping Actuators (ICSA) The propulsion system of this type of actuator is based on the forces that electric fields exert on (semi) permanent charges in a poor conductor. The actuator consists of a slider and a stator. The slider might be just a piece of poorly conducting material or a complete StoBot. The stator is equipped with interdigital three-phase electrodes, on which the slider is placed. First, a static driving voltage charges the slider, then a dynamic driving voltage is applied to the stator to make the actuator move. Where the three-phase <b>stator</b> <b>supports</b> only 1 D driving, a nine-phase stator was constructed to enable 2 D driving. A model has been developed, which allows the calculation of propulsive and lift forces working on the slider. Together with this model, a macro version of the ICSA with an electrode pitch of 0. 4 mm, based on printed circuit board technology, has been designed and realised. The realisation included a control system and a linear high voltage amplifier. Measurements with this actuator showed that its stepping behaviour has excellent repeatability and a top speed of 1 m/s at 2. 5 kHz driving frequency. The use of this scale model showed that several optimisations can be performed to improve the performance of this device. According to the theory, miniaturisation of the actuator would be beneficial, because with decreasing size, the strength of the electric field of the macro version can be realised at lower voltages. Miniaturised designs of the ICSA, based on surface micromachining and with a minimum electrode pitch of 4 μm, were designed and realised. These devices did not exhibit the expected forward movement and several explanations for this phenomenon can be given. These are an incorrect resistance of the device material, stiction effects, shielding of the electric fields by the material underneath the electrodes or an electrode to slider distance that is too small. Wafer to wafer transfer of microactuators An important aspect of the production of a future StoBot drive will be the integration of the recording medium and the StoBots. Because of cost effectiveness and because the fabrication processes may not be compatible, the StoBots and the recording medium will be fabricated separately. To meet this demand, a method has been developed to transport wireless microactuators from the wafer of origin (source) to another surface (target) without the use of sophisticated equipment. This method supports the transfer of groups of actuators as well as individual actuators. The technique requires that the actuators are fabricated up side down, fully released and connected to the source wafer by springs. The target surface should be equipped with electrodes to generate electrostatic clamping force. A die with finished actuators is picked up, turned up side down and brought into contact 202 Summary with the target wafer. At that moment, the actuators can be clamped by electrostatic force. When the source die is retracted, the clamped actuators remain on the target surface, making the suspending springs break at a predefined point. The use of electrostatic forces makes the transfer method independent of the type of actuator. Conductive actuators can be clamped by either a DC voltage between source and target wafer or by an AC voltage on the electrodes of the target surface. To clamp an non-conductive actuator, a DC voltage on the electrodes can be used. Experiments showed out that both the SDA and the ICSA can be transferred. The SDA’s could not be tested, but an optical microscopic inspection and inspection by SEM revealed no damaged. Optical inspection and experiments with transferred ICSA’s showed that these devices were undamaged and capable of movement. Outlook With the development of a suitable actuator and a method to transfer this actuator from one wafer to another, the first small steps are made on the road towards a StoBot drive. Future research on StoBots will be directed at reading and writing of data, the communication of StoBots with the rest of the drive and the integration of a small array of simple probes on a wireless actuator such as the ICSA. The flat, almost featureless shape of the miniaturised ICSA should facilitate the integration of simple electronics...|$|R
