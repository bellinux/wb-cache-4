Hemolymph osmolality was high in the intermolt and early premolt stages, but started to decrease prior to ecdysis through to postmolt stages A and B. Changes in Na? and Cl- ion concentrations paralleled those in hemolymph osmolality.

While control calves were fed basis dietary with no additives (0 CaP), other treatment calves were fed basis dietary supplementation with CaP at 50 (5 CaP) or 100 (10 CaP) g kg- 1 dry matter. The experiment lasted 160 d and was divided into three feeding stages: <b>Stage</b> 1 (<b>d</b> 0 to 30), <b>Stage</b> 2 (<b>d</b> 31 to 90), and <b>Stage</b> 3 (<b>d</b> 91 to 160). Six calves from each group were randomly selected and slaughtered on days 30, 90, and 160 when at the conclusion of each experimental feeding stage. The BW of calves increased with 10 CaP after feeding 90 d, whereas it increased with 5 CaP and 10 CaP at feeding 120 d and 160 d compared to 0 CaP. The 10 CaP group improved average daily gain (ADG) of calves at <b>stage</b> 2, and <b>d</b> 120 - 160 of stage 3 compared with the 0 CaP group. The ADG of 5 CaP was greater than the 0 CaP group only at 120 - 160 <b>d</b> of <b>stage</b> 3 compared with the 0 CaP group. The results of feed efficiency were in agreed with ADG as no dry matter intake difference at all stages of growth period.

In conclusion, dietary supplementation with calcium propionate at the tested doses caused a beneficial effect in the growth performance and gastrointestinal tract traits of Jersey calves, thus to add 10 % CaP before feeding 90 days was better and 5 % CaP supplementation was expected at the period for feeding 90 to 160 d...|$|R
