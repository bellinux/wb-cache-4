40|$|Examination {{of cooked}} pre-rigor muscle by TEM (transmission {{electron}} microscopy) and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) revealed that all cookery methods {{resulted in the}} development of <b>supercontraction</b> bands alternating with areas showing tissue fragmentation and tearing. Microwave cookery produced smaller and less dense <b>supercontraction</b> nodes in pre-rigor muscle with less tearing and fragmentation but more fibre separation. Although cold-shortened pre-rigor muscle cooked by all methods also exhibited <b>supercontraction</b> bands with some tearing and fragmentation in adjacent sarcomeres, the samples cooked by microwaves showed a more uniform repeating pattern of small stretched areas alternating with dense contracted areas. Cooking of muscle in full rigor resulted in myofibrillar protein coagulation and shrinkage but <b>supercontraction</b> nodes were absent. Cold-shortened bicarbonate treated muscle was relatively intact after cooking, exhibiting fusion of the myofibrils and an absence of intermyofibrillar spaces.

40|$|Silk fibers from Argiope trifasciata and Nephila inaurata orb-web weaving spiders were UV {{irradiated}} {{to modify}} the molecular weight of the constituent proteins. Fibers were characterized either as forcibly silked or after being subjected to maximum <b>supercontraction.</b> The effect of irradiation on <b>supercontraction</b> was also studied, {{both in terms of}} the percentage of <b>supercontraction</b> and the tensile properties exhibited by irradiated and subsequently supercontracted fibers. The effects of UV exposure at the molecular level were assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. It is shown that UV-irradiated fibers show a steady decrease in their main tensile parameters, most notably, tensile strength and strain. The combination of the mechanical and biochemical data suggests that the restricted conformational freedom of the proteins after UV irradiation is critical in the reduction of these properties. Consequently, an adequate topological organization of the protein chains emerges as a critical design principle in the performance of spider silk...|$|E
40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{properties of}} spider silks have stimulated an increasing interest {{in understanding the}} roles of their composition and processing, {{as well as in}} the mass-production of these fibers. Previously, the variability in the mechanical properties of natural silk fibers was a major drawback in the elucidation of their behavior, but the authors have found that <b>supercontraction</b> of these fibers allows one to characterize and reproduce the whole range of tensile properties in a consistent way. The purpose of this review is to summarize these findings. After a review of the pertinent mechanical properties, the role of <b>supercontraction</b> in recovering and tailoring the tensile properties is explained, together with an alignment parameter to characterize silk fibers. The concept of the existence of a mechanical ground state is also mentioned. These behaviors can be modeled, and two such models–at the molecular and macroscopic levels–are briefly outlined. Finally, the assessment of the existence of <b>supercontraction</b> in bio-inspired fibers is considered, as this property may have significant consequences in the design and production of artificial fibers...|$|E
40|$|Spider {{dragline}} silk is {{a material}} that {{has evolved over}} millions of years to develop finely tuned mechanical properties. It is a protein-based fiber, used as the main structural component in spider webs and as a lifeline for the spider, and it combines strength and extensibility to give it toughness currently unmatched by synthetic materials. Dragline silk has the unusual tendency of shrinking by up to 50 % when exposed to high humidity, a phenomenon called <b>supercontraction.</b> <b>Supercontraction</b> is thought to occur due to the association of water molecules with the amorphous region of silk proteins. The water molecules are believed to break the hydrogen bonds that connect the protein strands, causing a fundamental reorganization of molecular structure, which is manifested at the macro scale by a large retraction in length. However, the details of these mechanisms remain unknown and have not been directly demonstrated in prior research. Here we use full-scale atomic modeling of spider silk using molecular dynamics to investigate the structure and properties of this material at a length scale that is not yet accessible by experimental methods. A model of spider silk protein is used to explore the phenomenon of <b>supercontraction.</b> Two classes of simulations with different models are performed, and in both cases the models show a reorganization of the molecular structure consistent with the theory of <b>supercontraction,</b> yet fail to show the dramatic change in size that is observed on the macro scale. by Laura Batty.

Healing of macroscopic damage in thermoset polymer composites faces a similar challenge.

Here, a stimuli-responsive fibre (SRF) with outstanding mechanical properties and <b>supercontraction</b> capability was fabricated for the purpose of healing macroscopic damage. The SRFs and thermoplastic particles (TPs) were incorporated into regular thermosetting epoxy for repeatedly healing macroscopic damages. The system works by mimicking self-healing of biological systems such as human skin, close (stitch) then heal, i. e. close the macroscopic crack through the thermal-induced <b>supercontraction</b> of the SRFs, and bond the closed crack through melting and diffusing of TPs at the crack interface.

40|$|Isolated cell {{preparations}} from chicken gizzard {{smooth muscle}} typically contain {{a mixture of}} cell fragments and whole cells. Both species are spontaneously permeable and may be preloaded with externally applied phalloidin and antibodies and then induced to contract with Mg ATP. Labeling with antibodies revealed that the cell fragments specifically lacked certain cytoskeletal proteins (vinculin, filamin) and were depleted to various degrees in others (desmin, alpha-actinin). The cell fragments showed a unique mode of <b>supercontraction</b> that involved the protrusion of actin filaments through the cell surface during the terminal phase of shortening. In the presence of dextran, to minimize protein loss, the supercontracted products were star-like in form, comprising long actin bundles radiating in all directions from a central core containing myosin, desmin, and alpha-actinin. It is concluded that <b>supercontraction</b> is facilitated by an effective uncoupling of the contractile apparatus from the cytoskeleton, due to partial degradation of the latter, which allows unhindered sliding of actin over myosin. Homogenization of the cell fragments before or after <b>supercontraction</b> produced linear bipolar dimer structures composed of two oppositely polarized bundles of actin flanking a central bundle of myosin filaments. Actin filaments were shown to extend the whole length of the bundles and their length averaged integral to 4. 5 microns. Myosin filaments in the supercontracted dimers averaged 1. 6 microns in length. The results, showing {{for the first time}} the high actin to myosin filament length ratio in smooth muscle are readily consistent with the slow speed of shortening of this tissue.

40|$|Spider {{dragline}} silk is {{a protein}} material that {{has evolved over}} millions of years {{to become one of the}} strongest and toughest natural fibers known. Silk features a heterogeneous structure that comprises [beta]-sheet crystals embedded in an amorphous matrix. However, it is not fully understood how the heterogeneity of silk affects its mechanical properties. First, the origin of the nanoscale heterogeneity during the Nephila Clavipes dragline silk assembly is investigated. Using molecular dynamics simulations, a shear flow at natural pulling speeds is modelled and the secondary structure transitions as well as shear stresses in the silk protein chains are determined. It is shown that under shear stresses beyond the elastic regime, silk undergoes an [alpha] [...] [beta] transition in the spinning duct. The stability of the assembled [beta]-sheet structure seems to arise from a close proximity of the [alpha]-helices in the silk solution. The smallest molecule size that might give rise to a silk-like structure is determined to comprise four to six repeats of the silk sequence. Establishing the molecular details of the assembly can guide the design of microfluidic devices and the synthesis of bioinspired protein materials. Second, it is shown how the heterogeneity of silk fibers, specifically its crystalline phase, relates to its fracture mechanical properties: strength and toughness. Analytical fracture mechanical arguments are presented to illustrate the relation between fracture strength and heterogeneity in silk and other biopolymers. Nanoconfinement and flaw tolerance are presented as natural strategies to increase the mechanical performance of the entire material system. It is shown that the consideration of interatomic interactions alone cannot explain the fracture strength observed in biological fibers. Instead, structures at multiple length-scales must be considered to explain the remarkable mechanical performance and resilience of silk. Third, the interaction of water with silk's heterogeneous nanostructure is investigated. At high humidity, some spider dragline silks will shrink up to 50 %, a phenomenon known as <b>supercontraction.</b> The molecular origin of dragline silk <b>supercontraction</b> is explored using a full-atomistic model and molecular dynamics supported by in situ Raman spectroscopy and mechanical testing performed at the Max Planck Institute in Potsdam, Germany. Tyrosine and Arginine are identified as the key residues in the Nephila Clavipes silk sequence that control <b>supercontraction.</b> A genetic engineering strategy to alter silk's behavior to industrial requirements is proposed, where sequence mutations reduce or even reverse the <b>supercontraction</b> mechanism. by Tristan Giesa.

40|$|Typical spider {{dragline}} silk {{tends to}} outperform other natural fibres and most man-made filaments. However, even {{small changes in}} spinning conditions can have large effects on the mechanical properties of a silk fibre {{as well as on}} its water uptake. Absorbed water leads to significant shrinkage in an unrestrained dragline fibre and reversibly converts the material into a rubber. This process is known as <b>supercontraction</b> and may be a functional adaptation for the silk's role in the spider's web. <b>Supercontraction</b> is thought to be controlled by specific motifs in the silk proteins and to be induced by the entropy-driven recoiling of molecular chains. In analogy, in man-made fibres thermal shrinkage induces changes in mechanical properties attributable to the entropy-driven disorientation of 'unfrozen' molecular chains (as in polyethylene terephthalate) or the 'broken' intermolecular hydrogen bonds (as in nylons). Here we show for Nephila major-ampullate silk how in a biological fibre the spinning conditions affect the interplay between shrinkage and mechanical characteristics. This interaction reveals design principles linking the exceptional properties of silk to its molecular orientation.

40|$|Cross sections, {{including}} serial sections, of myocardial zonal lesions {{in right}} vetricular papillary muscles of cats subjected to hypovolemic shock were examined by electron microscopy.

The herniated A and I bands, together with accompanying mitochondria, were enclosed in membranes, apparently the unspecialized portion of the intercalated disc. Since the longitudinal orientation of myofilaments is retained in zonal lesions, this study indicates that intact A and I bands must slide past one another during the <b>supercontraction</b> of sarcomeres which is characteristic of zonal lesions.

40|$|Electron-microscopic {{observations}} {{have been}} made on skeletal muscle from cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and particular {{attention has been paid}} to the regenerative changes. The degenerative changes encountered were similar to those which have been found by previous workers. The most basic change was a segmental one and consisted of <b>supercontraction</b> of myofibrils which appeared to precede their fusion and subsequent breakdown. It is suggested that the <b>supercontraction</b> may represent a state of contracture or failure of relaxation due to a relative deficiency of ATP in the muscle fibre. Regenerative changes were found in considerable numbers of muscle fibres particularly in the younger cases. In fibres showing advanced degenerative changes, “satellite cells” were commonly found to be enlarged and to have a more elaborate organelle content than that of the resting “satellite cell”. Thin filaments were found in the cytoplasm of some “satellite cells” confirming their ability to differentiate into myoblasts. Ribosomal aggregates were found within the degenerate sarcoplasm of some fibres but were not associated with new filament formation. Regenerating fibres were recognized by the presence of polyribosomes in the sarcoplasm and large nuclei with dispersed chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Although in some fibres the pattern of myofibrillar development appeared to be quite normal, in many regenerating fibres the myofibrils were poorly aligned and at times completely disorganized and often showed abnormalities such as streaming of the Z-band or other focal deficiencies in isolated sarcomeres. Mitochondria were sparse in the vicinity of developing myofibrils. In some small fibres which ended blindly, regenerative changes appeared to have become arrested. The present observations indicate that although dystrophic muscle is capable of regeneration, the pattern of morphological development of the contractile elements in regenerating fibres is often abnormal. Moreover, there is evidence of metabolic abnormalities in such fibres. The observed abnormalities in the regeneration of dystrophic muscle correlate with the known abnormal growth pattern of dystrophic muscle in tissue culture. The possible reasons for these abnormalities are considered...|$|E

This paper explores the links between silk material properties, propagation of vibrations within webs, {{and the ability of}} the spider to control and balance web function. Combining experimental and modelling approaches, we contrast transverse and longitudinal wave propagation in the web. It emerged that both transverse and longitudinal wave amplitude in the web can be adjusted through changes in web tension and dragline silk stiffness, i. e. properties which can be controlled by the spider. In particular, we propose that dragline silk <b>supercontraction</b> may have evolved as a control mechanism for these multifunctional fibres. The various degrees of active influence on web engineering reveals the extraordinary ability of spiders to shape the physical properties of their self-made materials and architectures to affect biological functionality, balancing trade-offs between structural and sensory functions...|$|E

MA silk evolved ~ 376 MYA and identifying how evolutionary changes in proteins influenced silk mechanics {{is crucial for}} biomimetics, but is hindered by high spinning plasticity. We use <b>supercontraction</b> to remove that variation and characterize MA silk across the spider phylogeny. We show that mechanical performance is conserved within, but divergent among, major lineages, evolving in correlation with discrete changes in proteins. Early MA silk tensile strength improved rapidly with the origin of GGX amino acid motifs and increased repetitiveness. Tensile strength then maximized in basal entelegyne spiders, ~ 230 MYA. Toughness subsequently improved through increased extensibility within orb spiders, coupled with the origin of a novel protein (MaSp 2). Key changes in MA silk proteins therefore correlate with the sequential evolution high performance orb spider silk and could aid design of biomimetic fibers...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} and theory of permanent hair straightening are discussed. Hair straightening as a cosmetic {{process is the}} reverse of hair waving. It removes hair curliness and makes wavy hair straight. While it is generally accepted that permanent hair straightening can be achieved only at very high pH with strong alkali, we have observed that {{it can also be}} achieved at neutral pH with lithium salt, or even at acidic pH with resorcinol. Also, while some of these treatments do result in considerable loss of cystine, others leave the cystine entirely intact. Lanthionine is produced in some cases, but is absent in others. It appears that the prime requirement for an effective hair straightening treatment {{is to be able to}} induce <b>supercontraction</b> of the hair fiber. Based on these observations, a model is proposed to explain permanent hair straightening in terms of certain molecular events such as chain folding and alpha-beta transformation of the polypeptide in the hair keratin...|$|E
40|$|A {{ten times}} {{elongation}} of certain abdominal intersegmental muscles occurs in female locusts during digging prior to oviposition. During and after oviposition the muscles contract, shortening {{by up to}} 90 % or more, restoring the resting positions of the abdominal segments. Discontinuous Z-discs permit <b>supercontraction</b> at the resting length and then fragment into Z-bodies when the muscle is stretched, so enabling it to superextend without loss of the contractile property. In this superextended state the fibres resemble smooth muscles. After oviposition, the muscle fibres contract but the sarcomeres are not restored completely, some of the Z-bodies being unevenly distributed in the recontracted fibres. Locust ovipositor muscle has the most extreme example of Z-disc disagregation known from the insects and is the insect muscle which approaches most closely the smooth muscle condition. Two types of motor nerve innervate this muscle, one is ordinary and the other, containing granules, resembles an octopaminergic fibre possibly involved in regulating a catch mechanism in the muscle.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{studied the}} in situ {{reconstitution}} of myosin filaments within the myosinextracted myofibrils in cultured chick embryo skeletal muscle cells using the electron microscope and polarization microscope. Myosin was first {{extracted from the}} myofibrils in glycerinated muscle cells with a high-salt solution containing 0. 6 M KCI. When rabbit skeletal muscle myosin {{was added to the}} myosin-extracted cells in the high-salt solution, thin filaments in the ghost myofibrils were bound with myosin to form arrowhead complexes. Subsequent dilution of KCI in the myosin solution to 0. 1 M resulted in the formation of thick myosin filaments within the myofibrils, increasing the birefringence of the myofibrils. When Mg-ATP was added, such myosin-reassembled myofibrils were induced either to form <b>supercontraction</b> bands or to restore the sarcomeric arrangement of thick and th. i n filaments. Under the polarization microscope, vibrational movement of the myofibrils was seen transiently upon addition of Mg-ATP, often resulting in a regular arrangement of myofibrils in register.

The effect of ethnic background on fiber structure and geometry was also investigated. The beard and scalp hairs of all three ethnic groups (Caucasian, Chinese, and Negro) differed significantly in fiber morphology. Scalp fibers had smaller cross-sectional areas and were more rounded than beard fibers, which exhibited asymmetrical, oblong, and trilobal shapes. There were more cuticle layers, less ordered scale patterns, and more extensive medullation in beard hair than in scalp hair of the same subject. In addition, some ethnic differences were observed in fiber size, geometry, and pigmentation i both facial and scalp hair. The principal difference in chemical composition was the lower disulfide content of beard hair. In addition, beard hair was richer in aspartic acid, lysine, and tyrosine and poorer in valine and serine. The higher disulfide content of scalp hair was reflected in greater esistance to solubilization by urea-bisulfite, slower swelling rate in formic acid, and less <b>supercontraction</b> r permanent set in bisulfite solutions than beard hair under identical conditions...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the dynamic mechanical properties of natural silk fibres, mainly from silkworm species Bombyx mori (B. mori) and spider species Nephila edulis, using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, DMTA. The aim {{is not only}} to provide novel data on mechanical properties of silk, but also to relate these properties to the structure and morphology of silk. A systematic approach is adopted to evaluate the effect of the three principal factors of stress, temperature and hydration on the properties and structure of silk. The methods developed in this work are then used to examine commercially important aspects of the ‘quality’ of silk. I show that the dynamic storage modulus of silks increases with loading stress in the deformation through yield to failure, whereas the conventional engineering tensile modulus decreases significantly post-yield. Analyses of the effects of temperature and thermal history show a number of important effects: (1) the loss peak at - 60 °C is found to be associated the protein-water glass transition; (2) the increase in the dynamic storage modulus of native silks between temperature + 25 and 100 °C is due simply to water loss; (3) a number of discrete loss peaks from + 150 to + 220 °C are observed and attributed to the glass transition of different states of disordered structure with different intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Excess environmental humidity results in a lower effective glass transition temperature (Tg) for disordered silk fractions. Also, humidity-dynamic mechanical analysis on Nephila edulis spider dragline silks has shown that the glass transition induces a partial <b>supercontraction,</b> called Tg contraction. This new finding leads to the conclusion of two independent mechanisms for <b>supercontraction</b> in spider dragline silks. Study of three commercial B. mori cocoon silk grades and a variety of processed silks or artificial silks shows that lower grade and poorly processed silks display lower Tg values, and often have a greater loss tangent at Tg due to increased disorder. This suggests that processing contributes significantly to the differences in the structural order among natural or unnatural silks. More importantly, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis is proposed to be a potential tool for quality evaluation and control in silk production and processing. In summary, I demonstrate that DMTA is a valuable analytical tool for understanding the structure and properties of silk, and use a systematic approach to understand quantitatively the important mechanical properties of silk in terms of a generic structural framework in silk proteins.

An electron microscopic study of muscles exposed to 10 (- 2) and 5 X 10 (- 3) M bupivacaine revealed an initial <b>supercontraction</b> followed by evidence of severe and probably irreversible injury to plasma membrane, sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.

40|$|Background: In {{the field}} of Plastic Reconstructive Surgery the {{development}} of new innovative matrices for skin repair is in urgent need. The ideal biomaterial should promote attachment, proliferation and growth of cells. Additionally, it should degrade in an appropriate time period without releasing harmful substances, but not exert a pathological immune response. Spider dragline silk from Nephila spp meets these demands to a large extent. Methodology/Principal Findings: Native spider dragline silk, harvested directly out of Nephila spp spiders, was woven on steel frames. Constructs were sterilized and seeded with fibroblasts. After two weeks of cultivating single fibroblasts, keratinocytes were added to generate a bilayered skin model, consisting of dermis and epidermis equivalents. For the next three weeks, constructs in co-culture were lifted on an originally designed setup for air/liquid interface cultivation. After the culturing period, constructs were embedded in paraffin with an especially developed program for spidersilk to avoid <b>supercontraction.</b> Paraffin cross- sections were stained in Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) for microscopic analyses. Conclusion/Significance: Native spider dragline silk woven on steel frames provides a suitable matrix for 3 dimensional skin cell culturing. Both fibroblasts and keratinocytes cell lines adhere to the spider silk fibres and proliferate. Guided by the spider silk fibres, they sprout into the meshes and reach confluence in at most one week.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior and}} microstructure of {{minor ampullate gland}} silk (miS) of two orb-web spinning species, Argiope trifasciata and Nephila inaurata, were extensively characterized, enabling detailed comparison with other silks. The similarities and differences exhibited by miS {{when compared with the}} intensively studied major ampullate gland silk (MAS) and silkworm (Bombyx mori) silk offer a genuine opportunity for testing some of the hypotheses proposed to correlate microstructure and tensile properties in silk. In this work, we show that miSs of different species show similar properties, even when fibers spun by spiders that diverged over 100 million years are compared. The tensile properties of miS are comparable to those of MAS when tested in air, significantly in terms of work to fracture, but differ considerably when tested in water. In particular, miS does not show a <b>supercontraction</b> effect and an associated ground state. In this regard, the behavior of miS in water {{is similar to that of}} B. mori silk, and it is shown that the initial elastic modulus of both fibers can be explained using a common model. Intriguingly, the microstructural parameters measured in miS are comparable to those of MAS and considerably different from those found in B. mori. This fact suggests that some critical microstructural information is still missing in our description of silks, and our results suggest that the hydrophilicity of the lateral groups or the large scale organization of the sequences might be routes worth exploring...|$|E
40|$|The binding {{of small}} {{molecules}} to hair [...] I: The hydration {{of hair and}} the effect of water on the mechanical properties of hair M. M. BREUER* Synopsis [...] -HUMIDITY has a major influence on hair sets. Experimental results suggest hat water affects the mechanical properties of single fibres and these in turn strongly influence the set holding characteristics of hair tresses. The paper discusses the molecular mechanism of WATER BINDING to KERAT 1 N fibres and the role that hydration plays in the behaviour of single fibre properties. The binding of water appears to be a site binding process, i. e. interactions occur in stoichiometric ratios between the water molecules and the various hydrophilic groups of the protein (carboxylic, amino and peptide groups) and are governed by the mass action law. The effect of water on the mechanical properties of the fibre and, in particular, on its tem-perature-induced shrinkage (i. e. <b>SUPERCONTRACTION)</b> and the strain-stress curve can be adequately represented by means of a polymer-gel model. According to this model keratin is a semicrystalline (partially helical) cross-linked polypeptide network. The polypeptides, irrespec-tive of their conformations, are capable of binding water molecules, although the value of the binding constant depends on the conformation. The elasticity of the network, i. e. the retractlye force of the fibre, is determined by the free energy which is required to disorganize the helical regions into random conformations. Absorption of water changes this free energy of transition and thus affects both f, the elastic force, and T s, the shrinkage or melting temperature of the hair. The experimentally determined ependences of T s and f on humidity and off on tempera-ture can be interpreted in a consistent way using the conventional thermodynamic treatments developed for cross-linked semicrystalline polymeric networks...|$|E
