40|$|With {{day to day}} {{advancement}} wireless {{and communication}} industry, a single device needs to operate at multi frequency and enormous high bandwidth. Microstrip antenna is only to fit in this. A small rotated <b>square</b> <b>slot</b> antenna with a parasitic patch for bandwidth enhancement is proposed and investigated. A simple 50 - microstrip line is used to excite the slot. A rotated <b>square</b> <b>slot</b> resonator with center parasitic patch is considered as reference geometry. The rotated <b>square</b> <b>slot</b> antenna exhibits two resonances. By embedding a parasitic patch {{into the center of}} the rotated <b>square</b> <b>slot,</b> the lower resonant frequency is decreased and the higher resonant frequency is increased. Thus, broadband characteristic of the wide-slot antenna is achieved. The measured results demonstrate that this structure exhibits a wide impedance bandwidth, which is over 85 % for dB ranging from 2. 19 to 5. 95 GHz. Also, a stable and Omni directional radiation pattern is observed within the operating bandwidth. In this design, a smaller ground plane is considered compared to the reference antenna (rotated <b>square</b> <b>slot</b> antenna with the parasitic center patch). The proposed antenna has a strong application in UWB and WiMax devices.

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on circularly polarized antennas fed with a microstrip transmission line {{does not include}} a systematic methodology to control and tune the reflection coefficient (S 11) and axial ratio (AR). To enable systematic tuning of those performance metrics, this study proposes a new, circularly polarized, circular microstrip patch antenna with truncated <b>square</b> <b>slot.</b> A combination of an edge-truncated square-slot and noncontacted electromagnetic coupling methods implemented in combination with circular patch results in a directional, left-handed circularly polarized (LHCP) pattern. This article discusses the analysis of several slot shapes that contribute to a good circularly polarized antenna.
