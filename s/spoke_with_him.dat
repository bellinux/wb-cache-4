25|$|The {{claim of}} Parker's Dutch {{heritage}} was confirmed when Parker tried {{to avert a}} lawsuit in 1982 by asserting {{that he was a}} Dutch citizen. In 1993, Dutch TV director Jorrit van der Kooi <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> in Dutch about the Netherlands. Parker was not aware that his sister Adriana had died a few years before.|$|E
25|$|From 1980–93, Williams succeeded Arthur Fiedler as the Boston Pops Orchestra's Principal Conductor. Williams {{never met}} Fiedler in person but <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> by telephone. His arrival as the Pops' new {{leader in the}} spring of 1980 allowed him to devote part of the Pops' first PBS {{broadcast}} of the season to presenting his new compositions for The Empire Strikes Back.|$|E
5000|$|A {{short time}} afterwards, Van recounted having {{receiving}} the great grace of having St. Therese appear to <b>him</b> and <b>spoking</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> familiarly, {{and that this}} occurred {{on a regular basis}} for a period. [...] She personally taught him her [...] "little way," [...] and asked him to pray for the French, whom he had previously disliked due to their colonisation of Vietnam. Thérèse spoke to him about God, His love, His paternity, and invited <b>him</b> to converse <b>with</b> God as would two friends. She showed him that God, in fact, was interested in the everyday things of our lives.|$|R

Buxton, a {{reporter}} from the Camden Evening Courier, phoned Unruh's home and <b>spoke</b> briefly <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> On a hunch, Buxton had looked up Unruh's number in the phone book.

25|$|Unlike most cult leaders, Jones {{was able}} to gain public support and contact with {{prominent}} politicians in the local and national level. For example, Jones and Moscone met privately with vice presidential candidate Walter Mondale on his campaign plane days before the 1976 election, leading Mondale to publicly praise the Temple. First Lady Rosalynn Carter also personally met with Jones on multiple occasions; corresponded with him about Cuba; and <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> at the grand opening of the San Francisco headquarters, where he garnered louder applause than Mrs. Carter.|$|E
25|$|Phelps never married, but {{lived with}} four {{different}} women throughout his lifetime. He {{was a major}} baseball fan, and had personal friendships with numerous well-known players of the time. Phelps received much of the attention {{of his mother and}} grandmother during his childhood; this led to a strained relationship with his sister, who remained embittered towards him {{for the rest of her}} life. She left America in the 1920s, and never <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> again. He preferred to live in hotels and move from place to place, and never owned any real estate.|$|E
25|$|On November 9, 1969, the Zodiac mailed a seven-page letter {{stating that}} two policemen stopped and {{actually}} <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> three minutes after he shot Stine. Excerpts from the letter {{were published in}} the Chronicle on November 12 including the Zodiac's claim; that same day, Officer Don Fouke wrote a memo explaining what had happened the night of Stine's murder. On December 20, 1969, exactly one year after the murders of David Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen, the Zodiac mailed a letter to Belli that included another swatch of Stine's shirt; the Zodiac said he wanted Belli to help him.|$|E

25|$|The Los Angeles Police Department {{contacted}} Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a {{close friend}} of Bill Cosby for many years, to ask for his phone number. Waters declined to give it to them, instead asking another close friend, Essence magazine publisher Ed Lewis, {{to be the one to}} tell Cosby. However, the police contacted the CBS studio which produced his new series, Cosby, filmed in New York at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. Cosby was on set at the time when producer Joanne Curley-Kerner informed him of the death of his son. Los Angeles police later <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and discouraged him from flying to Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, one of Garrido's neighbors called 9-1-1 {{to inform}} {{them that there}} were tents in the {{backyard}} with children living there and that Garrido was [...] "psychotic" [...] with sexual addictions. A deputy sheriff <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{at the front of}} the house for about 30 minutes and left after telling him that there would be a code violation if people were living outside on the property. After Dugard was found in August 2009, the local Contra Costa County Sheriff, Warren E. Rupf issued an apology to the victims in a news conference.|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{spent most}} of the early {{afternoon}} and evening of September 14 discussing his career plans with the record producer Alan Douglas. In {{the early morning hours of}} September 15, he went to London's Heathrow Airport with Douglas, who was returning to New York. Hendrix's confidante Sharon Lawrence was in London, and <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> that day. Lawrence commented: [...] "Jimi tracked me down, detailing his pressures and discussing the 'so-called friends'. He was jittery and angry." [...] According to Lawrence, Hendrix told her: [...] "I can't sleep. I can't focus to write any songs." [...] Later that afternoon, his girlfriend Monika Dannemann arrived at the Cumberland. She and Hendrix then drove to her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{graduation}} {{he went to}} Paris {{to study}} at the Sorbonne University. Among the subjects he studied there were history and politics of the Middle East. While he was in Paris he met a Jew from Jerusalem, who <b>spoke</b> Hebrew <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> It was this use of Hebrew in a spoken form that convinced him that the revival of Hebrew as the language of a nation was feasible. Ben-Yehuda spent four years in Paris.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund, who had previously shot the controversial clip for the song [...] "Smack My Bitch Up" [...] (1997) by The Prodigy. Madonna had been planning the video for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] {{from the time she}} was filming the clip for previous single [...] "Frozen" [...] in the Mojave Desert. [...] "Smack My Bitch Up" [...] was her current favorite and she enlisted Åkerlund. Madonna stated that when she makes an album, she [...] "puts [...] soul on it", but a music video is a lot more working with a director. With the Ray of Light album, she wanted to have videos with fresh expression, and hence wanted to collaborate with new directors. She liked Åkerlund's [...] "special way of working" [...] and <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> over the telephone. Their conversations continued for over six months, and most of the time was spent coming with a final concept for the clip. Åkerlund said in an interview with Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet: ...|$|E
500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E

2500|$|The DeLorean Motor Company {{name was}} {{subsequently}} {{owned by a}} Texas-based firm that provided parts and professional restoration to DeLorean DMC-12 owners. Although John DeLorean {{was not involved in}} the business, its vice president James Epsey <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on the phone once a month, the last time being two days before his death in March 2005. According to Epsey, in their final conversation, DeLorean expressed his dismay at the then-current direction of General Motors, saying [...] "They have too many bean counters and not enough engineers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1781 Beverley Robinson, having {{received}} {{no response from}} Ethan Allen to his first letter, sent a second letter, in which he enclosed {{a copy of the}} first. [...] Shortly thereafter, Allen's friend Seth Warner, who still held a colonel's commission in the Continental Army, <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about the ongoing negotiation and his concern that about their potentially treasonous character. [...] In response to ongoing suspicions, Allen sent these letters to Congress, noting that he had never responded to them. [...] Congress, preoccupied with the war, did not deal substantively with the dispute in early 1781.|$|E
5000|$|All natural {{scientists}} of the 18th century <b>spoke</b> of <b>him</b> <b>with</b> admiration. Tournefort and Linnaeus named in his honour the genus Plumeria, which {{belongs to the}} family Apocynaceae and is indigenous in about forty species to Central America.|$|R
50|$|Poets Gu Kaizhi and Tao Yuanming {{have also}} {{mentioned}} Rong Qiqi in their poetry, but the latter <b>spoke</b> of <b>him</b> <b>with</b> far more skepticism, wondering if such {{emphasis on the}} natural and abandonment of the worldly is actually worth it.|$|R
50|$|Galante {{went from}} being chauffeur of Bonanno family boss, Joseph Bonanno, to caporegime and then underboss.

2500|$|Ned {{loved the}} Navy {{as a man}} might love his own family. For the Navy was his family, the junior {{officers}} he trained and the enlisted men who did {{so much of the}} hand-labor in the boats. He served with distinction approaching perfection and, like his father, would then write about the things he'd seen and done... More than once I <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about the psychological aspects of combat, and every time he told me what I needed to know, always from his own rich experiences. Ned was a serious student of history -- he wrote several splendid books on this subject -- and of human nature. What he didn't know had never happened.|$|E
2500|$|Representative Miller {{told the}} Investigative Subcommittee {{that the first}} time she spoke to Representative Smith about his vote on the Medicare {{legislation}} was on the House floor while the vote was open, after Representative Smith had cast his vote. She estimated that she <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> during the first hour of the time that the vote was held open. Representative Miller saw Representative Smith's no vote on the board and she [...] "didn't like the way that he voted." [...] Representative Miller testified that, on her own initiative, she approached Representative Smith and said words to the effect of: [...] "Is this how you're going to vote; or, This is how you're going to vote? And he said, Obviously." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to act was initially opposed by Nishida and Kita {{when they learned}} of it. The pair's [...] relationship {{with most of the}} officers had become relatively distant in the years leading up to the uprising, and they were against direct action. However, once {{it was clear that the}} officers were determined to act anyway, they moved to support them. Another barrier to be overcome was opposition to the involvement of troops from Teruzō Andō, who had sworn an oath to his commander not to involve his men in any direct action. Andō's position in the 3rd Infantry Regiment (the largest source of troops) was essential to the plot, so Muranaka and Nonaka <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> repeatedly, ultimately wearing down his resistance.|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, Afzali called Zazi's father.

[...] Afzali called Zazi, and told him that the authorities had asked him about [...] "you guys." [...] He also asked Zazi for the telephone number of one of the other men whose photos he had been shown, and set up a meeting <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Barnet {{walked through}} the crowd, unable to bring himself to ask; indeed his bearing must have been more valiant than his circumstances, for twice {{he says that he}} was begged from.

But here he was kept in like a schoolboy to write his name over and over on pieces of paper. His wounds were deep.|$|R
