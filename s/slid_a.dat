25|$|Despite listing 12 grapplers {{that she}} would work with, Wolfe used his {{influence}} to get her frozen from NWA members. The result was that her run in the Southeast with Cowboy Luttrall and Paul Jones in 1954 fizzled. Adding insult to injury, Burke wrestled Wolfe’s daughter-in-law June Byers. The match took place on August 20, 1954 in Atlanta and the match was a shoot. By having the local commission in his corner, Wolfe <b>slid</b> <b>a</b> friendly referee into the match. Despite giving up the first fall {{with the intention of}} competing stronger in the second, Burke never had the opportunity. Officials called the match, and the second fall never had a finish.|$|E
500|$|The Flames {{dominated}} {{the first period}} of play, outshooting Montreal 19–8. [...] Canadiens' goaltender Carey Price made several difficult saves early in the game, stopping a Rene Bourque one-timer {{from the top of}} the crease followed immediately by a save on Alex Tanguay, who tried to stuff the rebound into the net. Calgary was given an early two-man advantage after P. K. Subban and Hal Gill both took tripping penalties in the seventh minute of play. [...] The Flames capitalized on the power play, as Tanguay <b>slid</b> <b>a</b> pass in front of the Montreal net that was deflected in by Bourque to give Calgary a 1–0 advantage.|$|E
2500|$|In Faraday's first {{experimental}} demonstration (August 29, 1831), {{he wrapped}} two wires around {{opposite sides of}} an iron ring or [...] "torus" [...] (an arrangement similar to a modern toroidal transformer). Based on his understanding of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a [...] "wave of electricity", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it. This induction {{was due to the}} change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly <b>slid</b> <b>a</b> bar magnet {{in and out of a}} coil of wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead ("Faraday's disk").|$|E

5000|$|Up until then, some {{advances}} {{over the}} Chi-Ha variants can be seen, but some aspects {{in the tank}} hull were still lagging behind. <b>A</b> <b>slid</b> {{was attached to the}} rear part of the hull. This is something commonly seen in World War I and inter-war tanks. It is often said that by extending the length of the hull, it gained the benefit of crossing trenches but in that, there was a problem. In one theory, because the FT-17 became the origin of current medium tanks of the day and mounted <b>a</b> <b>slid,</b> among many countries, including Japan, [...] "Slid on tank" [...] was common sense. But as a tank mounts <b>a</b> <b>slid,</b> it becomes tail heavy (center of weight shifts backwards) and that presented uncertainty when crossing wide trenches. Mounting <b>a</b> <b>slid</b> on <b>a</b> tank that normally does not have <b>a</b> <b>slid</b> would likely have been ineffective. By becoming tail heavy, the rear portion of the suspension would undertake a greater load and thus wear out faster. Furthermore, the somewhat increase in weight would reduce things like mobility. In the case for the Type 89 medium tank, in reality, it seems like the only advantage lost by mounting <b>a</b> <b>slid</b> was that it could not mount additional loading cargo spaces.|$|R
