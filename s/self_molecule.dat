2500|$|The biggest {{weakness}} in Burnet's {{theory was that}} he had no explanation for how the body selected for immune cells that only identified non-self. In 1961, Jacques Miller published a paper offering an explanation. Miller was a PhD student at the Chester Beatty Research Institute in London. His discovery centered on the thymus. The thymus had long been regarded as nothing more than a repository for dead cells. Miller didn't buy this hypothesis. By removing the thymus of leukemic mice early in life, he found that the mice had a drastically weakened immune system. Taking inspiration from Medawar's skin transplant work, he performed a series of skin-graft experiments that showed that these immunocompromised mice didn't reject skin grafts from non-genetically identical mice. Miller then hypothesized that the thymus was essential in the construction and maintenance of the immune system. At this point Burnet came back into the picture, extending the hypothesis to specify that the dead cells found in the thymus are not any old immune cells, but instead the cells that are activated by self molecules. In other words, any molecule that binds to and hence [...] "recognizes" [...] a <b>self</b> <b>molecule</b> is killed before exiting the thymus. These cells were later found to be one of two types of immune cells, the T-cells (named for their origin, the thymus).|$|E

Mice transgenic (Tg) for this TCR were crossed with mice genetically deficient in beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 m). No mature Tg gamma delta T cells were detected in the thymus or the spleen of the beta 2 m- gamma delta Tg mice.

40|$|Studies in {{hepatitis}} B {{e antigen}} (HBeAg) -expressing transgenic mice indicate that self tolerance to two T-cell determinants {{on the same}} transgenic <b>self</b> <b>molecule</b> can differ markedly. The dominant T-cell site on HBeAg is tolerogenic, whereas a proportion of T cells recognizing a second T-cell site evade tolerance induction, persist in the periphery, and can be activated in vivo by a single injection of a 12 -residue T-cell self peptide. The self-reactive T cells mediate in vivo autoantibody production sufficient to neutralize detection of the autoantigen in serum. Furthermore, autoantibody production can be inhibited by nonself peptides that compete with the self peptide for binding to major histocompatibility complex molecules. This model illustrates that T cells specific for an immunogenic T-cell site on a nonsequestered autoantigen can escape tolerance induction and, more importantly, can mediate autoreactivity in vivo. Furthermore, {{these results suggest that}} synthetic T-cell sites may be useful as immunotherapeutic agents for the purpose of circumventing nonresponse to HBeAg during persistent hepatitis B virus infection...|$|E

40|$|The {{mystery of}} {{why and how}} a small, {{seemingly}} disparate subset of all <b>self</b> <b>molecules</b> become functional autoantigens holds a key to understanding autoimmune diseases. Here and in a companion article in this issue, we show that affinity of <b>self</b> <b>molecules</b> to the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate (DS) is a common property of autoantigens and leads to a specific autoreactive B- 1 a cell response. Autoimmune ANA/ENA reference sera react preferentially with DS affinity-fractionated cellular proteins. Studying patients with autoimmune diseases, we discovered patient-specific complex autoantigen patterns that are far richer and more diverse than previously thought, indicating significant pathological heterogeneity even within traditionally defined clinical entities, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. By shotgun sequencing of DS affinity-enriched proteomes extracted from cell lines, we identified approximately 200 autoantigens, both novel and previously linked to autoimmunity, including several well-known families of autoantigens related to the nucleosome, ribonucleoproteins, the cytoskeleton, and heat shock proteins. Using electron microscopy, we recognized direct interaction with dead cells as an origin of autoantigenic association of DS with <b>self</b> <b>molecules.</b> DS affinity may be a unifying property of the human autoantigen-ome (ie, totality of <b>self</b> <b>molecules</b> that can serve as functional autoantingens) and thus provides a promising tool for discovery of autoantigens, molecular diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, and development of cause-specific therapies...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the variety}} and {{complexity}} of microorganisms, the mechanisms needed for pathogen recognition are diverse. Innate immune recognition is mainly based {{on a series of}} germ-line encoded receptors that have been selected by evolution to recognize nonself molecules present in microorganisms. Innate immunity also recognizes changes in our cells caused by infection, such as the lack or induction of <b>self</b> <b>molecules.</b> Adaptative immunity somatically generates large repertories of receptors which collectively recognize any nonself antigen. These receptors are randomly generated, and the adaptative immune system has to learn how to eliminate or inactivate cells with high avidity receptors for <b>self</b> <b>molecules.</b> Given the enormous variety of microbe structures and immune receptors, the difference between self and nonself is not absolute; it depends on the threshold of activation. In genetically diverse populations, individuals who have this activation threshold too far from the average may suffer an autoimmune reaction. Accumulation of mutations in cancer cells generates neoantigens that may be also recognized as nonself molecules, but the extent of self and nonself discrimination limits immune responsiveness to them. Surprisingly, most of the molecules expressed by cancer cells recognized by the immune system are non mutated <b>self</b> <b>molecules...</b>|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} arterial wall characterized by endothelial dysfunction, and in which innate and adaptive immune responses have a crucial role. Autoimmune reactions against several self molecules and modified self molecules {{have been identified in}} patients with atherosclerotic disease. Oxidative stress, increasingly reported in these patients is the major event causing protein structural modifications, thus inducing the appearance of neo/cryptic epitopes. Following intraplaque haemorrhage large amounts of cell-free haemoglobin (Hb) accumulate within atheroma, due to its impaired clearance by the haptoglobin-CD 163 scavenging system. The pro-oxidative intraplaque microenvironment may induce Hb structural changes, thus generating neo/cryptic autoantigenic epitopes and rendering the oxidized <b>self</b> <b>molecule</b> as a dangerous signal for both immune and endothelial cells. In this review, we will present the most relevant information on Hb as a candidate self antigen involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease and on its ability to trigger signals that drive endothelial dysfunction and immune cell activation.

40|$|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) {{are widely}} {{expressed}} and play {{an essential role}} in the activation of innate immune cells. However, certain TLRs are also expressed on T cells, and TLR ligands can directly modulate T cell functions. Here, we discuss findings indicating that T cells directly respond to Heat Shock Protein (HSP) 60, a <b>self</b> <b>molecule,</b> or to the HSP 60 -derived peptide, p 277, via a TLR- 2 -dependent mechanism. HSP 60 has been considered to be a danger signal for the immune system because of its ability to induce pro-inflammatory phenotypes in innate immune cells – in this case via TLR- 4 activation; nevertheless, TLR- 2 engagement by HSP 60 on T cells can lead to resolution of inflammation by up-regulating the suppressive function of regulatory T cells and shifting the resulting cytokine secretion balance towards a Th 2 phenotype. Moreover, T-cell TLR- 4 engagement by LPS leads to up-regulation of SOCS 3 expression and consequently down-regulates T cell chemotaxis. Thus, TLR 2 and TLR 4 activation can contribute to both induction and termination of effector immune responses by controlling the activities of both innate and adaptive immune cells...|$|E
40|$|Nucleotide {{sequences}} of VJ (variable-joining) junctional regions of V 14 + alpha-chain T-cell receptor genes {{show that most}} V alpha 14 + T cells use one alpha chain (V alpha 14 J alpha 281 with a one-nucleotide N region, which is frequently used in keyhole limpet hemocyanin-specific suppressor T-cell hybridomas) in unprimed mice. Moreover, the frequency of this alpha-chain expression was greater than 1. 5 % of the total alpha chains found in laboratory strains, including B 10 congenic mice. This is about 10 (4) times higher than was expected. The V 14 J 281 alpha-chain expression was relatively low but was significant in CD 4 +/CD 8 + immature thymocytes and became quite high in mature single-positive T cells, implying that this alpha chain is selected during T-cell maturation. V 14 J 281 expression increased with time after birth and reached a maximum at around 5 weeks of age. The ligand {{seems to be a}} <b>self</b> <b>molecule</b> and to be present in laboratory strains but to be absent in a wild mouse, Mus musculus molossinus, because bone marrow chimeras clearly showed that bone marrow cells derived from Mus musculus molossinus negative for this alpha chain raised V 14 J 281 -positive T cells in a C 57 BL/ 6 environment. The above results suggest that there are some selection mechanisms for this cell type other than those for conventional alpha beta T cells and also that the homogenous VJ junction of the V 14 J 281 alpha chain plays a pivotal role in the selection of the T cell and its ligand reactivity...|$|E

30|$|The hemocytes are the {{effective}} cellular immune components in crustaceans {{and in the}} present study we investigated its immune function of phagocytosis using rabbit erythrocyte as target cell. Based on observations under phase contrast microscope the hemocytes showed phagocytic activity with untreated rabbit erythrocyte and this was enhanced with pre-incubated serum or clarified serum rabbit erythrocyte. The purified lectin Pjlec coated erythrocyte showed a two fold increase in phagocytic activity thereby affirming the role of Pjlec as an opsonin in phagocytosis. However the facilitated phagocytic response of hemocyte was dependent on the lectin Pjlec’s glycan specific binding that was elicited by 27.46  % to that of serum, as elimination of proteins from the serum yielded purified Pjlec lectin. Moreover the proteinase treatment of the erythrocytes enhanced phagocytosis with the removal of inhibitory proteins and exposure of sialic acid on its surface. On the other hand neuraminidase treatment of rabbit erythrocyte failed to be recognized or bind to the hemocytes. These optic observations were supported from the flow cytometry study, where the unstained hemocyte population occurred as three sub populations observed by scattered FSC and SSC in flow cytogram distinguishing the populations of hyaline, semigranular and granular cells. Our study on in vivo phagocytosis with FITC-Annexin labeled rabbit erythrocyte in flow cytometry failed to show response for 30  min after administration of either untreated or Pjlec coated rabbit erythrocyte. Evidently the non <b>self</b> <b>molecule</b> were sequestered from the hemolymph to other organs or cells of immune system probably the fixed hemocytes before being released for phagocytosis by freely circulating hemocytes (Johnson 1987; van de Braak et al. 2002) However by flow cytometry the in vitro phagocytosis analysis by hemocytes were also investigated using the FITC-Annexin labeled native and variously treated rabbit erythrocyte, and revealed phagocytosis in 33.74  % of the hemocyte population and the lectin incubated erythrocyte were engulfed by 97  % of the hemocyte population whereas proteinase treated erythrocytes were ingested by 68.29  % of the hemocytes. Flow cytometry observations of in vitro phagocytic response supported the optic observation of opsonin function of Pjlec in bridging erythrocytes (non-self) to hemocyte by a possible interaction between sialic acid on rabbit erythrocyte and receptors on hemocyte surface. Our findings clearly implicated that the immune response of phagocytosis in P. jacquemontii was initiated by recognition involving neuraminic acid binding of Pjlec that acted as an opsonin to interact with hemocyte surface receptors that signal a pathway for a cascade of reactions resulting in ingestion and subsequently elimination of nonself. The protein molecule β-integrin has been reported to attach nonself molecules to hemocyte surface (Wang et al. 2014).The study on in vitro hemolysis affirmed the binding of Pjlec on hemocyte surface to expedite the breakdown of erythrocyte. The observations of in vitro phagocytosis convincingly explained the function of Pjlec in binding the nonself to hemocytes where all the granular and semigranular hemocyte morphotypes appeared to bind to the lectin coated erythrocyte comprising about 94 – 96  % of the hemocyte population. The hyaline cells that constituted 4 – 6  % of the hemocyte population failed to phagocytose and appeared as the non-phagocytic proportion of the hemocyte population, indicating that recognition and ultimate ingestion on non self was discriminated at the hemocyte surface receptors (Gargioni and Barracco 1998). The opsonin factor Pjlec had the ability to bind to the phagocytic hemocytes disparated by its surface receptors to recognize, bind and ingest nonself entity and this observation finds support from the findings of (Hose et al. 1990).|$|E
40|$|Autoimmune {{diseases}} are often marked by autoantibodies binding to self antigens. However, many healthy persons also manifest autoantibodies that bind to self antigens, known as natural autoantibodies. In order to characterize natural autoantibodies present at birth, we used an antigen microarray (antigen chip) to analyze informatically (with clustering algorithms and correlation mapping) the natural IgM, IgA, and IgG autoantibody repertoires present in 10 pairs of sera from healthy mothers and the cords of their newborn babies. These autoantibodies {{were found to}} bind to 305 different, mostly <b>self,</b> <b>molecules.</b> We report that in utero, humans develop IgM and IgA autoantibodies to relatively uniform sets of <b>self</b> <b>molecules.</b> The global patterns of maternal IgM autoantibodies significantly diverged from those at birth, although certain reactivities remained common to both maternal and cord samples. Because maternal IgG antibodies (unlike IgM and IgA) cross the placenta, maternal and cord IgG autoantibodies showed essentially identical reactivities. We found that some self antigens that bind cord autoantibodies were among the target self antigens associated with autoimmune diseases later in life. Thus, the obviously benign autoimmunity prevalent at birth may {{provide the basis for}} the emergence of some autoimmune diseases relatively prevalent later in life...|$|R
40|$|The {{immune system}} is {{essential}} to body defense and maintenance. Specific antibodies to foreign invaders function in body defense, {{and it has been}} suggested that autoantibodies binding to <b>self</b> <b>molecules</b> are important in body maintenance. Recently, the autoantibody repertoires in the bloods of healthy mothers and their newborns were studied using an antigen microarray containing hundreds of <b>self</b> <b>molecules.</b> It was found that the mothers expressed diverse repertoires for both IgG and IgM autoantibodies. Each newborn shares with its mother a similar repertoire of IgG antibodies, which cross the placental but its IgM repertoire is more similar to those of other newborns. Here, we took a system-level approach and analyzed the correlations between autoantibody reactivities of the previous data and extended the study to new data from newborns at birth and a week later, and from healthy young women. For the young women, we found modular organization of both IgG and IgM isotypes into antigen cliques—subgroups of highly correlated antigen reactivities. In contrast, the newborns were found to share a universal congenital IgM profile with no modular organization. Moreover, the IgG autoantibodies of the newborns manifested buds of the mothers' antigen cliques, but they were noticeably less structured. These findings suggest that the natural autoantibody repertoire of humans shows relatively little organization at birth, but, by young adulthood, it becomes sorted out into a modular organization of subgroups (cliques) of correlated antigens. These features revealed by antigen microarrays can be used to define personal states of autoantibody organizational motifs...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe cytolytic {{activity}} of natural killer (NK) cells is regulated by inhibitory receptors that detect {{the absence of}} <b>self</b> <b>molecules</b> on target cells. Structural studies of missing self recognition have focused on NK receptors that bind MHC.

We determined the structure of killer cell lectin-like receptor G 1 (KLRG 1) in complex with E-cadherin. KLRG 1 mediates missing self recognition by binding to a highly conserved site on classical cadherins, enabling it to monitor expression of several cadherins (E-, N-, and R-) on target cells. This site overlaps the site responsible for cell-cell adhesion but is distinct from the integrin αEβ 7 binding site. We propose that E-cadherin may coengage KLRG 1 and αEβ 7 and that KLRG 1 overcomes its exceptionally weak affinity for cadherins through multipoint attachment to target cells, resulting in inhibitory signaling...|$|R

40|$|Interactions between {{hosts and}} their parasites are {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} major forces driving animal evolution. It can be assumed that the evolutionary changes will occur especially in host molecules directly involved in these interactions. The first line of host defense is formed by innate immunity receptors among which also pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) belong.

Although this mechanism of immune system activation is based on the recognition of ligands that are relatively evolutionarily conservative in pathogens, growing body of evidence suggests that PRRs are highly polymorphic on both interspecific and intraspecific level. High frequencies of minority alleles can be observed in most populations studied.

40|$|Recent {{analyses}} of immune response (It) 1 gene-controlled responses {{have led to}} the conclusion that nonresponsiveness, in the majority, if not all, of the cases, is caused by the absence of functional T cell clones rather than a failure of antigen presentation (1 - 4). Theoretically, nonresponsiveness at the T cell level can arise in at least two ways, both associated with the individualization of the T cell repertoire. First, some T cell clones are physically or functionally eliminated because they react with selfmajor histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, or with other self antigens in association with <b>self</b> MHC <b>molecules</b> (5). Second, the T cell repertoire is positively selected to recognize <b>self</b> MHC <b>molecules</b> or other self-antigens in the context of self-MHC molecules, and therefore the clones recognizing foreign antigens that are not identical with or closely related to self antigens are not included in the repertoire (6). To test whether a case can be made for the involvement of one of these two mechanisms in nonresponsiveness, we have used as a model system the secondary in vitro response of T cells depleted of alloreactive cells to antigens presented by allogeneic antigen-presenting cells (APC) (1).

For example, NKG 2 D recognizes multiple cellular ligands including MHC Class-I related chain A (MICA), MICB and UL 16 -binding pro-teins (ULBPs) 1 – 6. 2 All these molecules are rarely expressed on the surface of healthy tissues but become upregulated in response to stressful conditions including heat shock, pathogen infection and malig-nant transformation.

5000|$|Because of the {{specificity}} of toll-like receptors (and other innate immune receptors) they cannot easily be changed {{in the course of}} evolution, these receptors recognize molecules that are constantly associated with threats (i.e., pathogen or cell stress) and are highly specific to these threats (i.e., cannot be mistaken for <b>self</b> <b>molecules</b> that are normally expressed under physiological conditions). Pathogen-associated molecules that meet this requirement are thought to be critical to the pathogen's function and difficult to change through mutation; they are said to be evolutionarily conserved. Somewhat conserved features in pathogens include bacterial cell-surface lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoproteins, lipopeptides, and lipoarabinomannan; proteins such as flagellin from bacterial flagella; double-stranded RNA of viruses; or the unmethylated CpG islands of bacterial and viral DNA; and also of the CpG islands found in the promoters of eukaryotic DNA; as well as certain other RNA and DNA molecules. For most of the TLRs, ligand recognition specificity has now been established by gene targeting (also known as [...] "gene knockout"): a technique by which individual genes may be selectively deleted in mice. See the table below for a summary of known TLR ligands.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effects of {{increased}} expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on the development of self-tolerance, transgenic mice were produced that expressed the H- 2 Kb gene {{under the control of the}} metallothionein promoter. Administration of zinc enhanced transgene expression in liver, kidney and exocrine pancreas. No evidence suggestive of an autoimmune response was found in transgene-expressing tissues in mice otherwise allogeneic to H- 2 Kb. Despite this lack of responsiveness in vivo, T cells could be stimulated in vitro to lyse H- 2 Kb-bearing target cells. No infiltration was detected in transgenic mice after irradiation and reconstitution with bone marrow cells. When spleen cells were used for reconstitution, however, dense lymphocytic infiltration was seen, particularly in the portal tracts of the liver, and this was accompanied by piecemeal necrosis and apoptosis of periportal hepatocytes. This aggressive response progressively diminished with time, and by 12 weeks after reconstitution many of the portal tracts were free of infiltration while the others showed no accompanying necrosis. The picture at this stage was similar to that seen in chronic persistent hepatitis. These results suggest that, in addition to negative selection in the thymus, peripheral mechanisms not involving clonal deletion or permanent clonal anergy can prevent immune responses to <b>self</b> <b>molecules...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is {{initiated}} when alloreactive donor T {{cells are}} primed by host APCs to undergo clonal expansion and maturation. Since {{there is a}} controversy regarding the role of nonhematopoietic cells in GVHD, we wanted to investigate the influence of MHC disparity on nonhematopoietic cells on the pathogenesis of GVHD in the MHC-haplomismatched C 57 BL/ 6 (H- 2 b) or DBA/ 2 (H- 2 d) →unirradiated (C 57 BL/ 6 ×DBA/ 2) F 1 (BDF 1; H- 2 b/d) murine model of acute GVHD (aGVHD) or chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Methods: We generated (BDF 1 →C 57 BL/ 6), (BDF 1 →DBA/ 2), and (BDF 1 →BDF 1) chimeras and examined GVHD-related parameters and donor cell engraftment in those chimeras. Results: Using this experimental system, we found that 1) severe aGVHD across MHC Ag barrier depends on the expression of nonhematopoietically rather than hematopoietically derived alloAgs for maximal GVHD manifestations; 2) host APCs were sufficient to break B cell tolerance to <b>self</b> <b>molecules</b> in cGVHD, whereas host APCs were insufficient to induce autoimmunity in aGVHD; 3) donor cell engraftment was greatly enhanced in the host with MHC-matched nonhematopoietic cells. Conclusion: Taken together, our results provide an insight into how MHC disparity on GVHD target organs contribute to the pathogenesis of GVHD. [Immune Network 2010; 10 (2) : 46 - 54...|$|R
40|$|Protection against {{infection}} {{hinges on}} a close interplay between the {{innate immune system}} and the adaptive immune system. Depending on the type and context of a pathogen, the innate system instructs the adaptive immune system to induce an appropriate immune response. Here, we hypothesize that the adaptive immune system stores these instructions by changing from a naive to an appropriate memory phenotype. In a secondary immune reaction, memory lymphocytes adhere to their instructed phenotype. Because cross-reactions with unrelated Ags can be detrimental, such a qualitative form of memory requires a sufficient degree of specificity of the adaptive immune system. For example, lymphocytes instructed to clear a particular pathogen may cause autoimmunity when cross-reacting with ignored <b>self</b> <b>molecules.</b> Alternatively, memory cells may induce an immune response of the wrong mode when cross-reacting with subsequent pathogens. To maximize the likelihood of responding {{to a wide variety}} of pathogens, it is also required that the immune system be sufficiently cross-reactive. By means of a probabilistic model, we show that these conflicting requirements are met optimally by a highly specific memory lymphocyte repertoire. This explains why the lymphocyte system that was built on a preserved functional innate immune system has such a high degree of specificity. Our analysis suggests that 1) memory lymphocytes should be more specific than naive lymphocytes and 2) species with small lymphocyte repertoires should be more vulnerable to both infection and autoimmune diseases...|$|R
40|$|Non-enzymatic protein glycation is {{a source}} of {{metabolic}} stress that contributes to cytotoxicity and tissue damage. Hyperglycemia has been linked to elevation of advanced glycation endproducts, which mediate much of the vascular pathology leading to diabetic complications. Enhanced glycation of immunoglobulins and their accelerated vascular clearance is proposed as a natural mechanism to intercept alternative advanced glycation endproducts, thereby mitigating microvascular disease. We reported that antibodies against the glycoprotein KLH have elevated reactivity for glycopeptides from diabetic serum. These reactions are mediated by covalent binding between antibody light chains and carbonyl groups of glycated peptides. Diabetic animals that were immunized to induce reactive antibodies had attenuated diabetic nephropathy, which correlated with reduced levels of circulating and kidney-bound glycation products. Molecular analysis of antibody glycation revealed the preferential modification of light chains bearing germline-encoded lambda V regions. We previously noted that antibody fragments carrying V regions in the germline configuration are selected from a human Fv library by covalent binding to a reactive organophosphorus ester. These Fv fragments were specifically modified at light chain V region residues, which map to the combining site at the interface between light and heavy chains. These findings suggest that covalent binding is an innate property of antibodies, which may be encoded in the genome for specific physiological purposes. This hypothesis is discussed in context with current knowledge of the natural antibodies that recognize altered <b>self</b> <b>molecules</b> and the catalytic autoantibodies found in autoimmune disease...|$|R
