5|$|In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, {{but were}} defeated. However, in 406 AD an {{unprecedented}} number of tribes {{took advantage of}} the freezing of the Rhine to cross en masse: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in the <b>Sack</b> <b>of</b> Moguntiacum and the <b>Sack</b> <b>of</b> Treviri, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death.|$|E

5|$|In around 166 AD, several Germanic tribes pushed {{across the}} Danube, {{striking}} {{as far as}} Italy itself in the Siege of Aquileia in 166 AD, and the heartland of Greece in the <b>Sack</b> <b>of</b> Eleusis.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople in 1204 by Latin crusaders, two Byzantine {{successor}} {{states were}} established: the Empire of Nicaea, and the Despotate of Epirus. A third, the Empire of Trebizond, {{was created by}} Alexios I of Trebizond {{a few weeks before}} the <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople. Of the three successor states, Epirus and Nicaea stood the best chance of reclaiming Constantinople. The Nicaean Empire struggled to survive the next few decades, however, and by the mid-13th century it had lost much of southern Anatolia. The weakening of the Sultanate of Rûm following the Mongol invasion in 1242–43 allowed many beyliks and ghazis to set up their own principalities in Anatolia, weakening the Byzantine hold on Asia Minor. In time, one of the Beys, Osman I, created an empire that would eventually conquer Constantinople. However, the Mongol invasion also gave Nicaea a temporary respite from Seljuk attacks, allowing it to concentrate on the Latin Empire to its north.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the half, Oklahoma started with the ball but was unable to advance, as Nebraska {{recorded}} their first quarterback <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> the game and caused Oklahoma to punt after going three-and-out. Later in the third quarter, Oklahoma used eleven plays, three minutes and 21seconds, to go 99yards and score a touchdown with 1:25 left in the third quarter. It was the longest scoring drive in Big 12 Championship history.|$|E

5|$|Boston College, {{in their}} first {{possession}} of the second half, fared even worse than Virginia Tech did. Two incomplete passes and a 5-yard delay of game penalty forced Boston College into a three-and-out possession {{that resulted in a}} punt. On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, thanks in part to an 11-yard <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{was born}} in Cornwall, to Reinfrid and Gonilla. His brother was Roger fitzReinfrid, a layman and royal justice {{during the reign of}} King Henry II of England. Although the medieval chronicler and churchman Gerald of Wales related that his friend was descended from Trojan heroes who escaped the <b>Sack</b> <b>of</b> Troy and ended up in Cornwall, that was a {{flattering}} invention on Gerald's part. Coutances' family was of the knightly class, and probably from Normandy originally.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, Arrington {{was curious}} {{about the price of}} {{potatoes}} and set about his first economic experiment. He put slips of paper in some of the sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> potatoes.|$|E

5|$|The Hippodrome in Constantinople {{remained}} in use for races, games, and public ceremonies {{up to the}} <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In the 12th century, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180) even staged Western-style jousting matches in the Hippodrome. During the <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> 1204, the Crusaders looted the city and, among other things, removed the copper quadriga that stood above the carceres; it is now displayed at St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice. Thereafter, the Hippodrome was neglected, although still occasionally used for spectacles. A print of the Hippodrome from the fifteenth century shows a derelict site, a few walls still standing, and the spina, the central reservation, robbed of its splendor. Today, only the obelisks and the Serpent Column stand where for centuries the spectators gathered. In the West, the games had ended much sooner; {{by the end of}} the fourth century public entertainments in Italy had come to an end in all but a few towns. The last recorded chariot race in Rome itself took place in the Circus Maximus in 549 AD.|$|E

Boston College punted, but the kick by Johnny Ayers {{traveled}} just 34yards before sailing out of bounds.|$|E
