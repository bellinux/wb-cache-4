Since {{it was found that}} a high correlation exists between the amount of P_ 2 O_ 5 or N (mg/lOOg soil) sdsorbed and electric conductivity, the adsorption coefficients of phosphate and nitrogen were estimated for 37 soil <b>sampls.</b> Measurements were estimated for solubility of Na^+, K^+, Mg^ and Ca^ ions for 37 samples. The results are summarized as follows: 1) Ionic strength, calculated from the activities of dissolved major ions in the bulk solution, correlates with the electric conductivity of the bulk solution with a high correlation coefficient (γ= 0. 890). 2) The difference involved in the estimation of the adsorption coefficient from the electric conductivity data was 28. 8 % for phosphate and 15. 3 % for nitrogen. 3) The differences are mainly attributed to the precence of unbalanced phosphate ion species in the treated soil samples. The large difference for phosphate compared with that of nitrogen suggests that the method is not suitable for phosphate. No signifficant difference was observed for cations, Na^+, K^+, Mg^ and CA^, provided their concentrations are low. 4) Not only the major ions in the bulk solution, but also many other ions were dissolved through soil reaction. Especially, higher solubility of Na^+, K^+, Mg^ ion in the bulk solution than that in the water extracted treatment of the same soil was recognized. 5) The solubility of Ca^ in the bulk solution was less than that in water extraction of the same soil. However the variation of Ca^ solubility was the lowest among the analysed cations in the bulk solution.

40|$|Genes in each {{somatic cell}} {{of the living}} body are usually {{expressed}} equally from both fathers 2 ̆ 7 and mothers 2 ̆ 7 alleles. As one exception of this in mammals, however, genomic imprinting phenomenon has been reported, in which the expression of either fathers 2 ̆ 7 or mothers 2 ̆ 7 allele is specifically repressed. Mouse parthengenetic and androgenetic embryos are unioarental embroys in which paternally derived genes and maternally derived genes cannot be expressed, respectively. Using these embryos, many imorinted genes have been identified. To identify novel imprinted genes, several technologies, such as cDNA subtraction and differential display method have been used. However, some drawbacks have been pointed out, suggesting that these methods lead to many false positive results caused by PCR-mediated amplification. Then, I have improved the RLCS-window separation method, which is baced on the visualization of cDNA spots without PCR-mediated amplification in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis images. on the other hand, the cDNA microarray method has recently been established for the purpose to extensively analyze the gene expression. In this mothod, two cDNA <b>sampls</b> labeled with different fluorescence dyes are subjected to competitive hudridazation on the cDNA microarray, onto which {{a huge number of}} cDBA are spotted. By determination of the fluorescence intensity of each spot, difference in expression between samples can be eluucidated simultaneously {{for tens of thousands of}} genes. In order to search for the novel imprinted genes effectively, mouse cDNA microarray was employed and the genes expressed differentially between two uniparental embryos were systematically analyzed. Twenty-seven genes, including 9 known imprinted genes, were found to be expressed differentially in uniparental embryos. To examine biallelically whether these 18 candidate imprinted genes are expressed biallelically or monoallelically in normal diploid embryos, expressed alleles of these were investigated. Three genes -Asb 4, Ata 3 and Dcn- were expressed only from one specific allele in day- 15. 5 normalembryos. Eight other genes, however, were expressed from both alleles. These results suggested that not only imprinted that not only imorinted genes but also certain non-impromted genes are expressed differentially in uniparental embryos and these genes may function under the control of imprinted genes. Four out of 18 genes were located very close to the known imprinted regions on the chromosome. Application of the cDNA microarray method to search for the defferentially expressed genes enabled us to identify effectively the novel imprinted genes, and this high-throughput analysis may also have the capability to identify the imprinting-related genes. In future, by applying this method further using the cDNA microarray which contains the complete set of mouse genes, novel imprinted genes will be comprehensively identofoed. Further identification of imprinted genes and genes under the control of imprinted genes should lead to elucidation of the mechanism of imprinting phenomenon and give clues for treatment of many imprinting-related human deseases.

40|$|In this work, a {{systematic}} protocol is proposed to automatically parametrize implicit solvent models with polar and nonpolar components. The proposed protocol utilizes the classical Poisson model or the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) based polarizable Poisson model for modeling polar solvation free energies. For the nonpolar component, either {{the standard model}} of surface area, molecular volume, and van der Waals interactions, or a model with atomic surface areas and molecular volume is employed. Based {{on the assumption that}} similar molecules have similar parametrizations, we develop scoring and ranking algorithms to classify solute molecules. Four sets of radius parameters are combined with four sets of charge force fields to arrive at a total of 16 different parametrizations for the Poisson model. A large database with 668 experimental data is utilized to validate the proposed protocol. The lowest leave-one-out root mean square (RMS) error for the database is 1. 33 k cal/mol. Additionally, five subsets of the database, i. e., <b>SAMPL</b> 0 -SAMPL 4, are employed to further demonstrate that the proposed protocol offers some of the best solvation predictions.

We employed two solvation models for this challenge, a linear interaction energy (LIE) model based on explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations, and the first-shell hydration (FiSH) continuum model previously calibrated to mimic LIE data. On the 23 compounds from the obscure (blind) dataset, the prospectively submitted LIE and FiSH models provided predictions highly correlated with experimental hydration free energy data, with mean-unsigned-errors of 1. 69 and 1. 71 kcal/mol, respectively. We investigated several parameters that may affect the performance of these models, namely, the solute flexibility for the LIE explicitsolvent model, the solute partial charging method, and the incorporation {{of the difference in}} intramolecular energy between gas and solution phases for both models. We extended this analysis to the various chemical classes that can be formed within the <b>SAMPL</b> 2 dataset.

Further, the current results on the <b>SAMPL</b> 2 test dataset provide additional support for the FiSH continuum model as a fast yet accurate alternative to the LIE explicit-solvent model. Overall, both the LIE explicit-solvent model and the FiSH continuum solvation model show considerable improvement on the <b>SAMPL</b> 2 data set over our previous continuum electrostatics-dispersion solvation model used in the <b>SAMPL</b> 1 blind challenge.

40|$|In recent years, {{wireless}} sensor networking {{has shown}} great promise in applications ranging from industrial control, en-vironmental monitoring and inventory tracking. Given the resource-constrained nature of sensor devices and the dy-namic wireless channel used for communication, a sensor networking protocol {{needs to be}} compact, energy efficient and highly adaptable. In this paper we present <b>SAMPL,</b> a simple aggregation and message passing layer, aimed at flex-ible aggregation of sensor information {{over a long period}} of time, and supporting sporadic messages from mobile devices. <b>SAMPL</b> is a compact network layer that operates on top of a low-power CSMA/CA based MAC protocol. The proto-col has been designed with extensibility in mind to support new transducer devices and unforeseen applications withou...|$|E
40|$|Many species {{within the}} Citrus genus are {{economically}} important crops throughout tropical and subtropical {{regions of the}} world. Molecular marker technologies have eased and improved the genetic analysis of plants and promise to greatly assist Citrus breeding programs. Several types of molecular markers {{have been used to}} characterize the Citrus genome, {{but this is the first}} time where Amplified Restriction Fragment Polymorphism (AFLP) and Selective Amplification of Microsatellite Polymorphic Loci (<b>SAMPL)</b> techniques are used to identify varieties within species that belong to Citrus genus such as, C. sinensis, C. clementina, C. paradisi, C. aurantium, and C. limon. Both techniques were used to identify accessions belonging to the CIDA - Murcia, collection (Spain). Key words: AFLP, citrus, molecular markers, <b>SAMPL,</b> variety differentiati...|$|E
40|$|Indigenous to Europe, the {{blackberry}} rust fungus Phragmidium violaceum {{was introduced}} to Australia and subsequently appeared in New Zealand, with the most recent authorised introductions to Australia specifically for the biological control of European blackberry. Markers for ‘selective amplification of microsatellite polymorphic loci’ (<b>SAMPL)</b> were developed for studying the population genetics of P. violaceum. Modification {{of one of the}} two <b>SAMPL</b> primers with a HaeIII adapter (H) revealed significantly greater levels of genetic variation than primers used to generate AFLPs, the latter revealing little or no variation among 25 Australasian and 19 European isolates of P. violaceum. <b>SAMPL</b> was used to describe genetic variation among these 44 isolates of P. violaceum from 51 loci generated using primer pairs (GACA) ₄ + H–G and R 1 + H–G. The European isolates were more diverse than Australasian isolates, with 37 and 22 % polymorphic loci, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed geographic clades, with Australasian isolates forming one cluster separated from two clusters comprising the European isolates. However, low bootstrap support at these clades suggested that Australian isolates had not differentiated significantly from European isolates since the first record of P. violaceum in Australia in 1984. In general, the results support two hypotheses. First, that the population of P. violaceum in Australia was founded from a subset of individuals originating from Europe. Second, that P. violaceum in New Zealand originated from the Australian population of P. violaceum, probably by wind dispersal of urediniospores across the Tasman Sea. The application of <b>SAMPL</b> markers to the current biological control programme for European blackberry is discussed. Don R. Gomez, Katherine J. Evans, Paul R.
