The game, titled Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, was initially {{developed for the}} Sega NAOMI arcade board, marking Capcom's first attempt at a fighting game outside of the CP System II and III hardware systems. It features several significant gameplay changes from Clash of Super Heroes, such as three-on-three tag team battles, a new character assist system, and a more <b>simplified</b> <b>control</b> scheme. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 also includes a roster of 56 playable fighters, drawing numerous character sprites from Capcom's previous Marvel-licensed fighting games.

50|$|In 1969, the PLAAF {{issued an}} order to build a small, inexpensive, STOL (short takeoff and landing) {{lightweight}} fighter in order to replace the MiG-19. Two designs were submitted, namely the Shenyang J-11 and the Nanchang J-12. Prototypes of J-12 was designed by Lu Xiao Peng and built by the Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Company (NAMC). Flight testing of the three prototypes began on December 26, 1970. Due to less than satisfactory performance, additional prototypes were built with improvements such as <b>simplified</b> <b>control</b> surfaces, a lighter area ruled fuselage, and revised intake. All variants of the first prototypes looked similar; the J-12 was a small single-seat jet fighter with low-set, swept wings, swept control surfaces, tubular fuselage, and nose intake with small or absent shock cone.|$|E
50|$|Many {{players were}} unable {{to cope with the}} 8-way {{joystick}} of the original game, leading to its relative unpopularity. The sequel, Sheriff 2 was released in 1979, with the characters changed to cute animals, and a greatly <b>simplified</b> <b>control</b> system. The 8-way joystick used for shooting was replaced with a normal button, so the sheriff can only shoot in the direction he is facing. Another game pattern was also added, where the bandits enter into the central area, but run straight through the top half instead of chasing the sheriff. The player can gain bonus points if he manages to shoot all of the bandits while they are running through the central area. However, Sheriff 2 was not distributed widely enough to gain any sort of following.|$|E
