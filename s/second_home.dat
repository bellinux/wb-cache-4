We cite several studies and information related with the impact of <b>second</b> <b>homes</b> in Europe and North America. One conclusion regarding the number of <b>second</b> <b>homes</b> built in Spain during the last years is that, despite the housing boom, the annual percentage increase in 2001 - 2007 was very alike to the previous period 1991 - 2001. Spain is a country with very high demand for <b>second</b> <b>homes,</b> both for Spaniards and foreigners.

He was dropped from the side for a period of time following an FA Cup defeat to Northampton Town in November 2001, during which he missed an open goal. He returned to the first team in January 2002 and scored on his second game back in the starting eleven as Torquay defeated Bristol Rovers. Two months later, he scored a vital goal in a 2–0 victory over Lincoln City, which helped Torquay to only their <b>second</b> <b>home</b> victory in four months and move them 13points clear of the relegation zone. Torquay finished the season only two places higher than their previous campaign, but 15points above relegated Halifax Town.

40|$|Second-home {{tourism is}} a very popular form of tourism in many countries, {{particularly}} in the Nordic countries. More {{than half of the}} Swedish population have access to <b>second</b> <b>homes.</b> Previous studies have revealed that there is great variation between different <b>second</b> <b>homes.</b> Examples range from rustic Australian shacks, lonely cabins in the Norwegian mountains, spacious Swedish archipelago villas and palatial Russian dachas. Still, <b>second</b> <b>homes</b> are often seen and analysed as a unitary category – a perspective that obscures the considerable heterogeneity within the category as well as spatial differences in the impact of second-home tourism. Using a second-home typology from previous research and data on about 660, 000 <b>second</b> <b>homes,</b> we analyse the heterogeneity of <b>second</b> <b>homes</b> by mapping the composition of the Swedish second-home stock. Results show the uneven geography of second-home tourism, revealing significant and sometimes steep differences between peripheral areas and urban hinterlands, tourism hot-spots, and areas in decline. Based on these results, we assert that there is good cause to move away from using <b>second</b> <b>homes</b> as a unitary category. Instead, we argue for viewing <b>second</b> <b>homes</b> as an umbrella concept with dwelling use in focus. This enables a greater sensibility to place and more accurate analyses of the uneven impacts of second-home tourism. The results also give greater insights into the impact of the ‘invisible population’ of second-home owners from a public planning perspective...|$|R

During the two games played between the rivals last season, the Bears won the first game 28–10, while the Vikings won the second 21–14. Since 2001, the Bears led the series 16–10. ESPN writes that the Bears could capitalize on the Vikings' tendency to turn the ball over, as they gave away the ball to the Detroit Lions four times in week one. Chicago's defense should also prevent NFL MVP Adrian Peterson, who had been struggling when playing the Bears at Soldier Field. Since 2009, Peterson has been able to record only 73 rushing yards per game.|$|E

40|$|<b>Second</b> <b>homes</b> {{are once}} again a source of {{political}} and social contention in rural areas. The British government's decision to reduce Council Tax discounts on <b>second</b> <b>homes</b> in England in April 2004 has caused wide debate in local communities, local authorities, and the media. The debate has not only focused on the vexed Council Tax issue, but on wider rural housing concerns. Questions have been raised as to whether <b>second</b> <b>homes</b> are a major cause of housing affordability problems in rural areas, and whether they lead to the displacement of local people in rural communities. In the face of anecdotal evidence being presented to answer these questions, Second Homes: European Perspectives and UK Policies, offers a more comprehensive analysis of the <b>second</b> <b>homes</b> question as it now exists. This up-to-date and authoritative analysis of <b>second</b> <b>homes</b> draws on the latest research and offers a critical insight into current housing problems in rural communities.
