40|$|AbstractTiming {{of trips}} and tours {{play a very}} {{important}} role in travel demand modeling. To deal with issues related to congestion, the planner must have a clear understanding of the timing of travel patterns. In the literature, there is very little attention t o tour- based modeling in the developing country context. The inability of the current practice in evaluating substitution of trips and tours across intra-day periods in responses to time-varying policies (flexible and <b>staggered</b> work <b>hours)</b> and <b>system</b> attributes (congestion or tolls) needs to be addressed. To address these shortcomings, this study uses tours as the fundamental unit of analysis to circumvent discontinuity in mode choice and independence assumption in trip-based models. For this study, tour data from nearly 1000 workers are extracted from the Chennai Household Activity and Travel Survey 2004 - 05. Based on the information about the peak traffic, the 24 hour time-window was split into 6 time intervals. The nominal nature of the dependent variable is captured using Multinomial Logit Model (MNL). This paper investigates the timing decisions of tours in the context of Indian city, Chennai. Three related sub-objectives are pursued towards this goal: 1. develop models of tour timing (departure times) for workers, 2. analyze the role of individual, household, work-related, modal characteristics and transportation system attributes on this timing decision, and 3. understand the differences in behavior of tour timing between work tours and non-mandatory tours of workers...|$|R

40|$|Applying {{the welfare}} {{economic}} approach it is demonstrated what {{the effects of}} certain supply changes in the local public transport will be and the potential of innovative demand management measures are examined. Straighter bus routes would reduce the average travel time from door to door. The travel time on the buses decreases and the frequency increases, which reduces waiting times at bus stops. Using smaller buses {{and more of them}} would also increase the net benefit, but increase the need for subsidisation. The peak within the peak in the morning is hard to handle by price policy alone. Introducing a small variation of the start of the school-day for high-school pupils would make investment- and operation cost savings possible, and the inconvenience costs for the pupils could be limited. It is only during peak hours in the main direction of peak travel and in the critical section of the line that optimal price becomes high relative to the present level. Zero fares in off-peak will be social profitable, but an increase in subsidy is needed. An introduction of these policy changes would give rise to a net social benefit of 30 million SEK per year in Linköping.
