5|$|Hartebeest {{are remarkably}} alert and {{cautious}} animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lookout for danger, often {{standing on a}} termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E
5|$|After a busy week {{servicing}} Hubble, {{the crew}} of Atlantis had {{the majority of the}} day off, giving them time to rest and prepare for landing. They took their traditional on-orbit crew portrait, and spoke with reporters from around the world in a news conference. The crew also had the opportunity to speak with the Expedition 19 crew on board the International Space Station, in a conference call routed through satellites. The station crew congratulated them on a very successful mission, and {{the crew of}} Atlantis expressed their gratitude to the station crew for all the work they do during their long duration <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> station.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} (Manhattan- and Queens-bound) {{end of the}} upper level, the Culver Line local tracks diverge, {{splitting}} into four tracks. The F train, using the outer pair of tracks, ramps down to the lower level, merges with the innermost, express tracks located on the lower level, and continues north to Jay Street–MetroTech. Meanwhile, the G train, using the inner pair of tracks, <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper level before making a hard right turn east under Schermerhorn Street to Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. The lower level tracks can only be reached by trains running to or from Jay Street–MetroTech since they do not connect to the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E

Cú Chulainn <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sidelines, recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing. He enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps {{his side of the}} bargain and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field. Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune moment she gets her period, and although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he spares her because he does not think it right to kill women, and guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as Athlone.|$|E
5|$|The song had hot shot debuts {{and limited}} <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100 {{due to the}} single being {{released}} via iTunes only. It debuted in the U.S. at number twenty-six on the week ending November 21, 2009, and remained on the chart for two weeks. The same week it debuted at number fifteen in Canada, remaining on the chart for two weeks. The song returned to the Canadian Hot 100 at number ninety-nine on the week ending January 9, 2010. In 2010, the chart also appeared on the UK Singles Chart at seventy-six, and on the UK R Chart.|$|E
5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – {{two members of the}} chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E

5|$|The 7.7million day {{visitors}} and 5.5million who made overnight <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Norfolk coast in 1999 {{are estimated to}} have spent £122million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as {{the main purpose of}} their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} {{for an average}} of 11days (range 10–16). Both adults incubate, although only the female <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 11–12days after hatching, leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two or three weeks. If the nest is threatened, the non-incubating bird gives an alarm call so that the sitting parent and chicks stay still and quiet. A male blackcap may mob a potential predator, or try to lure it away with disjointed runs and flaps on the ground. The blackcap normally raises just one brood, but second nestings are sometimes recorded, particularly in the milder climate of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands; triple brooding has been observed once, the female laying a total of 23 eggs in the season.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|Every tooth is {{connected}} to its surrounding bone by the periodontal ligament. The tooth receives its nourishment through this ligament. When a tooth is knocked-out, this ligament is stretched and splits in half; half <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tooth root and half <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> socket wall. If these two halves can be kept alive, the tooth can be replanted and the halves of the ligament will reattach and the tooth will remain vital. The half that <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> socket wall, since it remains connected to the bone blood supply, is naturally kept alive. However, the ligament cells that remain on the tooth root lose their blood and nutrition supply and must be artificially maintained. They must be protected from two potentially destructive processes: cell crushing and loss of normal cell metabolism. All treatment between {{the time of the}} accident and the ultimate replantation must be focused on preventing these two possibilities.|$|E

25|$|The climatic {{conditions}} on the North Sea coast have been claimed to be healthful. As early as the 19th century, travellers used their <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> North Sea coast as curative and restorative vacations. The sea air, temperature, wind, water, and sunshine are counted among the beneficial conditions that are said to activate the body's defences, improve circulation, strengthen the immune system, and have healing effects on the skin and the respiratory system.|$|E
25|$|The {{domestication}} {{of wheat}} provides an example. Wild wheat shatters and {{falls to the}} ground to reseed itself when ripe, but domesticated wheat <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stem for easier harvesting. This change was possible because of a random mutation in the wild populations at the beginning of wheat's cultivation. Wheat with this mutation was harvested more frequently and became the seed for the next crop. Therefore, without realizing, early farmers selected for this mutation. The result is domesticated wheat, which relies on farmers for its reproduction and dissemination.|$|E

25|$|Fredericton has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb). The average January low temperature is -16°C, {{while the average}} high in July high is 26°C. On average, Fredericton receives approximately 1100mm of precipitation per year. Snowfall is common between late November and early April, and snow usually <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground beginning in December. Flooding occurs {{during the spring of}} most years on area rivers and affects the city's low-lying neighbourhoods. Its climate is somewhat influenced by its inland position, with warmer summers and colder winter nights than expected for coastal areas of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.|$|E
25|$|Köppen climate {{classification}} Dfc: The northernmost {{parts of}} Ontario—primarily north of 50°N {{and with no}} major cities in the area—have a subarctic climate (Köppen) with long, severely cold winters and short summers, with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. In summer, hot weather occasionally reaches even the northernmost parts of Ontario for brief periods, although humidity is generally lower than in the south. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking Arctic air masses, temperatures of −40°C (−40°F) are not uncommon. The snow <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground much longer here than in other regions of Ontario; snow cover is usually present to some extent between October and May.|$|E
25|$|Unstable {{colloidal}} suspensions of low-volume fraction form clustered liquid suspensions, wherein individual {{clusters of}} particles {{fall to the}} bottom of the suspension (or float to the top if the particles are less dense than the suspending medium) once the clusters are of sufficient size for the Brownian forces that work to keep the particles in suspension to be overcome by gravitational forces. However, colloidal suspensions of higher-volume fraction form colloidal gels with viscoelastic properties. Viscoelastic colloidal gels, such as bentonite and toothpaste, flow like liquids under shear, but maintain their shape when shear is removed. It is for this reason that toothpaste can be squeezed from a toothpaste tube, but <b>stays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> toothbrush after it is applied.|$|E
