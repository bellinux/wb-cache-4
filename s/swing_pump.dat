50|$|Fendt's {{infinitely}} variable transmission (IVT) differs from a continuously variable transmission (CVT) as an IVT can be travelling at 0.0 km/h whilst the transmission is engaged and not in neutral. The IVT/CVT gearbox {{is widely regarded as}} the most fuel efficient gearbox on the agricultural market prompting nearly all other major manufacturers to develop their own system. Manufacturers such as ZF, John Deere and CNH group have also developed very intuitive systems but Fendt's Vario is broadly considered a market leader. Variations can be found on other AGCO tractor brands such Massey Ferguson. The gearbox may be the same however the individual brands have different controls/ joystick and may have different ECU software. The IVT transmissions are extremely popular in the European market and its fuel efficiency puts it in favour of mechanical competitors, however one weakness to the Vario is its power consumption, in comparison to a mechanical transmission, most IVT/CVT gearboxes can lose 10-20 hp in the transmission due to the hydraulic <b>swing</b> <b>pump</b> element of the transmission. The Fendt Vario offers 60 km/h travel speed on its 800 series and 900 series models, this same transmission can also be found in 4000 series JCB tractors. Claas also use the Vario transmission sold under its CMatic brand. Claas use their own control method however it is mechanically identical to that of a Massey Ferguson as Claas use Massey Ferguson transmissions/back end.|$|E
5000|$|Clarkson was accidentally {{killed while}} working in his {{sandstone}} quarry not far from Potsdam. When a worker {{was in danger of}} being crushed by a loose pump, Clarkson pushed him out of the way risking his own life. Clarkson was crushed against a wall by the <b>swinging</b> <b>pump,</b> sunstaining severe internal injuries. He died five days later. The Clarkson family realized great wealth in the development of such quarries, and Potsdam sandstone was highly sought after by developers of townhouses in New York City and elsewhere. The family were important benefactors in the Potsdam area.|$|R

5000|$|While Eurogamer {{claimed that}} the gesture-based control is gimmicky and unreliable, most review sites said just the opposite, with IGN noting that [...] "the first DS Worms... was {{drastically}} hurt by a sloppy control method, but that is entirely not the case this time around," [...] and 1UP.com commenting that [...] "The Wii motion controls are initially as friendly as a Rancor beast, but they're just as easily conquered," [...] and [...] "after a few Wiimote stabs, <b>swings,</b> and <b>pumps,</b> you'll probably never {{want to go back}} to traditional button-pressing controls." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{school was}} founded in 1896, funded by the sisters of Thomas S. Clarkson, a local {{entrepreneur}} who was accidentally killed while working in his sandstone quarry not far from Potsdam. When a worker {{was in danger of}} being crushed by a loose pump, Clarkson pushed him out of the way risking his own life. Clarkson was crushed against a wall by the <b>swinging</b> <b>pump,</b> sustaining severe internal injuries. He died five days later. The Clarkson family realized great wealth in the development of such quarries, and Potsdam sandstone was highly sought after by developers of townhouses in New York City and elsewhere. The family were important benefactors in the Potsdam area. The school was called the Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial School of Technology.In 1913, the name was changed to Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial College of Technology, which was used in a shortened version as Clarkson College of Technology or CCT. During {{the first half of the}} 20th century the majority of the campus was located [...] "downtown". The campus slowly expanded to an area known as the [...] "Hill", located on the south-western edge of the village. As of 2001, almost all academics and housing had moved to the hill campus, although the university still uses the downtown buildings known as Old Snell and Old Main for administrative functions.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} playground swings, a Russian swing has steel bars {{instead of}} ropes, and its swinging platform {{is able to}} rotate 360 degrees around the horizontal bar from which it is suspended. Two or more acrobats stand on the <b>swing</b> platform, <b>pumping</b> {{it back and forth}} until it is swinging in high arcs. This motion increases the centrifugal force of the flyer (the acrobat who is going to jump). The flyer then lets go of the swing at the peak of its arc, gaining enough altitude to execute one of various aerial flips before landing at a distance from the swing. The flyer may land on a crash mat, in a vertically slanted net, in the arms of other acrobats (referred to as catchers), in a pool of water, or even on the platform of another Russian swing.|$|R
5000|$|The 2011 {{report was}} issued on 9 November 2011. The {{executive}} summary {{noted that there}} were [...] "few signs that the urgently needed change in direction in global energy trends is underway." [...] Richard G. Newell, associate professor of energy and environmental economics at Duke University notes: [...] "Even as mature economies moderate oil demand through efficiency and biofuels, emerging economies' oil demand for transport grows by almost 50 percent. The bottom line is, like it or not, we should be prepared for price <b>swings</b> at the <b>pump</b> {{for some time to}} come." ...|$|R
