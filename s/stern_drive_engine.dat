25|$|In 1957 Kiekhaefer {{introduced}} the Mark 75 motor, the industry's first 6-cylinder 60hp (horsepower) outboard motor. Two Mark 75 motors set an endurance record by running for 34 days, 11 hours, 47 minutes, and 5.4 seconds nonstop and over 25,000 miles. The motors were refueled on the run, and averaged 30.3mph (miles per hour). In 1961 Kiekhaefer Marine {{merged with the}} Brunswick Corporation. Later that year Kiekhaefer would use his NASCAR and boat engineering skills to develop the 100hp <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> <b>engine</b> now known as MerCruiser. Kiekhaefer resigned {{as president of the}} company in 1969, and the company name changed to Mercury Marine.|$|E

50|$|A bow rider {{is a kind}} of runabout boat {{typically}} between 17' and 35', use <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> or outboard <b>engines,</b> {{and hold}} between six and ten people. To distinguish it from a cuddy boat, it has an open bow area where there are extra seats in front of the helm station. This term can be confused with bow riding, a dangerous and often illegal activity involving sitting or standing on the bow while the boat is making way.|$|R
50|$|BMW Marine, in {{conjunction}} with ZF, designed and manufactured a new <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> unit. These <b>stern</b> <b>drives</b> were marketed as the BMW Z-Drive.

50|$|Internal drive {{propulsion}} {{is a form}} {{of marine}} propulsion commonly used in recreational boating. Like other forms of motorized boating, internal drive propulsion employs a motor that turns a propeller to move the boat forward. The primary difference between internal <b>drive</b> boats and <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> boats is that the propeller is enclosed inside the hull of an internal drive boat whereas the propeller is exposed outside the hull of a <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> boat.|$|R

50|$|Inboard jet drives {{remained}} a power choice for Wacanda {{through the end}} of production in 1988, frequently with drives built by Berkley Pump Co. (California) or Eliminator Jet (Idaho).
