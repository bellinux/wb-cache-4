40|$|BACKGROUND: Grass pollen allergens are {{the most}} {{important}} and widespread elicitors of pollen allergy. One of the major plant allergens which millions of people worldwide are sensitized to is Phl p 2, a <b>small</b> protein from <b>timothy</b> grass pollen. Phl p 2 is representative of the large family of cross-reacting plant allergens classified as group 2 / 3. Recombinant Phl p 2 has been demonstrated by immunological cross-reactivity studies to be immunologically equivalent to the natural protein. RESULTS: We have solved the solution structure of recombinant Phl p 2 by means of nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The three-dimensional structure of Phl p 2 consists of an all-beta fold with nine antiparallel beta strands that form a beta sandwich. The topology is that of an immunoglobulin-like fold {{with the addition of a}} C-terminal strand, as found in the C 2 domain superfamily. Lack of functional and sequence similarity with these two families, however, suggests an independent evolution of Phl p 2 and other homologous plant allergens. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high homology with other plant allergens of groups 1 and 2 / 3, the structure of Phl p 2 can be used to rationalize some of the immunological properties of the whole family. On the basis of the structure, we suggest possible sites of interaction with IgE antibodies. Knowledge of the Phl p 2 structure may assist the rational structure-based design of synthetic vaccines against grass pollen allergy...|$|R
40|$|VOLT {{was created}} in San Francisco in 1991. The journal was {{originally}} published by Pacific Film and Literary Association, a non-profit organization registered in California. VOLT is now housed at Sonoma State University. Innovative in design and content, VOLT publishes a range of adventurous writing. Founded and edited by Gillian Conoley, VOLT appears every fall. VOLT has received many awards and honors, including several Pushcart Prize Anthology selections, a Fund for Poetry grant, and several selections for the annual anthology, The Best American Poetry. VOLT is produced {{with the help of}} Assistant Editors Paula Koneazny and Marjorie Stein.
