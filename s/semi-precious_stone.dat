5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a glassy material known as faience, which they treated {{as a type of}} artificial <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone.</b> Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.|$|E

Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E

25|$|Lapis lazuli, a <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone,</b> {{has been}} mined in Afghanistan {{for more than}} three {{thousand}} years, and was exported to all parts of the ancient world. In Iran and Mesopotamia, it was used to make jewellery and vessels. In Egypt, it was used for the eyebrows on the funeral mask of King Tutankhamun (1341–1323 BC).|$|E
25|$|While jade {{has been}} since {{earliest}} times the most prized <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone</b> for carving in East Asia and Pre-Columbian America, in Europe and the Middle East the different varieties of quartz were {{the most commonly used}} for the various types of jewelry and hardstone carving, including engraved gems and cameo gems, rock crystal vases, and extravagant vessels. The tradition continued to produce objects that were very highly valued until the mid-19th century, when it largely fell from fashion except in jewelry. Cameo technique exploits the bands of color in onyx and other varieties.|$|E
25|$|Mineral {{pigments}} {{were also}} traded over long distances. The {{only way to}} achieve a deep rich blue was by using a <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone,</b> lapis lazuli, to produce a pigment known as ultramarine, and the best sources of lapis were remote. Flemish painter Jan van Eyck, working in the 15th century, did not ordinarily include blue in his paintings. To have one's portrait commissioned and painted with ultramarine blue was considered a great luxury. If a patron wanted blue, they were obliged to pay extra. When Van Eyck used lapis, he never blended it with other colors. Instead he applied it in pure form, almost as a decorative glaze. The prohibitive price of lapis lazuli forced artists to seek less expensive replacement pigments, both mineral (azurite, smalt) and biological (indigo).|$|E

25|$|For the {{execution}} of its astonishing revetment of marbles inlaid with colored marbles and <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone,</b> the Grand Ducal hardstone workshop, the Opificio delle Pietre Dure was established. The art of commessi, {{as it was called}} in Florence, assembled jig-sawn fragments of specimen stones to form the designs of the revetment that entirely cover the walls. The result was disapproved of by 18th and 19th century visitors, but has come to be appreciated for an example of the taste of its time. Six grand sarcophagi are empty; the Medici remains are interred in the crypt below. In sixteen compartments of the dado are coats-of-arms of Tuscan cities under Medici control. In the niches that were intended to hold portrait sculptures of Medici, two (Ferdinando I and Cosimo II) were executed by Pietro Tacca (1626–42).|$|E

Beginning of early Iron Age Kalahandi may be placed in the first millennium BC in which black and red ware was the diagnostic pottery type. Next phase of Iron Age represents to early history that was concomitants with state formation and urbanization and technological break through besides voluminous trade, agriculture surplus and heterogeneous social complex in ancient Kalahandi. The material culture of Iron Age found in Kalahandi included semi-precious beads, terracotta figurines, iron implements of war and peace, decorated and plain ceramic, burnt brick, hopscotch (gaming items), spindle whorl, weight stone etc. The largest Megalithic Cemetery was found in the river bank of the Tel river Bileikani, Kalahandi.|$|E
25|$|Pit'dah (פִּטְדָה = in the masoretic text) / Topazios (in the Septuagint) - {{despite the}} {{suggestion}} of the Septuagint that it was Topaz, Topaz was scarcely known {{at the time the}} Book of Exodus was written (according to both the traditional dating of the book and that by critical scholars); in the classical era, topazios referred to Topazos Island on which a particular yellow mineral was mined (topazios means to seek, in reference to the difficulty in finding the island). Others suggest that topaz was merely peridot, a light green <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone,</b> and which stone in the ancient world was found primarily on Topazos Island as well as on St. John’s Island (Zabargad) in the Egyptian Red Sea. The word pit'dah is thought by scholars to be connected with the Assyrian word hipindu, which refers to something that flashed (presumably meaning shimmered), and thus the jewel in question would fit the description of Chrysolite, a translucent greenish yellow mineral, common throughout the Levant, and particularly found on a particular island in the Red Sea, {{under the control of the}} Egyptian Pharaoh.|$|E

500|$|There {{are seven}} glass {{vessels in the}} collection, but {{a larger number of}} pieces in {{transparent}} rock crystal or quartz, a mineral that might easily be taken for glass. This was always a much more valuable and prestigious material, qualifying as a <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone.</b> [...] Needing very patient grinding and drilling, it is much harder to work than glass (though correspondingly less easy to break once finished), and the pieces include mounts or bases in precious metal, which none of the actual glass has; nor are the rock crystal pieces painted. [...] Read's catalogue groups these and other pieces in <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone</b> with the objects in gold, as opposed to the [...] "silver plate", which probably reflects how a Renaissance collector would have ranked them. [...] There are ten pieces in crystal and nine in other stones.|$|E
500|$|The {{brilliant}} palette {{ought to}} have been expected by the restorers as the same range of colours appears in the works of Giotto, Masaccio and Masolino, Fra Angelico and Piero della Francesca, as well as Ghirlandaio himself and later fresco painters such as Annibale Carracci and Tiepolo. The reason for employing this range of colours is that many other pigments are not usable in fresco as they have chemical properties that react badly in interaction with wet plaster. [...] The colour that is noticeably missing from Michelangelo's ceiling, but not The Last Judgment, is the intense blue of lapis lazuli. This colour, achieved by grinding <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone,</b> was always applied as a secondary, a secco stage, along with the gold leaf applied as haloes and decoration to robes.|$|E
500|$|In {{all this}} tradition, the {{contemporary}} architectural style for mosques was adapted for a {{building with a}} smaller main room, and usually no courtyard. [...] Decoration was often tilework, and could include parchin kari inlays in <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone,</b> painting, and decorative carving. [...] No animals would be represented, but geometric patterns and written inscriptions were common. [...] The sarcophagus {{might be in a}} small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room. [...] Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the Qur'an in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The Mausoleum of Khomeini, still under construction in a Tehran cemetery, and intended to be the centre of a huge complex, continues these traditions.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from the}} two pieces of Islamic glass {{described}} above, there are five Renaissance or Baroque glass vessels, all unusual and of exceptional quality. Most are Venetian glass; one is moulded opaque Bohemian glass (WB.56) with a Triumph of Neptune, and is now dated to the late 17th century; it is also dichroic glass, which changes colour depending on whether it is lit from the front or behind. [...] There is a very rare goblet in opaque turquoise glass with enamels (WB.55); this was to imitate or suggest a vessel in even more expensive <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone.</b> [...] The late 15th-century Deblín Cup with its cover {{is one of a}} small group of vessels made in Murano, Venice in a German or Central European taste, drawing on metalwork shapes used there. [...] It carries a later inscription in Czech urging that the health of the Lords of Deblín, near Brno, be drunk, and was probably the [...] "welcome cup" [...] of the castle there.|$|E

2500|$|Tourmaline ( [...] ) is a {{crystalline}} boron silicate mineral {{compounded with}} {{elements such as}} aluminium, iron, magnesium, sodium, lithium, or potassium.

According to the Madras Tamil Lexicon, the Tamil [...] "tuvara-malli" [...] (துவரைமல்லி) and Toramalli are also derived from the Sinhalese root word. This etymology is also given in other standard dictionaries including the Oxford dictionary.|$|E

2500|$|Ultramarine, {{originally}} the <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone</b> lapis lazuli, {{has been replaced}} by an inexpensive modern synthetic pigment, French Ultramarine, manufactured from aluminium silicate with sulfur impurities. At the same time, Royal Blue, another name once given to tints produced from lapis lazuli, has evolved to signify a much lighter and brighter color, and is usually mixed from Phthalo Blue and titanium dioxide, or from inexpensive synthetic blue dyes. Since synthetic ultramarine is chemically identical with lapis lazuli, the [...] "hue" [...] designation is not used. French Blue, yet another historic name for ultramarine, was adopted by the textile and apparel industry as a color name in the 1990s, and was applied to a shade of blue that has nothing in common with the historic pigment ultramarine.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese {{sculpture}} also achieves {{the difficult}} feat of creating effective landscapes in three dimensions. There {{is a long}} tradition of the appreciation of [...] "viewing stones" [...] - naturally formed boulders, typically limestone from the banks of mountain rivers that has been eroded into fantastic shapes, were transported to the courtyards and gardens of the literati. Probably associated with these is the tradition of carving much smaller boulders of jade or some other <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone</b> into the shape of a mountain, including tiny figures of monks or sages. Chinese gardens also developed a highly sophisticated aesthetic much earlier than those in the West; the karensansui or Japanese dry garden of Zen Buddhism takes the garden even closer to being a work of sculpture, representing a highly abstracted landscape.|$|E

The mantelshelf is massive enough to support three lifesized marble busts: Edward Akroyd on the left, his father Jonathan in the centre, and his wife Elizabeth on the right (by Nicolo Bazzanti). [...] The bust of Elizabeth is remarkable in that it has the trompe-l'œil effect of a veil over the face. The glazed hearth tiles are similar to Mintons tiles but are probably locally made.|$|E
