50|$|Electronic dry boxes {{contain a}} small Peltier cooler, which removes {{moisture}} from the air by condensing it out. A control dial is usually provided that permits the user rough adjustment of the humidity level. More sophisticated designs link the cooler to a <b>settable</b> digital hygrometer, allowing very precise humidity level control.|$|E
50|$|Pentax Optio W-series compact cameras (Optio W10,W20,W60,W90,WG-1) {{as well as}} Optio 555 have a {{built-in}} basic intervalometer. The camera is put in standby mode between shots to reduce power. The intervalometer can be set to take up to 1000 pictures, at a user <b>settable</b> interval of 10 seconds to 99 minutes.|$|E
50|$|A {{component}} {{consists of}} a configured implementation, where an implementation is the piece of program code implementing business functions. The component configures the implementation with specific values for <b>settable</b> properties declared by the implementation. The component can also configure the implementation with wiring of references declared by the implementation to specific target services.|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} IBM AT, PCs {{supported}} a hardware clock <b>settable</b> through BIOS. It had a century bit which allowed for manually changing the century when the year 2000 happened. Most BIOS revisions created in 1995 {{and nearly all}} BIOS revisions in 1997 supported the year 2000 by setting the century bit automatically when the clock rolled past midnight, December 31, 1999.|$|E
50|$|Assignment of left/middle/right {{button to}} primary/modifier/alternate, alternate/modifier/primary, or {{something}} else is <b>settable</b> by many means. Some mice have a switch, that swaps assignment of right and left keys. Many laptop bioses have a setting for mouse button assignment. Many window managers have a setting that permutes the assignment. Within the X Window System core protocol, permutation can be applied by xmodmap(1).|$|E
50|$|A {{monophonic}} synthesizer or monosynth is a synthesizer {{that produces}} only one note at a time, making it smaller and cheaper than a polyphonic synthesizer which can play multiple notes at once. This {{does not necessarily}} refer to a synthesizer with a single oscillator; The Minimoog, for example, has three oscillators which are <b>settable</b> in arbitrary intervals, but it can play only one note at a time.|$|E
5000|$|IRCnet {{operates}} {{few if any}} {{network services}} to service nicknames or channels. It does implement reop -channelmode that allows channel operators to set hostmasks for users to be automatically [...] "reopped" [...] by the server. This mode is called +R with capital Rand in fact supersedes the RFC2811 +r (lower-case r) channel mode, available only on !-channels and <b>settable</b> (not resettable) only by their creators.|$|E
50|$|A revised machine, the C-36, {{was similar}} to the C-35, but had a {{different}} distribution of the lugs on the bars. Six C-36 machines were purchased by the Swedish Navy for testing in October 1937. Both machines had five pinwheels with 17, 19, 21, 23 and 25 pins, each individually <b>settable,</b> giving a maximum period of 3,900,225 for the machine. The C-362 revision included a few other improvements, most notably movable lugs instead of fixed.|$|E
50|$|The {{collective}} pitch control or collective {{is located on}} the left side of the pilot's seat with a <b>settable</b> friction control to prevent inadvertent movement. The collective changes the pitch angle of all the main rotor blades collectively (i.e. all at the same time) and independently of their position. Therefore, if a collective input is made, all the blades change equally, and the result is the helicopter increasing or decreasing in altitude.|$|E
50|$|Fluids {{can contain}} {{suspended}} solid matter consisting of particles {{of many different}} sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly {{to the bottom of}} the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the <b>settable</b> solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.|$|E
5000|$|In {{canonical}} mode, {{data are}} accumulated {{in a line}} editing buffer, and do not become [...] "available for reading" [...] until line editing has been terminated by the user (at the terminal) sending a line delimiter character. Line delimiter characters are special characters, and they are end of file, end of line, and linefeed (ASCII [...] ). The former two are <b>settable</b> programmatically, whilst the latter is fixed. The latter two {{are included in the}} line editing buffer, whilst the former one is not.|$|E
50|$|KCF's {{orientation}} {{boards are}} 3 axes, dynamic, and provide actual orientation in 3D space at 72 times/second. They include unique, user <b>settable</b> addresses which allow multiple sensors to be daisy chained together. A USB to RS485 adapter provides power and communication, and both raw sensor and orientation data are accessible. The unit has diverse applications, including marine, industrial, academic, and film usages. It {{is sold in}} three unique designs: as a bare board, with a black anodized aluminum casing, and with a housing suitable for marine environments.|$|E
5000|$|... oBIX 1.0 {{provides}} {{a low level}} object model which can be extended during implementation. While points are directly addressable (and thereby <b>settable),</b> direct interaction with the points requires too much knowledge of the underlying control system for the enterprise developer. The underlying points can be aggregated, the results named, alarm levels set, and histories begun using the oBIX contract. If oBIX exposes a low level object model for control systems, oBIX contracts create the higher level type libraries that most programmers actually want to work with.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the format}} is {{commonly}} associated with print film, Kodak also produced Kodachrome 110 slide film until 1982.In 2012 Lomography re-introduced slide film for 110 with their Peacock 200 ASA model. However, since not all 110 cameras have a <b>settable</b> ASA dial (low or high, depending on presence of a notch in the cassette), a ND filter has to be used over the lens or the exposure compensation dial has to be used where available. Otherwise, over-exposure {{by a factor of}} x2 will result, leading to over-exposed images.|$|E
50|$|Its I/O mode is {{flexible}} and programmable, {{and it has}} a single-phase clock with an on-chip oscillator. Its register set consists of sixteen 16-bit registers. The program counter (PC) can reside in any of these, and is <b>settable</b> using the SEP Rn instruction, providing a simple way to implement multiple PCs, and to perform subroutine calls. (see Subroutine calls below). Similarly, pointers and indirect addressing use the X register (SEX Rn instruction), or the 16 registers can be used as general purpose registers. DMA In and Out and Interrupts use specific registers.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the coast}} of South Asia and the west part of {{mainland}} Southeast Asia, they {{went down to the}} Gulf of Thailand, in which this route is supported by the coastline that many scholars believe that this route is a possible route for the migration from Africa. This route seems to depict the major movement from Africa into this region. However, many possible sites along the coastline are difficult to locate due to the shift of the shoreline, even though the environmental setting is <b>settable</b> for the hominid habitats.|$|E
5000|$|In Unix and POSIX-compatible systems, local echo is a flag in the POSIX {{terminal}} interface, <b>settable</b> programmatically {{with the}} [...] function. The echoing is {{performed by the}} operating system's terminal device (in some way that is not specified by the POSIX standard). The standard utility program that alters this flag programmatically is the [...] command, using which the flag may be altered from shell scripts or an interactive shell. The command to turn local echo (by the host system) on is [...] and the command {{to turn it off}} is [...]|$|E
50|$|One {{reviewer}} underlined {{the fact}} that “McGuinness has whittled Sophocles’s plays down to a succession of very short, simple lines {{that can be easily}} heard when sung across an auditorium”, and that “Anderson’s music fills the emotional space around these lines”, to conclude that “for all the antiquity of its roots, Thebans may point to the future of opera”. Another reviewer declared that Frank McGuinness “has supplied what seems an eminently <b>settable,</b> elegant condensation of the drama”, and that the opera as a whole offers “the superb assurance of the writing metallically intent but underpinned by a novel harmonic richness”.|$|E
5000|$|The {{compatibility}} bitflags <b>settable</b> in [...] are not {{documented in}} the [...] file that ships with Windows 3.1, or in the Microsoft Windows 3.1 Resource Kit published by Microsoft. They are listed as a simple set of defined constants (with names beginning [...] "GACF_" [...] for [...] "GetAppCompatFlags"), without explanation, in the [...] header file that is shipped with the Microsoft Windows 3.1 Device driver Development Kit. In Windows 3.1, the compatibility flags that are in effect for any given task in the kernel's Task Database are readable via the undocumented [...] function that is exported from the [...] module.|$|E
5000|$|AutoLISP is a small, {{dynamically}} scoped, dynamically typed LISP dialect with garbage collection, immutable {{list structure}} and <b>settable</b> symbols, lacking in such regular LISP features as macro system, records definition facilities, arrays, functions with variable number of arguments or let bindings. Aside {{from the core}} language, most of the primitive functions are for geometry, accessing AutoCAD's internal DWG database, or manipulation of graphical entities in AutoCAD. The properties of these graphical entities are revealed to AutoLISP as association lists in which values are paired with AutoCAD [...] "group codes" [...] that indicate properties such as definitional points, radii, colors, layers, linetypes, etc. AutoCAD loads AutoLISP code from [...]LSP files.|$|E
50|$|The {{intention}} {{was to have the}} printers be programmed with control characters to set and clear the stops: ISO 6429 includes the codes 136 (Horizontal Tabulation Set), 137 (Horizontal Tabulation with Justification) and 138 (Vertical Tabulation Set). In practice, <b>settable</b> tab stops were rather quickly replaced with fixed tab stops, de facto standardized at every multiple of 8 characters horizontally, and every 6 lines vertically. A printing program could send zero or more tabs to get to the closest tab stop above and left of where it wanted to print, then send line feeds and spaces to get to the final location. Tab characters simply became a form of data compression.|$|E
50|$|In {{a special}} {{training}} session with cyclist Rochelle Gilmore, the contestants were challenged on their spin bikes. Each spin bike was {{hooked up to}} a car's headlights, with the headlights being turned on when the contestant cycled above a <b>settable</b> RPM level. At the end of the spin training session, Rochelle set a challenge for the contestants to maintain 130 rpm for 4 minutes. All four contestants hit 130 rpm. Lisa dropped out first, followed by Shannon. Phoebe and David were still going after 3 minutes, at which point Shannan raised the bar to 140 rpm for the last minute, which both Phoebe and David met. With 30 seconds remaining, Shannan raised the bar again to 150 rpm. David was able to reach 150 rpm, but Phoebe was not. David was able to last the set time and won the challenge. There was no prize for the challenge.|$|E
50|$|GarageBand can import MIDI {{files and}} offers piano roll or notation-style editing and playback. By {{complying}} with the MIDI Standard, a user can edit many different aspects of a recorded note, including pitch, velocity, and duration. Pitch was <b>settable</b> to 1/128 of a semitone, {{on a scale of}} 0-127 (sometimes described on a scale of 1-128 for clarity). Velocity, which determines amplitude (volume), can be set and adjusted on a scale of 0-127. Note duration can be adjusted manually via the piano roll or in the score view. Note rhythms can be played via the software instruments, or created in the piano roll environment; rhythm correction is also included to lock notes to any time signature subdivision. GarageBand also offers global editing capabilities to MIDI information with Enhanced Timing, also known as Quantizing. While offering comprehensive control over MIDI files, GarageBand does not include several features of professional-level DAWs, such as a sequencer for drum tracks separate from the normal piano roll. However, many of these shortcomings have been addressed with each successive release of GarageBand. Also of note, MIDI sequences edited or created in GarageBand cannot be exported to other DAWs or programs without first being converted to audio.|$|E
50|$|The Kine Exakta {{controls}} are somewhat {{different from those}} found on most later 35mm SLR film cameras: The finder hood in its collapsed state automatically blocks the shutter release. The film is transported towards the left, leaving the exposed frames {{the other way round}} on the filmstrip. The wind-on lever on the left-hand top plate is operated by the left hand thumb and it requires a single 300-degree movement. It advances the film one frame, cocks the shutter, and increments the manual reset frame counter. The lift, turn and set shutter speed dial on the left-hand top plate provides exposure times from 1/25 to 1/1000 second, plus B and Z (time). For double exposures, the shutter may be cocked again by turning the shutter speed dial itself. On the right-hand top plate sits a separately wound dual purpose dial, featuring long time exposure and delayed action shutter release. It works at the shutter setting B and is only <b>settable</b> after the shutter is cocked. Slow speeds are selected by the lift, turn and set procedure against a small index dot. The long exposures times, without delay, are marked in black numerals all the way to 12 seconds, while slow speeds with delayed action are in red numerals to 6 seconds. This is the extent of self-timer release available. All functions are activated by the left-hand front located threaded shutter release button. A film-cutting device is located inside the camera. It enables a partially exposed film to be removed from the camera in daylight for processing provided the left-hand take-up spool was placed in a cassette. A small milled knob at the base is unscrewed and pulled out to cut the film close to the unexposed film cassette.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relations between}} the causal models of Pearl and the <b>settable</b> systems framework recently introduced by White and Chalak. We pay particular attention to the suitability of these two approaches for analyzing the behavior of optimizing, interacting agents, the central concern of economics. We show that Pearl’s causal model is nested in the <b>settable</b> system framework, and we describe a number of ways in which Pearl’s causal models are not well suited to the study of interacting, optimizing agents. In contrast, <b>settable</b> systems have been explicitly designed to facilitate this study, accommodating systems of agents that not only optimize and interact, but that may learn from experience. We illustrate using examples from microeconomics, option pricing, game theory, and recursive estimation. Among the features of <b>settable</b> systems that distinguish it from Pearl’s causal models and that help deliver its capabilities are its countable rather than finite structure, its explicit use of attributes, and the introduction of partitions and partition-specific respons...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} interrelations between {{independence}} or conditional independence and causal relations, {{defined in terms}} of functional dependence, that hold among variables of interest within the <b>settable</b> system framework of White and Chalak. We provide formal conditions ensuring the validity of Reichenbach’s principle of common cause and introduce a new conditional counterpart, the conditional Reichenbach principle of common cause. We then provide necessary and sufficient causal conditions for probabilistic dependence and conditional dependence among certain random vectors in <b>settable</b> systems. Immediate corollaries of these results constitute causal conditions sufficient to ensure independence or conditional independence among random vectors in <b>settable</b> systems. We demonstrate how our results relate to and generalize results in the artificial intelligence literature, particularly results concerning d-separation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine if there is a significant difference in postsecondary business student scores and test completion time based on <b>settable</b> test item exposure control interface format, and to determine if there is a significant difference in student scores and test completion time based on <b>settable</b> test item exposure control interface format by gender. Results of the study indicate that there is no significant difference in postsecondary business student scores or test completion times based on <b>settable</b> test item exposure control interface format. When the variable gender was added, female postsecondary business students were found to achieve significantly higher test scores and to have significantly faster test completion times. Effect size and descriptive statistic analysis suggests that these differences by gender are too small to be of much practical difference...|$|E
