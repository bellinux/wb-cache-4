5000|$|A {{versatile}} pan {{that combines}} {{the best of}} both the <b>sauté</b> <b>pan</b> and the frying pan has higher, sloping sides that are often slightly curved. This pan is called a sauteuse (literally a <b>sauté</b> <b>pan</b> in the female gender), an evasée (denoting a pan with sloping sides), or a fait-tout (literally [...] "does everything"). Most professional kitchens have several of these utensils in varying sizes.|$|E
50|$|A frying pan, frypan, or skillet is a {{flat-bottomed}} pan {{used for}} frying, searing, and browning foods. It is typically 200 to 300 mm in diameter with relatively low sides that flare outwards, a long handle, and no lid. Larger pans {{may have a}} small grab handle opposite the main handle. A pan of similar dimensions, but with less flared vertical sides and often with a lid, is called a <b>sauté</b> <b>pan.</b> While a <b>sauté</b> <b>pan</b> can be used like a frying pan, it is designed for lower heat cooking methods, namely sautéing.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sauté</b> <b>pans,</b> {{used for}} <b>sautéing,</b> {{have a large}} surface area and low sides to permit steam to escape and allow the cook to toss the food. [...] The word [...] "sauté" [...] comes from the French verb [...] "sauter", meaning to jump. <b>Saute</b> <b>pans</b> often have {{straight}} vertical sides, but may also have flared or rounded sides.|$|R
25|$|Anodized {{aluminium}} {{has had the}} {{naturally occurring}} layer of aluminium oxide thickened by an electrolytic process to create a surface that is hard and non-reactive. It is used for <b>sauté</b> <b>pans,</b> stockpots, roasters, and Dutch ovens.|$|R
5000|$|Sautéing ( [...] or , {{from the}} French sauté , lit. [...] "jumped, bounced" [...] in {{reference}} to tossing while cooking) is a method of cooking food that uses {{a small amount of}} oil or fat in a shallow pan over relatively high heat. Various sauté methods exist, and <b>sauté</b> <b>pans</b> are a specific type of <b>pan</b> designed for <b>sautéing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "La Paul&eacute;e" [...] {{comes from}} the French word for <b>sauté</b> <b>pan,</b> poile. In its {{earliest}} incarnations, the post-harvest meal was so simple that it was cooked in a single poile.|$|E
50|$|When {{the sauce}} {{is used to}} {{accompany}} sautéed meat or poultry, it is made directly in the <b>sauté</b> <b>pan</b> in which these items were cooked. The onions or shallots are sautéed in the pan and the red wine is added {{which is used to}} dissolve and incorporate the residue from the cooking of the meat. The onions may also be cooked {{at the same time as}} the meat.|$|E
50|$|Wash the {{vegetable}}s. Chop {{the vegetable}} into small rectangular pieces. Put coconut {{oil in a}} frying or <b>saute</b> <b>pan</b> and add red chilli and mustard seeds to the oil, saute it, add the chopped vegetables and salt to taste. Stir {{it for a few}} minutes and remove from heat. Turmeric powder or cumin seeds or garam masala can be added for different taste. The ajethna is generally served with cooked rice or chapati.|$|E
50|$|Frying {{techniques}} vary in {{the amount}} of fat required, the cooking time, the type of cooking vessel required, and the manipulation of the food. <b>Sautéing,</b> stir frying, <b>pan</b> frying, shallow frying, and deep frying are all standard frying techniques.|$|R
50|$|To this {{a little}} pends (browned bits or drippings from meats or vegetables, found {{on the bottom of}} a <b>sauté</b> or {{roasting}} <b>pan</b> via the Maillard reaction) or stock may be added. It is used to flavor sauces such as tomato sauce, savory fruit sauces, and other sweet and sour sauces such as the classic orange sauce for duck à l'orange.|$|R
5000|$|In some productions, {{the cast}} prepares and eats the food. For example, in the MRT Productions (Chicago) presentation, the {{reviewer}} noted: [...] "A meticulously detailed set, including actual food prepared and savored onstage with mouthwatering sensuality, {{also contributes to}} 'The Art of Dining'. [...] " [...] In a production by the Key City Public Theatre at the Key City Playhouse, Port Townsend, Washington, the reviewer described the stage activity: [...] "... the food is either prepared on set by Steurer Ellen — a restaurateur in her other life — and Nollette Cal, or delivered steaming haute and fragrant from the <b>saute</b> <b>pans</b> of chef Dan Kithcart of nearby Alchemy Bistro and Wine Bar. Good for the actors, who actually get to eat all that actual cooking." [...] In the Community Theatre production at the Imperial Centre, Rocky Mount, North Carolina, the reviewer wrote: [...] "Adding to the effect, the actors cook and eat real food on stage with a real working kitchen." [...] In a production at the Smith Theatre, Howard Community College, Maryland, the reviewer observed that [...] "The offbeat production -- sizzling with dual conversations, physical humor and clever staging -- presented several obstacles for the cast and crew. To lend a flavor of authenticity, gourmet food from a gourmet restaurant will be imported for each show... The restaurant's chef, Glenn Spindler, also gave two of the actors a crash course on slicing and serving, and preparing the dessert -- flaming crepes suzette... But to perfect the art of dining, the actors first had to perfect the art of eating. 'They've been practicing on bread and Jell-O,' the director said." ...|$|R
50|$|Various {{types of}} cook-tops {{are used as}} well. They carry the same {{variations}} of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above. Cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed {{on top of the}} heat source, such as a <b>sauté</b> <b>pan,</b> sauce pot, frying pan, or pressure cooker. These pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as steaming, simmering, boiling, and poaching for moist methods, while the dry methods include sautéing, pan frying, and deep-frying.|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} {{frying pan}} or electric skillet incorporates an {{electric heating element}} into the frying pan itself and so can function independently off of a cooking stove. Accordingly, it has heat-insulated legs for standing on a countertop. (The legs usually attach to handles.) Electric frying pans are common in shapes that are unusual for 'unpowered' frying pans, notably square and rectangular. Most are designed with straighter sides than their stovetop cousins and include a lid. In this way they are {{a cross between a}} frying pan and a <b>sauté</b> <b>pan.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Standard American chop suey {{consists}} of elbow macaroni {{and bits of}} cooked ground beef with sautéed onions and green peppers in a thick tomato-based sauce. The dish is typically cooked in a frying or <b>sauté</b> <b>pan,</b> {{as opposed to being}} baked in an oven like a casserole. Though this comfort food is influenced by Italian-American cuisine as well as older New England quick and practical meals like the [...] "potato bargain" [...] and [...] "necessity mess," [...] it is known as [...] "American chop suey" [...] both because it is a sometimes-haphazard hodgepodge of meat, vegetables and Italian seasonings, and because it once used rice, a base ingredient in Chinese cuisine, instead of pasta.|$|E
50|$|Only enough fat to lightly {{coat the}} bottom of the pan is needed for sautéing; too much fat will cause the food to fry rather than just to slide, and may {{interfere}} with the development of fond. The food is spread across the hot fat in the pan, and left to brown, turning or tossing frequently for even cooking. The sauté technique involves gripping the handle of the <b>sauté</b> <b>pan</b> firmly, and using a sharp elbow motion to rapidly jerk the pan back toward the cook, repeating as necessary to ensure the ingredients have been thoroughly jumped. Tossing or stirring the items in the pan by shaking the pan too often, however, can cause the pan to cool faster and make the sauté take longer.|$|E
50|$|In a sauté, all the {{ingredients}} are heated at once, and cooked quickly. To facilitate this, {{the ingredients}} are rapidly moved around in the pan, either {{by the use of}} a utensil, or by repeatedly jerking the pan itself. A <b>sauté</b> <b>pan</b> must be large enough to hold all of the food in one layer, so steam can escape, which keeps the ingredients from stewing and promotes the development of fond. Most pans sold specifically as sauté pans have a wide flat base and low sides, to maximize the surface area available for heating. The low sides allow quick evaporation and escape of steam. While skillets typically have flared or rounded sides, sauté pans typically have straight, vertical sides. This keeps the ingredients from escaping as the pan is jerked or stirred.|$|E
5000|$|In Himachal Pradesh, kulath {{is used to}} make khichdi. In Uttarakhand, it {{is cooked}} in a round iron <b>saute</b> <b>pan</b> (kadhai) to prepare ras, a {{favorite}} of most Kumaonis. In Garhwal region, another more elaborate dish is phanu which is made in a kadhai with roughly ground gahat (previously soaked overnight) boiled over several hours. Towards the end, some finely chopped greens (palak or spinach, rai, tender radish leaves, or dhania (coriander leaves) if nothing else is available) are added to complete the dish. Served with boiled rice, jhangora (a millet-like grain, used as a staple by poorer Garhwalis only a decade ago and now a prized health-food) or just roti, phanu is a wholesome and nutritious meal. is somewhat heavy to digest; {{it is possible to}} go through the whole day without feeling in the least bit hungry, after having a big phanu meal in the morning.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two primary}} ways {{to prepare the}} fish (most popularly, sole or trout). One is by sautéing—first {{dredging}} the fish in seasoned flour (white flour or corn flour) and then cooking in a hot <b>sauté</b> <b>pan</b> {{with a small amount}} of clarified butter. The alternative method is to pan-fry or deep fry the floured fish. In pan frying, oil or a combination of oil and butter is used—up to perhaps 2 cm deep. Deep frying is done in either a large fry pot or in a stand-alone deep fryer. The floured fish is completely submerged in the hot oil. The frying techniques result in a crisper texture, but the sauce will need to be made separately. The sautéed fish will have a softer skin by comparison, but allows for the possibility of creating the sauce [...] after the fish has been removed by adding fresh butter, parsley, and lemon.|$|E
50|$|A consommé is made {{by adding}} a mixture of ground meats, {{together}} with mirepoix (a combination of carrots, celery, and onion), tomatoes, and egg whites into either bouillon or stock. The key to making a high quality consommé is simmering; the act of simmering, combined with frequent stirring, brings impurities {{to the surface of}} the liquid, which are further drawn out due to the presence of acid from the tomatoes. Eventually, the solids begin to congeal at the surface of the liquid, forming a 'raft', which is caused by the proteins in the egg whites. Once the 'raft' begins to form, the heat is reduced, and the consommé is simmered at a lower heat until it reaches the desired flavor, which usually takes anywhere from 45 minutes to over an hour. The resulting concoction is a clear liquid that has either a rich amber colour (for beef or veal consommé) or a very pale yellow colour (for poultry consommé). It is then carefully drawn from the pot and passed again through a filter to ensure its purity, and is then put through a lengthy process where all of the visible fat is skimmed from the surface. To ensure total purification, the consommé can be refrigerated, which draws out remaining fat, which can easily be skimmed off with a cheesecloth. Alternatively, the consommé can be placed in a wide, shallow container such as a <b>sauté</b> <b>pan</b> or large bowl and wide strips of parchment paper can be dragged along the surface; the tiny amounts of remaining fat adhere to the parchment, leaving the consommé perfectly de-greased. Cartilage and tendons should be left on the meat because of the gelatin they contain, which enhances the mouthfeel of the soup. If beef or veal is used, shin meat is ideal because it is very low in fat and very high in gristle, and although it is undesirable for most other purposes, it is near essential for the flavour of the consommé. The meat is best if it is ground very fine, as if for a mousseline.|$|E
40|$|What Does Food Mean to Me Food {{has always}} been very {{important}} to me and I have always been very interested in it. Even when I was a little kid I would always be in the kitchen helping my mom. Whether I was pouring flour into cookie dough batter, spraying a cupcake pan with pam, or eating the leftover brownie batter, the different tastes and interesting flavors of food have always intrigued me. I noticed that different tastes and smells would trigger important memories for me. The repetition of certain meals helped me remember important moments in my life, this is why traditional meals have always stood out to me. A traditional meal that is very special to me is my grandpa’s homemade spaetzle,. A traditional meal that stands out to me the most is my grandpa’s homemade spaetzle. Many people do not know what spaetzle is because it is very foreign. Spaetzle is a soft egg noodle or dumpling found in cuisines of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Hungary. It is a very unique dish because it can be prepared as a savory or a sweet entrée. I remember the first time I ever laid eyes on it I was a little nervous to even try it. The noodles were a very odd shape and had an odd smell to them. They look like little larva worms with a light brown color to them. Without asking my grandpa would give me {{a large portion of the}} noodles and smile at me as I ate and tasted the delicious worm like noodles. The noodle would slowly melt in my mouth as I began to shove more into my mouth. The noodles were surprisingly addicting. I would not bother looking at the other food on my plate until all the noodles on my plate were gone. I was so intrigued by this oddly named, weird looking, and delicious dish that I had to have more. My two younger sisters and I would ask my grandpa to make his special spaetzle every time we would see him, whether it was an important holiday or a random family gathering, we needed to have it. This is my favorite recipe because it always reminds me of him. My dad agreed with me by saying “If I had to pick one thing that I really loved to cook with him it was spaetzle, essentially a German dumpling. This is one of the reasons why I asked him to teach you, Kara and Grace to make them as well-need to have the tradition carry on. ” This last winter my grandpa grew very ill and we knew he didn’t have much time left with him. We had him come over to our house to have him prepare some of our favorite dishes. I, of course, asked him to show me how to make his homemade spaetzle. I read different versions of the recipe online but his was slightly different. According to my dad “His recipe is not written-down. Like a good chef is comes from practice and taste. This is why he taught us-so we can pass it down. ” When he made his dough, he took a lot of time because he wanted to make sure it would be the perfect consistency. He would hand beat a couple eggs in a bowl and then he would slowly add in small amount of another mixture of flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg (his little special touch). The batter was a lot thinner than I expected it to be but this was because he liked to have the dough form a small noodle rather than a chunky dumpling. He would use his ancient strainer and slowly pour the batter in. The droplets of batter would fall into a boiling pot of salty water. The little noodles would float to the surface of the water and begin to cook. Since the noodles were so thin, they did not take very long to cook. He would then scoop the noodles out of the water and throw them into a <b>sauté</b> <b>pan</b> lined with butter and a little bit f garlic. This was my favorite way to eat them because the little doughy noodles would get caramelized by the copious amounts of butter. My grandpa was very close to my family and not having him around makes the holidays a lot harder. He was a man of very few words, mostly because it was always so hard to understand him. He was fluent in 6 different languages, which gave him a very strange accent. The best way for him to speak was through his cooking. He taught me to appreciate the food that I ate. Food was meant to be simple and made with love. Through him I learned to be patient with food, the best meals take the most time and focus but it was always worth it. I began to appreciate the time I had left with him. He taught me everything I know about German cooking. My family and I miss him dearly. The best way for me to remember him is by preparing his favorite dish, Spatzel. Overall, food is {{very important to me}} because it has helped me remember the important moments in my life and has also provided me with the sense of community...|$|E
