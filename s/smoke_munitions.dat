5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels. Boron {{is used in}} pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide {{has been identified as}} a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in <b>smoke</b> <b>munitions,</b> signal flares and fireworks. Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.|$|E
50|$|Hexachloroethane, {{also known}} as {{perchloroethane}} (PCA), C2Cl6, is a white crystalline solid at room temperature with a camphor-like odor. It {{has been used by}} the military in smoke compositions, such as base-eject <b>smoke</b> <b>munitions</b> (smoke grenades).|$|E
50|$|Courtland AAF was {{the home}} of a Basic Flying School which {{utilized}} Vultee BT-13s for the Air Cadets. Personnel were required to fire pistols or carbines for marksmanship training and practice gas attack drills. The chemical agents used during training were tear gas, mustard agent, chlorine gas, incendiary and <b>smoke</b> <b>munitions.</b>|$|E
50|$|Artillery and mortars {{can also}} fire <b>smoke</b> {{generating}} <b>munitions,</b> {{and are the}} main means of generating tactical smokescreens on land. As with grenades, artillery shells are available as both emission type smoke shell, and bursting smoke shell. Mortars nearly always use bursting smoke rounds because of the smaller size of mortar bombs and the greater efficiency of bursting rounds.|$|R
5|$|Carbon, aluminium, {{phosphorus}} and selenium {{continue the}} theme. Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants, bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military delay fuses and igniters. Aluminium {{is a common}} pyrotechnic ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in thermite mixtures. Phosphorus {{can be found in}} <b>smoke</b> and incendiary <b>munitions,</b> paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. Selenium has been used {{in the same way as}} tellurium.|$|R
50|$|The {{time length}} of a time fuze is usually {{calculated}} {{as part of the}} technical fire control calculations, and not done at the gun although armies have differed in their arrangements. The fuze length primarily reflects the range to the target and the required height of burst. High height of burst, typically a few hundred metres, is usually used with star shell (illuminating shell) and other base ejecting shells such as <b>smoke</b> and cluster <b>munitions,</b> and for observing with high-explosive (HE) shells in some circumstances. Low airburst, typically about 10 metres, was used with HE. The height of burst with shrapnel depended on the angle of descent, but for optimal use it was a few tens of metres.|$|R
5000|$|In 1941, the United States Army's Chemical Warfare Service {{decided to}} open a {{chemical}} munitions manufacturing and storage facility in Huntsville, Alabama. Prior to that, {{there was only the}} facility at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland. The Huntsville facility produced colored <b>smoke</b> <b>munitions,</b> gel-type and toxic agents such as mustard gas, phosgene, lewisite, white phosphorus, [...] and tear gas. As male employees increasingly were lost to the military draft, the arsenal decided to use women wherever possible. The first were hired in February 1942.|$|E
50|$|White {{phosphorus}} {{has been}} condemned by {{human rights organizations}} as cruel and inhumane because it causes severe burns. White phosphorus burns on the bodies of civilians wounded in clashes near Bagram were confirmed. The U.S. claims at least 44 instances in which militants have used white phosphorus in weapons or attacks. In May 2009, the U.S. confirmed that Western military forces in Afghanistan use white phosphorus to illuminate targets or as an incendiary to destroy bunkers and enemy equipment. U.S. forces used white phosphorus to screen a retreat in the Battle of Ganjgal when regular <b>smoke</b> <b>munitions</b> were not available.|$|E

50|$|The two-man turret on the K21 is {{armed with}} an S&T Dynamics K40 40 mm cannon capable of firing APFSDS, high-explosive, <b>smoke</b> and {{multipurpose}} <b>munitions,</b> and a 7.62 mm machine gun. This {{is combined with}} an advanced fire-control system and gun stabilizer usually found on third-generation main battle tanks that makes the K21, together with the German Puma, able to move and engage the targets with high degree of accuracy at the same time. The ammunition for the autocannon is stored under the turret. The 40 mm cannon can fire up to 300 rounds per minute, with a projectile velocity of up to 1,005 m/s. The improved APFSDS rounds fired from {{it is able to}} penetrate up to 160-220 mm of armor, slightly higher than other APFSDS rounds, due to the self-sharpening process as the round penetrates the armour.|$|R
40|$|Most {{coloring}} agents used {{in older}} markers, signals and <b>smoke</b> <b>munitions</b> are carcinogenic or suspected carcinogens, {{but are still}} abundant in the military inventory. Confirmation of acceptable alternatives and development of safe disposal methods are thus important. Formulations for new items are chosen to minimize risks. Two successful methods are reported here for combustive destruction of colored smokes and many other military items. See the project reports for additional details and a literature summary on hydrothermal methods used 1, 2 for treatment of propellants, explosives and pyrotechnics (PEP). Reaction temperature, feed rates, and etc., have been established for successful destruction of signal devices and bulk colored filler mixes, by incineration in the APE- 1236 M 1 military kiln. This method has been successful also for bulk explosives and several types of munitions. High pressure hydrothermal oxidation in the supercritical range also gave over 99 % destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) for bulk colored smoke mixes, red-water, common explosives and a nerve agent simulant containing the toxic organic phosphate moiety...|$|E
40|$|This volume, {{the second}} {{in a series of}} three devoted to the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) in World War II, now the Chemical Corps, covers research, development, procurement, and {{distribution}} of chemical warfare materiel. It traces the history of these activities from the World War I period, when the CWS was activated to supervise the offensive and defensive aspects of gas warfare throughout the Army, until the end of World War II. The first volume in the series, "Organizing for War", discusses the development of the CWS organization and mission as well as personnel management and military training. The third volume, entitled "Chemicals in Combat", will deal with the chemical warfare activities in the theaters of operations. In treating research and development, the present volume concentrates on CWS projects that proved of greatest significance to the armed forces during World War II. It attempts to point up the problems that arose in course of research and development and to indicate the solutions which the scientists hit upon. Since research and development in the zone of the interior was closely related to research and development in the theaters of operations, the volume covers activities in both areas. In contrast to research and development, procurement and distribution differed considerably as between the zone of the interior and the theaters of operations; in the theaters these activities were closely associated with the commanders' combat responsibilities. The volume, therefore, confines itself to a review of procurement and distribution in the zone of the interior, leaving narration of theater activities to the volume "Chemicals in combat". U. S. G.
