5|$|Stegosaurus madagascariensis from Madagascar {{is known}} solely from teeth and was {{described}} by Piveteau in 1926. The teeth were variously attributed to a <b>stegosaur,</b> the theropod Majungasaurus, a hadrosaur or even a crocodylian, but is now considered a possible ankylosaur.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} still ongoing; at this time, Scelidosaurus is {{considered}} to be either more closely related to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids and, by extension, a true ankylosaur, or basal to the ankylosaur-stegosaur split. The <b>stegosaur</b> classification has fallen out of favor, but is seen in older dinosaur books. Cladistic analyses have invariably recovered a basal position for Scelidosaurus, outside of the Eurypoda.|$|E
5|$|Tracks {{discovered}} by Matthew Mossbrucker (Morrison Natural History Museum, Colorado) suggest that Stegosaurus lived in multiple-age herds. One group of tracks is interpreted as showing {{four or five}} baby stegosaurs moving in the same direction, while another has a juvenile <b>stegosaur</b> track with an adult track overprinting it. Stegosaurus may have preferred drier settings than other common Morrison Formation dinosaurs, such as Allosaurus, Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus.|$|E

50|$|Bohlin placed Stegosaurides in the Stegosauria. However, later authors often presumed it {{represented}} {{a member of}} the Ankylosauria, in an indeterminate position. The fossils resemble vertebrae of both groups in having strongly elevated diapophyses, but are more ankylosaur-like in that the neural arch is moderately tall. Uncertainty over the precise age of the Xinminbao Group adds to the difficulty of determining the affinities. Usually it is given as Early Cretaceous when both <b>stegosaurs</b> and ankylosaurs were present, but sometimes as Late Cretaceous when <b>stegosaurs</b> were probably extinct.|$|R
5000|$|From the Early Cretaceous, {{far fewer}} finds are known {{and it seems}} that the group had {{declined}} in diversity. Some fragmentary fossils have been described, such as Craterosaurus from England and Paranthodon from South Africa. The only more substantial discoveries are those of Wuerhosaurus, the exact age of which is highly uncertain. In the fall of 2016, the teeth and tail spikes of <b>stegosaurs</b> were found in a Russian ravine that was once part of an Early Cretaceous river. The remains of these <b>stegosaurs</b> and other dinosaurs in the area were all miniature, implying that either large amounts of baby dinosaurs spent the first stage in their lives here, or that the area was home to dwarf dinosaurs. Several Russian scientists also theorize that the remains of these <b>stegosaurs,</b> as well as the remains of allosaurids in the same area, could imply that the area could have once been a [...] "refugium", were these Jurassic dinosaurs managed to survive into the Cretaceous period.|$|R
5|$|Other dinosaurs of the La Amarga Formation {{include the}} <b>stegosaur</b> Amargastegos; predatory dinosaurs include the small ceratosaur Ligabueino, and the {{presence}} of a large tetanuran is indicated by teeth. Other than dinosaurs, the formation is notable for the cladotherian mammal Vincelestes, the only mammal known from the Early Cretaceous of South America. Crocodylomorphs are represented by the trematochampsid Amargasuchus– the holotype of this genus was found in association with the Amargasaurus bones.|$|E
5|$|Scelidosaurus was an ornithischian. It was {{the oldest}} ornithischian known until the {{description}} of Geranosaurus in 1911. During the twentieth century, it has been classified at different times as an ankylosaur or <b>stegosaur.</b> Alfred von Zittel (1902), William Elgin Swinton (1934), and Robert Appleby et al. (1967) identified the genus as a stegosaurian, though this concept then encompassed all armoured forms. In a 1968 paper, Romer argued it was an ankylosaur. In 1977, Richard Thulborn of the University of Queensland attempted to reclassify Scelidosaurus as an ornithopod similar to Tenontosaurus or Iguanodon. Thulborn argued Scelidosaurus was a lightly built bipedal dinosaur adapted for running. Thulborn's 1977 theories on the genus have since been rejected.|$|E
5|$|Typically for a <b>stegosaur,</b> Kentrosaurus had {{extensive}} osteoderm (bony {{structures in the}} skin) covering, including small plates (probably located on the neck and anterior trunk), and spikes of various shapes. The spikes of Kentrosaurus are very elongated, with one specimen having a bone core length of 731 millimetres. The plates have a thickened section in the middle, {{as if they were}} modified spines. The spikes and plates were likely covered by horn. Aside from a few exceptions they were not found in close association with other skeletal remains. Thus, the exact position of most osteoderms is uncertain. A pair of closely spaced spikes was found articulated with a tail tip, and a number of spikes were found apparently regularly spaced in pairs along the path of an articulated tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{earlier and}} more basal genus Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of China (some 165 {{million years ago}} – Mya) antedates Stegosaurus by 20 million years {{and is the only}} genus in the family Huayangosauridae. Earlier still is Scelidosaurus, from Early Jurassic England, which lived about 190Mya. Interestingly, it possessed {{features}} of both <b>stegosaurs</b> and ankylosaurs. Emausaurus from Germany was another small quadruped, while Scutellosaurus from Arizona was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal. These small, lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both <b>stegosaurs</b> and ankylosaurs. A trackway of a possible early armored dinosaur, from around 195 Mya, has been found in France.|$|R
40|$|Close {{your eyes}} and {{visualize}} the world 70 million years ago. What do you see? As a science teacher familiar with geologic time and the likely scenery of different geologic eras, you may envision wideranging herds of many kinds of dinosaurs and few, if any, small mammals hiding in the shadows. Included in this vision {{of the age of}} dinosaurs might be the sail-backed Dimetrodon, plate-backed <b>stegosaurs,</b> huge long-necked sauropods (such as Brachiosaurus), swimming ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, flying pterosaurs, three-horned Triceratops, and T. rex.

5|$|Currently, Paranthodon is {{classified}} as a <b>stegosaur</b> related to Stegosaurus, Tuojiangosaurus, and Loricatosaurus. Initially, when Broom assigned the name Palaeoscincus africanus to the Paranthodon fossils, he classified them as an ankylosaurian. This classification was later changed by Nopcsa, who found that Paranthodon best resembled a stegosaurid (before the group was truly defined). Coombs (1978) did not follow Nopcsa's classification, keeping Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, like Broom, although he only classified it as Ankylosauria incertae sedis. A subsequent review by Galton and Coombs in 1981 instead confirmed Nopcsa's interpretation, redescribing Paranthodon as a stegosaurid from the Late Cretaceous. Multiple phylogenetic analyses have placed Paranthodon in Stegosauria, and often in Stegosauridae. A 2010 analysis including nearly all species of stegosaurians found that Paranthodon was outside Stegosauridae, and in a polytomy with Tuojiangosaurus, Huayangosaurus, Chungkingosaurus, Jiangjunosaurus, and Gigantspinosaurus. However, when the latter two genera were removed, Paranthodon grouped with Tuojiangosaurus just outside Stegosauridae, and Huayangosaurus grouped with Chungkingosaurus in Huayangosauridae. Below is the analysis with all included genera.|$|E
5|$|Kentrosaurus {{was a small}} <b>stegosaur.</b> It had {{the typical}} dinosaurian body bauplan, characterised by a small head, a long neck, short forelimbs and long hindlimbs, and a long, {{horizontal}} and muscular tail. Typical stegosaurid traits included the elongation and flatness of the head, the powerful build of the forelimbs, erect and pillar-like hindlimbs {{and an array of}} plates and spikes running along both sides of the top mid-line of the animal. Only a single complete tooth was known when Hennig published his monography in 1925. Later, a part of a dentary, the tooth-bearing bone of the front lower jaw, was found, which bears a just emerging tooth, and some tooth fragments were recovered from matrix sticking to other bones. The deep dentary is almost identical in shape to that of Stegosaurus, albeit much smaller. Similarly, the tooth is a typical stegosaurian tooth, small with a widened base and vertical grooves creating five ridges.|$|E
25|$|Peter Malcolm Galton in {{the eighties}} {{referred}} all <b>stegosaur</b> remains from Late Jurassic deposits in western Europe to D. armatus. A radically different approach was in 2008 taken by Susannah Maidment who limited the material of D. armatus to its holotype. Most named species, among them Astrodon pusillus from Portugal based on <b>stegosaur</b> fossils, she considered nomina dubia. She considered the specimens from mainland Europe possibly a separate species, but as it was too limited to establish distinctive traits she assigned it to Dacentrurus sp.|$|E
50|$|Like all <b>stegosaurs,</b> Chungkingosaurus was a herbivore. Chungkingosaurus {{is thought}} to have coexisted with large plant-eaters and stegosaurids such as Chialingosaurus, Tuojiangosaurus, Mamenchisaurus, and Omeisaurus. It may have also been preyed upon by theropods such as Yangchuanosaurus.|$|R
25|$|Among stegosaurids, only Kentrosaurus {{has been}} found with parascapular spines, which project posteriorly out of {{the lower part of}} the {{shoulder}} plates. These spines are long, rounded and comma-shaped in lateral view and have an enlarged base. Loricatosaurus was also believed to have a parascapular spine, but Maidment et al. (2008) observed that the discovered specimen, from which the spine is described, has a completely different morphology than the parascapular spine specimens of other <b>stegosaurs.</b> They suggest it may be a fragmentary tail spine instead. The genuine absence of parascapular spines in other stegosaurids is considered a secondary loss since many basal <b>stegosaurs</b> like Gigantospinosaurus and Huayangosaurus have been discovered with them.|$|R
40|$|The Villar del Arzobispo Formation (Tithonian-Berriasian) in Teruel and Valencia provinces (SE Iberian Range) {{has yielded}} {{abundant}} skeletal remains of dinosaurs, mainly of sauropods and <b>stegosaurs.</b> Three vertebrae {{collected in the}} locality of Cerrito del Olmo I (Alpuente, Valencia province), two of them previously referred to the stegosaurid Dacentrurus armatus, belong in fact to an ornithopod. The material consists of one cervical and two caudal centra that preserve {{the base of the}} neural arch fused to the centrum. These remains are here assigned to Ornithopoda indet. {{on the basis of the}} combination of several characters more frequent in ornithopods than in <b>stegosaurs.</b> This is the first description of ornithopod skeletal remains from the Villar del Arzobispo Formatio...|$|R
25|$|Stegosaurs {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by the prominent row of plates above the spine and long spines on the tail. Most stegosaurs, but not Stegosaurus, {{also have a}} spine over each shoulder. These spines and plates have evolved from the earlier surface scutes. Huayangosaurus is {{the oldest and most}} primitive known <b>stegosaur.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1985, fossil hunter Patrick McSherry, at {{the ranch}} of S.B. Smith in Johnson County, Wyoming, found {{the remains of a}} <b>stegosaur.</b> As he had {{difficulty}} securing the specimen due to the hard rock matrix, he sought help from Ronald G. Mjos and Jeff Parker of Western Paleontological Laboratories, Inc. They, in turn, cooperated with paleontologist Dee Hall of Brigham Young University. At first, it was assumed it represented an exemplar of Stegosaurus. However, Clifford Miles, while preparing the remains, recognised that they belonged to a species new to science.|$|E
25|$|The holotype, HMNH 001 (later HMNS 14), {{was found}} in the Windy Hill Member, stratigraphic zone 1 of the lower Morrison Formation, dating from the early Kimmeridgian, about 156 million years old. In 2001, it {{represented}} the oldest known American <b>stegosaur.</b> It consists of a nearly complete skull and much of the skeleton. It includes the disarticulated elements of the skull, the rear lower jaws, an hyoid, thirteen neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae, three sacrals, forty-four tail vertebrae, neck ribs, dorsal ribs, chevrons, a left shoulderblade, a complete pelvis, ossified tendons and ten neck and back plates. The skeleton was partly articulated and, in view of healed fractures, belongs to an old individual. It was obtained by the Japanese Hayashibara Museum of Natural Science at Okayama.|$|E

5000|$|Priodontognathus (meaning [...] "saw tooth jaw") was a genus of ankylosaurian dinosaur {{possibly}} {{from the}} Oxfordian-age Upper Jurassic Lower Calcareous Grit of Yorkshire, England. It is a dubious genus {{based on a}} maxilla, and has been erroneously mixed up with iguanodonts and <b>stegosaurs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1977, Dong {{provided}} a diagnosis but this largely consisted of traits shared with other <b>stegosaurs.</b> In 1990, Peter Malcolm Galton pointed out an autapomorphy: the spines of the vertebrae {{of the tail}} base possess spines with bony skirts running from their front to the sides.|$|R
500|$|S. stenops {{had four}} dermal spikes, each about [...] long. Discoveries of {{articulated}} <b>stegosaur</b> armor show, {{at least in}} some species, these spikes protruded horizontally from the tail, not vertically as is often depicted. Initially, Marsh described S.ungulatus as having eight spikes in its tail, unlike S.stenops. However, recent research re-examined this and concluded this species also had four.|$|E
500|$|The first {{fossils of}} Kentrosaurus were {{discovered}} by the German Tendaguru Expedition in 1909, recognised as belonging to a <b>stegosaur</b> by expedition leader Werner Janensch on 24 July 1910, and described by German palaeontologist Edwin Hennig in 1915. The name Kentrosaurus was coined by Hennig and comes from the Greek kentron/κέντρον, meaning [...] "sharp point" [...] or [...] "prickle", and sauros/σαῦρος meaning [...] "lizard", Hennig added the specific name aethiopicus to denote the provenance from Africa.|$|E
500|$|Kentrosaurus was by Hennig {{assigned}} to the Stegosauridae in 1915. This is confirmed by modern cladistic analyses, although {{it should be noted}} that in 1915 Stegosauridae was a far more inclusive concept. A consecutive narrowing down of this concept caused Kentrosaurus, until the 1980s to be seen as a typical [...] "primitive" [...] stegosaurian, to be placed in a more derived, higher, position in the <b>stegosaur</b> evolutionary tree. Derived traits include a sacral yoke, a long prepubic process, a long thighbone and two rows of plates or spikes. A study by Octávio Mateus e.a. in 2009 recovered Kentrosaurus in a basal position in the Stegosauridae as shown by this cladogram: ...|$|E
50|$|Ankylosauria {{was first}} named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1923. In the Linnaean {{classification}} system, {{the group is}} usually considered either a suborder or an infraorder. It is contained within the group Thyreophora, which also includes the <b>stegosaurs,</b> armored dinosaurs known for their combination of plates and spikes.|$|R
50|$|Yang in 1959 placed Chialingosaurus in the Stegosaurinae {{within the}} Stegosauridae. In 1969, Rodney Steel {{suggested}} that Chialingosaurus might {{have actually been}} an early ancestor of other <b>stegosaurs.</b> However, Galton in 2004 recovered a rather derived position, albeit indeed close to Kentrosaurus. Dong confirmed the placement in the Stegosaurinae.|$|R
50|$|Tizi-n-Aït tracksite is {{a fossil}} {{trackway}} location in Morocco in the Azilal province. It is Jurassic (Pliensbachian, 189.6 - 183.0 Ma) in age, with tracks attributed to sauropods or <b>stegosaurs,</b> and an unidentified carnosaur. The tracksite {{is part of}} the Aganane Formation and the tracks are located at base of formation.|$|R
500|$|Soon {{after its}} description, a {{controversy}} arose over the stegosaur's name, {{which is very}} similar to the ceratopsian Centrosaurus. Under the rules of biological nomenclature, forbidding homonymy, two animals may not be given the same name. Hennig renamed his <b>stegosaur</b> Kentrurosaurus, [...] "pointed-tail saurian", in 1916, while Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa renamed the genus Doryphorosaurus, [...] "lance-bearing saurian", the same year. If a renaming had been necessary, Hennig's would have had priority. However, because both the spellings and the pronunciations are different (Centrosaurus is pronounced with a soft C), both Doryphorosaurus and Kentrurosaurus are unneeded replacement names; Kentrosaurus remains the valid name for the genus with Kentrurosaurus and Doryphorosaurus being its junior objective synonyms.|$|E
500|$|Marsh {{published}} his more accurate skeletal reconstruction of Stegosaurus in 1891, {{and within a}} decade Stegosaurus had become among the most-illustrated types of dinosaur. Artist Charles R. Knight {{published his}} first illustration of Stegosaurus ungulatus based on Marsh's skeletal reconstruction in a November 1897 issue of The Century Magazine. This illustration would later go on to {{form the basis of}} the stop-motion puppet used in the 1933 film King Kong. Like Marsh's reconstruction, Knight's first restoration had a single row of large plates, though he next used a double row for his more well-known 1901 painting, produced under the direction of Frederic Lucas. Again under Lucas, Knight revised his version of Stegosaurus again two years later, producing a model with a staggered double row of plates. Knight would go on to paint a <b>stegosaur</b> with a staggered double plate row in 1927 for the Field Museum of Natural History, and was followed by Rudolph F. Zallinger, who painted Stegosaurus this way in his [...] "Age of Reptiles" [...] mural at the Peabody Museum in 1947.|$|E
500|$|Stegosaurus {{and related}} genera were herbivores. However, their teeth and jaws are very {{different}} from those of other herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs, suggesting a different feeding strategy that is not yet well understood. The other ornithischians possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material and a jaw structure capable of movements in planes other than simply orthal (i.e. not only the fused up-down motion to which <b>stegosaur</b> jaws were likely limited). Unlike the sturdy jaws and grinding teeth common to its fellow ornithischians, Stegosaurus (and all stegosaurians) had small, peg-shaped teeth that have been observed with horizontal wear facets associated with tooth-food contact and their unusual jaws were probably capable of only orthal (up-down) movements. Their teeth were [...] "not tightly pressed together in a block for efficient grinding", and no evidence in the fossil record of stegosaurians indicates use of gastroliths—the stone(s) some dinosaurs (and some present-day bird species) ingested—to aid the grinding process, so how exactly Stegosaurus obtained and processed the amount of plant material required to sustain its size remains [...] "poorly understood".|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "thagomizer" [...] {{was coined}} by Gary Larson in humor, in a 1982 Far Side comic, {{in which a}} group of cavemen in a faux-modern lecture hall are taught by their caveman {{professor}} that the spikes on a <b>stegosaur's</b> tail are so named [...] "after the late Thag Simmons".|$|R
25|$|Genasauria is {{commonly}} divided into Neornithischia and Thyreophora. Neornithischia {{is characterized by}} asymmetrical distributions of enamel covering the crowns of the cheek teeth, an open acetabulum, and a laterally protruding ischial peduncle of the ilium. Neornithischia includes ornithopods, pachycephalosaurs, and ceratopsians. Thyreophora is characterized by body armor and includes <b>stegosaurs,</b> ankylosaurs, Scelidosaurus, and Scutellosaurus.|$|R
50|$|Thyreophorans include various subgroups, {{including}} the suborders Ankylosauria and Stegosauria. In both the suborders, the forelimbs were much {{shorter than the}} hindlimbs, particularly in <b>stegosaurs.</b> The clade {{has been defined as}} the group consisting of all species more closely related to Ankylosaurus than to Triceratops. Thyreophora is the sister group of Cerapoda within Genasauria.|$|R
