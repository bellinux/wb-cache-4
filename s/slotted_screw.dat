5000|$|The tool used {{to drive}} a <b>slotted</b> <b>screw</b> head is called a standard, common blade, flat-blade, slot-head, straight, flat, flat-tip, or [...] "{{flat-head}}" [...] screwdriver. This last usage can be confusing, because the term flat-head also describes a screw with a flat top, designed to install in a countersunk hole. Furthermore, the term implies that a screwdriver has a [...] "head"; it does not. Such a flat-headed screw may have a slotted, cross, square recessed, or combination head. Prior {{to the development of}} the newer bit types the flat-blade was referred to as the [...] "Common-Blade". This was simply because it was the most common one.|$|E
40|$|Vacuolar type rotary H+-ATPases (VoV 1) couple ATP synthesis/hydrolysis by V 1 with proton {{translocation}} by Vo via {{rotation of}} a central rotor apparatus composed of the V 1 -DF rotor shaft, a socket-like Vo-C (eukaryotic Vo-d) and the hydrophobic rotor ring. Reconstitution experiments using subcomplexes revealed a weak binding affinity of V 1 -DF to Vo-C {{despite the fact that}} torque needs to be transmitted between V 1 -DF and Vo-C for the tight energy coupling between V 1 and Vo. Mutation of a short helix at the tip of V 1 -DF caused intramolecular uncoupling of VoV 1, suggesting that proper fitting of the short helix of V 1 -D into the socket of Vo-C is required for tight energy coupling between V 1 and Vo. To account for the apparently contradictory properties of the interaction between V 1 -DF and Vo-C (weak binding affinity but strict requirement for torque transmission), we propose a model in which the relationship between V 1 -DF and Vo-C corresponds to that between a slotted screwdriver and a head of <b>slotted</b> <b>screw.</b> This model is consistent with our previous result in which the central rotor apparatus is not the major factor for the association of V 1 with Vo (Kishikawa and Yokoyama, J Biol Chem. 2012 24597 - 24603) ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{screwdriver}} {{is classified}} by its tip, which is shaped {{to fit the}} driving surfaces—slots, grooves, recesses, etc.—on the corresponding screw head.

Torx™ is one such pattern that has become widespread. It's a spline tip with a corresponding recess in the screw head. The main cause of this trend is manufacturing efficiency: Torx screwdriver tips do not slip out of the fastener as easily as would a Phillips or <b>slotted</b> driver.

40|$|Misfit at the abutment-prosthetic {{cylinder}} interface {{can cause}} loss of preload, leading to loosening or fracture {{of gold and}} titanium screws. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of screw type, alloy, and cylinder position on marginal fit of implant frameworks before and after laser welding. METHODS: After Estheticone-like abutments were screwed to the implants, thirty plastic prosthetic cylinders were mounted and waxed-up to fifteen cylindrical bars. Each specimen had three interconnected prosthetic components. Five specimens were one-piece cast in titanium and five in cobalt-chromium alloy. On each specimen, tests were conducted with hexagonal titanium and <b>slotted</b> gold <b>screws</b> separately, performing a total of thirty tested screws. Measurements at the interfaces were performed using an optical microscope with 5 mm accuracy. After sectioning, specimens were laser welded and new measurements were obtained. Data were submitted to a four-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test (alpha= 0. 05). RESULTS: <b>Slotted</b> and hexagonal <b>screws</b> did not present significant differences regarding to the fit of cylinders cast in titanium, either in one-piece casting framework or after laser welding. When <b>slotted</b> and hexagonal <b>screws</b> were tested on the cobalt-chromium specimens, statistically {{significant differences were found}} for the one-piece casting condition, with the <b>slotted</b> <b>screws</b> presenting better fit (24. 13 µm) than the hexagonal screws (27. 93 µm). Besides, no statistically significant differences were found after laser welding. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The use of different metal alloys do exert influence on the marginal fit, 2) The <b>slotted</b> and hexagonal <b>screws</b> play the exclusive role of fixing the prosthesis, and did not improve the fit of cylinders, and 3) cylinder position did not affect marginal fit values...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} documented screwdrivers {{were used}} in Europe in the late Middle Ages. They were probably invented in the late 15th century, either in Germany or France. The tool's original names in German and French were Schraubendreher (screwturner) and tournevis (turnscrew), respectively. The first documentation of the tool is in the medieval Housebook of Wolfegg Castle, a manuscript written sometime between 1475 and 1490. These earliest screwdrivers had pear-shaped handles and were made for <b>slotted</b> <b>screws</b> (diversification of the many types of screwdrivers did not emerge until the Gilded Age). The screwdriver remained inconspicuous, however, as evidence of its existence throughout the next 300 years is based primarily {{on the presence of}} screws.|$|R

This is why older NES carts are referred to as [...] "5-screw" [...] and are distinguishable by their flat tops and, as the name suggests, five screws instead of three. Around this time, the standard screws were changed to 3.8 mm security screws to further secure the ROMs inside from tampering.|$|R
50|$|Gunsmiths still {{refer to}} a {{screwdriver}} as a turnscrew, under which name {{it is an important}} part of a set of pistols. The name was common in earlier centuries, used by cabinet makers, shipwrights, and perhaps other trades. The cabinet-maker's screwdriver is one of the longest-established handle forms, somewhat oval or ellipsoid in cross section. This is variously attributed to improving grip or preventing the tool rolling off the bench. The shape has been popular for a couple of hundred years. It is usually associated with a plain head for <b>slotted</b> <b>screws,</b> but has been used with many head forms. Modern plastic screwdrivers use a handle with a roughly hexagonal cross section to achieve these same two goals, a far cry from the pear-shaped handle of the original 15th-century screwdriver.|$|R

50|$|By design, Torx head screws resist cam-out {{better than}} Phillips head or <b>slot</b> head <b>screws.</b> Whereas Phillips heads were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the screw head when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, screw head, and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|R

For each sample, the fluids whose IFT was to be measured were introduced into a capillary tube. The tube was first filled with the denser fluid and then closed with teflon cap having a rubber septum. Then, a drop of the less dense fluid (oil) was injected into the tube through the rubber septum using a syringe. The tube-cap assembly was inserted into the tensiometer <b>slot</b> and <b>screwed</b> firmly in place. Appropriate rotation speed was then adjusted, so that the oil droplet can be suitably elongated. Lastly, the IFT between the two fluids were calculated using a built-in software system.|$|R
50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square socket head screws that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for <b>slot</b> head <b>screws</b> and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|R

5000|$|Soon he {{discovered}} {{that he had to}} design machinery to make its parts. One of the first was a tapping machine, also his patent. Around 1896 with his business in machinery progressing, Hubbell's next patent was a major breakthrough in the fastener industry: the process and machinery for cold rolled screw threads which reduced the rate of material lost in production by more than 50%. He designed and built progressive blanking and forming dies, patented machinery to <b>slot</b> <b>screw</b> heads, a machine to assemble screws and small parts, devised tools to indicate speed, and patented a changeable speed screwdriver. Hubbell's idea was to provide convenience, safety, and control to an electric light with his new [...] "pull socket" [...] which was patented in August 1896. The same familiar device with its on/off pull chain is still in use today. He built three prototypes by hand using metal and insulated wood parts to design a product with individual wires permanently attached in the proper sequence and correct polarity, and one which could be connected or disconnected, easily and safely, to a power supply in the wall. cartridge fuses and fuse block, lamp holders, key sockets - soon followed the same path Later, Hubbell's [...] "separable plug" [...] design took shape on the drawing board back in Bridgeport, and then submitted to the patent office in Washington, D.C. Additional designs based on that basic concept - separable plugs in different configurations, a single flush mounted receptacle - as well as new products for electrical circuits. One of the most successful and the one most familiar today, was the duplex receptacle which is still found everywhere that electrical power is used. In 1901 Hubbell published a 12-page catalogue that listed 63 electrical products of his company's manufacture, and four years later he incorporated his enterprise as Harvey Hubbell, Incorporated , In the same year, the Company registered its trademark of [...] "...a sphere with meridian lines and the name 'Hubbell' centered within."

50|$|Many {{textbooks}} and vocational schools instruct mechanics to grind down {{the tip of}} the blade, which, due to the taper, increases its thickness and consequently allows more precise engagement with the <b>slot</b> in the <b>screw.</b> This approach creates a set of graduated slotted screwdrivers that fit a particular screw for a tighter engagement and reduce screw head deformation. However, many better-quality screwdriver blades are already induction-hardened (surface heat-treated), and tip grinding after manufacture compromises their durability. Thus, it is best to select a tip made to fit precisely to begin with, and avoid weakening the factory heat-treatment.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. <b>Slotted</b> head <b>screws</b> require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R

30|$|Several {{mechanical}} {{approaches to}} remove screw remnants can be employed. Generally, after identifying {{the position and}} condition of the screw remnant, it can be carefully removed using manual instrumentation. A fine-tipped hand instrument may be wedged between screw and implant. If this fails to do the trick, {{the use of a}} round burr applying occlusal pressure and turning counter clockwise may loosen the fragment. When a flared burr is wedged between implant and screw remnant, the drill should make a clockwise action, to direct the screw in the counterclockwise direction. Cutting a deep <b>slot</b> in the <b>screw</b> and subsequently removing it with a bladed screw driver has also been advised. The use of rotary instrumentation may cause damage to the cranial inner portion of the implant body. If that occurs, even when the fragment (finally) loosens, it will not screw out, and this complicates matters considerably.|$|R

If fractured screw components cannot be removed, it may render the implant unrestorable or forces the dentist to creative solutions, such as cementable components. Fortunately, fractured screw components will generally be loose because the preload {{has not been}} retained. In that case, they may be removed by manipulating them counter clockwise with a straight probing instrument. On occasion, screw remnants cannot be mobilized, and removal remains a clinical challenge. Careful instrumentation when attempting to remove them should prevent damage to the internal thread of the implant and its surrounding tissues. The use of a fine-tipped hand instrument, a round burr turning counter clockwise, or drilling a <b>slot</b> in the <b>screw</b> {{in order to get}} more grip can be attempted to loosen the fragment.
