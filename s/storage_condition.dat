25|$|The <b>storage</b> <b>condition</b> of the {{bottled wine}} will {{influence}} a wine's aging. Vibrations and heat fluctuations can hasten a wine's deterioration and cause {{adverse effect on}} the wines. In general, a wine has a greater potential to develop complexity and more aromatic bouquet if it is allowed to age slowly in a relatively cool environment. The lower the temperature, the more slowly a wine develops. On average, the rate of chemical reactions in wine double with each 18°F (8°C) increase in temperature. Wine expert Karen MacNeil recommends keeping wine intended for aging in a cool area with a constant temperature around 55°F (13°C). Wine can be stored at temperatures as high as 69°F (20°C) without long term negative effect. Professor Cornelius Ough of the University of California, Davis believes that wine could be exposed to temperatures as high as 120°F (49°C) {{for a few hours}} and not be damaged. However, most experts believe that extreme temperature fluctuations (such as repeated transferring a wine from a warm room to a cool refrigerator) would be detrimental to the wine. The ultra-violet rays of direct sunlight should also be avoided because of the free radicals that can develop in the wine and result in premature oxidation.|$|E

50|$|Generally {{the greater}} the amount of ullage, the more {{potential}} that the wine has been exposed to harmful levels of oxidation. This is why auction houses and retailers of mature wines {{pay close attention to}} the ullage levels in determining the resale value of the wine. The ullage level can also give insight as to the type of care and <b>storage</b> <b>condition</b> that the wine was kept in. Wines that have been kept at ambient humidity levels and in temperatures between 50-59°F (10-15°C) will experience evaporation and diffusion at a slower rate than wine kept in lesser conditions and will thus have a lower ullage levels. Ullage levels are generally important to the likelihood of almost any wine being in good shape. Vintage Port might be slightly less prone to damage since it is fortified, but the only wines that can not be damaged by oxidation are Madeira wines, which are already oxidized.|$|E
5000|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{practical}} way of halting or reversing the course of degradation. Many film collectors use camphor tablets {{but it is not}} known what the long term effects on the film would be. [...] While there has been significant research regarding various methods of slowing degradation, such as storage in molecular sieves, temperature and moisture are the two key factors affecting the rate of deterioration. According to the Image Permanence Institute, fresh acetate film stored at a temperature of 70 °F (21 °C) and 40% relative humidity will last approximately 50 years before the onset of vinegar syndrome. Reducing the temperature by 15° while maintaining the same level of humidity brings a dramatic improvement: at a temperature of 55 °F (13 °C) and 40% relative humidity, the estimated time until onset of vinegar syndrome is 150 years.

Nonetheless, a major QTL on chromosome 4 [Seed longevity 4. 1 (Slg 4. 1) ] was responsible for almost 23 % of the phenotypic variation in viability of the conventionally stored control seeds of the 2006 RIL population, with improved longevity conferred by the Salinas allele.
