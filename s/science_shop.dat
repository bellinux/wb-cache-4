40|$|Science Shop" {{is defined}} as a system which {{provides}} independent, participatory research support in response to concerns experienced by civil society. In the Netherlands, <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> have been operated in almost every university since 1970 s. The same types of <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> have been conducted in some other countries such as United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark since 1980 s. The European Commission is now supporting to disseminate this concept to other European countries, especially to Eastern Europe. In this paper, we will discuss the possibility of the transferring the effectiveness of <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> to the Japanese society. For this purpose, we will review the character, the history and the actual process of <b>science</b> <b>shops.</b> The necessity of "the participatory research" such as <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> are gradually increasing {{in various parts of the}} world. Additionally, some cases in third world countries shall clarify the importance of learning from their experience...|$|R
50|$|Myriad Science Shops have {{developed}} expertise in specific areas. For example, the first <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> {{attached to the}} chemistry department at Utrecht University was particularly skilled in evaluation reports on soil analysis.|$|E
5000|$|The Dutch {{system has}} {{inspired}} Science Shops in nations across Europe such as Denmark, Austria, Germany, Norway, the UK, Belgium, Romania and Portugal [...] Moreover, {{there are currently}} Science Shops in countries outside of Europe such as Canada. The University of Waterloo <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> http://www.scienceshop.ca in Canada is a community service centre for knowledge transfer. Science Shops {{around the world are}} linked through the International <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> network Living Knowledge. The network’s aim is to foster public engagement with, and participation in, all levels of the research and innovation process. The Living Knowledge network is open for all organisations that are interested in community based research and the concept of Science Shops.|$|E
50|$|The European Commission (EC), which initiates and {{implements}} EU {{policies and}} spends EU funds, {{has been an}} important factor behind the international interest and progress of the <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> movement. The EC has financed studies and projects, such as SCIPAS, InterActs, ISSNET and TRAMS which contributed to the development of new Science Shops.|$|E
40|$|The science-shop {{model was}} {{initiated}} in the Netherlands in the 1970 s. During the 1980 s, the model spread throughout Europe, but without much coordination. The crucial {{idea behind the}} <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> involves a working relationship between knowledge-producing institutions like universities and citizen groups that need answers to relevant questions. More recently, the European Commission has funded a number of projects for taking stock {{of the results of}} <b>science</b> <b>shops.</b> Twenty-one in-depth case studies by seven <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> across Europe enable us to draw some conclusions about the variety of experiences in terms of differences among disciplines, nations, and formats of the historical institutionalization. The functions of <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> in the mediation of normative concerns with analytical perspectives can further be specified. ...|$|R
50|$|In practice, {{this means}} civil society {{organizations}} {{will have access}} to scientific research at low or no cost. <b>Science</b> <b>Shops</b> that are based at universities give students opportunities to do community-based research as part of their curriculum. <b>Science</b> <b>Shops</b> are not restricted to the natural sciences. They can cover topics in all scientific disciplines, ranging from natural sciences to social sciences and humanities.|$|R
40|$|<b>Science</b> <b>shops</b> were {{established}} at universities throughout the Netherlands {{in the early}} 1970 s with the avowed aim of democratizing science and contributing to social change. During the past few years, <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> have met with significant challenges. For one thing, {{they have had to}} adapt to various changes directly associated with the Dutch polit-ical climate, the organization of higher education, national research policies, and so on. Moreover, they have faced serious financial cutbacks. In their efforts to address these challenges, <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> have adopted various approaches, some of which {{have turned out to be}} more successful than others. Usually, the differences between the individual Dutch <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> are described and understood only in pragmatic terms, with respect to their internal organization and practices. This article, by contrast, argues that the dif-ferent ways of coping with change should be understood as reflecting divergent, yet unarticulated, answers to the question of how science and technology can or should be democratized...|$|R
50|$|The Public Engagement with Research And Research Engagement with Society (PERARES) {{project was}} a four years project {{funded by the}} European Community’s 7th Framework Programme. The project started in 2010 and aimed to {{strengthen}} public engagement in research (PER) by involving researchers and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) {{in the formulation of}} research agendas and the research process. It used various debates (or dialogues) on Science to actively articulate research request of civil society. These are forwarded to research institutes and results are used in the next phase of the debate. Thus, these debates move ‘upstream’ into agenda settings. For this, partners linked existing debate formats - such as science café’s, science festivals, online-forums - with the <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> network - already linking civil society and research institutes. To be able to answer to research requests, it was necessary to enlarge and strengthen the network of research bodies doing research for/with CSOs. Thus, ten new <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> like facilities throughout Europe are started, mentored by experienced partners. Guidelines to evaluate the impact of engagement activities are developed and tested.|$|E
50|$|Clients {{are often}} {{directed}} to the <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> that is best suited to address their particular concerns. The Dutch system has provided many benefits e.g. to environmentalists, workers, and social workers. Science Shops, in general, have aided environmentalists in better analyzing industrial pollutants, and helped workers to better evaluate the safety and employment consequences of new production processes. Moreover, they have enhanced the understanding of social workers in {{how to deal with}} disaffected teenagers.|$|E
50|$|European University Cyprus {{has placed}} Cyprus in the {{international}} and European map of “Science Shops”, {{with the establishment of}} the first “Science Shop”, one of 30 operating in Europe today.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, several {{innovative}} experiments {{have emerged in}} the sphere of science, such as: conscience clauses and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> and community-based research.

50|$|A <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> is a facility, often {{attached}} to a specific department of a university or an NGO, that provides independent participatory research support in response to concerns experienced by civil society. It's a demand-driven and bottom-up approach to research. Their work {{can be described as}} community-based research (CBR). Science Shops were first established in the Netherlands in the 1970s and their main function is to increase both public awareness and to provide access to science and technology to laymen or non-profit organizations.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the exhibitions and planetarium films, Heureka also offers the opportunity to view daily science theatre shows, to participate in supervised programmes and to watch Rat Basketball games. Furthermore, {{a number of other}} individual events, such as Science Days, science holidays and science camps in the summer are organised at Heureka. Public lectures with different themes are also regularly held in Heureka’s auditorium. Public lectures are given in the planetarium as well. Other services at Heureka include a <b>science</b> <b>shop</b> and a restaurant, as well as conference facilities and a 220-seat auditorium for meetings.|$|E
50|$|Heureka’s {{funding is}} {{provided}} through subsidies from the City of Vantaa and the Ministry of Education and Culture, {{as well as}} through its own operational revenue: admission and rental fees, fundraising and exhibition export. Heureka’s overall funding is approximately nine million euro, of which the revenue from own operations was 48% in 2011. The share of the funding provided by the City of Vantaa and the Ministry of Education and Culture was altogether 52% in 2011. The public support is notably less than for many other cultural institutions. Part of the funding also comes through corporate co-operation. The temporary exhibitions are often sponsored by main partners and other partners. Heureka also has two companies owned entirely by the Foundation, namely the <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> Magneetti Oy, which runs the Heureka Shop at Heureka and at the Kamppi Shopping Centre in central Helsinki, and Heureka Overseas Productions Oy Ltd, which manages the export activities of Heureka.|$|E
40|$|We will {{describe}} various {{ways in which}} we formulate joint research agendas with CSOs. Next to varied face-to-face events, from once-offs to continuous dialogues, we have set up a web-portal for on-line dialogues. We have so far done three on-line dialogues to articulate research questions, in different domains. We started with discussing five different applications of nanotechnologies that have their impacts on environment and health. Then we discussed two different fields of social studies: research on domestic violence issues and research with Roma and other travelling minority groups. All these on-line dialogues have been prepared in longer co-operations with Community Organisations, such as Environmental NGOs, Women’s Associations and Roma and Travellers Communities. We can see clear differences between the natural sciences dialogue and the other two. Also, we are becoming more aware of the required follow-up [...] and the practical web requirements. To answer the research requests, we turn to <b>Science</b> <b>Shops</b> and Research Funders. <b>Science</b> <b>Shops</b> are university-units or NGOs, doing or mediating research for Community Groups -already since the 1970 s-, in all research fields, so science, humanities, arts, social sciences, engineering, etc. By making use of students in their curriculum, the service is affordable or even free. Please see workshop by Linda Hawkins if you want to learn more. We will thus also share some experiences on the {{ways in which we}} have set up ten new <b>Science</b> <b>Shops</b> as part of the project, and we will highlight our studies on the role of research funders in supporting Community-Engaged Research. For this, we interviewed policy makers and funders in UK, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands and more countries. Finally, we {{will describe}} the way that the International Living Knowledge Network has enabled us to create this project, and we are interested to discuss follow-up and spin-off opportunities with the participants...|$|R

While these sixteen top-level categories have remained intact, the ontology of second- and lower-level categories has undergone a gradual evolution; significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached.|$|R

40|$|Science Shops are {{units that}} perform or broker {{research}} with and for Civil Society Organisations, in a demand driven way. They are often, but now always, based at universities. This {{allows them to}} use students to do the research under faculty supervision. Thus, the {{research is part of}} the core-business of the university (research driven learning and teaching), and the public engagement is added-in to these activities, and not added-on. This makes Science Shops an affordable tool for science-society engagement and co-creation of new knowledge. Stand-alone Science Shops use per project funding to achieve the same objectives. In the period 2010 - 2014, the PERARES-project intensively supported new <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> initiatives in ten different regions, through mentoring. PERARES also supported various other initiatives through annual Summer Schools, incidental lectures, and on-line resources. To start a new <b>Science</b> <b>Shop,</b> the following approach was taken: 1. A staff member is appointed to do a feasibility study and make a business plan,dealing with following elements and strengths/weaknesses of various options: a. The potential demand (topics, numbers) for research from CSOs. b. The potential resource of student-researchers (disciplines, levels, numbers) c. Options for organisational placement of the <b>Science</b> <b>Shop,</b> staffing, work- flows and responsibilities d. Potential sources for continued funding 2. An advisory board (including both research and CSO representatives) is set up 3. A temporary structure is set up to solicit and respond to research questions 4. Pilot projects are done Based on all the above experiences, which were scheduled {{for the first half of}} the project, in the second half, a final structure was proposed, publicity made and funding for that was sought, while (pilot) projects continued. The approach led to the following results: The European University Cyprus now has its <b>Science</b> <b>Shop,</b> integrated in university. The Institute of Baltic Studies, a (non-university) NGO research organisation has done projects co-operation with various universities through its <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> called ‘Teadusturg’ and now starts co-operation with Tartu university for continuity. In France, the association ADReCA has its Echop’a Sciences established, though working with university structures in Grenoble is still tough. Also in France, Université de Lyon has established its Boutique des Sciences, with a 3 -year funding secured from a national program. The Technical University of Crete (Greece) has established its own <b>Science</b> <b>Shop,</b> Epilyon. In Ireland, the Dublin Institute of Technology has extended its project “Students Learning with Communities” to include <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> projects. In Israel, the Heschel Centre, an NGO, catalysed networking among universities and other stakeholders. In Italy, the University of Sardegna has established its <b>Science</b> <b>Shop</b> as an association called “IntHum”. In Norway, the University of Stavanger has established its <b>Science</b> <b>Shop,</b> the Forskningstorget, which works with two of its schools now The University of Cambridge (UK) has further established its <b>Science</b> <b>Shop,</b> the Community Knowledge Exchange. The 5 Summer Schools that were organized attracted about 130 participants from approximately 25 countries. Mentors in Hungary and Romania supported new Science Shops actively, and quite a number of other presentations and workshops, and publications were made. We conclude that: By doing research projects with and for civil society in the curriculum - through Science Shops and similar intermediaries - many universities throughout Europe can advance public engagement in an affordable and mutually beneficial way. Supporting these universities with seed funding and mentoring/training by European experts is an efficient tool to set-up new Science Shops. Setting-up Science Shops without the active co-operation of universities is quite complicated. The Summer Schools are a good way to reach out to more interested actors...|$|E
40|$|Community {{interaction}} with universities forms {{part of the}} field of engaged scholarship, civic engagement or socially responsive interaction between universities and communities. This type of interaction yields a different form of knowledge production, as universities and communities engage at different levels and different projects develop out of this engagement. One such form of interaction is the <b>science</b> <b>shop.</b> The following literature review examines the theories of engaged scholarship and role of engagement between universities and communities, from an international and South African point of view. This will introduce the UCT Knowledge Partnership Pilot Project – UCT's first <b>science</b> <b>shop</b> – laying the foundations for a further evaluation of this project over the next two and a half years. Using a broad array of available literature, the following review will introduce a scholarly overview of the scholarship of engagement, community engagement and social responsiveness. In doing so, it will further lay the foundations for the investigation of the practical brokering model – a practical illustration and manifestation of the theories of engagement. One of the more popular forms of engagement in a university forum is the <b>science</b> <b>shop.</b> The core idea in writing this review is to explore the idea and principles of the <b>science</b> <b>shop,</b> in order to evaluate the creation of the UCT Knowledge Partnership Pilot Project. The review will identify the development of the <b>science</b> <b>shop</b> in Europe, North America and Australia, looking at how the shops operate, and how they have been successful or unsuccessful in past years. Having obtained this analysis, the Knowledge Partnership Pilot Project itself will be explained in broader terms, with added analysis and evaluation of science shops...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper explores {{some of the}} {{difficulties}} in accounting {{for the value of}} knowledge intermediation, focusing on two types of knowledge inter-mediators: <b>science</b> <b>shops</b> and knowledge brokers. We analyse the way in which actors themselves 'situate', and thus value, their work and practices. Drawing upon theorisations by Antoine Hennion and Bruno Latour, who have distinguished between intermediaries and mediation, we show that actors mobilise two non-mutually exclusive, coexisting repertoires: a 'two-world' repertoire and a repertoire of 'exploration'. In the two-world repertoire, knowledge inter-mediators are seen as actors placed between two (pre-existing) worlds: as a result, their task becomes connecting these two worlds. The repertoire of exploration refers to the fact that inter-mediators evolve in uncertain worlds, their role consisting of exploring and performing new worlds including their own place and role within these. We argue that the tensions between these two repertoires are a potential resource for theory and practice...|$|R
