2500|$|The Diyarbakir space {{surveillance}} site {{operated a}} detection radar (FPS-17) and a tracking radar (FPS-79) throughout the 1960s and 1970s. If a new space object was sensed by the detection radar's fans, then the tracking radar could be oriented to achieve lock-on and tracking. The orientation was governed by {{knowledge of the}} appropriate [...] "normal" [...] object's astrodynamic laws of motion, or by an assumption as to launch point. Thus, if an unknown was detected, and if it followed an unusual path, {{it was unlikely that}} it could, or would, be tracked. Furthermore, the director of the radar could make a decision that the unknown object detected is not of interest (because of the location of the FPS-17 fan penetration or {{because of the lack of}} prior information on a possible new launch). In the absence of detection fan penetration (the fan had a rather limited coverage), the FPS-79 tracking radar was tasked to follow other space objects on a schedule provided by the <b>Space</b> <b>Defense</b> Center, and again there was almost no likelihood that an anomalistic object could, or would, be tracked.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1992, during Galileo second gravity-assist {{planetary}} flyby of Earth, another groundbreaking {{experiment was}} performed. Optical communications in space {{was assessed by}} detecting light pulses from powerful lasers with Galileo CCD. The experiment, dubbed Galileo Optical Experiment or GOPEX, used two separate sites to beam laser pulses to the spacecraft, one at Table Mountain Observatory in California and the other at the Starfire Optical Range in New Mexico. The Table Mountain site used a frequency doubled Neodymium-Yttrium-Aluminium garnet (...) laser operating at 532nm with a repetition rate of ~15 to 30Hz and a pulse power (FWHM) {{in the tens of}} megawatts range, which was coupled to a [...] Cassegrain telescope for transmission to Galileo. The Starfire range site used a similar setup with a larger, , transmitting telescope. Long exposure (~0.1 to 0.8s) images using Galileo 560nm centered green filter produced images of Earth clearly showing the laser pulses even at distances of up to [...] Adverse weather conditions, restrictions placed on laser transmissions by the U.S. <b>Space</b> <b>Defense</b> Operations Center (SPADOC) and a pointing error caused by the scan platform acceleration on the spacecraft being slower than expected (which prevented laser detection on all frames with less than 400ms exposure times) all contributed to the reduction of the number of successful detections of the laser transmission to 48 of the total 159 frames taken. Nonetheless, the experiment was considered a resounding success and the data acquired will likely be used in the future to design laser [...] "downlinks" [...] which will send large volumes of data very quickly from spacecraft to Earth. The scheme is already being studied (as of 2004) for a data link to a future Mars orbiting spacecraft.|$|E
