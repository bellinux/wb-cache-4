6000|$|Evelyn did {{not know}} much about the Canadian North, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> his holding on. [...] "I expect you will find Langrigg {{different}} from the British Columbian wilds," [...] she said. [...] "Do you feel strange here?" ...|$|E
60|$|Beatrice felt guilty. Her {{father had}} not {{forbidden}} her {{speaking to the}} man; he trusted her to remember what was due to her station. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> his anger were he to suspect that she had allowed Harding {{to make love to}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wally, it's--" [...] She {{paused for}} a word. [...] "Kind" [...] was horrible. It would have sounded cold, almost supercilious. [...] "Sweet" [...] {{was the sort of}} thing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> Lois Denham saying to her friend Izzy. She began her {{sentence}} again. [...] "You're a dear to say that, but...." ...|$|E
60|$|Millicent {{saw he was}} troubled, though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> the reason.|$|R
60|$|Evelyn was frankly amused. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> his cooking very well, but {{she liked}} his humorous candor.|$|R
60|$|She {{stood looking}} at him blankly. He was holding a drawer in one hand. Why, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{turned as}} she left the piano and gave Carrie a quick glance. A sharp jealousy seized her, for while <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> what a strong man felt, Carrie really knew. She had fronted danger with Jim; she had watched and helped his {{struggle}} in the lonely North. Evelyn was suddenly afraid of Carrie. She was a powerful rival.|$|E
60|$|He {{shut his}} eyes as if to forget the horrors of which he spoke. They were fresh and real to him. Frida {{did not like to}} {{question}} him further. She knew to what he referred, and in a dim, vague way (for she was less wise than he, she knew) she thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> why he found it all so terrible.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood looking}} down on her with an {{impressive}} steadiness of gaze. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> him facing the city men, from whom he had extorted the full value of his mine, in the same fashion, and in a later instance, so surveying the eddies beneath the osiers when {{he had gone to}} Mabel's rescue. She felt that they had better understand one another.|$|E
60|$|Martha Phibbs {{followed}} reluctantly. Miss Jane might {{already be}} awake and demanding her services, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> what {{the young lady}} wanted her for.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl looked}} at Prescott; troubled and {{surprised}} by the confused emotions his face betrayed. There was obviously something wrong, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> what it was.|$|R
60|$|If Mr. Elton, on his return, {{made his}} own {{indifference}} as evident and indubitable as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not doubt he would anxiously do, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him.|$|R
60|$|Resolutely now {{she went}} back to her work; {{for the past two years}} she had found that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> herself to be quite {{moderately}} happy, if only she had plenty to do; and she did hope that BÃ©la would allow her to work in her new home and not to lead a life of idleness--waited on by paid servants.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Stonehouse, {{with the}} wisdom and power of age, waited, {{suspending}} judgment. But Pearl was in a fever of anxiety; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> nothing which could keep her away from The Man. But she {{saw that there was}} some difficulty, some cause of delay. So she too added her pleading. Putting her mouth close to Lady de Lannoy's ear she whispered very faintly, very caressingly: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{leaned against}} the smooth wall of yew, {{looking down at her}} with an {{impressive}} steadiness of gaze. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> him facing the city men from whom he had extorted the full value of his mine in the same fashion, and, in a later instance, so surveying the eddies beneath the osiers, when he had gone to Mabel's rescue. It was borne in upon her that they would better understand each other.|$|E
60|$|How Wickham and Lydia {{were to be}} {{supported}} in tolerable independence, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine.</b> But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> easily conjecture.|$|R
60|$|Poor Molinda merely stared; for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> what he meant. In {{a moment}} he was gone; and having taken, by the king's permission, the flying carpet, he {{was back at the}} ambassador's house in Gluckstein.|$|R
60|$|But {{to account}} for the strange {{likeness}} between Lord Greystoke and this forest god--that was quite beyond her, and it is not strange that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> that this naked savage was indeed an English nobleman.|$|R
60|$|Geraldine quietly studied him. He {{was troubled}} {{and could not}} hide it, and he {{interested}} her. The man was honest and forceful in an untrained way. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> his grappling with unaccustomed difficulties, clumsily, perhaps, but resolutely. Though several years his junior, {{she knew that she}} had the keener intelligence; but this did not make her attitude contemptuous. He had shown signs of qualities which sometimes carried one farther than superficial smartness.|$|E
60|$|Geraldine {{thought that}} {{his friends were}} mistaken in this conclusion, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> his {{yielding}} to the representations of cleverer people, without questioning the accuracy of their views about him. He had, however, obviously broken loose from his tutelage, and now stood firm, ignorant perhaps of much that men who worked for their living knew, confronting with undisciplined courage troubles new to him. She {{had no doubt that}} he had courage and strong sincerity.|$|E
60|$|He had done, and was unanswered. It {{would have}} {{surprised}} Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech: words of such interest, spoken with such serious warmth! <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> what Louisa was feeling. For herself, she feared to move, lest {{she should be}} seen. While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her, and they were moving on. Before they were beyond her hearing, however, Louisa spoke again.|$|E
60|$|The gentle Beulah smiled, but she {{no longer}} felt uneasiness. She {{understood}} the impulses and sentiments of her own pure but tranquil nature too well, to distrust herself; and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>imagine</b> that Maud {{would not be as}} composed under similar circumstances.|$|R
60|$|Arthur still lingered, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> {{what had}} become of him. All sorts of horrible fancies passed through her mind, and she dreaded she knew not what. At last they heard a {{footstep}} inside the house, and the door was opened.|$|R
50|$|Merkel {{also said}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> {{negotiations}} continuing without concessions made by Ankara toward opening up its ports to Cypriot ships. The Turkish Government responded by demanding that the EU lift its embargo on the Turkish-controlled {{part of the island}} in return.|$|R
60|$|She {{stopped in}} the street and looked at him. This was a state of things of which she had never dreamed. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> that a man should wish to put it off, but that he should have the face to declare to his young woman that he never meant to marry at all, was a thing that she could not understand. What {{business}} had such a man to go after any young woman? 'And what do you mean that I'm to do, Sir Felix?' she said.|$|E
60|$|When her car {{had crossed}} the Missouri River on the swing-ferry between Bismarck and Mandan, Claire had passed from Middle West to Far West. She came out on an upland of virgin prairie, so {{treeless}} and houseless, so divinely dipping, so rough of grass, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> buffaloes still roving. In a hollow a real prairie schooner was camped, and the wandering homestead-seekers were cooking dinner beside it. From a quilt on the hay in the wagon a baby peeped, and Claire's heart leaped.|$|E
60|$|Louisa {{left alone}} in the sitting room, {{in front of the}} cheery fire, sat down for a moment on the sofa and rested her head against the cushions. There was memory even in that, for when she closed her eyes, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> that Luke was sitting {{at the foot of the}} sofa; she could see him almost, with his eyes turned ever toward her, and that quaint gesture of his when he passed his hand over the back of his neatly groomed head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Anne stupidly. For {{the first}} time in her life she was stupid. Yet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> why. <b>She</b> seemed to have {{absolutely}} nothing to say to this sweet, smiling, angelic old lady who was patting her hand so kindly.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Bertram was {{perfectly}} quiescent and contented, {{and had no}} objections to make. Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little trouble; and she assured him [...] "that she {{was not at all}} afraid of the trouble; indeed, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> there would be any." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{in spite}} of sorrow, {{in spite of}} anguish so terrible that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> Death itself {{to have a more}} cruel sting, she wished above all to {{safeguard}} that final, attenuated thread of hope which was wound round the packet that lay hidden on her breast.|$|R
6000|$|Elizabeth-Jane {{was fond}} of music; she could not help pausing to listen; and the longer she listened the more she was enraptured. She had never heard any singing like this and {{it was evident that}} the {{majority}} of the audience had not heard such frequently, for they were attentive to a much greater degree than usual. They neither whispered, nor drank, nor dipped their pipe-stems in their ale to moisten them, nor pushed the mug to their neighbours. The singer himself grew emotional, till <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> a tear in his eye as the words went on:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{had thought}} seriously of {{surprising}} and delighting everyone by appearing in a costume which should {{do justice to}} the loveliness which was so modest that it was apt to forget itself in admiring others what girls call a [...] "ravishing" [...] dress, such as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> and easily procure by the magic of the Fortunatus' purse in her pocket. She had planned it all, the shimmer of pale silk through lace like woven frostwork, ornaments of some classic pattern, and all the dainty accessories as perfect as time, taste, and money could make them.|$|E
60|$|She {{simply could}} not {{understand}} it. Yet there it was: they were watched, followed. Of {{that there was no}} question. And all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> was that the troupe was secretly accused of White Slave Traffic by somebody in Woodhouse. Probably Mr. May had gone the round of the benevolent magnates of Woodhouse, concerning himself with her virtue, and currying favour with his concern. Of this she became convinced, that it was concern for her virtue which had started the whole business: and that the first instigator was Mr. May, who had got round some vulgar magistrate or County Councillor.|$|E
60|$|It was {{an ideal}} spot, one whose beauties appealed to her {{even under the}} {{harrowing}} conditions which had forced her to seek its precarious safety. In another land and with companions of her own kind <b>she</b> <b>could</b> well <b>imagine</b> the joy of a fortnight spent in such a sylvan paradise.|$|R
50|$|Her other film {{credits include}} Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959), The Misfits (1961), The Magic Sword (1962), The Notorious Landlady (1962), Dead Ringer (1964), Camelot (1967) and The Producers (1968). She later denigrated the last film, saying <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> why <b>she</b> {{had done it}} except for the money.|$|R
60|$|His {{hand was}} upon the latch before she {{realized}} that he was actually going. She sprang to her feet. Abuse, scorn, upbraidings, even violence--she had been prepared for all of these. There was something about this self-restraint, however, this strange, brooding silence, which terrified her more than anything <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>imagined.</b>|$|R
