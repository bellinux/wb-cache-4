500|$|Upon {{losing the}} final game of the match, Taimanov shrugged his shoulders, saying sadly to Fischer: [...] "Well, I <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> music." [...] As a result of his performance, Taimanov [...] "was thrown out of the USSR team and {{forbidden}} to travel for two years. He was banned from writing articles, was deprived of his monthly stipend... the authorities prohibited him from performing on the concert platform." [...] "The crushing loss virtually ended Taimanov's chess career." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{admits that}} there is a {{distinct}} challenge for them, coming out of their past bands (Eraserheads and The Teeth). The challenge is particularly pronounced on frontman, Ely Buendia, since older fans tend to compare him and his new band with the huge popularity of The Eraserheads before. In an interview by Y. Losorata he says, [...] "I just want my fans and hopefully, my fans to be, to appreciate my music. I’m lucky to <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> career in music as a job and as part of Pupil wala akong (I don't have) delusions to become as big as my previous band was." [...] In fact, the band itself describes their music as actually [...] "one foot in the past, one foot in the present and both eyes dead set at the future." [...] According to Buendia, it's not being there but getting there that's exciting for him, {{no matter how many times}} he tries to get there. He later added in a different interview, [...] "Let’s just say that the Eraserheads is about escaping reality and Pupil is about accepting reality." ...|$|E

It may be well for {{you to know that}} Miss Trevor <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>my</b> respect as a woman and my admiration as a lady. And, since she has been so misjudged by her father, she <b>has</b> <b>my</b> deepest sympathy. But I wish to beg of you, if you have anything of this nature to say to her, you will take her feelings into consideration as well as ours." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s and 90s the DSB {{began to}} have less and less need for them, and the last {{ordinary}} MY-hauled train ran in 2001. One unit however, 1135, is now a special service locomotive which runs special trains, so DSB <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>MY</b> locos in service. The others have either been scrapped or sold to diverse private operators in Norway, Germany and Sweden, who now use them on light freight duties. They are called TMY in Sweden (as diesel locomotives have names beginning with T in Sweden).|$|R
2500|$|On July 3, 2009 it was {{announced}} that Storm would be coming out of retirement to perform at two Ring of Honor shows on July 24 and 25, Death Before Dishonor VII: Nights 1 and 2 respectively. On July 24, Storm and fellow Canadian Kevin Steen defeated Chris Hero and Davey Richards and on July 25, Storm was defeated by Hero in a one-on-one grudge match. Following the match, Storm cut an emotional promo, and later announced his belief that this would be his last match, saying [...] "I shared this match with people who share my love and respect for this business, and I am now home being Lance Evers with the family I will share {{the rest of my life}} with. I <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> school, and I will always be a part of this business, but I truly believe I am now done as a performer. They say, never say never in this business, and because of that I won’t, but I think I left it all in the ring that night and I believe I wrote the final page in the 19-year long book that was the career of Lance Storm." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There isn't any equity," [...] {{he shook}} his head. [...] "Oh, I know it seems a preposterous change of view. But at this late day I have made the {{discovery}} of the ancient truth that women are different from men. All I have learned of book and theory goes glimmering before the everlasting fact that the women are the mothers of our children. I... I <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> hopes of children with you, you see. But that's all over and done with. The question now is, what's in your heart? I have told you mine. And afterward we can determine what is to be done." ...|$|R

5000|$|Gislason is a {{recovering}} alcoholic. He said this in an 2014 interview: [...] "When I came put of rehab {{two and a}} half years ago I didn't feel good. I felt as I had lost at life. I was an alcoholic with three tries at rehab in that same year. I felt hopeless. I felt alone and abandoned. The future did not look good. But then I came out into the real world and discovered that this was all wrong. I <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> education, my talents, and most important I had a great family, friends and coworkers that stood by me. They helped me a great deal in my recovery. I never had to suffer alone. There was always someone there and that was and is incredibly valuable to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hardly angry,--but vexed. As {{you ask me}} so frankly and prettily, I {{will forgive}} you. There is my hand upon it. All evil {{thoughts}} against you shall go out of my head. I shall <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> wishes, but I will not be cross with you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, though Jimmy had not spoken, [...] "old man Leeson is right; we {{will have}} to fight for it. <b>Still,</b> I <b>have</b> put <b>my</b> pile in, and we have got to win." ...|$|R

60|$|If I {{had been}} the most scrupulous man in the world, I must <b>still</b> <b>have</b> {{received}} <b>my</b> wages, for the very necessary purpose of not appearing to distinguish myself invidiously from my fellow-workmen. Upon the whole, I got on well with them. Old File and I struck up quite a friendship. Young File and Mill worked harmoniously with me, but Screw and I (as I had foreboded) quarreled.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reply yes, at once, Major Lindsay. A load {{has been}} lifted from my mind. I shall <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> liberty, my capital, and my people; and am grateful, indeed, for the clemency {{that has been}} shown me.

Though I scold, {{and have a}} frightful temper, my {{servants}} {{will do anything to}} make me comfortable, and get up at any hour of the night, and never say a cross word in answer.

[...] And here she would begin to doze: waking up, however, if my wife stirred or rose, and imagining that Theo was about to leave her. [...] "Don't go away, I can't bear to be alone.

6000|$|I once proved {{this fact}} {{to my own}} {{satisfaction}} in some papers which I wrote several years ago; but it appears, from a question which has lately come to me from England, that I did not carry conviction quite so far as that island; and I <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> work all before me, if I understand the London friend who wishes [...] "a comparative view of the centres of literary production" [...] among us; [...] "how and why they change; how they stand at present; {{and what is the}} relation, for instance, of Boston to other such centres." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jemison {{resigned}} from NASA in March 1993. [...] "I left NASA because I'm {{very interested in}} how social sciences interact with technologies," [...] Jemison said. [...] "People always think of technology as something having silicon in it. But a pencil is technology. Any language is technology. Technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate technology in developing countries, appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity." [...] NASA training manager and author Homer Hickam later expressed some regret that she had departed, saying, [...] "NASA had {{spent a lot of}} money training her; she also filled a niche, obviously, being a woman of color." [...] Hickam had trained Jemison for her flight on Spacelab-J/STS-47. In an interview with the Des Moines Register on October 16, 2008, Jemison said that she was not driven to be the [...] "first black woman to go into space." [...] "I wouldn't have cared less if 2,000 people had gone up before me... I would <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> hand up, 'I want to do this.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Then, Sir, I brought {{upon the}} perilous {{situation}} that {{presence of mind}} for which the name of Hector Ratichon will for ever remain famous. Without a single flurried movement, I slipped one of the velvet-covered cases which I <b>still</b> <b>had</b> in <b>my</b> hand into the breast pocket of my coat, I closed down {{the lid of the}} iron chest and locked it with the duplicate key, and I went out of the room, closing the door behind me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my lord," [...] {{answered}} Ravenswood; [...] "it {{is in the}} House of British Peers, whose honour must {{be equal}} to their rank--it is {{in the court of}} last resort that we must parley together. The belted lords of Britain, her ancient peers, must decide, if it is their will that a house, not the least noble of their members, shall be stripped of their possessions, the reward of the patriotism of generations, as the pawn of a wretched mechanic becomes forfeit to the usurer the instant the hour of redemption has passed away. If they yield to the grasping severity of the creditor, and to the gnawing usury that eats into our lands as moths into a raiment, it will be of more evil consequence to them and their posterity than to Edgar Ravenswood. I shall <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> sword and my cloak, and can follow the profession of arms wherever a trumpet shall sound." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{afternoon}} both flint and tinder--whichever {{of us was}} which--were kept very busy. Mrs Monnerie {{fell into}} one of her long monologues, broken only by Chakka's griding on his bars, and Cherry's whimpering in his dreams. It was another kind of [...] "white meat" [...] for me: and though, no doubt, I was incapable of digesting all Mrs Monnerie's views on life, society, and the world at large, I realized that if {{in the course of}} time it might be my fate to wither and wizen away, I should <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> own company and plenty of internal entertainment. I actually saw myself a little bent-up, old, midget woman creeping down some stone steps out of a porch, with a fanlight, under a street lamp. It curdled my blood, that picture. And yet, I thought, what must be, must be. I will endure to be a little, bent-up, old, midget woman, creeping down stone steps out of a porch with a fanlight. And I even nodded up at the street lamp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I?" [...] I said briefly; and I {{looked at}} his features, {{beautiful}} in their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied myself in idea his wife. Oh! it would never do! As his curate, his comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour; accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man: profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other. I should suffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free. I should <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness. There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital--this would be unendurable.|$|E
60|$|Such {{were the}} trinkets, if {{so they may}} be called. They are of little value {{intrinsically}} except for their weight in gold, because, as I have said, the emeralds are flawed as though they have been through a fire or some other unknown cause. Moreover, there is about them nothing of the grace and charm of ancient Egyptian jewellery; evidently they belonged to a ruder age and civilization. Yet they <b>had,</b> and <b>still</b> <b>have,</b> to <b>my</b> imagining, a certain dignity of their own.|$|R
