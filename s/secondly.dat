5|$|With Isabelle Ingaldsthorpe, John Neville {{had a son}} {{and five}} daughters. The eldest was George Neville, Duke of Bedford (c. 1461–1483). It appears that Montagu had wanted to marry George to Anne, heiress of the Duke of Exeter; however, she had married the Earl of Dorset by 1466. George {{eventually}} died without issue, having been stripped of his Dukedom in 1478. His first daughter was Anne, who married Sir William Stonor of Stonor in Pyrton, Oxfordshire (and was thus a descendant of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk).

5|$|Firstly, he {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} about how serious {{the situation is}} already and how much worse it will get. <b>Secondly,</b> he examines the roots of denial, {{both in terms of}} resistance to the evidence and in relation to the actors and agencies motivated to deny climate change. Lastly, he looks at some future scenarios and explains what people should do.|$|E
5|$|I believe few plays {{have ever}} adventured {{into the world}} under greater {{disadvantage}} than this. First, as it succeeded a comedy which, for the continued space of twenty-eight nights, received as great (and as just) applauses, as ever were bestowed on the English Theatre. And <b>secondly,</b> as it is co-temporary with an entertainment which engrosses the whole talk and admiration of the town.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Madness {{played the}} {{majority}} of their new album The Liberty of Norton Folgate at London's Hackney Empire for three nights.

5|$|In Singapore, {{ensuring}} {{widespread and}} {{equal access to}} justice for Singapore citizens is a constant goal.

5|$|Morrison {{received}} two civil awards in 1996, firstly the Order of the British Empire for his service to music, <b>secondly</b> an {{award from the}} French government which made him an Officier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Along with these state awards he has two honorary degrees in music; an honorary doctorate in literature from the University of Ulster, and an honorary doctorate in music from Queen's University {{in his hometown of}} Belfast.|$|E
5|$|Moulting {{serves a}} number of {{functions}} – firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, <b>secondly,</b> it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. Renewal of the skin by moulting is supposed to allow growth in some animals such as insects, however this view has been disputed {{in the case of}} snakes.|$|E

5|$|On August10, 2014, NJPW {{made two}} announcements. Firstly, Wrestle Kingdom 9 {{would be held}} at the Tokyo Dome on January4, 2015. <b>Secondly,</b> NJPW {{revealed}} a partnership with Jeff Jarrett's Global Force Wrestling, which it approached about bringing the event to a new market. On November4, GFW announced that it would present the event live on American pay-per-view television and that it had a PPV market of 125million homes.|$|E
5|$|Poedjangga Baroe paid {{subscribers}} {{were always}} fewer than 150. According to historian Heather Sutherland, this low circulation {{was rooted in}} several cultural factors. Firstly, the native populace at the time had limited literacy and education. <b>Secondly,</b> native intellectuals mainly spoke Dutch during formal discourse, while others kept to local languages; this led to comprehension issues for the Indonesian-language Poedjangga Baroe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Secondly,</b> quotas {{were raised}} {{to limit the}} ability of workers to overfulfill targets. In the case of time workers, this was {{sometimes}} done by keeping quotas the same but reducing hours; for example, coal miners saw their working day shortened to six hours. Some rises were very steep; {{in the case of}} engineering enterprises, quotas were raised by 65 percent.|$|E
5|$|The fort was renovated {{twice in}} modern times, once by Tranquebar Association {{with the help}} of the Danish royal family and the State Archaeology Department in 2001 and <b>secondly</b> by a project named Destination Development of Tranquebar by the Department of Tourism of the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2011. The fort is one of the {{prominent}} tourist destinations in the region.|$|E
5|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} {{is dependent on}} the activation energy needed to form the transition state which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). <b>Secondly</b> the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.|$|E
5|$|The {{report states}} {{that there were}} two {{critical}} errors made during the planning stages. Firstly, the parking lot for the mall was located {{on the roof of the}} building without there being sound waterproofing, and <b>secondly</b> the structural inefficiency of the hollow concrete slabs which prevented the installation of effective waterproofing later on.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} enzyme {{kinetics}} {{is important for}} two basic reasons. Firstly, it helps explain how enzymes work, and <b>secondly,</b> it helps predict how enzymes behave in living organisms. The kinetic constants defined above, KM and Vmax, are critical to attempts to understand how enzymes work together to control metabolism.|$|E
5|$|This scheme {{can be seen}} as a {{mechanism}} for representation. First, MPs are chosen by the electorate to represent their concerns and needs in Parliament. <b>Secondly,</b> the Prime Minister, who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs, and the Cabinet which is made up of popularly elected MPs, effectively represent the views of the electorate as he heads the Government. The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of political representation.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual {{events have}} been recorded. Firstly, in 1940 No.6221 Queen Elizabeth had its Caledonian blue colour scheme {{replaced}} by the crimson lake, the only such instance. <b>Secondly,</b> it was often speculated that {{at some time in}} the two-year history of the Coronation Scot a crimson streamliner might have hauled the blue trainset. Such an event has, probably uniquely, been captured on film.|$|E
5|$|What {{were the}} {{possibilities}} which thus presented themselves? Firstly, in that {{of making a}} film not noticeably similar to any previously made in the English language. <b>Secondly,</b> that of using this English language... in a more varied and, to me, more interesting way than I had previously had the chance of doing in a film. Thirdly, that of making a picture which paid no regard whatever to established, although not practised, moral convention.|$|E
25|$|<b>Secondly.</b> –– Without her consent.|$|E
25|$|Augusta (1862-1925), {{who married}} first William Wyckham Tyrwhitt-Drake and <b>secondly</b> Frederick Peter Game.|$|E
