In addition, the manuals contain guidance on how the Department defines other standards, such as "state-of-the-art " control technologies or "best management practices. " Unless otherwise required by federal or state law, the policies and procedures contained in a <b>technical</b> <b>manual</b> on the date an application is filed will be binding on both the DEP and the applicant.

It enables equipment manufacturers and shipyards to structure, write and deliver <b>technical</b> <b>manuals,</b> and to load ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and CMM (Computerized Maintenance Management) systems with <b>technical</b> <b>manual</b> contents into a standardized electronic format, making them much easier to produce and manage, compared to traditional methods of writing <b>technical</b> <b>manuals</b> using a word processor.|$|R

50|$|As {{fans of the}} {{original}} series of Star Trek and fans of the space program, Sternbach and Michael Okuda found roles as Technical Advisors on the series, advising the writers on technical matters and developing a number of concepts to add realism to the Star Trek universe, such as the Structural Integrity Field and the Inertial Damper. To this end, they produced a <b>technical</b> <b>manual</b> for each series, that was made available along with the series bible to any prospective script-writers to familiarize them with the concepts behind the series' technology. In 1991, Pocket Books published an updated, illustrated version of the Next Generation <b>Technical</b> <b>Manual</b> and then seven years later, the Deep Space Nine <b>Technical</b> <b>Manual.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some ideas {{developed}} for the <b>technical</b> <b>manual,</b> or its predecessor, the internal Writers <b>Technical</b> <b>Manual,</b> were later incorporated into the storylines of the TV series and movies. Most notably, a concept drawing from the manual describing an emergency landing of the saucer section was seen by TNG writers Ronald D. Moore, Jeri Taylor, and Brannon Braga who wanted to use a saucer crash as a sixth-season cliffhanger episode for the TV series. This idea was shelved due to budget limitations and resistance from producer Michael Piller. However, Moore and Braga later included the scenario in Star Trek Generations. Also first seen in the <b>technical</b> <b>manual</b> were the Nova-class starship and the USS Galaxy.|$|R
