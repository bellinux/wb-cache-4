40|$|An {{immersive}} whiteboard {{system is}} presented in a networked collaborative environment where users at multiple locations can communicate with each other. The immersive system consists of five major components: the network, the virtual environment, the avatar representation, the multimedia objects, and the <b>shared</b> <b>whiteboards.</b> The virtual environment is shared among multiple networked users and allows each user to interact independently with the world. The avatar is used to represent each user in the immersive environment and conveys its user identity and facial expressions to the world. The <b>shared</b> <b>whiteboards</b> provide a medium for communication using handwritten inputs, {{as well as a}} desirable interface for navigation and mouse control.

50|$|The {{second type}} of shared {{applications}} are multi-user 2D Java applications. Wonderland provides a framework for creating these applications to help developers build true collaboration-aware tools - ones designed from the outset with multiple users in mind. One example of a collaboration-aware application is the slide show viewer in which every person gets {{a copy of the}} slides. Users can then either synchronize with the presenter or navigate through the slides independently. Another example is the <b>shared</b> <b>whiteboard.</b> This allows multiple users to draw on the board at the same time. These applications not only have the advantage of being multi-user, but they also perform better because the code for each application runs on the client computer and only minimal amounts of data are shared through the server to synchronize the state.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we present our {{approach}} of combining open and sophisticated technologies {{in order to}} establish an integrated rich media environment for collaborative visualization processes. Aiming to support comprehensive visualization settings of spatially separated domain specialists, we deploy remote render farms for producing the visualization of complex datasets as video streams, separately for every collaboration partner. This makes our system capable also for low-end mobile devices, which only {{have to be able to}} render MEPG- 4 compliant video streams. The cooperation support is provided by a full-featured CSCW system including a <b>shared</b> <b>whiteboard</b> based on the platform independent Eclipse framework. The visualization objects are embedded in the CSCW system’s persistent object space and presented by the rich media view of the <b>shared</b> <b>whiteboard.</b> Starting with a basic scenario of collaborative visualization we will present the architecture of the combined visualization and CSCW systems and the design of the plug-in based <b>shared</b> <b>whiteboard.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Traditional computer-supported {{collaborative}} learning (CSCL) systems {{focus primarily on}} facilitating group work amongst students, providing several different modes for different types of communication, from chatting applications to <b>shared</b> <b>whiteboards.</b> The power of a good CSCL system, {{in addition to the}} interactions it supports, lies with the data the system can gather from those interac-tions (both relational and content-based). Thus, we have developed the Intelligent Multiagent Infrastructure for Distributed System in Education (I-MINDS), a CSCL system built on the Microsoft ConferenceXP platform that tracks real-time data to support student learning and classroom management.

This document specifies how to employ two-dimensional telepointers with RTP/I and defines application data units (ADUs) for telepointer operations.
