25|$|Floodgates, {{also called}} stop gates, are {{adjustable}} gates {{used to control}} water flow in flood barriers, reservoir, river, stream, or levee systems. They may be designed to set <b>spillway</b> <b>crest</b> heights in dams, to adjust flow rates in sluices and canals, {{or they may be}} designed to stop water flow entirely as part of a levee or storm surge system. Since most of these devices operate by controlling the water surface elevation being stored or routed, they are also known as crest gates. In the case of flood bypass systems, floodgates sometimes are also used to lower the water levels in a main river or canal channels by allowing more water to flow into a flood bypass or detention basin when the main river or canal is approaching a flood stage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In open channels, the {{relationship}} between the specific energy and the flow depth exhibits a minimum, and the corresponding flow conditions are called critical flow conditions. Herein they are re-analysed {{on the basis of the}} depth-averaged Bernoulli equation. At critical flow, there is only one possible flow depth, and a new analytical expression of that characteristic depth is developed for ideal-fluid flow situations with non-hydrostatic pressure distribution and non-uniform velocity distribution. The results are applied to relevant critical flow conditions: e. g., at the <b>crest</b> of a <b>spillway.</b> The finding may be applied to predict more accurately the discharge on weir and <b>spillway</b> <b>crests...</b>|$|R
40|$|The authors {{developed}} {{a series of}} expression for the critical depth in open channels with irregular channel cross-sections. It is believed that the article thrust and its conclusion missed a key point. The work is restricted to an open channel flow motion with hydrostatic pressure distributions {{although it was not}} stated explicitly. In turn the readers could be misled to assume that the results may apply {{to a wide range of}} open channel situations incl. weirs, <b>spillway</b> <b>crests,</b> gates, [...] . Figure 1 illustrates some flow situations in which the flow is critical but the pressure distributions are not hydrostatic. It is shown herein that the critical depth may be derived more broadly for flow situations with non-hydrostatic pressure distributions. At critical flow conditions, the specific energy is minimum (Bakhmeteff 1912, 1932, Liggett 1993). The cross-sectional averaged specific energy H is commonly expressed following Chanson (2006) : y g...|$|R
