5|$|At the Adarsh Gaurishankar <b>Sanskrit</b> College, Giridhar learnt {{the eight}} Ganas of <b>Sanskrit</b> prosody while {{studying}} Chandaprabhā, a work on <b>Sanskrit</b> prosody. The next day, he composed his first <b>Sanskrit</b> verse, in the Bhujaṅgaprayāta metre.|$|E
5|$|Rambhadracharya {{composed}} <b>Sanskrit</b> commentaries titled Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam on the Prasthanatrayi scriptures – the Brahma Sutra, the Bhagavad Gita, {{and eleven}} Upanishads. These commentaries were released on 10 April 1998 by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then Prime Minister of India. Rambhadracharya composed Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam on Narada Bhakti Sutra in 1991. He thus revived {{the tradition of}} writing <b>Sanskrit</b> commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi. He also gave the Ramananda Sampradaya its second commentary on Prasthanatrayi in <b>Sanskrit,</b> the first being the Ānandabhāṣyam, composed by Ramananda himself. Rambhadracharya's commentary in <b>Sanskrit</b> on the Prasthanatrayi was the first written in almost 500 years.|$|E
5|$|Shastry also critiqued {{the work}} Bhṛṅgadūtam, about {{which he says}} that it has many new usages (Prayogas) not seen earlier in <b>Sanskrit</b> poetry. As per Shastry, new {{dimensions}} in <b>Sanskrit</b> literature are seen in the play Śrīrāghavābhyudayam where there are songs in the Gīti style, and Gītarāmāyaṇam which is an epic poem in the Gīti style of Gītagovindam by Jayadeva. Dikshit writes that Kubjāpatram is {{a revival of the}} letter-poem (Patrakāvya) genre in <b>Sanskrit</b> after 2000 years, and is the first work in <b>Sanskrit</b> literature whose lead character is disabled.|$|E
5|$|Early Jain texts {{were not}} {{composed}} in Vedic or classical <b>Sanskrit,</b> but in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit language. According to Matilal, the earliest Jain literature that present a developing {{form of a}} substantial anekantavada doctrine is found in <b>Sanskrit</b> texts, and after Jaina scholars had adopted <b>Sanskrit</b> to debate their ideas with Buddhists and Hindus of their era. These texts show a synthetic development, the existence and borrowing of terminology, ideas and concepts from rival schools of Indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed with their peers.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 Giridhar {{enrolled}} at the Sampurnanand <b>Sanskrit</b> University in Varanasi for higher studies in Vyakarana. He topped the final examination for the Shastri (Bachelor of Arts) degree in 1974, and then enrolled for the Acharya (Master of Arts) degree at the same institute. While pursuing his master's degree, he visited New Delhi to participate in various national competitions at the All-India <b>Sanskrit</b> Conference, where he won five out of the eight gold medals—in Vyakarana, Samkhya, Nyaya, Vedanta, and <b>Sanskrit</b> Antakshari. Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister of India, presented the five gold medals, along with the Chalvaijayanti trophy for Uttar Pradesh, to Giridhar. Impressed by his abilities, Gandhi offered to send him at her own expense to the United States for treatment for his eyes, but Giridhar turned down this offer, replying with an extemporaneous <b>Sanskrit</b> verse.|$|E
5|$|Many Lingbao {{beliefs are}} {{borrowed}} from Buddhism. The {{names of the}} many different deities and heavens were often given titles based on phonetic transcriptions of <b>Sanskrit.</b> Many <b>Sanskrit</b> terms were borrowed phonetically, but given completely different meanings. One significant concept borrowed from Buddhism was that of reincarnation.|$|E
5|$|Michael Witzel, a Professor of <b>Sanskrit,</b> {{said that}} Wendy Doniger's {{knowledge}} of Vedic <b>Sanskrit</b> is severely flawed. Nicholas Kazanas, a European Indologist, has also criticised Doniger's works and wrote that Doniger {{seems to be}} obsessed with only one meaning of myths: the most sexual imaginable.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 1997, Giridhar (now {{known as}} Rambhadracharya) {{was awarded the}} post-doctorate Vachaspati (DLitt) degree by Sampurnanand <b>Sanskrit</b> University for his 2000-page <b>Sanskrit</b> {{dissertation}} Pāṇinīyāṣṭādhyāyyāḥ Pratisūtraṃ Śābdabodhasamīkṣā, or Investigation into verbal knowledge of every Sūtra of the Ashtadhyayi of Panini. The degree was presented to him by K. R. Narayanan, then President of India. In this work, Rambhadracharya explained each aphorism of the grammar of Panini in <b>Sanskrit</b> verses.|$|E
5|$|Rambhadracharya {{can speak}} 22languages {{and is a}} {{spontaneous}} poet and writer in <b>Sanskrit,</b> Hindi, Awadhi, Maithili, and several other languages. He has authored more than 100books and 50papers, including four epic poems, Hindi commentaries on Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas and Hanuman Chalisa, a <b>Sanskrit</b> commentary in verse on the Ashtadhyayi, and <b>Sanskrit</b> commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi scriptures. He is acknowledged for his knowledge in diverse fields including <b>Sanskrit</b> grammar, Nyaya and Vedanta. He is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest authorities on Tulsidas in India, and is the editor of a critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas. He is a Katha artist for the Ramayana and the Bhagavata. His Katha programmes are held regularly in different cities in India and other countries, and are telecast on television channels like Shubh TV, Sanskar TV and Sanatan TV. He is also a leader of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).|$|E
5|$|Ramprasad {{was born}} in Halisahar, a village {{on the banks of}} the Ganges about thirty-five miles north of Kolkata, into a Tantric Vaidya family. Due to the absence of birth records, his actual birth date is not known, but it is {{believed}} to be around 1718 or 1723. His father, Ramram Sen, was an Ayurvedic doctor and <b>Sanskrit</b> scholar. Ramprasad's mother Siddheswari was Ramram's second wife. Ramprasad was sent to a <b>Sanskrit</b> tol (school) where he learned <b>Sanskrit</b> grammar, literature, Persian, and Hindi. As a youth, he had a talent for poetry and learning new languages.|$|E
5|$|Shastry critiqued {{the work}} Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam in the January 2003 {{issue of the}} <b>Sanskrit</b> monthly Bhāratī. Shastry writes that the work has poetic excellence, variety of meters and dexterity of {{language}} {{which has not been}} seen hitherto in <b>Sanskrit</b> epics. Shastry finds the twentieth canto of the epic to be an excellent illustration of <b>Sanskrit</b> poetry in Prakrit verses, a style which was pioneered by Shastry's father.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Boden Professor of <b>Sanskrit</b> at the University of Oxford {{was established in}} 1832 with money bequeathed to the university by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Boden, a retired soldier {{in the service of}} the East India Company. He wished the university to establish a <b>Sanskrit</b> professorship to assist in the conversion of the people of British India to Christianity, and his bequest was also used to fund scholarships in <b>Sanskrit</b> at Oxford. The first two professors were elected by Oxford graduates, as the university's statutes provided: Horace Hayman Wilson won by a narrow majority in 1832, and the 1860 election was hotly contested, as the rivals each claimed to be best at fulfilling Boden's intentions and presented different views about the nature and purpose of <b>Sanskrit</b> scholarship. Reforms of Oxford implemented in 1882 removed all mention of Boden's original purpose from the statutes, removed the power to elect the professor from graduates, and gave the holder of the professorship a fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|A 10th-century Kannada text {{based on}} the <b>Sanskrit</b> text was written by the poet Adikavi Pampa.|$|E
5|$|A Kalpavriksha is {{mentioned}} in the <b>Sanskrit</b> work Mānāsara as a royal insignia. In Hemādri's work Caturvargacīntama, the Kalpavriksha {{is said to be}} a tree of gold and gem stones.|$|E
5|$|Andayya, {{taking a}} non-conformist path {{that was never}} {{repeated}} in Kannada literature, wrote Madana Vijaya ("Triumph of cupid", 1217–1235) using only pure Kannada words (desya) and naturalised <b>Sanskrit</b> words (tadbhava) and totally avoiding assimilated <b>Sanskrit</b> words (tatsamas). This is seen {{by some as a}} rebuttal meant to prove that writing Kannada literature without borrowed <b>Sanskrit</b> words was possible. The poem narrates the story of the moon being imprisoned by the god Shiva in his abode in the Himalayas. In his anger, Kama (Cupid, the god of love, also called Manmata) assailed Shiva with his arrows only to be cursed by Shiva and separated from his beloved. Kama then contrived to rid himself of Shiva's curse. The work also goes by other names such as Sobagina Suggi ("Harvest of Beauty"), Kavane Gella ("Cupid's Conquest") and Kabbigara-kava ("Poets defender"). Kama has an important place in Jain writings even before Andayya. The possibility that this writing was yet another subtle weapon in the intensifying conflict between the dominant Jains and the Veerashaivas, whose popularity was on the rise, is not lost on historians.|$|E
5|$|Another medieval era <b>Sanskrit</b> {{text with}} the title Mānasollāsa also exists, {{consisting}} of devotional praise hymns (stotra), and it {{is different from the}} encyclopedic treatise.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} five, Giridhar {{memorised}} {{the entire}} Bhagavad Gita, consisting of around 700verses with chapter and verse numbers, in 15days, {{with the help of}} his neighbour, Pandit Murlidhar Mishra. On Janmashtami day in 1955, he recited the entire Bhagavad Gita. He released the first Braille version of the scripture, with the original <b>Sanskrit</b> text and a Hindi commentary, at New Delhi on 30 November 2007, 52years after memorising the Gita. When Giridhar was seven, he memorised the entire Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas, consisting of around 10,900verses with chapter and verse numbers, in 60days, assisted by his grandfather. On Rama Navami day in 1957, he recited the entire epic while fasting. Later, Giridhar went on to memorise the Vedas, the Upanishads, works of <b>Sanskrit</b> grammar, the Bhagavata Purana, all the works of Tulsidas, and many other works in <b>Sanskrit</b> and Indian literature.|$|E
5|$|Deshasthas {{produced}} prominent literary {{figures in}} Maharashtra between the 13th and the 19th centuries. The great <b>Sanskrit</b> scholar Bhavabhuti was a Deshastha Brahmin who lived around 700 AD in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. His works of high <b>Sanskrit</b> poetry and plays are only equalled {{by those of}} Kalidasa. Two of his best known plays are Mahāvīracarita and Mālatī Mādhava. Mahaviracarita is a work on the early life of the Hindu god Rama, whereas Malati Madhava is a love story between Malati and her lover Madhava, which has a happy ending after several twists and turns.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Ranbir Singh, the temple complex became the centre of <b>Sanskrit</b> teachings to {{a large number of}} Brahmin students. A {{translation}} centre was also established as part of the temple where books on philosophy and history in Arabic and Persian languages were translated by Muslim scholars into <b>Sanskrit.</b> Like wise, Pundits translated many scriptures into Hindi and Dogri languages. This initiative taken by Maharaja Ranbir Singh to bring amity between the Hindu and Muslim communities was praised by Sir Aurel Stein as in:order to facilitate the exchange of ideas which the Maharaja in a spirit of true enlightenment desired to promote between the representatives of Hindu and Mohammedan scholars in his domain. The temple also houses a library, which has rare <b>Sanskrit</b> works.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{taught that}} the true secret of sex magic were bodily secretions, the most {{important}} of which was a woman's menstrual blood. He referred to female sexual secretions as kalas, a term adopted from <b>Sanskrit.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 1940, the Government of Madras {{appointed}} a committee headed by Srinivasa Sastri to frame {{a set of}} general principles for coining words for scientific and technical terms in vernacular languages. The constitution of the committee was strongly condemned by the Madras Presidency Tamil Sangam and its Secretary E. M. Subramania Pillai who felt that Srinivasa Sastri was biased in favour of <b>Sanskrit</b> and hence, Anti-Tamil. The committee submitted its report after three months recommending the retention of the existing <b>Sanskrit</b> loanwords in Tamil and rejecting the need {{for them to be}} replaced. The deliberations of the Sastri Committee provoked widespread agitations in Madras Presidency. The committee was eventually reshuffled by Provincial Education Minister T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar soon after the demise of Srinivasa Sastri and balanced with the introduction of more members supporting the replacement of <b>Sanskrit</b> loan words.|$|E
5|$|In {{an age of}} {{classical}} <b>Sanskrit</b> literature, Madhava II (brother of King Vishnugopa) wrote a treatise Dattaka Sutravritti {{which was based on}} an earlier work on erotics by a writer called Dattaka. A <b>Sanskrit</b> version of Vaddakatha, a commentary on Pāṇini's grammar called Sabdavathara and a commentary on the 15th chapter of a <b>Sanskrit</b> work called Kiratarjunneya by poet Bharavi (who was in Durvinita's court) are ascribed to Durvinita. King Shivamara II is known to have written Gajamata Kalpana. Hemasena, also known as Vidya Dhananjaya authored Raghavapandaviya, a narration of the stories of Rama and the Pandavas simultaneously through puns. Gayachintamani and Kshatrachudamini which were based on poet Bana's work Kadambari were written by Hemasena's pupil Vadeebhasimha in prose style. and Chavundaraya wrote Charitarasara.|$|E
5|$|In his autobiography, Gandhi {{wrote that}} he {{believed}} every Hindu boy and girl must learn <b>Sanskrit</b> because its historic and spiritual texts are in that language.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions in <b>Sanskrit</b> and Kannada are {{the main}} source of {{information}} about Badami Chalukya history. Among them, the Badami cave inscriptions of Mangalesha (578), Kappe Arabhatta record of c.700, Peddavaduguru inscription of PulakeshinII, the Kanchi Kailasanatha Temple inscription and Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple inscription of VikramadityaII (all in Kannada language) provide more evidence of the Chalukya language. The Badami cliff inscription of PulakeshinI (543), the Mahakuta Pillar inscription of Mangalesha (595) and the Aihole inscription of PulakeshinII (634) are examples of important <b>Sanskrit</b> inscriptions written in old Kannada script.|$|E
5|$|Kannada {{became more}} {{prominent}} {{as a literary}} language during the Rashtrakuta rule with its script and literature showing remarkable growth, dignity and productivity. This period effectively {{marked the end of}} the classical Prakrit and <b>Sanskrit</b> era. Court poets and royalty created eminent works in Kannada and <b>Sanskrit</b> that spanned such literary forms as prose, poetry, rhetoric, the Hindu epics and the life history of Jain tirthankars. Bilingual writers such as Asaga gained fame, and noted scholars such as the Mahaviracharya wrote on pure mathematics in the court of King Amoghavarsha I.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} <b>Sanskrit</b> texts, that enjoys authority in Ganapatya tradition states John Grimes, is the Ganapati Atharvashirsa.|$|E
5|$|Over the millennia, the {{community}} produced the eighth century <b>Sanskrit</b> scholar Bhavabhuti, {{the thirteenth century}} Varkari saint and philosopher Dnyaneshwar, his brother and guru Saint Nivruttinath , his sister Saint Muktabai, and Samarth Ramdas.|$|E
5|$|Rambhadracharya is {{a scholar}} of 14 {{languages}} and can speak 22 languages in total, including <b>Sanskrit,</b> Hindi, English, French, Bhojpuri, Maithili, Oriya, Gujarati, Punjabi, Marathi, Magadhi, Awadhi, and Braj.

He delivers Katha programmes in various languages, including Hindi, Bhojpuri, and Gujarati.|$|E
5|$|Scholars however concur {{that the}} rulers of the {{imperial}} dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the Kannada language as important as <b>Sanskrit.</b> Rashtrakuta inscriptions use both Kannada and <b>Sanskrit</b> (historians Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben claim they are mostly in Kannada), and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages. The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty. Though these Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas, they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well.|$|E
5|$|Shivayogi's other {{writings}} {{include a}} scientific encyclopaedia called Vivekachintamani, so well regarded {{that it was}} translated into Marathi language in 1604 and <b>Sanskrit</b> language in 1652 {{and again in the}} 18th century. The writing categorises 1,500 topics based on subject and covers a wide array such as poetics, dance and drama, musicology and erotics.

5|$|The <b>Sanskrit</b> name of Tulsidas can be transliterated in two ways. Using the {{original}} <b>Sanskrit,</b> {{the name is}} written as Tulasīdāsa. Using the Hunterian transliteration system, it is written as Tulsidas or Tulsīdās reflecting the vernacular pronunciation (since the written Indian languages maintain the vestigial letters that are no longer pronounced). The lost vowels are {{an aspect of the}} Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages and can vary between regions. The name is a compound of two <b>Sanskrit</b> words: Tulasī, which is an Indian variety of the basil plant considered auspicious by Vaishnavas (devotees of god Vishnu and his avatars like Rama), and Dāsa, which means slave or servant and by extension, devotee. Tulsidas, which means a servant of the plant Tulsi.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>Sanskrit</b> to English {{translation}} of the Aitareya Upanishad was made by Colebrooke, in 1805 and the first English {{translation of}} the Kena Upanishad was made by Rammohun Roy in 1816.|$|E
