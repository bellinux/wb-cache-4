5|$|Scent plays a {{significant}} role in olfactory communication. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and <b>sniff</b> at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behaviour but less prominently than the males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} often hunts alone, and {{sometimes}} in pairs, but rarely hunts in a pack. When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops to <b>sniff</b> and listen. Once prey is located, the jackal conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping {{into the air and}} pouncing on them. In India, they can dig Indian gerbils out from their burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4–5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding blackbuck calves throughout the day during the calving period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams and drive their prey from one jackal to another.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would <b>sniff</b> her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she {{caught a whiff of}} her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaurs {{had large}} {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to their brain size). These suggest a highly developed {{sense of smell}} which could <b>sniff</b> out carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs. Opponents of the pure scavenger hypothesis have used the example of vultures in the opposite way, arguing that the scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large gliding birds, which use their keen senses and energy-efficient gliding to cover vast areas economically. Researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger, although the theropod might {{have had to be}} cold-blooded in order to get more calories from carrion than it spent on foraging (see Metabolism of dinosaurs). They also suggested that modern ecosystems like the Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because gliding birds now do the job much more efficiently, while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from gliding birds.|$|E
5|$|The gray wolf's {{expressive}} {{behavior is}} more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity. When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, the face is smooth, the lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction. Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and piloerection. Aggressive, or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine. Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: passive and active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to <b>sniff</b> its anogenital area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face. When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.|$|E

40|$|SummarySniffing is a {{specialized}} respiratory {{behavior that is}} essential for the acquisition of odors [1 – 4]. Perhaps not independent of this, <b>sniffing</b> is commonly displayed during motivated [5 – 7] and social behaviors [8, 9]. No measures of <b>sniffing</b> among interacting animals are available, however, calling into question the utility of this behavior in the social context. From radiotelemetry recordings of nasal respiration, I found that investigation by one rat toward the facial region of a conspecific often elicits a decrease in <b>sniffing</b> frequency in the conspecific. This reciprocal display of <b>sniffing</b> was found to be dependent upon the rat’s social status in two separate paradigms, with subordinates reliably decreasing their <b>sniffing</b> frequency upon being investigated in the face by dominant rats. Failure of subordinates to decrease their <b>sniffing</b> frequency shortened the latency for agonistic behavior by dominant rats, reflecting that decreases in <b>sniffing</b> serve as appeasement signals during social interactions. Rats rendered unable to smell persisted in displaying reciprocal <b>sniffing</b> behavior, demonstrating the independence of this behavior from olfaction. Oxytocin treatment in rats with established social hierarchies abolished agonistic behaviors and reciprocal <b>sniffing</b> displays. Together, these findings demonstrate that rodents utilize <b>sniffing</b> behaviors communicatively, not only to collect [6, 10 – 14] but also to convey information...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sniffing,</b> a {{behavior}} that enhances detection and localization of odorants, is typically assumed to require behavioral arousal. In {{an effort to}} determine whether <b>sniffing</b> and arousal are dissociable, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) was presented to 8 -day-old rats while respiration and behavioral state were monitored. Pups <b>sniffed</b> {{in response to the}} highest concentrations of DMDS, exhibiting a lower olfactory threshold when awake. Surprisingly, <b>sniffing</b> occurred even while pups remained asleep. <b>Sniffing</b> was mediated by the olfactory system, as evidenced by the abolition of <b>sniffing</b> when the lateral olfactory tracts were cut and the retention of rapid arousal in response to a trigeminal stimulant, acetic acid. Finally, sleeping pups presented with acetic acid awakened without <b>sniffing.</b> Thus, although olfactory threshold increases during sleep, sleeping does not preclude <b>sniffing.</b> Sleep in mammals can be defined by using electrographic cri-teria—including changes in the electromyogram (EMG) and elec-troencephalogram (EEG) —and behavioral criteria—including a relaxed posture and increased sensory thresholds (Campbell & Tobler, 1984; Rechtschaffen & Kales, 1968).

5000|$|While <b>sniffing</b> {{behavior}} is often observed and discussed {{within the context}} of acquiring odor information, <b>sniffing</b> is also displayed during the performance of motivated behaviors and upon deep brain electrical stimulation of brain reward centers.

[...] Thus, while <b>sniffing</b> is often considered a critical part of olfaction, its link with motivated and reward behaviors suggests it plays a role in other behaviors.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sniffing</b> is a perceptually-relevant behavior, {{defined as}} the active {{sampling}} of odors through the nasal cavity {{for the purpose of}} information acquisition. This behavior, displayed by all terrestrial vertebrates, is typically identified based upon changes in respiratory frequency and/or amplitude, [...] and is often studied in the context of odor guided behaviors and olfactory perceptual tasks. <b>Sniffing</b> is quantified by measuring intra-nasal pressure or flow or air [...] or, while less accurate, through a strain gauge on the chest to measure total respiratory volume. Strategies for <b>sniffing</b> behavior vary depending upon the animal, with small animals (rats, mice, hamsters) displaying <b>sniffing</b> frequencies ranging from 4 to 12 Hz but larger animals (humans) <b>sniffing</b> at much lower frequencies, usually less than 2 Hz. Subserving <b>sniffing</b> behaviors, evidence for an [...] "olfactomotor" [...] circuit in the brain exists, [...] wherein perception or expectation of an odor can trigger brain respiratory center to allow for the modulation of <b>sniffing</b> frequency and amplitude and thus acquisition of odor information. <b>Sniffing</b> is analogous to other stimulus sampling behaviors, including visual saccades, active touch, and whisker movements in small animals (viz., whisking). [...] Atypical <b>sniffing</b> has been reported in cases of neurological disorders, especially those disorders characterized by impaired motor function and olfactory perception.|$|R
50|$|Notably, {{several studies}} have {{reported}} that modulation in <b>sniffing</b> frequency {{may be just as}} great in context of anticipation of odor sampling as during sampling of odors.

The remaining two conditions involved a constant, very low flow of either odorized or odorless air during velopharyngeal closure (VPC), a technique that prevents subject-induced airflow through the nasal passages. Contrary to expectation, <b>sniffing</b> under odorless conditions did not induce significant piriform and surrounding cortical (PC+) activity when compared to odorless VPC, even at a liberal statistical threshold. However, a small correlation emerged in PC+ between the difference signal of [odorless <b>sniffing</b> odorless VPC] and peak rate of nasal pressure change. PC+ activity was, however, strongly evoked by odorant exposure during <b>sniffing</b> and VPC, with neither technique showing greater activation.
