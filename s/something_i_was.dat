[...] "One {{or two of}} the {{vehicles}} carrying the ideas were not as strong as the ideas that they carried.

500|$|Of {{his time}} in the Army, Gore later stated, [...] "I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform." [...] He also later stated that his {{experience}} in Vietnam didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did {{not take into account the}} fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> naively unprepared for.|$|E
500|$|Orantes' main {{objective}} is to trace {{the origins of the}} MEV-1 pathogen. Cotillard, a fan of Soderbergh's work, first met with the director in Los Angeles, California. The French actress was enthralled with the script because she was [...] "very concerned about germs. I've always been ... scared, in a way, by all of those disease. So ... it was really <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really interested." [...] Soderbergh said that Orantes [...] "gets dropped into situations and has to deal with cultural as well as scientific issues that are sometimes at odds", and notes that she has a [...] "professional" [...] yet stubborn, [...] "remote", and [...] "dispassionate" [...] demeanor, though [...] "something happens to her {{in the course of the}} story that causes a significant emotional shift." ...|$|E

500|$|Esch {{returned}} for the Symbols album, which {{was released in}} 1997 and featured Abby Travis and Skinny Puppy's Nivek Ogre. Symbols reached No.137 on the Billboard 200. Its first track, [...] "Megalomaniac", was featured in the film , {{and was the first}} song from its soundtrack to receive radio airplay. [...] Tim Skold, formerly of the band Shotgun Messiah, made his first appearance as a band member, writing lyrics and performing vocals on [...] "Anarchy". Looking back on Symbols in 2002, Konietzko said, [...] "I listened to the Symbols album and heard exactly why KMFDM broke up in the first place. It told me the story of what went wrong. There were maybe two (good) songs on that album and the others were just a bunch of compromising tug-of-wars. That was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not going to do again." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving {{school at}} 16, {{he decided to}} be a painter and began {{training}} in commercial illustration at Saint Martin's School of Art. While attending a rehearsal for a workshop at the Oval House, a fire eater was teaching people how to eat fire {{and he decided to}} join. A circus agent saw him busking and hired him for three years. He later trained for three years as an actor at the Drama Centre London. Brosnan has described the feeling of becoming an actor and the impact it had on his life: [...] "When I found acting, or when acting found me, it was a liberation. It was a stepping stone into another life, away from a life that I had, and acting was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> good at, something which was appreciated. That was a great satisfaction in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{was quickly}} {{followed}} by [...] "Third Day of a Seven Day Binge". Manson {{said that the}} recording of the album [...] "just became a rhythm. This was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> excited to do." [...] This is {{in stark contrast to}} the recording of The High End of Low (2009) and Born Villain, when he was frequently [...] "dragged into the studio" [...] late at night to record vocals. He credited this enthusiasm to the collaborative process between him and Bates, saying that he realized after the first performance of [...] "Birds of Hell Awaiting" [...] that [...] " [...] just sang it. I didn't even know where the music was going to go and I just went with it and it was very organic. And then it opened up a whole different part of my mind." ...|$|E

500|$|Evra {{initially}} {{had some}} problems adapting to the English game. He made his debut for the club on 14 January in a 3–1 away defeat to Manchester City in the Premier League. He was substituted out at half-time after failing to make an impact. After {{the conclusion of the}} match, Ferguson stated, [...] "Maybe {{it was a bit of}} a gamble playing Evra," [...] while the player himself admitted that [...] "playing for Manchester United was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not prepared for". Despite the initial set-back, Evra started in the team's ensuing match against Liverpool, a 1–0 victory, and was praised for his performance by teammate Rio Ferdinand. On 26 February, Evra appeared as a substitute in United's 4–0 win over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 League Cup final. On 2 March, it was reported that Liverpool defender Steve Finnan had racially abused Evra in the match. The abuse claims surfaced from two deaf television viewers lodging a police complaint. The viewers claimed to have lip-read Finnan abusing Evra during the televised match. Finnan denied the charge and, after an investigation, The Football Association (FA) decided against charging the player. Evra regularly alternated between the bench and the starting 11 to close out the campaign. He finished the season with 14 total appearances for his new club.|$|E
500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E

When I was younger, I became a fighter because I had to survive. I had nothing. I {{had no one to}} depend on except myself. I {{realized}} that boxing was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> good at, and I trained hard so that I could keep myself and my family alive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... {{features}} dialogue-driven interludes in {{the beginning}} of several tracks with Raekwon and Ghostface Killah conversing about money, life, crime, and hip hop, among other things. The introduction to [...] "Glaciers of Ice," [...] for instance, involves Ghostface addressing his plans and methods of dyeing Wallabee-styled Clarks. In a 2005 interview, Ghostface Killah explained [...] "We was in the car one day, driving around with the DAT machine with a microphone and we just started talking shit about how we're gonna do it this summer with the Clarks. The dyeing was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing already. I'm an inventor. Niggas can't fuck with me when it comes to style. Only nigga that is right there with me is probably Slick Rick. Other than that, I'm boss." ...|$|E
2500|$|Encouraged by her father, Bow {{continued}} to visit studio agencies asking for parts. [...] "But {{there was always}} <b>something.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too young, or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat." [...] Eventually, director Elmer Clifton needed a tomboy for his movie Down to the Sea in Ships, saw Bow in Motion Picture Classic magazine, and sent for her. In an attempt to overcome her youthful looks, Bow put her hair up and arrived in a dress she [...] "sneaked" [...] from her mother. Clifton said she was too old, but broke into laughter as the stammering Bow made him believe she was {{the girl in the}} magazine. Clifton decided to bring Bow with him and offered her $35 a week. Bow held out for $50 and Clifton agreed, but he could not say whether she would [...] "fit the part". Bow later learned that one of Brewsters' subeditors had urged Clifton to give her a chance.|$|E
2500|$|On April 25, Norris {{wrote on}} her website that the {{response}} to her idea had surprised and shocked her: [...] "I did not intend for my cartoon to go viral.

This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!" [...] On April 26, she wrote on her website: [...] "I am NOT involved in [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammd [...] Day! I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it. Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff". She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused.

2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be able to help you with that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E
