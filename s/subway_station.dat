5|$|Previously a {{grade-level}} intersection, the underpass {{was constructed}} simultaneously with the <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> costing $250,000. The {{construction of the}} underpass with a <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> underneath was a massive undertaking. Three levels were required {{in order for the}} underpass and the <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> to be built. The upper level that was built was Queens Boulevard, which carries traffic east and west. The second level is an underpass that carries four lanes of Union Turnpike (and now also the Jackie Robinson Parkway) under the Boulevard. The tunnel is in between the two mezzanines and it would rest atop the roof of the <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> platform.|$|E
5|$|Created as a {{replacement}} for Rockaway Beach Branch service in the 1950s, the Q53 was originally labeled an express service. It made stops at the Woodside LIRR station, Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street <b>subway</b> <b>station,</b> Grand Avenue station, and 63rd Drive <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> (near the former Rego Park LIRR station) before running non-stop to Broad Channel and the Rockaways. Under the MTA, limited-stop service along Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevard was added in 2006 and overnight service was added in 2013.|$|E

25|$|In August 2006, the MTA {{announced}} that all future <b>subway</b> <b>stations,</b> which include 34th Street–Hudson Yards, South Ferry, and all Second Avenue <b>Subway</b> <b>stations,</b> will have platforms outfitted with air-cooling systems. The existing Grand Central–42nd Street station also has these cooling systems; however, {{for the most}} part, <b>subway</b> <b>stations</b> lack air-cooling systems due to their expense, {{and only a few}} stations have ceiling fans.|$|R
50|$|In April 2016, Main Street was {{the first}} station on the Toronto subway system to have the new paddle-door fare gates which {{replaced}} the turnstiles. All <b>subway</b> <b>stations</b> (at least one entrance per station) became fully Presto-compatible by December 22, 2016, and new swing-open paddle-door fare gates will eventually be installed at all <b>subway</b> <b>stations</b> (including all remaining entrances and the initial 26 <b>subway</b> <b>stations</b> retrofitted with Presto machines on the older turnstiles).|$|R
5|$|In 2010, a {{renovation}} of North Philadelphia <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> was completed. This included restoring the Glenwood Avenue headhouses, closed for decades before, which improved {{connections to the}} mainline station.|$|E
5|$|The Lexington Avenue–63rd Street <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> has two island platforms, {{which were}} {{originally}} built with now-demolished walls on their northern sides. The platforms {{were designed to}} provide a cross-platform interchange to the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E

500|$|The 72nd Street {{station is}} served by the Q train at all times, and some N trains during rush hours. It has two tracks and an island platform. [...] The station is built {{so that it is}} more wide open than most other {{underground}} <b>subway</b> <b>stations</b> in the system, like other Second Avenue <b>Subway</b> <b>stations</b> but unlike existing New York City <b>Subway</b> <b>stations.</b> Due to its openness, the station was likened to a Washington Metro station by Dr. Michael Horodniceanu, President of MTA Capital Construction. The platform is approximately 99 feet (30 m) below ground, making it the deepest of the 3 stations built under phase 1. The platform for the 72nd Street station, like the other Second Avenue <b>Subway</b> <b>stations,</b> is [...] wide.|$|R

5|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) station along the Rockaway Beach Branch. The LIRR station opened in 1913 {{to replace the}} nearby Ramblersville station. The LIRR ceased operations at this station in 1950, and the New York City Transit Authority bought {{the section of the}} Rockaway Beach Branch that included this station in 1952. The <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> opened on June 28, 1956. Between 2000 and 2003, the <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> was completely reconstructed and a transfer to the new AirTrain JFK was built. The rebuilt complex was completed on December 17, 2003, providing easier access to JFK Airport for large parts of the city.|$|E
5|$|Broad Channel {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1880 as a Long Island Railroad station. The LIRR discontinued service in 1950 after a {{fire on the}} trestle across Jamaica Bay, to the station's north. The station reopened June 28, 1956, as a <b>subway</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|Located {{underneath}} the <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> terminal {{is a set}} of bus stops on Stillwell Avenue and Mermaid Avenue that make up a bus terminal for four New York City Bus lines. The bus terminal provides easier transfer to the subway and bus connections. One additional bus line is located near the station complex.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} located on Roosevelt Island, which was once home to a penitentiary and some asylums. Then known as Welfare Island, the island became neglected. During the 1960s, some groups started proposing uses for the island. More {{suggestions}} for {{what to do with}} it were made once the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) announced that it would build a <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> on the island. The station was intended as a way to encourage transit-oriented development on the island. When construction of the line was delayed, the Roosevelt Island Tram was built in 1973. The Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was formed in 1984 to develop the island, but was not successful until October 1989 when the <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> opened along with the rest of the 63rd Street Line. The opening encouraged the development of the island, which has made the station busier.|$|E
5|$|Except for the Q53, all buses {{along the}} {{corridor}} end northbound service at Queens and Woodhaven Boulevards, at the Woodhaven Boulevard <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> of the IND Queens Boulevard Line and {{at the foot of}} Queens Center mall. Buses reenter service in a dedicated bus stop area on Hoffman Drive adjacent to the south side of Queens Boulevard. The Q53 serves these stops on its through service to or from Woodside.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, on October 2, 1925, the 95th Street <b>subway</b> <b>station,</b> {{which was}} built mainly in {{anticipation}} for the Staten Island Tunnel, was opened. The station was built with a false wall at its south end, intended for either a planned extension to 100th or 101st Streets or a line leading to a future Fort Hamilton-based tunnel.|$|E

5|$|On August 8, 2012, a {{controlled}} blast at 72nd Street caused rocks {{to fly over}} the station site. Nearly two weeks later, on August 21, 2012, an uncontrolled blast for the Second Avenue <b>Subway</b> <b>station</b> at 72nd Street was done incorrectly, causing a large explosion that sent debris {{into the air and}} broke windows of buildings in the area and damaged nearby sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1915, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} during construction of the 23rd Street <b>subway</b> <b>station</b> that caused the tunnel to collapse. Seven people were killed after a blast of dynamite in the subway tunnel destroyed the plank roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E
5|$|Other {{variations}} to {{the pattern}} {{can be observed}} at Islington and Warden stations, which both have a tricolour design. The current terminus stations of Kipling and Kennedy stations resemble the second version of Union <b>subway</b> <b>station.</b> Since opening, Kipling and Kennedy stations are the only Bloor–Danforth line stations {{not to use the}} Toronto Subway font.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels {{needed to meet}} stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously tested in a laboratory in York, Pennsylvania.

As a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E
