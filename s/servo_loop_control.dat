40|$|Linear and {{circular}} representations {{are widely}} used to define tool paths, however, the tangency discontinuity between the linear and circular segments leads to large fluctuations in velocity and acceleration, as a result, the machining accuracy and efficiency are degraded. It becomes the key problem in some micromachining situations where the quality of freeform surfaces is critical, such as moulds and knee implants, etc. This research aims to develop a local tool path smoothening scheme to achieve C 2 continuity at the transition positions. This scheme applies to sections consisting of high density of short segments. These segments will be approximated by cubic B-splines. The approximation is carried out within the specific error tolerance. High frequency energy to be injected into the <b>servo</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> system is greatly reduced by the C 2 continuity.

40|$|The Thirty Meter Telescope has 492 {{primary mirror}} segments, each {{incorporated}} into a Primary Segment Assembly (PSA), each of {{which in turn has}} three actuators that control piston, tip, and tilt, for a total of 1476 actuators. Each actuator has a <b>servo</b> <b>loop</b> that <b>controls</b> small motions (nanometers) and large motions (millimeters). Candidate actuators were designed and tested that fall into the categories of "hard" and "soft," depending on the offload spring stiffness relative to the PSA structural stiffness. Dynamics models for each type of actuator are presented, which respectively use piezo-electric transducers and voice coils. Servo design and analysis are presented that include assessments of stability, performance, robustness, and control structure interaction. The analysis is presented for a single PSA on a rigid base, and then using Zernike approximations the analysis is repeated for 492 mirror segments on a flexible mirror cell. Servo requirements include low-frequency stiffness, needed for wind rejection; reduced control structure interaction, specified by a bound on the sensitivity function; and mid-frequency damping, needed to reduce vibration transmission. The last of these requirements, vibration reduction, was found to be an important distinguishing characteristic for actuator selection. Hard actuators have little inherent damping, which is improved using PZT shunt circuits and force feedback, but still these improvements were found to result in less damping than is provided by the soft actuator.

Simulation results are shown for a number of pointing options under the disturbing influences of man motion, thruster firings, and experiment operations. One option of particular interest is the suspended pallet which offers the possibility of high accuracy pointing of very large payloads without using conventional gimbals. The pallet is suspended within the payload bay by nonrigid attachments such as springs, thereby isolating experiments from most shuttle disturbances. Control moment gyros apply torques directly to the pallet to maintain pointing accuracy within the arc second range. Spring torques constrain shuttle attitude so thruster operation is not required.

40|$|Abstract: Compact Disc {{players have}} been on the market in more than two decades, and a {{majority}} of the involved control problems have been solved. However, there are still problems with playing Compact Discs related to surface faults like scratches and fingerprints. Two <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> are used to keep the Optical Pick-up Unit focused and radially on the information track of the Compact Disc. The problem is to design servo controllers which are well suited for handling surface faults which disturbs the position measurement and still react sufficiently against normal disturbances like mechanical shocks. In this paper a novel method called feature based control is presented. The method is based on a fault tolerant control scheme, which uses extracted features of the surface faults to remove those from the detector signals used for control during the occurrence of surface faults. The extracted features are Karhunen-Loève approximations of the surface faults. The performance of the feature based control scheme controlling Compact Disc Players playing Compact Discs with surface faults have been validated by experimental work with positive conclusive results...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary mirror}} control system (M 1 CS) keeps the 492 {{segments}} of the Thirty Meter Telescope primary mirror aligned {{in the presence of}} disturbances. A global position <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> uses feedback from inter-segment edge sensors to three actuators behind each segment that control segment piston, tip and tilt. If soft force actuators are used (e. g. voice-coil), then in addition to the global position loop there will be a local <b>servo</b> <b>loop</b> to provide stiffness. While the M 1 control system at Keck compensates only for slow disturbances such as gravity and thermal variations, the M 1 CS for TMT will need to provide some compensation for higher frequency wind disturbances in order to meet stringent error budget targets. An analysis of expected high-wavenumber wind forces on M 1 suggests that a 1 Hz control bandwidth is required for the global feedback of segment edge-sensor-based position information in order to minimize high spatial frequency segment response for both seeing-limited and adaptive optics performance. A much higher bandwidth is required from the local <b>servo</b> <b>loop</b> to provide adequate stiffness to wind or acoustic disturbances. A related paper presents the control designs for the local actuator <b>servo</b> <b>loops.</b> The disturbance rejection requirements would not be difficult to achieve for a single segment, but the structural coupling between segments mounted on a flexible mirror cell results in control-structure interaction (CSI) that limits the achievable bandwidth.

The techniques for manufacturing these surfaces are varied but are tied together by one limitation; the lack of useable, on-line metrology instrumentation. Current metrology methods require the removal of a workpiece for characterisation which leads to machining down-time, more intensive labour and generally presents a bottle neck for throughput. In order {{to establish a new}} method for on-line metrology at the nanoscale investigation are made into the use of optical fibre interferometry to realise a compact probe that is robust to environmental disturbance. Wavelength tuning is combined with a dispersive element to provide a moveable optical stylus that sweeps the surface. The phase variation caused by the surface topography is then analysed using phase shifting interferometry. A second interferometer is wavelength multiplexed into the optical circuit in order to track the inherent instability of the optical fibre. This is then countered using a closed <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> to <b>servo</b> the path lengths mechanically which additionally counters external vibration on the measurand. The overall stability is found to be limited by polarisation state evolution however. A second method is then investigated and a rapid phase shifting technique is employed in conjunction with an electro-optic phase modulator to overcome the polarisation state evolution.
