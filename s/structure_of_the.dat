5|$|In archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of {{the complex}} is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Three copies of this protein {{are present in the}} ring and are {{responsible}} for the activity {{of the complex}}. In eukaryotes, none of the RNase PH subunits have retained this catalytic activity, meaning the core ring <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human exosome has no enzymatically active protein. Despite this loss of catalytic activity, the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core exosome is highly conserved from archea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function. In eukaryotes, the absence of the phosphorolytic activity is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, which are responsible for the ribonuclease activity of the exosome in such organisms.|$|E

The barite (001) and (210) cleavage surfaces are characterized by large (> 2500 Å) domains separated by unit-cell steps (7. 15 and 3. 44 Å steps for the (001) and (210) surfaces, respectively).
