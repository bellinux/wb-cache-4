5|$|As bishop, Burnell had a wall {{built around}} the cathedral at Wells, which helped to improve the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral and its {{outlying}} buildings. He left the court each year at Lent, {{when he returned to}} his diocese and attended to its affairs. Peckham appointed Burnell to be his deputy when the archbishop went to Wales in 1282. It was probably Burnell who suggested a compromise in 1285 over the jurisdictions of the royal and ecclesiastical courts, which allowed royal officials to return cases involving only religious matters to the church courts.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the episode}} was broadcast, it was {{announced}} that Rupert Penry-Jones would leave the series after playing Adam Carter for four years, while afterwards, another announcement was made introducing a new lead character, Lucas North. Inspiration towards the plot for the episode, and the remainder of the series, came from the resurgence of Russia, which the producers felt would in subtle ways threaten the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. The episode was partially filmed on location in Moscow, the first time in series history where filming took place outside the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian {{army had}} {{proceeded}} to burn and sack the Boeotian cities {{which had not}} surrendered, Plataea and Thespiae, before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat of the Allies to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely the allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnese. The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis ended in a decisive victory for the Allies, marking {{a turning point in}} the conflict.|$|E

5|$|In May 2003, the government's {{attempt to}} legislate Article 23 (National <b>Security)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Basic Law aroused strong {{suspicion}} among Hong Kong citizens. This Article would grant Hong Kong's police force {{right of access}} to private property on grounds of 'safeguarding national security', but without court warrants. Coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003. This demonstration hastened the resignations of two government ministers and, eventually, that of Tung on 10 March 2005.|$|E
5|$|In mid-November, Allied forces {{attacked}} the Japanese at Buna-Gona in New Guinea. Japanese Combined Fleet naval leaders, headquartered at Truk {{and under the}} overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in New Guinea posed a greater threat to the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Empire than an Allied {{military presence in the}} southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in this regard.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S. On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.|$|E

It had long been a stated British aim to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and between 1922 and 1939 over 250,000 Jewish immigrants had arrived in the country. However, Arab resistance and World War II prompted the British to curtail immigration. The time also saw the rise of the Jewish Resistance Movement, which eventually came into conflict with the British authorities.|$|E

This means that the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any Octopus card without authorization.
