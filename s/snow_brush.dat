25|$|A {{representative}} of the medical examiner's office testified that DNA of Littlejohn was found on a <b>snow</b> <b>brush</b> found alongside St. Guillen's body. Hairs found on a bedspread used to wrap St. Guillen's body belonged to Littlejohn's mother. In addition, besides those of St. Guillen, hairs were also identified as coming from eight other people.|$|E
50|$|The red-tailed {{chipmunk}} feeds {{mainly on}} seeds and berries and sometimes carries these in its cheek pouches. Frequently eaten foods include {{the seeds of}} fir and pine, honeysuckle berries, cranberries, whortleberries, huckleberries, the seeds of locust trees and of <b>snow</b> <b>brush,</b> buckbrush, thistle, willow herb, grasses and many others types of seed. Dandelion flowers and leaves are sometimes eaten and the animal has been caught in traps baited with meat. It does not hibernate but it may have periods of torpor.|$|E

50|$|Unimogs can be {{equipped}} with front and rear tool mounting brackets and hydraulic connections to allow bucket loaders and hydraulic arms to be used. Most units have a power takeoff (PTO) connection to operate rotary equipment such as snow brooms, <b>snow</b> blowers, <b>brush</b> mowers, loaders or stationary conveyor belts.|$|R
50|$|Adding a hitch to {{the back}} of a zero turn mower allows use of a variety of {{different}} attachments, including a dump cart, spreader, plug aerator, lawn dethatcher, roller or sprayer. Some zero turn mowers also accommodate front-mounted attachments such as a snow blade, <b>snow</b> blower or <b>brush</b> for clearing <b>snow</b> or debris.|$|R
5000|$|The {{challenges}} of cross-country transportation {{in the winter}} led to {{the invention of the}} snowmobile, an all-terrain vehicle specifically designed for travel across deep snow where other vehicles floundered. During the 20th century, rapidly evolving designs produced machines that were two-person tracked vehicles powered by gas engines that enabled them to tow a sled or travel, initially at low-to-moderate speeds, depending on snow conditions, terrain and obstacles protruding above the <b>snow</b> like <b>brush</b> and trees. Where early designs had [...] two-stroke engines, there has been a move toward newer style 2-stroke and 4-stroke gasoline engines, some with over [...]|$|R

The first shows an {{expedition}} member <b>brushing</b> <b>snow</b> off his clothes in front of a house built from snow over the main hatchway. Two other expedition members stand nearby. The second image shows four men transferring ice for cooking into an ice house built over the ship's galley. On the back of one man's coat is a hand drawn design...|$|R
5|$|A <b>snow</b> sweeper uses <b>brushes</b> {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and <b>snow</b> blowers. These <b>brushes</b> also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the <b>brushes,</b> and most <b>snow</b> sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|R
40|$|High speed rail are {{operatives}} in {{many countries}} in the world. The technology has evolved for about 40 years now and is mastered by several worldwide companies. However, high speed rail are fairly new in Nordic countries suchas Sweden and Finland and few development has been done so far to deal with high speed rail in hard winter conditions. Japanese Shinkansen experiences snowfall and cold weather but {{nothing compared to the}} Norwegian long, cold and snowy winters over the whole country. With the possibility of building a high speed rail in Norway in the future, NSB and CargoNet realise that few technologies are published in regard of winter operations. However, after winter 2009 / 2010 overwhelming snowstorm throughout Europe, most countries started analysing the situation to avoid any major winter shortage in the future. Many problems occurred on the networks either on the rolling stock, infrastructure or operations. The goal of the thesis is to analyse the proposed winter technologies from an economical/beneficial point of view to propose the best one to the industry. Literature study provides information about the available technologies and interviews with railway industry actors confirms its efficiency in case of an existing technology and the potential success {{in the event of a}} new one. The analysis of data provided that propylene glycol de-icing was the most cost effective technology for the rolling stock and should be implemented throughout any winter railway network. It has been proven effective by the industry. Likewise, <b>snow</b> <b>brushes</b> and fences combined with improved switch heaters – with the use of cameras and sensors – will reduce manual cleaning and increase the efficiency of the entire infrastructure network. For the planning, many alternatives are available to improve the operations but two main recommendations are to be kept in mind; Communication between weather forecasting groups, infrastructure managers, trains operators, customers and authorities is primordial as well as being ready to react to any situation by having emergency plans before the undesired situation arise. </p...|$|R
5000|$|As Rouse {{contemplated}} eternity, {{he became}} fearful {{of death and}} judgement. He tried to be good, and attended Methodist Church meetings, thinking this would get him to heaven. He went to Sunday School in the Sons of Temperance Hall where he memorized whole chapters and whole books of the Bible. But still, he had no assurance of salvation. On several occasions he had close calls, where {{he was sure he}} would die. On one such occasion, in March, 1885 he had a close call while turning the horses around in the <b>snow</b> and <b>brush</b> of a wood. Fearing death, he cried out, [...] "Oh, God, I'm lost, there's no use of me trying to be good." [...] He got the wood on, and was on his way home, when he saw that, according to Romans 5:6, [...] "Christ died for the ungodly," [...] and he remembered that moment as the time where he [...] "passed from death unto life." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{progression}} {{endemic to}} the ERTS Data Use Experiment SR 124 in data quality, analysis sophistication and applications responsiveness is reviewed. The {{roles of the}} variety of ERTS products, including the supporting underflight aircraft imagery at various scales, are discussed {{in the context of this}} investigation. The versatility of interpretation techniques and outputs developed and implemented via the General Electric Multispectral Information Extraction Systems is described and exemplified by both system-expository and applications-explanatory products. The wide-ranging and in-depth applications studied in the course of this experiment can be characterized as community-oriented and agency-directed. In the former, generic category, which is primarily data-contextual, problems analyzed dealt with agricultural systems, surface water bodies, <b>snow</b> cover, <b>brush</b> fire burns, forestry, grass growth, parks - golf courses - cemeteries, dust storms, grading sites, geological features and coastal water structure. The ERTS MSS band selectivity and measurements thresholds were of primary interest here. The agency-directed application areas have been user-evaluational in nature. Beginning with overall urbanized regional analysis of land cover density-development intensity, residential areas were analyzed for ascertaining if housing types could be aggregated with any degree of reliability...|$|R
50|$|The {{barn owl}} has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This {{improves}} detection of sound position and distance {{and the bird}} does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through <b>snow,</b> grass or <b>brush</b> to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture.|$|R

50|$|The queen then consults her magic mirror again, and {{the mirror}} reveals Snow White's survival. The queen dresses as a comb seller and convinces Snow White {{to take a}} {{beautiful}} comb as a present. She <b>brushes</b> <b>Snow</b> White's hair with the poisoned comb and the girl faints again. She is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. When the mirror again indicates that Snow White still lives, the queen makes a third and final attempt on Snow White by disguising herself as a farmer's wife, and offering a poisoned apple to her. The girl is at first hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White. The girl eagerly takes a bite and falls {{into a state of}} suspended animation. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White. Assuming that she is dead, they place her in a glass casket.|$|R

He asks Big Penguin why leaves fall off trees and she {{explains}} how plants grow, how the seasons affect a plant's life, how winter {{is the time for}} many plants to take a nice long rest. In the next scene, it has begun to snow and Paz finds his flowers drooping and sprinkled with the falling <b>snow.</b> He gently <b>brushes</b> away the <b>snow,</b> makes little umbrellas to protect them from the snow... But Big Penguin finds Paz crying because his flowers have lost their petals and he doesn't know how to fix them. Big Penguin helps him understand that his flowers need to rest over the winter, and in the spring all the plants in the garden will start growing again. Paz feels happy and sad at the same time, and saves some of the petals from his flowers so he can think about them all winter long.|$|R
