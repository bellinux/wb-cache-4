5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a <b>stream</b> <b>bed.</b> An Australian sapper checking the <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E
5|$|The two battalions of the 27th Infantry {{went into}} a {{perimeter}} defense {{just north of the}} village of Soi-ri. The 1st Battalion, on the left of the road, took a position with C Company on high ground in front, and with A Company on a ridge behind it. On their right, B Company was placed parallel to A Company, and carried the line across the stream and the narrow valley to the road. There the 2nd Battalion took up the defense line with E Company on the road and F Company on its right, while G Company held a ridge behind F Company. Thus, the two battalions presented a four-company front, with one company holding a refused flank position on either side. A platoon of tanks took positions on the front line, two tanks on the road and two in the <b>stream</b> <b>bed,</b> with four more tanks in reserve. The artillery went into firing positions behind the force. Six bazooka teams took up positions in front of the infantry positions along the road and in the <b>stream</b> <b>bed.</b> At the same time, the ROK 1st Division remained in control of the high ground {{on either side of the}} 27th Infantry positions.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of European {{settlement}} the river was a summertime chain of waterholes bounded by large gum trees. Flowing through {{the area where the}} city of Adelaide is sited the river was sometimes invisible beneath its gravel <b>stream</b> <b>bed.</b> It frequently flooded in winter and did not reach the sea, instead ending at coastal dunes where its waters created a vast but shallow freshwater wetlands. These wetlands, known as The Reedbeds after the dominant vegetation, occupied a large area of the western Adelaide Plains and were also fed by other waterways. The river only flowed to the sea through the Port River, Barker Inlet, and Patawalonga River following heavy rain.Try: http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au/Caring_for_Water_Seas/Creeks_Rivers/River_Torrens.aspx Retrieved on 9 September 2009.|$|E
5|$|Geologists and the {{official}} Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend {{in a series of}} small steps. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is gray sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool. Brown's book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types to classify waterfalls: falls, cascade, slide, and chute.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of urban runoff is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called ephemeral streams). When an area around such a stream is urbanized, the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round streamflow that hurts the vegetation, wildlife and <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> of the waterway. Containing little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, urban runoff rushes down the stream channel, ruining natural features such as meanders and sandbars, and creates severe erosionâ€”increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely incising the <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> upstream. As an example, on many Southern California beaches {{at the mouth of}} a waterway, urban runoff carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and other wastes, and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.|$|E

25|$|The {{water in}} a river is usually in a channel, {{made up of a}} <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> between banks. In larger rivers there is also a wider {{floodplain}} shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation {{to the size of the}} river channel. Rivers are a part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of water stored in glaciers and snowpacks.|$|E

50|$|Beds {{are usually}} {{what would be}} left once a stream {{is no longer in}} existence; the beds are usually well {{preserved}} even if they get buried, because the walls and canyons made by the stream usually have hard walls, usually soft sand and debris fill the <b>bed.</b> Dry <b>stream</b> <b>beds</b> are also subject to becoming underground water pockets (buried <b>stream</b> <b>beds</b> only) and flooding by heavy rains and water rising from the ground and may sometimes be part of the rejuvenation of the stream.|$|R
25|$|Flash floods are {{the most}} common flood type in normally-dry {{channels}} in arid zones, known as arroyos in the southwest United States and many other names elsewhere. In that setting, the first flood water to arrive is depleted as it wets the sandy <b>stream</b> <b>bed.</b> The leading edge of the flood thus advances more slowly than later and higher flows. As a result, the rising limb of the hydrograph becomes ever quicker as the flood moves downstream, until the flow rate is so great that the depletion by wetting soil becomes insignificant.|$|E
25|$|Formed by glacial meltwater, the Carbon River {{contains}} {{a heavy load}} of sediment such as silt and gravel. After emerging from the Carbon Glacier the Carbon River flows through a broad glacier-carved valley where thick sediment deposits in the <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> create sand and gravel bars causing the river to become complexly braided, meandering, and flood-prone. The river frequently shifts channels and creates new ones in its valley. Between Fairfax and Carbonado the Carbon River flows through a narrow gorge (right) before emerging into another broad flood-prone valley near Crocker and Orting.|$|E
25|$|To be effective, however, a culvert fence must be {{surrounded}} by enough water that the beavers will need to dam the entire fence perimeter. In areas where the <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> is narrow rather than wide, the fence must be narrow {{so that it is}} surrounded by water. Being narrow loses one advantage of the trapezoidal shape, but it can still deter beavers from damming the culvert. Since beavers are excellent diggers, a fence floor is usually needed to prevent beaver tunneling under the fence. The fence walls need to be only 24inches above the water line since beavers do not climb.|$|E

25|$|The {{restoration}} of Queiq River is directed towards {{the revival of}} the flow of the river, demolishing both the artificial cover of the <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> and the reinforcement of the stream banks along the river in the city centre. The flow of the river was blocked during the 1960s by the Turks, turning the river into a tiny sewage channel, something that led the authorities to cover the stream during the 1970s. In 2006 the flow of pure water was restored through the efforts of the Syrian government, granting a new life to the Quweiq River.|$|E
25|$|Despite its name, the Arroyo Seco {{generally}} has {{a flow of}} several cubic feet per second, but periodically it is inundated by torrential floods from its steep, erosion-prone mountain watershed.

Historically, these floods would race down the <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> and overflow through Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra and Los Angeles communities {{all the way to the}} Los Angeles River. As Los Angeles developed into a city and grew outwards, the damage from these floods was particularly severe in 1914 and 1916.|$|E
25|$|In June 2003, the Scouts {{agreed to}} install a fish ladder, modify the dam's spillway, educate Scouts at camp about {{threatened}} species, and enhance the <b>stream</b> <b>bed</b> habitat for fish.

The fish ladder is a unique design that allows the fish to swim upstream or downstream when the flashboards are installed. The design had not {{been used in the}} United States beforehand. It was designed by Swanson Hydrology + Geomorphology and built by Don Chapin Company. The fish ladders significantly improved fish passage.|$|E
40|$|Subglacial bedforms {{provide an}} {{important}} {{insight into the}} nature of the processes operating at the ice-bed interface. In particular, the well-established link between mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) and ice streams allows for indirect examination of the processes controlling the flow of ice streams, using observations of the morphology of features from palaeo-ice <b>stream</b> <b>beds.</b> Determining whether the existing theories of MSGL formation, in particular the groove-ploughing theory, can produce landforms with the morphology observed from palaeo-ice <b>stream</b> <b>beds,</b> is likely to {{have a significant impact on}} the understanding of the mechanisms that control the flow of ice streams. A number of theories for MSGL formation have been proposed in the literature. There have, however, been relatively few attempts to falsify these theories. This is partially due to the limited amount of observational data, regarding MSGL morphology and internal composition. In particular, the groove-ploughing theory for MSGL formation provides a number of predictions which can be tested by examining the morphology of lineation populations. This work constitutes the first extensive test of the groove-ploughing theory, using a large dataset of MSGL morphology from a number of different palaeo-ice <b>stream</b> <b>beds.</b> The objective of this work is to digitise a large sample of lineations, from three different palaeo-ice <b>stream</b> <b>beds,</b> in order to test the predictions of the groove-ploughing theory. It is necessary to identify the specific predictions that can realistically be tested using lineation morphology, and to devise measures that provide quantifiable tests of these predictions. Using the measures devised to test these predictions, along with close qualitative observation of other features of the palaeo-ice <b>stream</b> <b>beds</b> studied, it is found that the morphology of the lineations studied do not generally conform to the predictions of the groove-ploughing theory. ...|$|R
