40|$|Abstract. The {{ultrasonic}} {{nondestructive testing}} using a conventional inspection method {{with a single}} transducer consumes large inspection time and {{requires a lot of}} man power for controlling. Phased array techniques are famous for their inspection at shorter inspection time, electronic control, their real-time applicability and sensitivity to axial and lateral resolution. These ultrasonic phased array transducers are modelled using the numerical tool called elastodynamic finite integration technique (EFIT). A 64 element phased array transducer with different operating frequencies is modelled to perform ultrasonic inspection of a <b>steel</b> <b>slab</b> immersed in water. An ultrasonic pressure wave is injected into the water with a steering angle of 18 ° and by mode-conversion transmits a shear wave into the <b>steel</b> <b>slab</b> with approximately 42 °. A <b>steel</b> <b>slab</b> with internal notches with different depths has been simulated. A-scans are recorded for each particular element of the phased array transducer which forms a so-called parallel B-scan obtained with a single pulse-echo experiment. From the parallel B-scan a compressed A-scan is computed by averaging the A-scans in the parallel B-scan along the aperture coordinate of the phased array transducer. Modelling results are compared against measurements for selected cases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{hot rolling}} process, the <b>steel</b> <b>slab</b> may {{experience}} a temperature gradient along its transverse direction which may cause camber and wedge after rolling. Camber and wedge phenomenon {{will affect the}} quality of the steel plate. To eliminate camber and wedge phenomenon, a pair of side guides is placed before and behind the hot rolling mill. The position mode and the force mode are the control modes for side guides to correct the slab shape and to guide the slab to follow rolling direction. Finite element analysis using ABAQUS was applied to simulate hot rolling process to find the correction mechanism of rolling equipment. The centerline of slab was traced and the shape of slab was predicted. The difference of rolling load between work side and drive side of roller was determined. Furthermore, the load, stress and velocity distribution on the slab at roll bite were analyzed. By using numerical model, hot rolling parameters including side guide control strategy can be predicted, which can provide the hot rolling line as a guideline {{to improve the quality of}} the <b>steel</b> <b>slab...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{initial stages}} of {{solidification}} near the meniscus during continuous casting of <b>steel</b> <b>slabs</b> involve many complex inter-related transient phenomena, which cause periodic oscillation marks (OMs), subsurface hooks, and related surface defects. This article presents a detailed mechanism {{for the formation of}} curved hooks and their associated OMs, based on a careful analysis of numerous specially etched samples from ultra-low-carbon <b>steel</b> <b>slabs</b> combined with previous measurements, observations, and theoretical modeling results. It is demonstrated that hooks form by solidification and dendritic growth at the liquid meniscus during the negative strip time. Oscillation marks form when molten steel overflows over the curved hook and solidifies by nucleation of undercooled liquid. The mechanism has been justified by its explanation of several plant observations, including the variability of hook and OM characteristics under different casting conditions, and the relationships with mold powder consumption and negative/positive strip times. I...|$|R
40|$|Subsurface hook {{formation}} during initial solidification in {{the continuous}} casting mould degrades {{the quality of}} <b>steel</b> <b>slabs</b> owing to the associated entrapment of argon bubbles and non-metallic inclusions. To minimise hook depth and to improve slab quality, extensive plant experiments were performed and analysed to quantify the effect of casting parameters on hook characteristics using the no. 2 - 1 caster at POSCO Gwangyang Works, Korea. The results reveal that meniscus heat flux {{plays an important role}} in controlling hook characteristics. Hook depth correlates with oscillation mark depth, hook shell thickness, and hook length. Based on regression analysis, this paper proposes an equation to predict hook depth in ultra-low-carbon steels as a function of casting speed, superheat, oscillation frequency, surface level fluctuations, and mould flux properties. Use of this quantitative equation enables improved control of subsurface quality in the continuous casting of <b>steel</b> <b>slabs...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a new {{approach}} to measuring and evaluating the chemical micro-heterogeneity of the elements in solidified poly-component metallic systems. The original approach is based on experimental measurements made on the samples taken from characteristic places in a casting and the subsequent application of an original mathematical model for determining the element-distribution profile, characterizing the most probable distribution of an element concentration in the frame of a dendrite, and an original mathematical model for determining the effective partition coefficients of these elements {{in the structure of the}} analyzed alloy. The paper also describes an application of this method in the research of the chemical heterogeneity on a cross-section of a CC <b>steel</b> <b>slab</b> and presents the selected results (indices of the heterogeneity and effective partition coefficients of seven analyzed elements) characterizing the chemical micro-heterogeneity on one-half of the cross-section of this CC <b>steel</b> <b>slab.</b> The following main results were obtained: (i) the dendritic heterogeneity of the accompanying elements and impurities is comparatively high; (ii) all the analyzed elements segregate during the solidification into an inter-dendritic melt, and their partition coefficient is smaller than one; (iii) the effective partition coefficients calculated in this new way inherently include both the effect of segregation in the course of an alloy solidification, and the effect of th...|$|E

The experimental results show that many reactions would happen among {{the components of the}} coating and then many microspheres with the size of 80 - 100 nm generated in the system.
