5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E

Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E

25|$|The Irish {{physician}} and inventor, William Reid Clanny, {{who had moved}} to nearby Sunderland, introduced Jane to Sir Robert Peat, a sycophantic chaplain of the Prince Regent. Peat {{was said to be}} supportive of a match with Jane to use her relationship (albeit distant) to the prince's unofficial wife, to further advance himself in royal favour and also to repay his gambling debts. Jane was taken {{with the idea of a}} title if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> marry Peat, but was afraid to put her wealth at the disposal of a husband. When Sir Robert proposed to Jane, he was heard to have said that she would never marry as long as Herrington House still stood.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds and levels of loss in Albee’s play A Delicate Balance. Most obvious {{is the loss of}} balance that has been precariously maintained by Agnes, the main character in the play and mistress of the house in which the play takes place. Agnes begins the play musing about sanity, a condition, at least in Agnes’s mind, that can easily be lost. Agnes wonders what would happen if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> lose her sense of the rational. Who would take care of things? The way in which Agnes maintains the delicate balance in her home, as well as the delicate balance of her sanity, is to lose contact with her own emotional reality. She also tries to convince everyone else to suppress his or her emotions. Agnes believes that by saying that the emotions are gone, circumstances will return to some condition that resembles normalcy.|$|E

25|$|As {{the race}} {{continued}} to Pennsylvania, Indiana, and North Carolina, many observers concluded that Clinton had little chance to overcome Obama's lead in pledged delegates. Even if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> succeed {{in changing the}} dynamics of the race, there would not be enough pledged delegates remaining for her to catch up under most realistic scenarios. Some analysts believed Clinton could still win the nomination by raising doubts about Obama's electability, fighting for Michigan and Florida delegates to be seated at the convention, and convincing superdelegates to support her despite her expected loss in the pledged delegate vote. However, the window of opportunity for re-votes in Michigan and Florida appeared to close in late March, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, said that it would be harmful to the party if superdelegates were to overturn the result of the pledged delegate vote.|$|E
25|$|Following her {{retirement}} from the Navy, {{she was hired}} as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Hopper was initially offered the job position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on applying for the position at Digital Equipment Corporation, and going through the typical formal interview process. She also sent a letter to Yavinsky's boss explaining that she would be available on alternating Thursdays, receiving a high salary, and have access to an unlimited expense account if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer. After the proposal from Hopper, she {{was hired as a}} full-time senior consultant. As part of her position, she would report to Yavinsky.

She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.|$|E
25|$|A {{person who}} has ceased to hold {{the office of a}} judge may be {{appointed}} as Chief Justice or may sit as a judge of the High Court or a Judge of Appeal for a designated period as directed by the President if he concurs in his personal discretion with the Prime Minister's advice on the matter. In addition, to facilitate the disposal of business in the Supreme Court, judicial commissioners may be appointed for limited periods, including the hearing of a single case only. This is generally done to clear a backlog of cases, or to test a judicial commissioner's suitability for appointment as a judge. Although judicial commissioners do not enjoy security of tenure, they have the same powers and enjoy the same immunities as Supreme Court judges. It has been suggested that the risk that such judges may not act independently is mitigated by public scrutiny of judicial decisions {{and the fact that it}} is to the judge's advantage, for future appointment, if he or <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> act independently in accordance with the law. Also, issues of independence will not usually arise as most of the disputes adjudicated by judicial commissioners will not involve the other arms of government.|$|E

25|$|Deianira feared {{she would}} lose Heracles {{to the younger}} and more {{beautiful}} Iole. Years earlier, the centaur Nessus had ferried her across the river Evenus and attempted to rape her when {{they were on the}} other side. Heracles saved her from Nessus by shooting him with poisoned arrows. She had kept some of Nessus' blood for the centaur told her in his dying breath that if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> give Heracles a cloak (chiton) soaked in his blood, it would be a love charm. Deianira, being concerned by Heracles' infidelity, believed Nessus’ lie that Heracles would no longer desire any other woman after he was under the spell of the love philter. This seemed like the perfect solution to her problem to reclaim her husband's love from him Iole, the foreign concubine. The cloak was delivered to Heracles and when he put it on the poison went into his body. Deianira had unwittingly poisoned her husband with this purported love potion because of her sadness over her husband's unfaithfulness. Upon realizing the mistake she had made, Deianira then killed herself. Because of his love for his concubine Iole, Heracles asked his eldest son, Hyllus to marry her so that she would be well taken care of. Iole and Hyllus had a son called Cleodaeus, and also three daughters, Evaechme, Aristaechme, and Hyllis.|$|E
