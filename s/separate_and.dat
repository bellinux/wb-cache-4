5|$|Beginning {{with the}} Centennial of Confederation in 1967, Canada, {{followed}} in 1975 by Australia and New Zealand, {{developed their own}} national honours systems, <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> independent of the British or Imperial honours system. As each country's system evolved, operational gallantry awards were developed with the premier award of each system—the Victoria Cross for Australia, the Canadian Victoria Cross and the Victoria Cross for New Zealand—being created and named in honour of the Victoria Cross. These are unique awards of each honours system, recommended, assessed, gazetted and presented by each country.|$|E

5|$|Born in Budapest, Szabó {{is the son}} of Mária (née Vita) and István Szabó, {{the latter}} of whom was a doctor {{from a long line of}} doctors. Szabó came from a family of Jews who had {{converted}} to Catholicism, but were considered Jews by the Arrow Cross Party (Hungarian Nazis). They were forced to <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> hide in Budapest sometime between October 1944, when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary and installed the Arrow Cross in power, and February 1945, when the Soviets defeated the German Army in Budapest.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> to coordinate their activities with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E
5|$|By {{signing the}} Treaty of Utrecht, King Louis XIV of France {{recognised}} the Hanoverian succession in Britain. Nevertheless, gossip that Anne and her ministers favoured {{the succession of}} her half-brother rather than the Hanoverians continued, despite Anne's denials in public and in private. The rumours were fed by her consistent refusals to permit any of the Hanoverians to visit or move to England, and by the intrigues of Harley and the Tory Secretary of State Lord Bolingbroke, who were in <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> secret discussions with her half-brother about a possible Stuart restoration until early 1714.|$|E

5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter did not like mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, they realized that the two entities were <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> stood on their own.|$|E
5|$|George VI {{gave his}} elder brother {{the title of}} Duke of Windsor with the style His Royal Highness on 12 December 1936. On 3 May the {{following}} year, the Simpsons' divorce was made final. The case was handled quietly and it barely featured in some newspapers. The Times printed a single sentence below a <b>separate,</b> <b>and</b> seemingly unconnected, report announcing the Duke's departure from Austria.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this {{is the belief that}} all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised to build up the church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).|$|E

5|$|In the laboratory, the {{strength}} of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting temperature (also called Tm value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} forms of {{assimilation}} are still at work today. For example, when a central authority nationalizes one language, that attaches economic and social advantages to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> distinct ethnic group.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is <b>separate,</b> <b>and</b> canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E

5|$|Richard Bonnie, a {{professor}} of law and medicine at the University of Virginia School of Law, mentioned the deformed nature of the Soviet psychiatric profession as one of the explanations for why it was so easily bent toward the repressive objectives of the state, and pointed out the importance of a civil society and, in particular, independent professional organizations <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> apart from the state {{as one of the most}} substantial lessons from the period.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} the Governor's attack, a deadly flu kills many of the {{population}} at the prison. The Governor finds his former right-hand men and kills them, taking over their group and destroys the prison. Rick's group are forced to <b>separate</b> <b>and</b> flee, but not before Hershel and the Governor are killed. The survivors divide, face their own trials and meet new faces before finding signs pointing to a safe haven called Terminus. One by one, they reunite at Terminus, but all the group are captured for some unknown purpose.|$|E
5|$|Some poison dart frogs species {{include a}} number of conspecific color morphs that emerged as {{recently}} as 6,000 years ago. Therefore, species such as Dendrobates tinctorius, Oophaga pumilio, and Oophaga granulifera can include color pattern morphs that can be interbred (colors are under polygenic control, while the actual patterns are probably controlled by a single locus). Differing coloration has historically misidentified single species as <b>separate,</b> <b>and</b> there is still controversy among taxonomists over classification.|$|E
