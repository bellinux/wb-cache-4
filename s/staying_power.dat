The calibre and weight of secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the <b>staying</b> <b>power</b> of the destroyers expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and <b>staying</b> <b>power</b> in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread {{of the life of}} one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid {{in the minds of many}} citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E
5|$|By 1911 Germany {{had built}} battlecruisers of her own, and {{the superiority of}} the British ships could no longer be assured. Moreover, the German Navy did not share Fisher's view of the battlecruiser. In {{contrast}} to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany progressively improved the armour and <b>staying</b> <b>power</b> of their ships to better the British battlecruisers. Von der Tann, begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns, but with 11.1-inch (283mm) armour she was far better protected than the Invincibles. The two s were quite similar but carried ten 11.1-inch guns of an improved design. , designed in 1909 and finished in 1913, was a modified Moltke; speed increased by one knot to , while her armour had a maximum thickness of 12 inches, equivalent to the s of a few years earlier.

25|$|Rather than {{a planned}} action, the {{resistance}} movement was a spontaneous reaction {{in response to}} the wave of terror initiated by the authorities after the seizure of power in early 1948.

25|$|With Admiral Hugo von Pohl {{becoming}} mortally-ill and Admiral Reinhard Scheer taking {{command of}} the German High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916, the Germans began {{to take a more}} offensive strategy in the North Sea. Hitherto the German fleet had spared the army the burden of coast defence and encouraged the neutrality of the Netherlands and Scandinavia. The British blockade of Germany was causing hunger and the Germans lacked the <b>staying</b> <b>power</b> of the British and Scheer desired to find some means to counter British sea power. The High Seas Fleet could only prevail against the Grand Fleet in exceptional circumstances, which Jellicoe would never allow but Scheer thought that he could make the British war-weary and German raids in the North Sea became more frequent. On 9 February, the Admiralty warned the Grand Fleet that the Germans were stirring and the fleet was ordered south, the cruisers of Harwich Force being ordered to sail for Texel. A few hours later the alert was cancelled but next day, it was discovered that a force of light cruisers and destroyers had sailed westwards from the Jade river.|$|E
