5|$|Steam's {{primary service}} {{is to allow}} its users to {{download}} games and other software {{that they have in}} their virtual software libraries to their local computers as game cache files (GCFs). Initially, Valve was required to be the publisher for these titles since they had sole access to the Steam's database and engine, but with the introduction of the Steamworks <b>software</b> <b>development</b> <b>kit</b> (SDK) in May 2008, anyone could potentially become a publisher to Steam, outside of Valve's involvement to curate titles on the service.|$|E
5|$|The Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition, {{which was}} {{released}} on May 8, 2001, contains the latest game updates and a <b>software</b> <b>development</b> <b>kit,</b> a separate soundtrack CD and a page from a fictional newspaper featured prominently in Deus Ex titled The Midnight Sun, which recounts recent events in the game's world.

5|$|Adoption of Snapdragon {{contributed to}} Qualcomm's {{transition}} from a wireless modem company to one that also produces {{a wider range of}} hardware and software for mobile devices. In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon <b>software</b> <b>development</b> <b>kit</b> (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products. It also collaborated with Microsoft to optimize Windows Phone 8 for Snapdragon semiconductors.|$|E

5|$|From {{its release}} in 1998, Half-Life saw fervent support from {{independent}} game developers, due {{in no small}} part to support and encouragement from Valve Software. Worldcraft, the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software. Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a retail product, but these plans never materialized. Valve also released a <b>software</b> <b>development</b> <b>kit,</b> enabling developers to modify the game and create mods. Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the version 1.1.0.0 patch. Many supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and rival level editors like the multiple engine editor QuArK) were either created or updated to work with Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Several {{features}} and accessories were {{developed for the}} WonderSwan. The WonderWitch is an official <b>software</b> <b>development</b> <b>kit</b> aimed at amateur programmers that was released by Qute Corporation. It sold {{at a cost of}} ¥11,800 and allows for games to be developed in the C programming language. An adapter was created to connect headphones to the handheld, as the WonderSwan lacks a headphone port. A remote-controlled robot known as the WonderBorg can be operated through the unit. In addition, the handheld can be connected to a PocketStation, a memory card peripheral for the PlayStation console, through a device known as the WonderWave. The WonderSwan and its later models were also capable of connecting to the internet via a mobile phone network.|$|E
