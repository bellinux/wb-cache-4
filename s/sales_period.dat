40|$|This {{research}} discusses mathematical {{models of}} joint {{economic lot size}} optimization in a supplier-buyer inventory system in a situation when the supplier offers decremental temporary discounts during a <b>sale</b> <b>period.</b> Here, the <b>sale</b> <b>period</b> consists of n phases and the phases of discounts offered descend {{as much as the}} number of phases. The highest discount will be given when orders are placed in the first phase while the lowest one will be given when they are placed in the last phase. In this situation, the supplier attempts to attract the buyer to place orders as early as possible during the <b>sale</b> <b>period.</b> The buyers will respon these offers by ordering a special quantity in one of the phase. In this paper, we propose such a forward buying model with discount-proportionally-distributed time phases. To examine the behaviour of the proposed model, we conducted numerical experiments. We assumed that there are three phases of discounts during the <b>sale</b> <b>period.</b> We then compared the total joint costs of special order placed in each phase for two scenarios. The first scenario is the case of independent situation – there is no coordination between the buyer and the supplie-, while the second scenario is the opposite one, the coordinated model. Our results showed the coordinated model outperform the independent model in terms of producing total joint costs. We finally conducted a sensitivity analyzis to examine the other behaviour of the proposed model...|$|R

25|$|Each February, Tim Hortons holds a {{marketing}} campaign called Roll Up the Rim to Win. As of 2007, over 31 million prizes were distributed each year, including vehicles, televisions, and store products. Customers {{determine if they}} have won prizes by unrolling the rim on their paper cups when they have finished their drink, revealing the result underneath. Prizes are not distributed randomly country-wide; each of the company's distribution regions has distinct prize-winning odds. The idea for the campaign began in 1985 when Roger Wilson of one of Tim Hortons' supplier of cups, Lily Cup company, approached Tim Hortons with a new idea to increase their sales. Wilson explained his company had created a new cup design that allowed a message to be printed under the rim; the cup type cost {{no more than the}} current one and could enable a promotion, like a contest. Recognizing the opportunity to promote coffee in the normally weak <b>sales</b> <b>period</b> in the spring, the Roll Up the Rim to Win campaign was first held in 1986 when the biggest prize was a snackbox of Timbits. In 2008, over 88% of major prizes were redeemed.|$|E

Billboard reported that the song sold more than [...] "Writing's on the Wall" [...] by Sam Smith, the latter having won the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

500|$|In {{the fourth}} week of November – {{well into the}} lucrative Christmas <b>sales</b> <b>period</b> and close to {{four months after the}} concerts – Harrison voiced his {{frustration}} at the stalemate with Capitol on ABC's late-night chat show, The Dick Cavett Show. Harrison was on the program to promote the Raga documentary with Shankar, but after making a surprise guest performance with Gary Wright's new band Wonderwheel, he launched into a complaint about his US record company's interference and threatened to take the whole album package to Columbia. With the outburst attracting unfavourable attention in the press, where Capitol were viewed as [...] "profiteering on the backs of famine victims", the company eventually backed down and agreed to release the album on Harrison's terms. Of all the labels involved, only Columbia would make any money from The Concert for Bangladesh – 25 cents on every copy sold. Although none of these royalties went to the artist, Dylan and his record company were already benefiting from the exposure provided by the Bangladesh concerts, through the timely release of Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II. Of the other featured artists at the Concert for Bangladesh, the careers of both Preston (A Records) and Russell (Shelter) likewise prospered {{as a result of their}} participation, but their record companies imposed no such conditions on Apple and Capitol. In January 1972, Melody Makers Richard Williams remarked in his Concert for Bangladesh album review: [...] "Between them, Capitol and CBS have proved that, when it comes to awareness and enlightenment, the business is still several years behind the musicians." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{perishable}} product’s {{dynamic pricing}} with quantity discount strategy is studied. The seller uses two-period dynamic price {{during the whole}} <b>sale</b> <b>period</b> and introduces quantity discount in second <b>sale</b> <b>period</b> {{in order to improve}} the seller’s profit. The mathematic model expressions are obtained by assuming that consumer’s reservation price draws from a uniform distribution and the price discount is the linear function of the consumer’s proportion that purchased two units product in the second period. The models provide insights about optimal price and price discount under different levels of the number of the potential consumers, salvage value, reservation price. Finally, Matlab is used to implement the numerical studies and sensitivity tests. We find that the seller’s profit increases effectively after using quantity discount strategy through raising the two-period price and lowering the remaining inventory. The effectiveness of the quantity discount depends heavily on the number of potential consumers, the product’s salvage value, the difference between highest and lowest reservation price...|$|R
