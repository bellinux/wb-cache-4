5|$|The south London <b>shipbroker</b> William Richards {{contracted}} Prince of Wales in 1787 for the First Fleet voyage. Richards selected {{her after}} consultation with Royal Marine officers Watkin Tench and David Collins. Both officers would sail with the Fleet to Australia, Tench as a captain of marines, and Collins as judge-advocate {{for the new}} colony. She was the second-smallest of the First Fleet transports after Friendship, and the last to be contracted to join the voyage.|$|E
5|$|A Welsh <b>shipbroker,</b> W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E
25|$|The Sunderland Echo was {{launched}} {{with an initial}} investment of £3,500, raised by donations of £500 each from Storey and his business partners. Those joining the venture were: Quaker banker Edward Backhouse, <b>shipbroker</b> and MP Edward Temperley Gourley, shipbuilder and MP Charles Palmer, newspaper editor Richard Ruddock, rope-maker Thomas Glaholm and draper Thomas Scott Turnbull. Only Ruddock, however, had any knowledge of newspapers and the money was quickly used up.|$|E

40|$|The {{project had}} the {{following}} objectives: • Establish {{the major issues}} that shipbroking must address in order to survive. • Prioritise those issues. • Decide how <b>shipbrokers</b> can tackle each issue. • Suggest ways in which <b>shipbrokers</b> can develop and survive. The scope {{of the project was}} limited to the major issues that <b>shipbrokers</b> could control, minor issues and issues beyond the control of <b>shipbrokers</b> were not addressed. Chapter one, the introduction, explains the project in outline. The identification of the main issues and possible solutions was to be achieved in two ways; firstly by the literature review and secondly by a survey of the users of shipbroking services. Chapter two contains the literature review, a summary of all previously published work on the subject. Chapter three details the development of the questionnaire. Chapter four contains the questionnaire results and analysis. Chapter five then discusses and interprets the questionnaire results and considers their significance and relationship to other previously published work. Chapter six contains the conclusions which follow in order of priority: 1. <b>Shipbrokers</b> should provide value added services, for example research and consultancy. 2. Diversification into directly complementary business areas is recommended. 3. <b>Shipbrokers</b> should continue to invest in Information Technology in order to maintain a competitive edge. 4. Freight derivatives should be offered to clients, particularly dry cargo and tanker Forward Freight Agreements (FFAs). 5. The correct geographical location mix is important. 6. There is no need for brokers to offer access to all markets. Brokers should only remain in markets in which they are strong. 7. Some form of compulsory shipbroking qualification should be considered. 8. Brokers should obtain ISO certification. It is hoped that these constructive suggestions will be of assistance to <b>shipbrokers</b> in their efforts to develop and survive in the next millennium...|$|R

The nucleus of the team {{remained}} the same as the Championship winning sides of 1906 and 1909, with the core of the side increasingly becoming professionals who had developed in the county's Tonbridge Nursery. When Dillon, a <b>shipbroker</b> whose profession sometimes kept him away from cricket, was unable to play, former club captain Jack Mason generally led the side.|$|E
25|$|Jack Buckland {{was born}} in 1864 in Sydney, the eldest child of William Wilberforce Buckland and Harriet Emmeline Hopkins. His mother {{was born in}} Sydney in 1842, the {{daughter}} of John Hopkins, a ship chandler who {{died when she was}} young. Her father's business partner, John Carr, and his wife Eliza later adopted Harriet in addition to the ship chandler business. Buckland's father was from Wraysbury in England, the son of an auctioneer, William Thomas Buckland. Buckland's father worked as a merchant and <b>shipbroker</b> in Australia and in 1863 married the 21-year-old Harriet Hopkins in Sydney. Buckland was their first child, born in 1864. When he was 9, Buckland's family returned to England, leaving him with the now elderly John and Eliza Carr who adopted him as their son. John Carr was therefore Buckland's stepfather as well as step-grandfather.|$|E

500|$|The Sunderland Echo was {{launched}} {{with an initial}} investment of £3,500, raised by donations of £500 each from Storey and his business partners. Those joining the venture were Quaker banker Edward Backhouse, <b>shipbroker</b> and MP Edward Temperley Gourley, shipbuilder and MP Sir Charles Palmer, newspaper editor Richard Ruddock, rope-maker Thomas Glaholm and draper Thomas Scott Turnbull. Lack of experience—only Ruddock had previous knowledge of newspaper management—and over-optimistic estimates of costs meant that the initial funds were quickly exhausted. Storey later admitted: [...] "In our childlike, simple ways, we thought this might be sufficient, but {{in a few months}} all the money was gone, so we paid in another £3,500 and that soon went too." [...] As the prospect of any great financial success receded, Ruddock, Gourley and Palmer withdrew from the project. Storey, however, remained dedicated to the idea, and took on their shares. A further £7,000 in investment from Storey enabled the remaining partners to abandon the [...] "wheezing flat-bed press" [...] and, in July 1876, the Echo moved to new premises at 14Bridge Street, Sunderland.|$|E

2500|$|In 1894, aged nineteen, Agnes Mowinckel {{travelled}} to Kristiana to take {{classes in}} drawing at Den kgl. Tegneskole. In Kristiania she befriended Laura Gundersen, the leading actress at Christiania Theatre at the time. She visited {{her and her}} husband Sigvard Gundersen's home several days a week, and helped with the study of plays. Mowinckel's friend from Bergen, Hans Blehr, was also in Kristiania. Together with him she visited the cafés of the city, joining the circle of artists, many of whom later came to be part of her social network. Having spent one year in Kristiania, Mowinckel returned to Bergen. Back in Bergen she worked as a teacher at a girls' school; she also took lessons with instructor Ludovica Levy at Den Nationale Scene. She made her stage début at Den Nationale Scene on 2 January 1899, as [...] "Anna Hielm" [...] in Heiberg's play Kong Midas. Her second début was as [...] "Hjørdis" [...] in Ibsen's Hærmendene paa Helgeland. She was offered a position at Den Nationale Scene in Bergen, but chose to join Ludovica Levy at her Sekondteater in Kristiania. At Sekondteatret's first performance in August 1899 she played the character [...] "Mary Stuart" [...] in Schiller's play of the same name. In October she played [...] "Anna Hielm" [...] in Kong Midas in Kristiania. In October 1899, Mowinckel married Hans Blehr, a <b>shipbroker</b> a few months her senior. She bore him two children: Hans (born in June 1900) and Karen Lisbeth (born in October 1901). Blehr's house at Lysaker, a large house with several servants, became a meeting place for painters and writers, with Mowinckel-Blehr as hostess. Among her friends were the writers Sigurd Bødtker, Sven Elvestad, Olaf Bull, Nils Kjær and Nils Collett Vogt, and the painters Christian and Oda Krohg. Her first appearance at Nationaltheatret was in 1902, in a few performances when she replaced Ragna Wettergreen in the title role in Ibsen's Fru Inger til Østeraad.|$|E
