40|$|Abstract – Soft {{errors are}} caused by cosmic rays {{striking}} sensitive regions in electronic devices. Termed as single event upset (SEU), in the past this phenomenon mostly affected the high altitude systems or avionics. The small geometries of today’s nanodevices and their use in high-density and high-complexity designs make electronic systems sensitive even to the ground-level radiation. Therefore, large computer systems like workstations or computer web servers have become major victims of single event upsets. Given {{that the idea of}} cloud computing is an unavoidable trend for the next generation internet, which might involve almost every company in the IT industry, the urgency and criticality of the reliability rise higher then ever. This paper illustrates how soft errors are a reliability concern for computer servers. The soft error reduction techniques that are significant for the IT industry are summarized and a possible soft error rate (SER) reduction method that considers the cosmic ray <b>striking</b> <b>angle</b> to redesign the circuit board layout is proposed.

The Groom and Bailey (GB) decomposition (Groom and Bailey 1989) has been conventionally applied to the MT data to eliminate unwanted effects caused by near-surface galvanic distortions. The GB decomposition partly solves the distortion problem by separating the effects into determinable (shear and twist) and indeterminable parts (site gain and anisotropy) and removes the determinable part to allow the calculation of geoelectric <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> (Groom and Bailey 1989). A statistically extended form of the GB decomposition method was implemented that can separately treat frequencies, sites, and profiles (McNeice and Jones 2001). With respect to the AMT dataset, the multisite–multifrequency approach yielded an average geoelectric <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> of ~N 69 °E. For this approach, data corresponding to frequencies > 2500  Hz were identified as irrelevant for {{the determination of the}} geoelectric strike direction at seismogenic fault depths and thus excluded from the analysis of <b>strike</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R

40|$|Yield line {{analysis}} {{is a useful}} method for design of reinforced concrete slabs, but has been limited to slabs of simple geometry, because up to now {{there has been no}} generally applicable and fully automatic computational procedure for complex-shaped slabs. Herein, a new yield line method that can be applied to any convex polygonal-shaped slab is developed. In this method, the deflections of the slab regions divided by yield lines are measured in terms of the dip and <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> of the slab surfaces, which can define the geometry of all kinematically admissible collapse mechanisms or yield line patterns. The external work done and the internal energy dissipation at yield lines are evaluated as functions of the dip and <b>strike</b> <b>angles,</b> and the principle of virtual work is used to determine the corresponding load factor. The final solution is obtained by minimising the load factor with respect to the dip and <b>strike</b> <b>angles.</b> A computer program based on this method has been produced.

Dimensionality {{analysis}} and three-dimensional inversion of both datasets revealed the conductivity structure and yielded the results {{given in the}} conceptual model (Fig.  8). Performing 3 D analysis allowed us to detect highly varying lateral conductance values along the GF. The GF consists of several subsidiary fracture zones surrounding the main fault, which were identified by individual FCZs. The damage zone of the GF extends widely along these FZCs, forming an asymmetric damage zone concentrated in the south, where the younger formations act as reservoir for meteoric water. These spatial characteristics demonstrate a distributed conduit behavior of fluid flow {{in the vicinity of}} the GF. The GF is a strike-slip fault, almost lacking a dipping component. The geoelectric <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> are in agreement with the geological <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> and follow a N 70 °E trend. The absence of fluid pathways at greater depths and mechanically strong and resistive media on both sides of the fault might be indicators of the locked state of the fault, indicating a great potential for generating a large earthquake in the future.|$|R
5000|$|San Miguel is a {{forehand}} strike {{with the}} right hand, moving from the strikers right shoulder toward their left hip.

50|$|Another way of {{representing}} strike and dip is by dip and dip direction. The dip direction is the azimuth {{of the direction}} the dip as projected to the horizontal (like the trend of a linear feature in trend and plunge measurements), which is 90° off the <b>strike</b> <b>angle.</b> For example, a bed dipping 30° to the South, would have an East-West strike (and would be written 090°/30° S using strike and dip), but would be written as 30/180 using the dip and dip direction method.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, we {{can compare}} the two optimal focal {{mechanisms}} of the tremors to the focal mechanisms of shallow crustal earthquakes studied by Matsumoto et al. (2013). We found {{that one of the}} nodal planes has a similar <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> to that of the shallow earthquakes. Considering the principal stress directions estimated by Matsumoto et al. (2013) shown in Fig.  6 a, the similar nodal planes of the tremors and crustal earthquakes are favorably oriented under the current stress field. This could imply that both the shallow earthquakes and the tremors in this region are generated under the same tectonic stress conditions. In addition, the Hinagu fault zone at the surface has similar strike direction to one of the nodal planes of optimal focal mechanisms estimated in this study. This implies the possibility that the tremors occurred on a fault plane forming a downward extension of the Hinagu fault zone. The similarity of <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> of the fault planes suggests that the active fault, the shallow earthquakes, and the tremors represent a fault system reaching from the surface to the lower crust as described in Iio et al. (2004). This geometrical relationship indicates that the tremors are a phenomenon reflecting the loading process of the crustal earthquakes.|$|R
30|$|Next, {{with the}} {{knowledge}} obtained from the uniform slip model, I constructed {{a model for the}} foreshocks to map the detailed slip distribution. The slip distribution model is inferred by a least squares method, following the general procedure of Kobayashi et al. (2012). In the inversion, only the dip-slip and strike-slip components are estimated for each patch. The increase of model parameters gives rise to instability of the solution. To stabilize the solution, I here impose a spatial smoothness constraint on the slip distribution using a Laplacian operator. The relative weight of the constraints is determined by Akaike’s Bayesian information criterion (Akaike 1980). For the Hinagu fault, the fault plane was set to a rectangle 20  km long and 20  km wide. The <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> was set at 205 °, so as to be parallel to the Hinagu fault zone. The northern edge of the fault plane is set to be around the junction of the Hinagu fault and the Futagawa fault. For the local fault under Mashiki town, the fault plane was set to a rectangle 10  km long and 10  km wide, and dips to the south with a <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> of 60 °. Both planes are divided into 2  ×  2  km squares.|$|R
30|$|The {{numerical}} simulation of a tsunami has three stages, i.e., generation, propagation and inundation. In the generation stage of earthquake-generated tsunamis, Okada’s finite fault deformation model (see [3]) {{is widely used}} as the initial method to predict the initial sea surface displacement of a tsunami. This method assumes that an earthquake {{can be regarded as}} the rupture of a single fault plane. This fault is described by a series of physical parameters, comprising dip <b>angle,</b> <b>strike</b> <b>angle,</b> rake angle, fault width, fault length, and fault depth. Okada’s vertical displacement is applied to generate tsunami wave with initialized sea-surface elevation instantaneously, or drive the model at a specific rupture time (e.g., see [4]). Recently, tsunami-wave generations independent of the Okada’s assumption are also being developed and evaluated, in which a 3 D finite element model is employed (see [5]).|$|R
30|$|In summary, the {{presence}} of relocated aftershocks suggests changes in dip and <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> for the three segments of the rupture zone, and the focal mechanism in the northern segment shows a mixture of thrust and strike mechanisms. In the future, when {{the depth of the}} smaller aftershocks can be better constrained from depth phases (Langston, 1987), a cross section of the aftershock pattern should provide clues to variable dip angle versus depth for the rupturing fault plane. Therefore, much more work has to be done on aftershocks to better understand the rupture process and seismotectonic setting of the Wenchuan Earthquake.|$|R

Design: Observational cross-sectional study. Setting: Camera-based 3 D gait laboratory. Participants: Ten persons with PD (Hoehn and Yahr I − III) having mild gait disturbances and 10 HE. Interventions: Participants walked for two minutes under 3 conditions at comfortable pace: single-task walking, attending to heel strike during single-task walking, and dual-task walking. Main outcome measures: minimal and maximal toe clearance; foot <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> with the ground. Results: People with PD had less maximal toe clearance in the end of the swing phase and a smaller foot <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> than HE during all three walking conditions. Impairments significantly diminished during heel strike focused walking improving performance to equal the HE. Heel strike focused walking resulted in an increased minimal toe clearance and a longer duration of end swing phase when compared to walking with and without a dual-task. The attentional strategy to focus on heel strike improved the stride length when compared to dual-task walking. Surprisingly, minimal toe clearance did not differ between PD and HE in any of the conditions and there were no dual-task effects on toe clearance.

40|$|Radial and {{azimuthal}} anisotropy in {{seismic wave}} speeds {{have long been}} observed using surface waves and {{are believed to be}} controlled by deformation within the Earth’s crust and uppermost mantle. Although radial and azimuthal anisotropy reflect important aspects of anisotropic media, few studies have tried to interpret them jointly. We describe a method of inversion that interprets simultaneous observations of radial and azimuthal anisotropy under the assumption of a hexagonally symmetric elastic tensor with a tilted symmetry axis defined by dip and <b>strike</b> <b>angles.</b> We show that observations of radial anisotropy and the 2 ψ component of azimuthal anisotropy for Rayleigh waves obtained using USArray data in the western United States can be fit well under this assumption. Our inferences occur within the framework of a Bayesian Monte Carlo inversion, which yields a posterior distribution that reflects both variances of and covariances between all model variables, and divide into theoretical and observational results. Principal theoretical results include the following: (1) There are two distinct groups of models (Group 1, Group 2) in the posterior distribution in which the <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> of anisotropy in the crust (defined by the intersection of the foliation plane with Earth’s surface) is approximately orthogonal between the two sets. (2) The Rayleigh wave fast axis directions are orthogonal to the <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> in the geologically preferred group of models in which anisotropy is strongly non-elliptical. (3) The estimated dip angle may be interpreted in two ways: as a measure of the actual dip of the foliation of anisotropic material within the crust, or as a proxy for another non-geometric variable, most likely a measure of the deviation from hexagonal symmetry of the medium. The principal observational results include the following: (1) Inherent S-wave anisotropy (γ) is fairly homogeneous vertically across the crust, on average, and spatially across the western United States. (2) Averaging over the region of study and in depth, γ in the crust is approximately 4. 1 ± 2 per cent. γ in the crust is approximately the same in the two groups of models. (3) Dip angles in the two groups of models show similar spatial variability and display geological coherence. (4) Tilting the symmetry axis of an anisotropic medium produces apparent radial and apparent azimuthal anisotropies that are both smaller in amplitude than the inherent anisotropy of the medium, which means that most previous studies have probably underestimated the strength of anisotropy...|$|R
