Typical food plants include common nettle, docks, common knotgrass, fat hen, common chickweed and yarrow. Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, and grain makes up {{a significant part of the}} food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks which can occasionally number hundreds of birds, and often contain other buntings and finches.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{wildlife}} monitoring organization, WildTrack, started using JMP with the Footprint Identification Technology (FIT) system to identify individual endangered animals by their footprints. In 2009, the Chicago Botanic Garden used JMP to analyze DNA data from tropical breadfruit. Researchers {{determined that the}} seedless, <b>starchy</b> fruit {{was created by the}} deliberate hybridization of two fruits, the breadnut and the dugdug. The Herzenberg Laboratory at Stanford has integrated JMP with the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). The FACS system is used to study HIV, cancer, stem-cells and oceanography.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{depend on}} plants for food, either {{directly}} or as feed for domestic animals. Agriculture deals with the production of food crops, and has {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, <b>starchy</b> roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E

5|$|Also, {{the absence}} of <b>starchy</b> {{historical}} content in Robert doubtless {{played a part in}} attracting the bourgeoisie to the opera, until then regarded as primarily an aristocratic entertainment. The success of the opera also justified the government's policy of 'privatization' in selling the management to Véron, and this was a landmark in the dilution of state control and patronage in the fine arts. Although Véron had not commissioned it (having taken control only after the Revolution), Robert was his first new production as manager of the Opéra, and its success underwrote his policy of commissioning similar works. These were to include Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, Fromental Halévy's La Juive, and Daniel Auber's Gustave III. However, while they used 'the same dazzling theatrical rhetoric' as Robert, they led to 'uniformly horrific dénouements' with 'gripping moral urgency', their more sophisticated plot-lines reflecting the changes in taste of the new opera clientele.

5|$|The Chinese of the Tang era {{were also}} very {{interested}} in the benefits of officially classifying all of the medicines used in pharmacology. In 657, Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649–683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official materia medica, complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops. In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians. Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and Sun Simiao (581–682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with diabetes had an excess of sugar in their urine, and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and <b>starchy</b> foods. As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the thyroid glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat goiters; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890. The use of the dental amalgam, manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text Xinxiu Bencao written by Su Gong in 659.|$|E
5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a metal-tipped digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The <b>starchy</b> ovy tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea during the rainy season. To obtain water during the rainy season the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops of their houses using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E

5000|$|Worldwide, {{there is}} no sharp {{distinction}} between [...] "bananas" [...] and [...] "plantains". Especially in the Americas and Europe, [...] "banana" [...] usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the Cavendish group, which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, Musa cultivars with firmer, <b>starchier</b> fruit are called [...] "plantains". In other regions, such as Southeast Asia, many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the simple two-fold distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.|$|R
5000|$|Banana {{chips are}} deep-fried or dried slices of bananas (fruits of {{herbaceous}} plants {{of the genus}} Musa of the soft, sweet [...] "dessert banana" [...] variety). They can be covered with sugar or honey and have a sweet taste, or they can be fried in oil and spices and have a salty or spicy taste. Banana chips are commonly found in India, Philippines and Indonesia (as kripik). Variants of banana chips may be covered with chocolate instead. Banana chips are similar to chifle, usually made from firmer, <b>starchier</b> fruit varieties of the genus Musa commercially called plantains or [...] "cooking bananas".|$|R

25|$|Methods of fasting also {{vary widely}} and cover a broad spectrum. If {{followed}} strictly, the person fasting does not partake any {{food or water}} from the previous day's sunset until 48 minutes after the following day's sunrise. Fasting can also mean limiting oneself to one meal during the day, abstaining from eating certain food types or eating only certain food types. In any case, the fasting person {{is not supposed to}} eat or even touch any animal products (i.e., meat, eggs) except dairy products. Amongst Hindus during fasting, <b>starchy</b> items such as Potatoes, Sago and Sweet potatoes are allowed. The other allowed food items include milk products, peanuts and fruits. It should be noted that peanuts and the <b>starchy</b> items mentioned above originate outside India.|$|E
25|$|To produce ethanol from <b>starchy</b> {{materials}} such as cereal grains, the starch must first be converted into sugars. In brewing beer, this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate, or malt, which produces the enzyme amylase. When the malted grain is mashed, the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars.|$|E
5000|$|To {{facilitate}} {{transportation and}} storage, tomatoes are often picked unripe (green) and ripened in storage with ethylene. Unripe tomatoes are firm. As they ripen they soften until reaching the ripe state {{where they are}} red or orange in color and slightly soft to the touch. Ethylene is a hydrocarbon gas produced by many fruits that acts as the molecular cue to begin the ripening process. Tomatoes ripened in this way tend to keep longer, but have poorer flavor and a mealier, <b>starchier</b> texture than tomatoes ripened on the plant. [...] They may be recognized by their color, which is more pink or orange than the other ripe tomatoes' deep red, depending on variety.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{distinct}} groups of plants bearing edible fruit {{have been developed}} from species of Musa. In English, fruits which are sweet and used for dessert are usually called [...] "bananas", whereas <b>starchier</b> varieties used for cooking are called [...] "plantains", but these terms {{do not have any}} botanical significance. By far the largest and now the most widely distributed group of cultivated bananas is derived from section Musa, particularly [...] and , either alone or in various hybrid combinations. The next but much smaller group is derived from members of section Callimusa (previously classified as Australimusa) and is restricted in importance to Polynesia. Of even more restricted importance are small groups of hybrids from Papua New Guinea; a group from section Musa to which Musa schizocarpa has also contributed, and a group of hybrids between section Musa and section Callimusa.|$|R
60|$|Then comes Sir Walter Scott {{with his}} enchantments, {{and by his}} single might checks this wave of progress, and even turns it back; sets the world in love with dreams and phantoms; with decayed and swinish forms of religion; with decayed and {{degraded}} systems of government; with the sillinesses and emptinesses, sham grandeurs, sham gauds, and sham chivalries of a brainless and worthless long-vanished society. He did measureless harm; more real and lasting harm, perhaps, than any other individual that ever wrote. Most {{of the world has}} now outlived good part of these harms, though by no means all of them; but in our South they flourish pretty forcefully still. Not so forcefully as half a generation ago, perhaps, but still forcefully. There, the genuine and wholesome civilization of the nineteenth century is curiously confused and commingled with the Walter Scott Middle-Age sham civilization; and so you have practical, common-sense, progressive ideas, and progressive works; mixed up with the duel, the inflated speech, and the jejune romanticism of an absurd past that is dead, and out of charity ought to be buried. But for the Sir Walter disease, the character of the Southerner--or Southron, according to Sir Walter's <b>starchier</b> way of phrasing it--would be wholly modern, in place of modern and medieval mixed, and the South would be fully a generation further advanced than it is. It was Sir Walter that made every gentleman in the South a Major or a Colonel, or a General or a Judge, before the war; and it was he, also, that made these gentlemen value these bogus decorations. For it was he that created rank and caste down there, and also reverence for rank and caste, and pride and pleasure in them. Enough is laid on slavery, without fathering upon it these creations and contributions of Sir Walter.|$|R
25|$|The {{natives of}} South America {{produced}} a beer-like beverage from cassava or maize, {{which had to}} be chewed before fermentation in order to turn the starch into sugar.

25|$|Patients with CFS {{benefit from}} a {{well-balanced}} diet and eating regularly (eating little and often), including slow-release <b>starchy</b> foods in meals and snacks. Although elimination diets are not generally recommended, many people experience relief of CFS symptoms with these diets, including gastrointestinal complaints. To avoid the risk of malnutrition, they should be supervised by a dietitian.|$|E
25|$|A popcorn kernel's strong hull {{contains}} the seed's hard, <b>starchy</b> endosperm with 14-20% moisture, which turns to steam as the kernel is heated.

25|$|In Samoa {{the baby}} talo leaves and coconut milk are wrapped into parcels and cooked, {{along with other}} food, in an umu. The parcels are called palusami or lu'au. The {{resulting}} taste is smoky, sweet, savoury and has a unique creamy texture. The root is also baked (Talo tao) in the umu or boiled with coconut cream (Faálifu Talo). It has a slightly bland and <b>starchy</b> flavor. It is sometimes called the Polynesian potato.|$|E
25|$|The name “Adirondack” is an Iroquois word {{which means}} tree-eater and {{referred}} to their neighbors (more {{commonly known as the}} Algonquians) who collected the inner bark of this tree, Picea rubens, and others during times of winter starvation. The white soft inner bark (cambial layer) was carefully separated from the hard, dark brown bark and dried. When pounded this product can be used as flour or added to stretch other <b>starchy</b> products.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit is}} an achene, similar to {{sunflower}} seed, {{with a single}} seed inside a hard outer hull. The <b>starchy</b> endosperm is white and makes up {{most or all of}} buckwheat flour. The seed coat is green or tan, which darkens buckwheat flour. The hull is dark brown or black, and some may be included in buckwheat flour as dark specks. The dark flour is known as blé noir (black wheat) in French, along with the name sarrasin (saracen).|$|E
25|$|Both fronds and {{rhizomes}} {{have been}} used to brew beer, and the rhizome starch {{has been used as a}} substitute for arrowroot. Bread can be made out of dried and powdered rhizomes alone or with other flour. Indigenous peoples of the Americas cooked the rhizomes, then peeled and ate them or pounded the <b>starchy</b> fiber into flour.

25|$|Many {{parts of}} the Typha plant are edible to humans. The <b>starchy</b> {{rhizomes}} are nutritious with a protein content {{comparable to that of}} maize or rice. They can be processed into a flour with 266 kcal per 100 grams. They are most often harvested from late autumn to early spring. They are fibrous, and the starch must be scraped or sucked from the tough fibers. Plants growing in polluted water can accumulate lead and pesticide residues in their rhizomes, and these should not be eaten.|$|E

It is also popular with those on a diet restricting the use of red meat. To make the chili vegetarian, the cook leaves out the meat or replaces it with a meat analogue, such as textured vegetable protein or tofu, or a <b>starchy</b> vegetable, such as potatoes. These chilis nearly always include beans. Variants may contain corn, squash, mushrooms, or beets.|$|E
