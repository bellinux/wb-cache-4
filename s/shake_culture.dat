5000|$|Culture {{techniques}} and media vary {{depending upon the}} requirements of the fungal isolate involved, however the general procedure consist of the following: fungal hyphae are typically placed in liquid growth media and placed in <b>shake</b> <b>culture</b> until the fungal culture has increased in biomass. The fungal hyphae are removed from the growth media, washed with distilled water to remove the growth media, placed in distilled water and incubated on <b>shake</b> <b>culture</b> for 24 to 48 hours. The fungal hyphae are separated from the supernatant, and an aliquot of the supernatant is added to 1.0 mM ion solution. The ion solution is then monitored for 2 to 3 days for the formation of nanoparticles. Another common culture technique is to add washed fungal hyphae directly into 1.0 mM ion solution instead of utilizing the fungal filtrate. Silver nitrate is the most widely used source of silver ions, but silver sulfate has also been utilized. Choloroauric acid is generally used as the source of gold ions at various concentrations (1.0 mM and 250 mg to 500 mg of Au per liter). Cadmium sulfide nanoparticle synthesis for F. oxysporum was conducted using a 1:1 ratio of Cd2+ and SO42− at a 1 mM concentration. Gold nanoparticles can vary in shape and size depending on the pH of the ion solution. Gericke and Pinches (2006) reported that for V. luteoalbum small (cc.10 nm) spherical gold nanoparticles are formed at pH 3, larger (spherical, triangular, hexagon and rods) gold nanoparticles are formed at pH 5, and at pH 7 to pH 9 the large nanoparticles tend to lack a defined shape. Soni and Prakash (2011) reported an opposite response to pH for silver nanoparticles synthesized by both C. tropicum and F. oxysporum. [...] The authors concluded that silver nanoparticle size increased as the pH of the ion solution decreased. Temperature interactions for both silver and gold nanoparticles were similar; a lower temperature resulted in larger nanoparticles while higher temperatures produced smaller nanoparticles.|$|E

Other work {{has shown that}} several promoters, including acr (also known as hspX) (α-crystallin homolog), are upregulated in shallow standing cultures compared with constantly <b>shaking</b> <b>cultures.</b> Each of these promoters is also induced to a similar extent within macrophages. The present study used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to further characterize differences in mycobacterial protein expression during growth under standing and <b>shaking</b> <b>culture</b> conditions. Metabolic labeling of M. bovis BCG showed that at least 45 proteins were differentially expressed under standing and <b>shaking</b> <b>culture</b> conditions. Rv 2623, CysA 2 -CysA 3, Gap, and Acr were identified from each of four spots or gel bands that were specifically increased in bacteria from standing cultures. An additional standing-induced spot contained two comigrating proteins, GlcB and KatG. The greatest induction was observed with Rv 2623, a 32 -kDa protein of unknown function that was strongly expressed under standing conditions and absent in <b>shaking</b> <b>cultures.</b> Analysis using PROBE, a multiple sequence alignment and database mining tool, classified M. tuberculosis Rv 2623 {{as a member of}} a novel class of ATP-binding proteins that may be involved in M. tuberculosis's response to environmental signals.

40|$|Acetobacter aceti has {{an ability}} to grow under two {{different}} <b>culture</b> conditions, on <b>shaking</b> submerged <b>cultures</b> and on static pellicle-forming cultures. The respiratory chains of A. aceti grown on <b>shaking</b> and static <b>cultures</b> were compared, especially {{with respect to the}} terminal oxidase. Little difference was detected in several oxidase activities and in cytochrome b and c contents between the respiratory chains of both types of cells. Furthermore, the results obtained here suggested that the respiratory chains consist of primary dehydrogenases, ubiquinone, and terminal ubiquinol oxidase, regardless of the culture conditions. There was a remarkable difference, however, in the terminal oxidase, which is cytochrome a 1 in cells in <b>shaking</b> <b>culture</b> but cytochrome o in cells grown statically. Change of the <b>culture</b> condition from <b>shaking</b> to static caused a change in the terminal oxidase from cytochrome a 1 to cytochrome o, which is concomitant with an increase of pellicle {{on the surface of the}} static culture. In contrast, reappearance of cytochrome a 1 in A. aceti was attained only after serial successive <b>shaking</b> <b>cultures</b> of an original static culture; cytochrome a 1 predominated after the culture was repeated five times. In the culture of A. aceti, two different types of cells were observed; one forms a rough-surfaced colony, and the other forms a smooth-surfaced colony. Cells of the former type predominated in the static culture, while the cells of the latter type predominated in the <b>shaking</b> <b>culture.</b> Thus, data suggest that a change of the culture conditions, from static to shaking or vice versa, results in a change of the cell type, which may be related to the change in the terminal oxidase from cytochrome a 1 to cytochrome o in A. aceti...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that several genes expressed during Dictyostelium development could be induced in <b>shaking</b> <b>culture</b> by exogenous cAMP, {{even though the}} accumulation of intracellular cAMP was inhibited. The use of selected cAMP analogs indicated that the exogenous cAMP functioned by activating the cell surface cAMP receptor and not by interacting with the regulatory subunit of the intracellular cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Although some genes in Dictyostelium appear to be regulated by intracellular cAMP, {{these data suggest that}} this is not the case for all genes regulated by cAMP. Intracellular second messengers other than cAMP may, therefore, promote the expression of these other genes. Here, we have examined inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol as candidates for such mediators of signal transduction. We have studied three genes that exhibit disparate modes of temporal and spatial expression during development of Dictyostelium. In <b>shaking</b> <b>cultures,</b> maximal levels of expression of each are dependent on the accumulation of or exposure to extracellular cAMP. We show that the addition of inositol trisphosphate and/or diacylglycerol to cells in <b>shaking</b> <b>culture</b> has distinct effects on the expression of each gene and, under specific conditions, can bypass the requirement for extracellular cAMP. These data suggest that extracellular cAMP interacting with its cell surface receptor may promote synthesis of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol to regulate gene expression and aspects of differentiation in Dictyostelium...|$|R

Oxidation abilities of gluconate of these bacteria, cultured in the medium with glucose as the C-source by still standing method, are low shaking method the oxidation of gluconate increases relatively high irrespective of the iength of culture. Furthermore, considering inhibitory effect of DNP against the oxidation of glucose, in the still standing culture the oxidation of glucose may be thought to depend mainly on the E-M pathway and in the <b>shaking</b> <b>culture</b> it develops to the W-D pathway or glucose ➝ gluconate ➝ 2 -keto-gluconate (or 5 -ketogluconate) pathway. 2.

Bacteriol. 89 : 996 – 1004. 1965. —The {{nature of}} the glucose effect on tryptophanase in Escherichia coli (Crookes) was investigated to test the catabolite-repression hypothesis. Under static conditions {{of growth in the}} presence of 0. 005 m glucose, tryptophanase was repressed and remained so upon continued static incubation subsequent to glucose exhaustion. Aeration following glucose exhaustion under static cultural conditions resulted in rapid enzyme synthesis. In the absence of glucose, certain amino acids repressed tryptophanase synthesis early in the growth cycle under aerated conditions. An inverse relationship was observed between the concentration of acid-hydrolyzed casein and the level of tryptophanase. At 3 hr, enzyme activity in cells grown in media containing 0. 05 % acid-hydrolyzed casein was at least five times that of cells grown in the presence of 1 % casein. Addition of 0. 005 m d- or l-serine to a 0. 05 % acid-hydrolyzed casein medium rendered the medium capable of strongly repressing tryptophanase. Glucose-expended medium was prepared by allowing cells to grow and exhaust glucose in static culture. When this expended medium was recovered and inoculated with fresh cells not previously exposed to glucose, tryptophanase synthesis was repressed for a short period in <b>shake</b> <b>culture,</b> but in static culture enzyme synthesis was only slightly affected.

Antibodies raised against CFTH 1 localized the protein in a mucilageous coat surrounding submerged vegetative hyphae in liquid <b>shaken</b> <b>culture</b> and, as a discrete layer of about 10 nm thickness at the surface of aerial hyphae of standing cultures, suggesting a role in the formation of aerial hyphae...|$|R
