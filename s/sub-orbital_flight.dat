5|$|On July 21, 1961, Grissom was {{pilot of}} the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4, which he named Liberty Bell 7. This was a <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flight</b> that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds. After splashdown, {{emergency}} explosive bolts unexpectedly fired and blew the hatch off, causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Quickly exiting through the open hatch and into the ocean, Grissom nearly drowned as water began filling his spacesuit. A recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve the spacecraft, but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, and it was ultimately cut loose before sinking.|$|E
25|$|A minimal orbital spaceflight {{requires}} {{much higher}} velocities than a minimal <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flight,</b> {{and so it}} is technologically much more challenging to achieve. To achieve orbital spaceflight, the tangential velocity around the Earth is as important as altitude. In order to perform a stable and lasting flight in space, the spacecraft must reach the minimal orbital speed required for a closed orbit.|$|E
25|$|NASA's Space Shuttle first flew on April 12, 1981. The Shuttle re-entered at Mach 25 {{at the end}} of each spaceflight, landing entirely as a glider. The Space Shuttle and its Soviet equivalent, the Buran shuttle, were by far {{the fastest}} ever aircraft. Recent {{examples}} of rocket glider include the privately funded SpaceshipOne which is intended for <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flight</b> and the XCOR EZ-Rocket which is being used to test engines.|$|E

50|$|Early American <b>sub-orbital</b> rocket <b>flights</b> were {{achieved}} at Cape Canaveral in 1956. These flights occurred shortly after <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flights</b> launched from White Sands Missile Range, {{such as the}} Viking 12 sounding rocket on February 4, 1955.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{dogs that}} flew on <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flights</b> include Dymka (Дымка, [...] "Smoky"), Modnitsa (Модница, [...] "Fashionable") and Kozyavka (Козявка, [...] "Little Gnat").|$|R
25|$|Point-to-point sub-orbital spaceflight is a {{category}} of spaceflight in which a spacecraft uses a <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flight</b> for transportation. This can provide a two-hour trip from London to Sydney, which would be much faster than what is currently over a twenty-hour flight. Today, no company offers this type of spaceflight for transportation. However, Virgin Galactic has plans for a spaceplane called SpaceShipThree, which could offer this service in the future. Suborbital spaceflight over an intercontinental distance requires a vehicle velocity that is only a little lower than the velocity required to reach low Earth orbit. If rockets are used, {{the size of the}} rocket relative to the payload is similar to an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). Any intercontinental spaceflight has to surmount problems of heating during atmosphere re-entry that are nearly as large as those faced by orbital spaceflight.|$|E
500|$|Numismatic souvenirs have {{accompanied}} astronauts {{on nearly}} every early spaceflight. Mercury astronauts carried small light-weight mementos on their missions, often {{in the form of}} US coins or banknotes. On the first <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flight</b> (Mercury-Redstone 3), Alan Shepard carried with him four one-dollar silver certificates which were subsequently signed by him, other Mercury astronauts, and support staff becoming short snorters. John Glenn, piloting the first manned U.S. orbital spaceflight Mercury-Atlas 6 also carried several one-dollar silver certificates.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sub-orbital</b> <b>flights</b> {{can last}} many hours. Pioneer 1 was NASA's first space probe, {{intended}} {{to reach the}} Moon. A partial failure caused it to instead follow a sub-orbital trajectory, reentering the Earth's atmosphere 43 hours after launch.|$|R
5|$|The Soviet Union and United States had {{previously}} sent animals only on <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flights.</b> Three dogs were trained for the Sputnik 2 flight: Albina, Mushka, and Laika. Soviet space-life scientists Vladimir Yazdovsky and Oleg Gazenko trained the dogs.|$|R
50|$|After 1985 the {{facility}} was largely deserted. Nearby, however, {{at the site}} of Fort Churchill and the town of Churchill were an airport, a railway, some offices (Chamber of Commerce office), an eco-tourism centre and a geomagnetic observatory. Over the years over 3,500 <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flights</b> were launched from the site.|$|R
5000|$|Dezik (Дезик) and Tsygan (Цыган, [...] "Gypsy") {{were the}} first dogs to make a <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flight</b> on 22 July 1951. Both dogs were {{recovered}} unharmed after travelling to a maximum altitude of 110 km. Dezik made another <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flight</b> in July 29, 1951 with a dog named Lisa, although neither survived because the parachute failed to deploy. After the death of Dezik, Tsygan was adopted as a pet by Soviet physicist Anatoli Blagonravov.|$|E

50|$|The Kosmos-3 (GRAU Index: 11K65, {{also known}} as Cosmos-3) was a Soviet carrier rocket, derived from the R-14 missile, which was used to orbit {{satellites}} between 1966 and 1968. It was quickly replaced by the modernised Kosmos-3M. Six were flown, four as orbital carrier rockets, and two on <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flights.</b> All launches occurred from Site 41/15 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.|$|R

50|$|Goliath, a {{squirrel}} monkey, {{died in the}} explosion of his Atlas rocket on November 10, 1961. A rhesus monkey called Scatback flew a <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flight</b> on December 20, 1961, but was lost at sea after landing.|$|E
50|$|Kavoshgar-5 (Explorer-5), {{carrying}} a live monkey, was launched for a 20-minute <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flight</b> in September 2011, however the mission failed.

50|$|For example, {{the path}} of an object {{launched}} from Earth that reaches 100 km above sea level, and then falls back to Earth, is considered a sub-orbital spaceflight. Some <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flights</b> have been undertaken to test spacecraft and launch vehicles later intended for orbital spaceflight. Other vehicles are specifically designed only for sub-orbital flight; examples include manned vehicles such as the X-15 and SpaceShipOne, and unmanned ones such as ICBMs and sounding rockets.|$|R

25|$|In 1954, JPL {{teamed up}} with Wernher von Braun's rocketeers at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, to propose {{orbiting}} a satellite during the International Geophysical Year. The team lost that proposal to Project Vanguard, and instead embarked on a classified project to demonstrate ablative re-entry technology using a Jupiter-C rocket. They carried out three successful <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flights</b> in 1956 and 1957. Using a spare Jupiter-C, the two organizations then launched America's first satellite, Explorer 1, on February 1, 1958.|$|R
50|$|A major use of sub-orbital {{vehicles}} {{today are}} as scientific sounding rockets. Scientific <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flights</b> {{began in the}} 1920s when Robert H. Goddard launched the first liquid fueled rockets, however they did not reach space altitude. In the late 1940s, captured German V-2 ballistic missiles were converted into V-2 sounding rockets which helped {{lay the foundation for}} modern sounding rockets. Today there are dozens of different sounding rockets on the market, from a variety of suppliers in various countries. Typically, researchers wish to conduct experiments in microgravity or above the atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|Sounding rockets {{appeared}} in the mid- 20 th century and {{proved to be an}} extremely useful science tool in all fields of physics and even beyond. These rockets are conceived for <b>sub-orbital</b> <b>flights,</b> to take measurement and/or perform experiments in the high atmosphere, in near space and/or in micro-gravity conditions. They also allow to introduce young scientists to space sciences by undertaking a full-scale pedagogical science project with a relatively moderate cost. This paper presents the origins and principles of sounding rockets, how they work, as well as a few recent science applications...|$|R
