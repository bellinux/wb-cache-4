40|$|In this papaer {{we present}} a method based on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to detect meat and bone meal (MBM) in <b>compound</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> By {{choosing}} adequate DNA targets from an appropriate localisation in the genome the developed Real Time PCR method proved to be robust against severe heat treatment of the MBM, showing high sensitivity for the detectin of MBM. The mothod developed allows a specific detection of pig and cattle processed materials treated at 134 °C in various feed matrices with a limit of detection of about 0. 1 %. This technique has also been successfully applied on well-characterised MBM samples treated as far as 141 ºC {{as well as on}} various blind feed samples with very low MBM content. Finally the methods also passed successfully several official European ring trials. JRC. D. 8 -Food safety and qualit...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of robust methods for the species specific detection {{of meat and}} bone meal (MBM) in <b>compound</b> <b>feedingstuffs,</b> is an important prerequisite to enforce current and upcoming European legislation {{on the use of}} processed animal proteins in animal nutrition. Among possible methods, those based on DNA {{turned out to be a}} reliable tool for this aim, since DNA is a quite thermostable molecule able to resist severe heat treatments applied in the manufacturing of animal meals. The application of such methods by control laboratories implies that the method has been validated including an assessment of its robustness. Successful transferability between laboratories is considered an important robustness criterion of the method. However, corresponding guidelines regarding the design of such a study relevant to this field are missing. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a new concept that was applied to check for the transferability of a qualitative assay for the detection of banned MBM in feedingstuffs at trace level based on real time PCR. This approach can be of interest for other research groups working in the development of real-time PCR methods and in their use by control laboratories. JRC. D. 8 -Food safety and qualit...|$|R

40|$|Carotenoids {{are used}} in animal {{nutrition}} mainly as sensory additives that favourably affect the colour of fish, birds and food of animal origin. Various analytical methods exist for their quantification in compound feed, reflecting the different physico-chemical characteristics of the carotenoid and the corresponding feed additives. They may be natural products or specific formulations containing the target carotenoids produced by chemical synthesis. In this study a multi-analyte method was developed {{that can be applied}} to the determination of all 10 carotenoids currently authorised within the European Union for <b>compound</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> The method functions regardless of whether the carotenoids have been added to the compound feed via natural products or specific formulations. It is comprised of three steps: (1) digestion of the feed sample with an enzyme; (2) pressurised liquid extraction; and (3) quantification of the analytes by reversed-phase HPLC coupled to a photodiode array detector in the visible range. The method was single-laboratory validated for poultry and fish feed covering a mass fraction range of the target analyte from 2. 5 to 300 mg kg– 1. The following method performance characteristics were obtained: the recovery rate varied from 82 % to 129 % and precision expressed as the relative standard deviation of intermediate precision varied from 1. 6 % to 15 %. Based on the acceptable performance obtained in the validation study, the multi-analyte method is considered fit for the intended purpose. JRC. F. 5 -Food and Feed Complianc...|$|R

40|$|Fumaric acid is {{currently}} authorised as a preservative in feedingstuffs for all animal species. Fumaric acid is considered safe for {{pigs and poultry}} provided that an expected use level of 20 000 mg/kg in complete diets for pigs and poultry is not exceeded. The margin of safety for pigs and poultry is approximately two. The tolerated fumaric acid concentration in complete diets for ruminants is higher. The margin of safety for pigs, poultry and ruminants is sufficiently high that setting a maximum content is not necessary. In contrast, the maximum safe level in milk replacer for veal calves (and probably other young mammals) is provisionally estimated to be 10 000 mg/kg milk replacer, with no margin of safety. Fumaric acid is rapidly metabolised by well-recognised pathways, and neither fumarate nor its metabolites are expected to accumulate in animal tissues. Consequently, human exposure {{is not expected to}} be increased by the use of fumaric acid in animal nutrition. Fumaric acid is a severe irritant to eyes. Given the potential for eye irritation, the particle size and the dusting potential, exposure to other mucous membranes such as the respiratory tract may also be a concern and it is advisable to minimise exposure by inhalation. The use of fumaric acid in animal nutrition will not pose a risk to the environment. Fumaric acid has value as a food preservative only in the presence of significant moisture. Comparable situations in feed are limited to some feedingstuffs, feed processing and feeding techniques. In such situations, its function in feed is essentially the same as that in food and no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary. However, the FEEDAP Panel has reservations about the effectiveness of any preservative, including fumaric acid, in raw materials and <b>compound</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> with a typical moisture content of ≤ 12 %...|$|R

40|$|Within the EU, {{the use of}} {{nitrofurans}} {{is prohibited}} in food production animals. For this reason detection of these <b>compounds</b> in <b>feedingstuffs,</b> at whatever limit, constitutes an offence under EU legislation. This detection generally {{involves the use of}} analytical methods with limits of quantification lowers than 1  mg kg- 1.
