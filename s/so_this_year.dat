Three very pressing letters were therefore written to Mr Brandon; and the writers were much surprised to receive, in a short time, a collective answer, in which he stated that he would not only be present at the wedding, but that he thought of spending several months in New York. It would be very lonely at Midbranch, he wrote, without Roberta--though why it should be more <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> than during preceding winters, he did not explain--and he felt a desire to see the changes that had taken place in the metropolis since he had visited it, years ago.|$|E

60|$|With October {{had come}} {{the time for}} holding the great Fair which was celebrated every five years at Nottingham Town, to which folk came from far and near {{throughout}} the country. At such times archery was always the main sport of the day, for the Nottinghamshire yeomen were the best hand at the longbow in all merry England, but this year the Sheriff hesitated {{a long time before}} he issued proclamation of the Fair, fearing lest Robin Hood and his band might come to it. At first he had a great part of a mind not to proclaim the Fair, but second thought told him that men would laugh at him and say among themselves that he was afraid of Robin Hood, so he put that thought by. At last he fixed in his mind that he would offer such a prize as they would not care to shoot for. At such times it had been the custom to offer a half score of marks or a tun of ale, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> he proclaimed that a prize of two fat steers should be given to the best bowman.|$|E
6000|$|What I didn't {{begin to}} say to you the other day was how {{interesting}} and awful I found your picture of your seat of learning.

I gather from you that its air is all female, so to speak, and that in this buoyant medium you triumphantly float. It must be very wonderful and fearful and indescribable, all of it, lifelike indeed though your sketch appears to me. I wish immensely I could see you, so that we could get nearer, together, to everything. You come out most summers--is there no chance of your doing <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>year?</b> I seem to infer the sad contrary, from my little cousin's not having told me that you mentioned anything of the sort to her. I have the sense of having seen you odiously little last year--a blighted and distracted season. As I read over at present your generous letter I feel a special horror and dismay at having failed so long and so abominably to give you the promised word of introduction to Fanny Stevenson. I enclose one herewith--but I must tell you that I feel myself to be launching it rather into the dark. That is, I have a fear that she is rather changed--or rather exaggerated--with time, illness etc.--and that you may find her somewhat aged, queer, eccentric etc. And I'm not sure I'm possessed of her address. Only remember this--that she (with all deference to her) was never the person to have seen, it was R. L. S. himself. But good-night. I haven't half responded to you, nor met you--in your charming details; yet I am, none the less, my dear Lapsley, very affectionately yours, ...|$|E
60|$|During the {{six weeks}} after this, Harry Clavering settled down to {{his work at the}} {{chambers}} in the Adelphi with exemplary diligence. Florence, having remained a fortnight in town after Harry's return to the sheepfold, and having accepted Lady Ongar's present--not without a long and anxious consultation with her sister-in-law on the subject--had returned in fully restored happiness to Stratton. Mrs. Burton was at Ramsgate with the children, and Mr. Burton was in Russia with reference to a line of railway which was being projected from Moscow to Astracan. It was now September, and Harry, in his letters home, declared that he was the only person left in London. It was hard upon him--much harder than it was upon the Wallikers and other young men whom Fate retained in town for Harry was a man given to shooting--a man accustomed to pass the autumnal months in a country house. And then, if things had chanced to go one way instead of another, he would have had his own shooting down at Ongar Park with his own friends--admiring him at his heels; or, if not <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> he would have been shooting elsewhere with the prospect of these rich joys for years to come. As it was, he had promised to stick to the shop, and was sticking to it manfully. Nor do I think that he allowed his mind to revert to those privileges which might have been his at all more frequently than any of my readers would have done in his place. He was sticking to the shop; and, though he greatly disliked the hot desolation of London in those days, being absolutely afraid to frequent his club at such a period of the year, and though he hated Walliker mortally, he was fully resolved to go on with his work. Who could tell what might be his fate? Perhaps in another ten years he might be carrying that Russian railway on through the deserts of Siberia. Then there came to him suddenly tidings which disturbed all his resolutions, and changed the whole current of his life.|$|E
