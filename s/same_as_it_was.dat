25|$|ARC Resources - Just over $1.0 {{billion in}} revenue in 2012, 2011, and 2010 (up 23% versus 2009, about the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 2007), in 2009 revenue was at its lowest level in 5 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the game is largely the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the {{original}} Earthworm Jim; traverse through the levels in order to save Princess What's Her Name, and defeat the game's numerous enemies, namely Psy-Crow. However, gameplay is much more diverse than in the first Earthworm Jim.|$|E

The existing Humber Bridge toll system is largely the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> when the bridge opened in 1981, {{and uses a}} computer system that is over 15 years old. This obsolete technology requires an increasing amount of maintenance and needs replacing.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantines regrouped {{and pushed}} back in 622 under Heraclius. Khosrau was {{defeated}} at the Battle of Nineveh in 627, and the Byzantines recaptured all of Syria and penetrated {{far into the}} Persian provinces of Mesopotamia. In 629, Khosrau's general Shahrbaraz agreed to peace, and {{the border between the}} two empires was once again the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 602.|$|E
25|$|After all seat {{disputes}} {{had been}} solved and all 350 seats had been allocated, Prime Minister Felipe González voluntarily submited {{himself to a}} vote of confidence to rectify the atypical investiture vote in which 18 deputies {{had not been able to}} vote. The result was essentially a repeat of the December 1989 voting, with some parties previously voting 'No' choosing to abstain. González's parliamentary support remained the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
50|$|The North (Russian : Север) is {{the third}} and latest album of the Russian folk metal band Satanakozel. The line up of the band <b>is</b> the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> at the present.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} {{documentation}} of Kildwick's name is as Childeuuic in the Domesday Book. In Latin, the digraph ch is pronounced /kʰ/ not /tʃ/ so its pronunciation <b>was</b> the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now.|$|R
50|$|Walker's Court {{is shown}} on Richard Horwood's map of 1813 (3rd edition), {{by which time}} the street layout {{immediately}} north of Little Pulteney Street (now Brewer Street) <b>was</b> the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today.|$|R
25|$|If Captain Lynch {{had known}} that the Federal fleet faced a {{shortage}} of ammunition very much like his own, he perhaps would have altered his tactics, although the outcome would likely have been the <b>same.</b> <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> Rowan ordered the captains in his fleet to conserve their ammunition. They were told to use ramming and boarding, so far as was possible, to disable or capture the enemy ships.|$|E
25|$|All the old barrack {{buildings}} were demolished in 1936 {{to allow the}} construction of the present red brick buildings. One of the more unfortunate aspects of development since the 1930s has been the encroachment of structures outside the Fort Walls, especially on the Hesse and King Street sides. In terms of layout and despite some changes in architectural style, the Fort, as it stands today, is almost the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 1889.|$|E
25|$|In {{a fourth}} case, the {{consequences}} of incapacity are more drastic. Although the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 {{made it possible for}} the government or emanations of the state to be sued on contracts {{in the same way as}} a normal individual, where statute confers power on a public body to do certain acts, actions by representatives beyond that power will be ultra vires and void. The result is the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for companies before reform in 1989, so that whole chains of agreements could be declared as non-existent.|$|E
30|$|As {{noted in}} [18], {{questions}} are sometimes {{asked whether the}} theory of modular function spaces provides general methods for the consideration of fixed point properties; the situation here <b>is</b> the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in the Banach setting.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> a decimal repdigit and a strobogrammatic number (meaning that {{it looks}} the same turned upside down on a {{calculator}} display). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> one of the numbers whose digit sum in decimal <b>is</b> the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in binary.|$|R
25|$|The second {{obstacle}} {{concerns the}} location of the temple. The Holy of Holies in the third temple must be on the exact <b>same</b> spot <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the two previous temples. Therefore the temple must be built in the <b>same</b> location <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> before.|$|R
25|$|The format was the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 2010–11. The tournament {{consisted}} of 24 matches, divided {{into a group}} stage and a knockout stage. The group stage had the teams divided into two equal groups, with each playing a round-robin tournament. The top two teams of each group advanced to the knockout stage. The knockout stage {{consisted of}} two semi-finals, a third-place playoff and the grand final. The semi-finals had the top team of one group facing the second from the other. The winners of the semi-finals played the grand final to determine {{the winner of the}} competition, while the losers of the semi-finals played the third-place playoff.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals {{had allowed}} 69 steals against them through September 8, while they had stolen only 32. Yadier Molina {{is not at}} fault {{as much as the}} {{pitchers}} letting the runners get good jumps, instead of holding them closer to first base. Since his debut in 2004, the team has never allowed more than 64 steals until this year. Molina's pop time—defined as the time elapsed from the moment the pitch hits the catcher's mitt to the moment the intended fielder receives the throw—is the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> last year (1.92 seconds), when he allowed 37 stolen bases and ranked third in the National League with a caught-stealing percentage of 41. That pop time ranks seventh best among all catchers in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, milk-buying {{patterns}} have changed drastically in the UK. The classic milkman, who travels his local milk round (route) using a milk float (often battery powered) {{during the early}} hours and delivers milk in 1 pint glass bottles with aluminium foil tops directly to households, has almost disappeared. Two {{of the main reasons}} for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping). Another factor is that it is cheaper to purchase milk from a supermarket than from home delivery. In 1996, more than 2.5 billion liters of milk were still being delivered by milkmen, but by 2006 only 637 million liters (13% of milk consumed) was delivered by some 9,500 milkmen. By 2010, the estimated number of milkmen had dropped to 6,000. Assuming that delivery per milkman is the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 2006, this means milkmen deliveries now only account for 6–7% of all milk consumed by UK households (6.7 billion liters in 2008/2009).|$|E
50|$|When US 1 was {{designated}} in 1927, its route through Baltimore <b>was</b> the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today except the federal highway entered {{the city from}} the southwest along Washington Boulevard. The highway turned north onto Monroe Street, which it followed to its present course north of Wilkens Avenue.|$|R

50|$|The age {{distribution}} in Nack <b>is</b> much the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> throughout Germany. The younger age groups {{are represented in}} noticeably lower figures. The biggest group, among both men and women, is the 40-to-49 age group. This also holds true in age group breakdowns {{for the whole of}} the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land).|$|R
25|$|On April 12, 2000, the then-St. Louis Rams debuted new logos, team colors, and uniforms. The Rams' {{primary colors}} were changed from royal {{blue and yellow}} to Millennium Blue and New Century Gold. A new logo of a {{charging}} ram's head {{was added to the}} sleeves and gold stripes were added to the sides of the jerseys. The new gold pants no longer featured any stripes. Blue pants and white pants with a small gold stripe (an extension off the jersey stripe that ended in a point) were also an option with the Rams only electing to wear the white set in a pre-season game in San Diego in 2001. The helmet design essentially remains the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 1948, except for updates to the coloring, navy blue field with gold horns. The 2000 rams' horn design features a slightly wider separation at the helmet's center. Both home and away jerseys had a gold stripe that ran down each side, but that only lasted for the 2000 and 2001 seasons.|$|E
25|$|El Paraíso is {{situated}} {{near the mouth}} of the Chillón River Valley and is 2km from the Pacific Ocean. The temperature averages at 70°F ranging from 55°F to 90°F. El Paraíso is a river valley, which provides rich resources and is surrounded by barren desert land. There is a large flood plain near the site, which supports the growth of cotton fields. The Pacific Ocean brings the Humboldt Current through, creating rich and diverse marine life as well as lush tropical vegetation. The Humboldt Current most likely provided an extremely important food source before the advent of agriculture on the coast. Due to the lack of geologic and climatic evidence, it is assumed that the current climate on the Peru Coast is much the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> 4–5000 years ago. Studies conducted by Reitz et al. found mollusc remains which indicated at least two major El Niño events took place during the occupation of El Paraíso. El Niño would have affected the abundance, diversity and species composition of available resources. Most likely, El Niño only affected two separate human life-times and there is evidence that people subsisted from remaining marine life and the lush vegetation which El Niño brings to desert lands.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Dikembe Mutombo {{made people}} {{question}} the draft's legitimacy when he prematurely tweeted a congratulatory {{message to the}} Philadelphia 76ers for receiving the first pick hours before the lottery was conducted. Philadelphia did indeed win the first overall pick. Further questions were raised a bit when the NBA Draft revealed that every spot remained exactly the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> before the event took place, {{which was the first}} occurrence in draft lottery history. A year later, Lakers executive Magic Johnson raised even further questions about the draft process with him assuring head coach Luke Walton that the Lakers would acquire a top 3 pick for the 2017 NBA draft after an interview Walton had on May 4, 2017, twelve days before the draft lottery commenced and moved up to the second pick. As a result of the way teams like the Philadelphia 76ers were manipulating draft odds in their favor by losing games on purpose, starting September 28, 2017 {{with the end of the}} 2018 NBA draft, the NBA would implement a new system discouraging teams from going through Philadelphia's route in the mid-2010's by not only giving the worst three teams equal odds at the #1 pick, but also increasing their odds at going down within the draft with four teams being selected instead of the usual three.|$|E

500|$|On his 111th birthday, a Royal Marines {{band played}} to Allingham on board [...] before he {{returned}} with friends and relatives to the Queen's Hotel on the Portsmouth seafront for afternoon tea. Asked how it felt, Allingham replied, [...] "I'm pleased to be seeing another tomorrow. It's just the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> as at any age, it's no different.

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the King's Cross fire in 1987, the Fennell Report into the disaster recommended that London Underground investigate [...] "passenger flow and congestion in stations and take remedial action". A private bill was submitted to parliament and approved as the London Underground (Safety Measures) Act 1991 giving London Underground powers to improve and expand the frequently congested station with a new ticket hall and new subways. The expansion works were not carried out and the arrangement of the station remains much the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Following Roy Hodgson's {{appointment}} as Liverpool manager, Hodgson stated that Torres {{would not be}} sold by the club, saying, [...] "He is not for sale and we don't welcome any offers for him. We want to keep him." [...] Hodgson dismissed reports Torres was set to leave Liverpool by saying, [...] "He has {{told us that he}} is looking forward to Monday, to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for Liverpool next season. That is what I know so other reports, I would suggest, are erroneous." [...] Torres stated his commitment to Liverpool on 3 August: [...] "My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> on my first day when I signed." ...|$|E
