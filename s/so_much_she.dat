500|$|Posey {{was sent}} a script for [...] "Eagleton" [...] and enjoyed it <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>she</b> {{immediately}} agreed {{to play the}} part.

Despite wearing wool blazers that made the heat even harder to endure, the two actresses said they enjoyed filming the scene. Poehler jokingly said it was included in the script [...] "just because it's in Parker and I's contract, that that's how we will work together. It's the only way we'll work together, is fighting in garbage." ...|$|E

In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{she looks}} sixteen, Fanta is {{actually}} 172 years old (since one Avalon year is about 10 earth years). She can be manipulative, especially since her innocent and sweet appearances allows others to trust her. Despite the handicap {{of being a}} half-faerie, Fanta is extremely powerful, and was even able to summon a master class gown {{in the middle of}} a magical battle against her rival Medea and the exiled god Neptune, despite the fact such a feat should have been impossible. Fanta likes life in the mortal realm <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>she</b> completely torn her dress in half to stay longer, which was why summoning a master class dress was such an impressive feat, considering how badly her regular dress was damaged. Beyond her impressive magical powers, Fanta is very agile and strong, something that comes in handy more than once while fighting evil affinities. [...] Furthermore, her body possesses the unique quality of being to absorb, store, and then release vast amounts of magical energy. [...] Because the power was dangerous, it was sealed off when Fanta was very young and she undid the seal only when Oreadia's life was threatened. [...] This quality is shared by the King of Avalon and one of the primary reasons why he wants to marry her; since both he and Oreadia noticed this aspect of Fanta before it was sealed off, Fanta has become instrumental in both their plans.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy's {{hair has}} {{dominated}} her many styles {{and she has}} had several different hair colours. When asked about her character's [...] "crazy" [...] hair styles Fox revealed that the ideas for the styles are a collaboration of her own ideas and the production teams': [...] "I had a brown bob forever and I was sick to death of it, so when {{we came out of}} the Jake storyline last year, they wanted to change the image. They asked me if I wanted to dye it any colour, so I thought 'let's go red'". Fox said that her initial Hollyoaks image featuring green hair was [...] "definitely not a good look". She added that during her tenura Nancy has had a [...] "few hair disasters", especially the in between stages when she [...] "went back to black from red and then to blonde". She said that since her character has been through <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>she</b> no longer feels it necessary to [...] "desperately shock" [...] everyone with her hair styles as she has had to grow up and evolve. Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has [...] "evolved" [...] as she has [...] "been a Goth, she’s been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! It’s a bit Duffy, a bit ’50s-style, and now I’ve got the red hair it gives us more to play with". Fox added that [...] "one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - I do get to change my image a lot". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had [...] "cut it into a short bob, I got so many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be [...] "too masculine". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it [...] "great to be different" [...] but felt that it was difficult playing the [...] "alternative" [...] character of Nancy when her colleagues were such [...] "gorgeous, glamourous women". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said [...] "Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks. She wears rich colours and vibrant patterns, which compliment [...] her slim shape".|$|E
