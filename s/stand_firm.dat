5|$|The benediction being concluded, the {{sovereign}} {{rises from the}} Coronation Chair and is borne into a throne. Once the monarch is seated on the throne, the formula <b>Stand</b> <b>firm,</b> and hold fast from henceforth…– a translation of the Latin formula Sta et retine…, historically used for the enthronement of other Christian sovereigns – is recited.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{explained}} {{that although the}} title of his documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to <b>stand</b> <b>firm</b> on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.|$|E
5|$|Sir James Bond 007, {{a legendary}} British spy who {{retired from the}} secret service 20 years previously, is visited {{by the head of}} British MI6, M, CIA {{representative}} Ransome, KGB representative Smernov, and Deuxième Bureau representative Le Grand. All implore Bond to come out of retirement to deal with SMERSH who have been eliminating agents: Bond spurns all their pleas. When Bond continues to <b>stand</b> <b>firm,</b> his mansion is destroyed by a mortar attack at the orders of M, who is, however, killed in the explosion.|$|E

5|$|After Cadwallon ap Cadfan, {{the king}} of Gwynedd, in {{alliance}} with the pagan Penda of Mercia, killed Edwin of Deira in battle at Hatfield Chase in 633 (or 632, depending on when the years used by Bede are considered to have begun), Northumbria was split between its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswald's brother Eanfrith became king of Bernicia, but {{he was killed by}} Cadwallon in 634 (or 633) after attempting to negotiate peace. Subsequently, Oswald, {{at the head of a}} small army (possibly with the aid of allies from the north, the Scots and/or the Picts), met Cadwallon in battle at Heavenfield, near Hexham. Before the battle, Oswald had a wooden cross erected; he knelt down, holding the cross in position until enough earth had been thrown in the hole to make it <b>stand</b> <b>firm.</b> He then prayed and asked his army to join in.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and <b>stand</b> <b>firm.</b> The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the opening}} was {{behind them and}} {{encouraged}} by hints that the Public Works Committee was divided on the issue, Reps decided to <b>stand</b> <b>firm.</b> The chairman, Ken Towsey, wrote letters to the Mayor of Salisbury and Councillor J.

25|$|The Athenians {{express their}} shock at the Melians' lack of realism. They {{say that there}} is no shame in {{submitting}} to a stronger enemy, especially one who is offering reasonable terms. They also argue that it is sensible to submit to one's superiors, <b>stand</b> <b>firm</b> against one's equals, and be moderate to one's inferiors. The Melians do not change their minds and politely dismiss the envoys.|$|E
25|$|Victoria {{tried to}} {{convince}} her husband to accept his father's abdication. However, the prince {{did not agree with}} his wife and supported his father, saying that he would <b>stand</b> <b>firm</b> before the Landtag. For Frederick, the abdication of a monarch after a conflict with the Parliament would create a dangerous precedent and weaken his successors. The Crown Prince also judged that his support to his father's abdication in his favour would be a serious dereliction of his duties as a son.|$|E
25|$|During the {{election}} campaign, movements for strategic voting {{to defeat the}} government came {{from a variety of}} sources. The Liberals and the Green Party formed an agreement not to run candidates against their respective leaders and a national Anything But Conservative (ABC) campaign was created by Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams. The election also took place {{at the height of the}} Financial crisis of 2007–2008, which saw governments in the United States and United Kingdom take drastic measures to stimulate their economies and bail out failing financial institutions. The Conservatives promised to <b>stand</b> <b>firm</b> with Canada's fiscal course, while the other parties began to promise greater stimulus measures.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Schmidt (25 October 1895 – 5 November 1987) was {{an officer}} in the German {{military}} from 1914 to 1943. He attained the rank of Generalleutnant during World War II, and {{is best known for his}} role as the Sixth Army's chief of staff in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942–43, during the final stages of which he became its de facto commander, playing a large role in executing Hitler's order that it <b>stand</b> <b>firm</b> despite being encircled by the Red Army. He was a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union for twelve years, and was released following West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer's visit to Moscow in 1955.|$|E
25|$|In late February, a local Japanese counterattack was {{launched}} against Indian XV Corps in Arakan, using {{much the same}} tactics as Mutaguchi proposed to use. The engagement became known to the Allies as the Battle of the Admin Box. The attack failed when Allied aircraft parachuted supplies to cut-off troops, allowing them to <b>stand</b> <b>firm,</b> while the Japanese who had infiltrated behind them ran out of supplies. From this point onwards, the Allies were to place increasing faith and reliance on their transport aircraft. Also, the Japanese unexpectedly encountered a number of Indian tanks, to which the lightly equipped infiltrators had little counter. The planning of U-Go, however, was too far advanced {{to take account of}} these developments.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the turmoil}} over the naturalization issue {{continued}} in Tunis with riots {{that started in}} the countryside, affected by famine. The nationalist press thus multiplied its criticism towards the Residence, which had decided to prohibit teachers and students from attending certain lessons. It also forbade the movement of officials and suspended nationalist newspapers, including L'Action Tunisienne on May 31. In addition, the Destour party was banned. The French government feeling that Manceron acted too late to <b>stand</b> <b>firm,</b> replaced him with Marcel Peyrouton, on July 29, 1933. In this repressive context, Bourguiba was deprived of his means of expression andwas a prisoner of the Destour structure that {{was willing to take}} back his autonomy.|$|E

25|$|Although not capped, Newham was {{severely}} affected by grant penalties. It {{had worked with}} the capped councils and decided to join the campaign: on 7 March the council members unanimously passed a motion declaring {{that they could not}} set a rate. Council deputy leader Alan Mattingly said that the majority of councillors would go to jail rather than cut services. It was soon clear that there was a significant split in the Labour group as Leader Jack Hart told a council meeting on 28 March that the Government would not increase their spending limit and urged members to be realistic. His ally, councillor David Gilles, proposed a budget of £151.5m. Alan Mattingly by contrast urged the council to <b>stand</b> <b>firm</b> and despite Hart's support the budget was defeated by 18 to 35; a budget proposed by the SDP was voted down by 20 to 33.|$|E
25|$|You write: „I came to {{liberate}} the Talysh Khanate {{from the hands of}} the Persians“, allow me, general, not to believe your lying words, for you, I will say frankly and directly, as you came here to enslave and oppress the Talysh people. While Mir Mustafa Khan is alive, your government will have to protect the Khan his rights, by treating him personally and with due care; but once he will die his heirs will lose its independence and autonomy, turning in speechless and unfortunate slaves, the fault of the mad and visionary would degenerate Mir Mustafa Khan, the same who pursue only their personal goals in order to meet their lust for power, being a heartless and hardened egoist, as they're not thinking about the sad and desolate future of their offspring, who will betray him to anathema, because they will invite you here and handing the fate of their homeland to unfaithful strangers — rapists turning his people into meaningless plebeians. The groans and screams of the dead people involved in this network of selfish schemer — Mir Mustafa Khan will form an eternal curse upon it, as long as the Talysh Mountains <b>stand</b> <b>firm,</b> the bitter mourning the unfortunate fate of the Talysh people.|$|E

500|$|By spring 1527, Luther reacted {{strongly}} to Zwingli's {{views in the}} treatise Dass Diese Worte Christi [...] "Das ist mein Leib etc." [...] noch fest stehen wider die Schwarmgeister (That These Words of Christ [...] "This is My Body etc." [...] Still <b>Stand</b> <b>Firm</b> Against the Fanatics). The controversy continued until 1528 when efforts to build bridges between the Lutheran and the Zwinglian views began. Martin Bucer tried to mediate while Philip of Hesse, who wanted to form a political coalition of all Protestant forces, invited the two parties to Marburg to discuss their differences. This event {{became known as the}} Marburg Colloquy.|$|E
500|$|Despite the LCL's defeat, {{the failure}} of the LM to gain {{internal}} supremacy over the conservatives was seen by the latter as a vindication of their policies. Pressure from the LCL's leader, Bruce Eastick, who called on the LM to disband, and the conservative wing of the party, saw machinations against the LM. Hall reiterated the LM's intention to continue, but Millhouse was removed as the LCL deputy leader in 1973, and pressure began to be mounted on the faction, which did not have any members on the frontbench; Hall did not pursue a position in the shadow ministry. Tension continued as rumours spread claiming that the LCL State Council was contemplating the forbidding [...] and vetoing of LM members from representing the party in elections. While Hall and Martin Cameron responded by publicly vowing to <b>stand</b> <b>firm,</b> several of their LM colleagues were ambivalent when asked about the intentions if the LM were no longer tolerated within the LCL. However, Heini Becker left the LM.|$|E
500|$|Later, despite Taylor's pleas to {{keep the}} {{dissolution}} of the HNC secret in the hope it would be reversed, Kỳ, Thi, Thiệu and Cang called a media conference, where they maintained the HNC had been dissolved in the nation's best interests. The quartet vowed to <b>stand</b> <b>firm</b> and not renege on their decision. They also proclaimed their ongoing confidence for Suu and Hương. Two days later, Khánh went public in support of the Young Turks' coup against the HNC, condemning the advisory body and asserting the army's right to intervene if [...] "disputes and differences create a situation favorable to the common enemies: Communism and colonialism". The generals announced they had formed a new body called the Armed Forces Council (AFC) to succeed the current Military Revolutionary Council, and referred to {{the dissolution of the}} HNC as Decision No. 1 of the AFC. The American policymakers viewed the public moves by the Vietnamese generals as [...] "throwing down the gauntlet" [...] and challenging their counsel.|$|E
