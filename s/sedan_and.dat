5|$|Guderian's {{plan for}} 13 May was straightforward. The 2nd Panzer Division {{in the north}} was to form the right flank of the assaulting force when it reached the Meuse near Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division, {{reinforced}} by the Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland, a battalion of assault engineers, and divisional artillery of the 2nd and 10th Panzer Divisions, {{was to make the}} main attack by crossing the Meuse just north of <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> seizing the Heights of la Marfee overlooking the city. The 10th Panzer Division was to cross the Meuse south of <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> protect the southern flank of the corps. Throughout the day, large masses of troops and equipment assembled north of the Meuse in preparation for the river crossing.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, the facelifted E Series 2 was {{released}} which {{uses the same}} drivetrain as the W427 with an upgraded dual plate clutch not found on previous models. Late in the model run, HSV released the limited edition GXP <b>sedan</b> <b>and</b> Maloo GXP ute, being amalgams of HSV and Pontiac G8/ST components.|$|E
5|$|The German High Command did {{not want}} to exploit the victory at <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> Bulson until the German {{infantry}} divisions had caught up with the three Panzer divisions. To Guderian, this was madness and would throw away the victory at <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> allow the enemy time to recover and reorganise his still formidable armoured units. Guderian decided to push for the Channel, even if it meant ignoring the High Command and Hitler himself. Guderian ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to hold the Sedan bridgehead, while the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions struck north west, towards the Channel. Now that they were pushing largely at an 'open door', the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions advanced into the undefended French rear with speed.|$|E

Featuring the base Barra 182 six-cylinder engine, air conditioning, front power windows, and five-speed manual transmission, with {{the choice of a}} four-speed automatic, the XT was sold in <b>sedan</b> <b>and</b> station wagon body types. The Barra 220 V8 engine was available as an option. Judges of the Australia's Best Cars awards crowned the XT Best Family Car in 2002, and again in 2004, with the Futura receiving the award in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lexus began {{sales of}} the GS 450h, a V6 hybrid {{performance}} <b>sedan,</b> <b>and</b> launched the fourth generation LS line, comprising both standard- and long-wheelbase V8 (LS 460 and LS 460 L) and hybrid (LS 600h and LS 600h L) versions. The fifth generation ES 350 also debuted in the same year. The LS 600h L subsequently went on sale as the most expensive sedan ever produced in Japan. By the end of 2006, Lexus' annual sales had reached 475,000 vehicles worldwide. In January 2007, Lexus announced a new F marque performance division, which would produce racing-inspired versions of its performance models. The IS F, made its debut at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, accompanied by a concept car, the LF-A.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sector}} of Longwy, <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> Namur, where the Ardennes and the River Meuse meet, the French Ninth Army and French Second Army were made up chiefly of poor quality divisions. Reinforcements were minimal, and those units were {{equipped}} with obsolete weapons. The resources at {{the disposal of}} the two Series B divisions, the 55th and later 71s Infantry Divisions, who were to bear the brunt of the attack, were weak. They had almost no Regular officers and they had not been broken-in to war conditions by being in contact with the enemy.|$|E

5|$|MacLachlan flew {{missions}} against rail {{targets in}} Nazi Germany on 23 May, attacking Bingen am Rhein. On 25 May he flew against targets near <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> his Battle was damaged by flak. The unit relocated to Moissy and he flew missions {{in support of}} French Army forces around Abbeville. On 10 June near Fleury, his cockpit hood was shot away by accurate ground fire but MacLachlan was unhurt. On 13 June he flew a daylight mission against German spearheads and while returning to base flew under a formation of Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. The escorting Bf 109s gave chase and shot one Battle down. MacLachlan claimed to have managed to fire on two Bf 109s and damaged them—these claims cannot be confirmed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 May, German Army Group A broke the defences at <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> was now free to drive for the English Channel. The Allies {{considered}} a wholesale withdrawal from the Belgian trap. The withdrawal would reflect three stages: the night of 16/17 May to the River Senne, the night of 17/18 May to the river Dendre and the night of 18/19 May to the river Scheldt. The Belgians were reluctant to abandon Brussels and Leuven, especially as the Dyle line had withstood German pressure well.|$|E

5|$|SS V-Series Special Edition: {{following}} the 2009 cancellation of Pontiac brand in North America, the Pontiac G8 front-end fascia and other trimmings were fitted to approximately 1,500 Commodore SS Vs. Unveiled at the 2009 Deniliquin ute muster on 2 October, sales began in November. Unlike the G8 {{which was only}} offered as a sedan, Holden issued utility, <b>sedan</b> <b>and</b> Sportwagon body variants of the Special Edition.

5|$|The Battle of Sedan or Second Battle of Sedan (12–15 May 1940) was a Second World War battle fought {{during the}} French Campaign. The battle {{was part of}} the German Wehrmachts {{operational}} plan codenamed Fall Gelb (Case Yellow) for an offensive through the hilly and heavily forested Ardennes, to encircle the Allied armies in Belgium and north-eastern France. German Army Group A crossed the Meuse river with the intention of capturing <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> pushing northwards towards the Channel coast, in order to entrap the Allied forces that were advancing east into Belgium, as part of the Allied Dyle Plan strategy.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffes {{target was}} the Marfee heights which lay behind Sedan {{to the south}} east. They {{contained}} the fortified artillery positions and dominated the approaches to the strategic and operational depths beyond <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> the Meuse. The Luftwaffe was two hours late in appearing but the effort made was considerable. The attacks were made in Gruppe (group) strength and against the line of maximum resistance along the enemy gun line. To restrict enemy movements and communications, German fighters swept the area to cut land-lines and strafe fortifications, with some shooting of radio antennae off command posts. The attacks isolated the forward defence lines. Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 struck first {{in the morning of}} 13 May. In just five hours, 500 Ju 87 sorties had been flown.|$|E

5|$|The third French army to see {{action on}} Belgian soil was the 9th. It was weaker than both the 7th and the 1st Armies. The 9th Army was {{allocated}} infantry divisions, {{with the exception}} of the 5th Motorised Infantry Division (5e DIM). Its mission was to protect the southern flank of the Allied armies, south of the Sambre river and just north of Sedan. Further south, in France, was the French 2nd Army, protecting the Franco-Belgian border between <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> Montmédy. The two weakest French armies were thus protecting the area of the main German thrust.|$|E
5|$|Toyota {{researchers}} {{visited the}} U.S. in May 1985 to conduct {{focus groups and}} market research on luxury consumers. During that time, several F1 designers rented a home in Laguna Beach, California to observe the lifestyles and tastes of American upper class consumers. Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads. Toyota’s market research concluded that a separate brand and sales channel were needed to present its new <b>sedan,</b> <b>and</b> plans were made {{to develop a new}} network of dealerships in the U.S. market.|$|E
5|$|Under an {{unsuccessful}} model sharing arrangement {{that was part}} of the Hawke Labor government reforms in 1989, which saw the formation of the United Australian Automobile Industries alliance between Holden and Toyota Australia, the latter began selling badge engineered versions of the VN Commodore manufactured by Holden. The rebadged Commodores were sold as the Toyota Lexcen, named after Ben Lexcen who was the designer of Australia II yacht that won the 1983 America's Cup. The original T1 Lexcen offered <b>sedan</b> <b>and</b> station wagon body forms in three levels of trim: base, GL and GLX. Moreover, they were only available with 3.8-litre V6 engine and automatic transmission combination.|$|E

5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black <b>Sedan</b> <b>and</b> Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play The Night is Young. After the play opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date.|$|E
5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE <b>sedan</b> <b>and</b> Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E
5|$|In May 1985, {{designers}} {{started work}} on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow front profile. By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a conventional production vehicle of the time (C'd 0.29). For the passenger cabin, the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather {{for two years before}} settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship <b>sedan,</b> <b>and</b> the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in September 1986, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 13 May 1987.|$|E
