25|$|Political {{instability}} soon returned, {{social unrest}} being the disagreeable norm. The conservative {{renovation of the}} Republic's institutions was abandoned and taken apart. Eventually the decisive civil war victory of the incomparable Julius Caesar (100–44), followed by his executive mastery and public-minded reforms, appeared as the necessary and welcome step forward toward resolution of the <b>sorry</b> <b>and</b> bloody débâcle at Rome. This, in the dramatic narrative of Theodore Mommsen.|$|E
25|$|Several {{days after}} the trial verdict, a letter was {{delivered}} to the Indonesian embassy in Canberra containing an unknown substance on 31 May 2005. It was later found to be non-toxic and was considered a hoax. The embassy was shut down for decontamination. With negotiations on a prisoner exchange agreement between Australia and Indonesia about to begin, the Australian Government condemned the actions saying if they {{were related to the}} Corby case they would not help. The Indonesian foreign ministry described the attack as a <b>sorry</b> <b>and</b> cowardly attempt at intimidating Indonesia, and said Indonesia would not succumb to such a threat.|$|E

25|$|The three {{serial killers}} ineptly destroy {{the cake and}} fail {{to make a new}} one. Satan's {{assistant}} Demonius finds a cake the exact size and shape of an Acura TSX as a last-minute substitute. Satan is infuriated that he did not receive the right cake. When Demonius points out that his guests are having fun regardless, Satan flies into a rage. The guests get upset and start to leave, and Satan realizes that, in trying to have a party like the girls on My Super Sweet 16, he became like one of them. He tells the crowd that he is <b>sorry</b> <b>and</b> invites everyone into the party, including the Catholic priests. Having arrived in Los Angeles, Butters uses a make-up mirror to summon Biggie Smalls to the party, who asks Butters to come in with him as thanks.|$|E
25|$|April 20, 2011 {{was the day}} it was {{revealed}} on the band's Facebook page that the band went on an infinite hiatus. 5 members (Farrell, Rampolla, Vigil, Ghazarian & Gibson) left, leaving the one singer (Liebsch) alone in the band. Soon after, Liebsch wrote a batch of paragraphs explaining how he's <b>sorry</b> <b>and</b> everything from the break up. He included that he had an alcohol problem. He'd steal money (not much in the beginning) from the band's funds to buy drinks. Then another member on the band's official Tumblr announced that Liebsch did not have a drinking problem and he stole money for other things. Despite the ex-members' statements, most fans and other touring bands had noted Liebsch's drinking as more than just social. Liebsch has stated to be sober since the exodus of the other members.|$|E

500|$|For [...] "Return to the Nightosphere", Moynihan {{designed}} a special pan, showcasing {{the landscape of}} the Nightosphere. His drawings, however, got lost three times during production, although they were finally located. Moynihan later noted on the season four DVD commentary for the episode that he had an ambition to design extremely long pans; he had created a similar one for the second season episode [...] "Death in Bloom". As for [...] "Daddy's Little Monster", an original version of the episode featured Hunson Abadeer pretending to be sick so that Marceline would feel <b>sorry</b> <b>and</b> take over his job. However this plot was later discarded. The beginning of the episode features Finn and Jake reviewing footage captured on Jake's camera phone. Ward noted that it was difficult to keep the action lively, while also framing the scene as if it were stationary phone footage.|$|E
500|$|When Homer is mowing {{his lawn}} with obvious frustration, his next-door {{neighbor}} Ned Flanders invites {{him into his}} basement rumpus room for a beer. Upon seeing Ned's house and observing his exaggeratedly perfect relationships {{with his wife and}} son, Homer erupts at Ned, accusing him of showing off. Ned angrily asks Homer to leave in response. Later, however, he feels guilty and writes a letter to Homer saying that he is really <b>sorry</b> <b>and</b> that he loves him as a brother. [...] Homer is amused by Ned's sentimentality and reads the letter to the family at the breakfast table. Marge is not happy with the family's reaction, despite being unable to control her laughter, and chastises Homer for making light of Ned's sincere apology. Afterward, Homer takes Bart and Maggie to Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre for a round of miniature golf. They unexpectedly run into Ned and his son Todd and end up going golfing together.|$|E
500|$|The Hallucination version {{had only}} a basic story concept, having dropped the {{previous}} scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship. In 2012, [...] scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said {{he was responsible for}} this version, as he wanted to make Biohazard 4 scarier [...] "and suggested using a particular scene from the film Lost Souls, where the main character [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose. An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man. The idea went through several iterations as Mr. Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have to say, was very romantic). Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up. Accompanied by a B.O.W. [...] dog, the two start to make their way up the castle. Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive." [...] Kawamura added he was very <b>sorry</b> <b>and</b> [...] "even ashamed" [...] that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version. After this attempt, the last canceled revision featured classic zombies again. However, it was discontinued after few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic.|$|E

"Short o" [...] before r {{before a}} vowel: In typical North American accents (U.S. and Canada alike), the {{historical}} sequence [...] (a short o sound followed by r {{and then another}} vowel, as in orange, forest, moral, and warrant) is realized as , thus further merging with the already-merged [...] (horse–hoarse) set.
