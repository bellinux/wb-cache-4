However, it is mentioned {{in more than one}} strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield. However, in the feature film Garfield Gets Real and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans. In the 1 April (April Fools' Day) 1997 strip, Garfield, still with thought balloons, can be understood by Jon.|$|E
500|$|Computer Gaming World {{described}} Lunar Lander in 1982 {{as one of}} {{the first}} fun programs entry level programmers start with and continually improve upon as they improve their skills. By 1973, there were numerous versions of the text-based game, and so many versions of the graphical game existed by 1981 that Electronic Games, in a review of a version by Scott Adams for Atari 8-bit computers and the TRS-80, claimed it was [...] "yet another entry in a field as crowded as the category of Space Invaders imitators. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> as though every company capable of copying a cassette is trying to sell a game on this theme." [...] According to the authors of Grand Thieves & Tomb Raiders, Moon Lander for the MK14 (1977) w{{as one of the}} first three commercial games in Britain for home computers. The game type even spawned at least one meta-game; Antic, in March 1986, named Lunar Lander Construction Set as its game of the month, a BASIC game for Atari 8-bit computers in which the player can construct their own version of the graphical Lunar Lander. In Science Fiction Video Games (2014), while discussing the games' lack of science fiction concepts like aliens or unrealistic physics, author Neal Roger Tringham described the series as [...] "one of the few video games to be based on to be based on a real space program, as opposed to the many games inspired by fictional forms of space exploration".|$|E
500|$|Billboard named Usher the Hot 100 Artist of the 2000s decade. Usher had {{the most}} no. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 charts with 7 and held the no. 1 {{position}} for a total 41 weeks. Confessions was ranked as the top solo album of the decade, selling 20 million copies worldwide. Considered by Bonsu Thompson of Vibe to be [...] "the Thriller of our generation", Damien Scott of Complex said it [...] "became pop culture catnip" [...] because of its theme. Pop music critic, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker remarks that [...] "For a while, Confessions was pop music" [...] and says it [...] "may {{turn out to have}} been the last true blockbuster in pop". Clay Cane said in 2008 [...] "We didn’t see pop-R artists on pop radio, and Usher is one of those people in the 90’s who was the catalyst for that; he was kind of the pioneer [...] He’s the greatest example of pure crossover success". Regarded as the best dancer in pop since Michael Jackson by writers of VH1 and The Guardian, Jody Rosen said in 2012 [...] "He's the biggest male pop singer in the world; <b>sometimes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> like he's the only one, in a marketplace still dominated by divas". Complex's Justin Charity referred to him as [...] "the greatest male pop singer of the past couple decades" [...] in 2015. He has attained 9 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, tied with the Bee Gees, Elton John, and Paul McCartney.|$|E

60|$|So I {{always had}} a rough time of it, no matter whose watch <b>it</b> was; and <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to me that Ritchie's good-natured badgering was pretty nearly as {{aggravating}} as Brown's dead-earnest nagging.|$|R
6000|$|... "Done?" [...] He gave a sorrowful laugh; and added, with an absent air, [...] "Yes, it's {{really like}} doing {{something}} to me! And <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> {{as if you had}} done it purposely." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> as if {{the summit}} would be cleared in a few moments, and smile in sunshine; but what was gained on one side was lost on another.

60|$|I {{have always}} been a little disconcerted by the passion women have for {{behaving}} beautifully at the death-bed of those they love. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> as if they grudge the longevity which postpones their chance of an effective scene.|$|E
60|$|<b>Sometimes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to Mrs Crich as if {{her husband}} were some subtle funeral bird, feeding on the miseries of the people. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> to her he was never {{satisfied}} unless there was some sordid tale being poured out to him, which he drank in {{with a sort of}} mournful, sympathetic satisfaction. He would have no RAISON D'ETRE if there were no lugubrious miseries in the world, as an undertaker would have no meaning if there were no funerals.|$|R
60|$|Pony {{himself could}} never be exactly sure whether he had waited {{on the front steps}} and seen the circus magician or not. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> all of <b>it</b> like a dream, and {{sometimes}} only part of it. Jim Leonard tried to help him make it out, but they could not. He said it was a pity he had overslept himself, for if he had come to bid Pony good-bye, the way he said, then he could have told just how much of it was a dream and how much was not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it wasn't my fault," [...] he said slowly. [...] "If {{they wanted}} to look {{sideways}} at me {{it was up to}} them. And {{it was up to me}} to sidestep if I wanted to, wasn't it? You've no idea, Saxon, how a prizefighter is run after. Why, <b>sometimes</b> <b>it's</b> <b>seemed</b> to me that girls an' women ain't got an ounce of natural shame in their make-up.

6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} you really care," [...] she said. [...] "Men get so much {{into the habit of}} saying that sort of thing to women. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me they must do a great deal of mischief. But you--Is that really your wish?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The two drew near. [...] "It {{is so hard}} to explain," [...] she said. [...] "Things {{that one}} hardly sees for oneself. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> one cannot help oneself.

She had seen so little of him since, she had gone through so many years, that she had now to retrace her steps very far back to recognize him plainly in the mist of time. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that her daughter-in-law was talking of some strange man.|$|R
