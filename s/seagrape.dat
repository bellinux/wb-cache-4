40|$|Introduction: In Fiji, edible {{seaweeds}} are {{an important}} part of the diet of coastal people. Native Fijians have a long tradition of collecting and consuming different species and varieties of seaweeds. However, Caulerpa racemosa or <b>seagrapes</b> is one of the most common species that is regularly harvested for consumption and sale in Fiji (Morris and Bala, 2011; Richards. et al., 1993). Nama is a highly nutritious sea vegetable rich in iodine, vitamin A and carotenoids and is therefore an important part of the diet for coastal people. According to South (1993 a), commercialization of edible seaweeds is a relatively recent phenomenon that coincides with the expansion of the cash economy in the Pacific. A major problem with C. racemosa however, is its perishable nature which prevents it from being stored long after harvest. Its utilisation within the Pacific has thus been restricted to domestic trade and consumption (Chamberlain, 1997). The aim of this project is to explore and develop an ideal preservation method for <b>seagrapes</b> that would be acceptable to consumers and make it possible for exporting...|$|R

50|$|Moist {{forests are}} {{classified}} as being either lowland mesic, montane mesic, lowland wet, or montane wet. Characteristic lowland species are Haitian catalpa (Catalpa longissima), particularly in well-drained soils, and West Indian mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni). Puerto Rican royal palm (Roystonea borinquena) is common where soil is calcareous. Paradise tree (Simarouba glauca), anón de majagua (Lonchocarpus heptaphyllus), jagua (Genipa americana), black olive (Bucida buceras), West Indian lancewood (Oxandra lanceolata) and amacey (Tetragastris balsamifera) are found in small secondary stands.

Areas where soils are superficial or savannas have formed from degraded forest are indicated by trees such as the sandpaper tree (Curatella americana), grandleaf <b>seagrape</b> (Coccoloba pubescens), Jamaican nettletree (Trema micrantha) and Tabebuia species. Cashews (Anacardium occidentale) are present in zones that have marginal earth and precipitation closer {{to that of the}} dry forests. Yellow olivier (Buchenavia capitata), sablito (Schefflera morototoni), maricao (Byrsonima spicata) aguacatillo (Alchornea latifolia), West Indian cherry (Prunus myrtifolia), árbol de Santa Maria (Calophyllum brasiliense), cocuyo (Hirtella triandra), American muskwood (Guarea guidonia), palo de yagua (Casearia arborea), locust (Hymenaea courbaril), balatá (Manilkara domingensis) and sierra palm (Prestoea montana) grow in mesic forests. Hispaniolan pine (Pinus occidentalis) is common on lateritic soils. Wet forests consist of trees covered by parasitic plants and epiphytes. The principal indicator species include tree ferns (Cyathea spp.) and Chionanthus species. At higher elevations, characteristic species are the trembling schefflera (Schefflera tremula), black sapote (Diospyros digyna), almendrón (Prunus occidentalis), Fadyen's silktassel (Garrya fadyenii), Weinmannia pinnata, Oreopanax capitatus, Brunellia comocladifolia, Hispaniolan pines, and Cyathea species.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{capacity}} of the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungus, Scleroderma bermudense, to alleviate saline stress in <b>seagrape</b> (Coccoloba uvifera L.) seedlings. Plants were grown over a range (0, 200, 350 and 500 mM) of NaCl levels for 12 weeks, after 4 weeks of non-saline pre-treatment under greenhouse conditions. Growth and mineral nutrition of the <b>seagrape</b> seedlings were stimulated by S. bermudense regardless of salt stress. Although ECM colonization was reduced with increasing NaCl levels, ECM dependency of <b>seagrape</b> seedlings increased. Tissues of ECM plants had significantly increased concentrations of P and K but lower Na and Cl concentrations than those of non-ECM plants. Higher K concentrations in the leaves of ECM plants suggested a higher osmoregulating capacity of these plants. Moreover, the water status of ECM plants was improved despite their higher evaporative leaf surface. The results suggest that the reduction in Na and Cl uptake together with a concomitant increase in P and K absorption and a higher water status in ECM plants may be important salt-alleviating mechanisms for <b>seagrape</b> seedlings growing in saline soils...|$|E

(<b>seagrape)</b> mature trees and seedlings naturally regenerating in four littoral forests of the Guadeloupe island (Lesser Antilles). We collected 546 sporocarps, 49 sclerotia, and morphotyped 26, 722 root tips from mature trees and seedlings. Seven EM fungal species only were recovered among sporocarps (Cantharellus cinnabarinus, Amanita arenicola, Russula cremeolilacina, Inocybe littoralis, Inocybe xerophytica, Melanogaster sp., and Scleroderma bermudense) and one EM fungal species from sclerotia (Cenococcum geophilum). After internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing, the EM root tips fell into 15 EM fungal taxa including 14 basidiomycetes and 1 ascomycete identified. Sporocarp survey only weakly reflected belowground assessment of the EM fungal community, although 5 fruiting species were found on roots. <b>Seagrape</b> seedlings and mature trees had very similar communities of EM fungi, dominated by S. bermudense, R. cremeolilacina, and two Thelephoraceae: shared species represented 93 % of the taxonomic EM fungal diversity and 74 % of the sampled EM root tips. Furthermore, some significant differences were observed between the frequencies of EM fungal taxa on mature trees and seedlings. The EM fungal community composition also varied between the four investigated sites. We discuss the reasons for such a species-poor community and the possible role of common mycorrhizal networks linking <b>seagrape</b> seedlings and mature trees in regeneration of coastal forests...|$|E

The objectives of this research are to investigate the effect of extraction time (1, 2, 3 days) and ratio of sample-solvent (1 : 5, 1 : 10, 1 : 15 wv- 1) in ethyl acetate extraction on antibacterial activity of dry C. lentilifera by using disk diffusion method followed by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 120, 60, 30, 15, and 7. 5 μl and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) test against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. To determine the total phenolic compound {{to find out the}} relationship between antimicrobial activity and phenolic compound. The pathogenic bacteria used in this research are Staphylococcus aureus (FNCC 167), Escherichia coli (FNCC 194), Salmonella typhimurium (FNCC 0050) and Bacillus cereus (FNCC 0057). The antibacterial testing showed that inhibitory effect of C. lentilifera increased by increasing time of extraction and ratio of sample-solvent. The highest inhibitory action was achieved maximum level on 72 hours of extraction with ratio 1 : 15 wv- 1. Caulerpa lentilifera has MIC value around 1. 5 – 6 mg ml- 1 which is classified as strong inhibitor and ratio of MBC : MIC value less than 4 which is considered as bactericidal agent against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
