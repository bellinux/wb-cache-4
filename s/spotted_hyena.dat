5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> is {{the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social {{organisation}} is unlike {{that of any other}} carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-size, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. <b>Spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> is {{a highly}} {{successful}} animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success {{is due in part}} to its adaptability and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. The <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2–5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60km/h.|$|E
500|$|While female <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as hermaphrodites or as intersex, and scientists of antiquity (ancient and later historical times) believed that they were hermaphrodites, modern scientists do not refer to them as such. That designation is typically reserved for those who simultaneously exhibit features of both sexes; the genetic makeup of female <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> [...] "are clearly distinct" [...] from male <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas,</b> the female's pseudo-penis can be {{distinguished}} from the male's penis by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In {{both male and female}} <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas,</b> the base of the glans is covered with penile spines.|$|R
5|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> {{dominate}} other hyena species wherever their ranges overlap. Brown <b>hyenas</b> encounter <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> in the Kalahari, {{where the}} brown species outnumbers the spotted. The two species typically encounter {{each other on}} carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, brown hyenas will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls. This usually {{has the effect of}} seemingly confusing <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas,</b> which will act bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between <b>spotted</b> and striped <b>hyenas</b> in the Serengeti.|$|R
5|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> {{societies}} {{are more complex}} than those of other carnivorous mammals, and are remarkably {{similar to those of}} cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be more reliable than others, recognise third-party kin and rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in hyena {{societies are}} not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks. In this latter trait, the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> clans are very rare. The social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors. Environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance; individual factors include preference to bond with females and with kin; and topological effects include the tendency to close triads in the network. Female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> is {{the most}} {{carnivorous}} member of the Hyaenidae. Unlike its brown and striped cousins, the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> is a predator, not a scavenger; this has been shown since the 1960s. One of the earliest studies to demonstrate their hunting abilities was done by Hans Kruuk, an African wildlife ecologist, and he showed through a 7-year study of hyena populations in Africa that spotted hyenas hunt as much as lions, and with later studies this {{has been shown to}} be the average in all areas of Africa. However spotted hyenas remain being mislabeled as scavengers, often even by ecologists and wildlife documentary channels.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> {{can be traced back}} to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. <b>Spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. <b>Spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.|$|R
50|$|Attacks {{on humans}} by <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> are underreported. A pair of hyenas were {{responsible}} for killing 27 people in Mulanje, Malawi in 1962. In 1910 <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> were observed to kill sufferers of African sleeping sickness as they slept outside in camps.|$|R
25|$|Although <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> do prey {{on humans}} in modern times, such {{incidents}} are rare. However, {{according to the}} SGDRN (Sociedade para a Gestão e Desenvolvimento da Reserva do Niassa Moçambique), attacks on humans by <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> {{are likely to be}} underreported. According to hyena expert Dr. Hans Kruuk, man-eating <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> tend to be very large specimens: A pair of man-eating hyenas, responsible for killing 27 people in Mulanje (Mlanje), Malawi in 1962, were weighed at 72kg (159lb) and 77kg (170lb) after being shot. In 1903, Hector Duff wrote of how <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> in the Mzimba district of Angoniland would wait at dawn outside people's huts and attack them when they opened their doors. Victims of <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> tend to be women, children and sick or infirm men: Theodore Roosevelt wrote on how in 1908–1909 in Uganda, <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> regularly killed sufferers of African sleeping sickness as they slept outside in camps. <b>Spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> are widely feared in Malawi, where they have been known to occasionally attack people at night, particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside. Hyena attacks were widely reported in Malawi's Phalombe plain, to the north of Michesi Mountain. Five deaths were recorded in 1956, five in 1957 and six in 1958. This pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed. Attacks occurred most commonly in September, when people slept outdoors, and bush fires made the hunting of wild game difficult for the hyenas. An anecdotal news report from the World Wide Fund for Nature 2004 indicates that 35 people were killed by <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> in a 12-month period in Mozambique along a 20km stretch of road near the Tanzanian border.|$|R
5|$|Compared {{to other}} hyenas, the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> shows a greater {{relative}} amount of frontal cortex which {{is involved in}} the mediation of social behavior. Studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> and primate intelligence. A study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that spotted hyenas outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem-solving tests; captive pairs of spotted hyenas were challenged to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward, successfully cooperating and learning the maneuvers quickly without prior training. Experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced clan-mates to solve the problem. In contrast, chimps and other primates often require extensive training, and cooperation between individuals is not always as easy for them. The intelligence of the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> was attested to by Dutch colonists in 19th-century South Africa, who noted that hyenas were exceedingly cunning and suspicious, particularly after successfully escaping from traps. Spotted hyenas seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance; hyenas have been observed to indulge in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras, a behaviour which does not occur when they target other prey species. Also, spotted hyenas have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace. Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls in attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> {{is usually}} portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the genus Crocuta diverged from Hyaena (the genus of striped and brown hyenas) 10 million years ago. The {{ancestors of}} the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses, which forced them to operate in teams. At one point in their evolution, spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars; this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity, {{as is the case}} for brown and striped hyenas, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's land. It has been theorised that female dominance in <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills, and thus ensure that enough milk is produced for their cubs. Another theory is that it is an adaptation to the length of time it takes for cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws, thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females. Its appearance in Europe and China during the Cromerian period coincided with the decline and eventual extinction of Pachycrocuta brevirostris, the giant short-faced hyena. As {{there is no evidence of}} environmental change being responsible, it is likely that the giant short-faced hyena became extinct due to competition with the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena.</b>|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Psychological SciencesJerome FriemanSpotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) live in highly-complex, female-dominated groups called “clans. ” Due {{to their}} social arrangement, <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> were a logical species {{on which to}} test the social {{complexity}} hypothesis. In the present study, they were presented {{with a series of}} puzzle boxes designed to test problem-solving behavior. The five puzzles varied in difficulty. All <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> solved the puzzle with the lowest difficulty level, five out of six solved the medium puzzles at least once, and one out of six solved the high difficulty puzzle. Some decreases in behavior diversity and time working on the puzzles were observed over successful trials; however, the decreases were only significant for successful trials of one medium-level puzzle. Decreases in work time were observed for some unsuccessful trials and the decrease was statistically significant for the highest difficulty puzzle. Overall, <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> were proficient at problem solving in the present study. Social learning is an important component of a lengthy juvenile period for <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas,</b> and they have also been shown to influence one another’s feeding behavior. Furthermore, <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> participate in scramble competition when feeding and forage for and hoard food. In light of these behaviors, social learning was examined using the social transmission of a flavor preference (STFP) procedure. STFP was not observed overall. The sex of the subjects did not significantly influence the results; however, subjects that interacted with each other longer {{were significantly more likely to}} show STFP. The STFP procedure may not be sensitive enough to detect social learning in <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas.</b> Perhaps <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> have no need to learn STFP due to their digestive and/or immune systems. The results of the current experiments make important contributions to existing knowledge. Data from other species like <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> are vital for evaluating the generality of the social complexity hypothesis since support thus far has come from data on primates. This study was the first to investigate STFP in a species from the Feliformia suborder. Additionally, finding more evidence that <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> have advanced cognitive abilities is essential for researchers and zoo personnel who work with <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> in captivity...|$|R

50|$|Mammal: There are no {{confirmed}} {{cases of}} sex role reversed mammals but female <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> have peculiar anatomy and behaviour that has warranted much attention. Female <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> {{are much more}} aggressive than males due to their high levels of androgens during development. The increased male hormones during development contribute to an enlarged pseudopenis that is involved in mating and birth.

5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> (Crocuta crocuta), {{also known}} as the {{laughing}} hyena, is a species of hyena, currently classed as the sole member of the genus Crocuta, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals. The species is, however, experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching. The species may have originated in Asia, and once ranged throughout Europe for at least one million years {{until the end of the}} Late Pleistocene. The <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> is the largest known member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build, its rounded ears, its less prominent mane, its spotted pelt, its more dual purposed dentition, its fewer nipples and the presence of a pseudo-penis in the female. It is the only mammalian species to lack an external vaginal opening.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> (cave hyena subspecies) is {{depicted}} in {{a few examples of}} Upper Palaeolithic rock art in France. A painting from the Chauvet Cave depicts a hyena outlined and represented in profile, with two legs, with its head and front part with well distinguishable spotted coloration pattern. Because of the specimen's steeped profile, it is thought that the painting was originally meant to represent a cave bear, but was modified as a hyena. In Lascaux, a red and black rock painting of a hyena is present in the part of the cave known as the Diverticule axial, and {{is depicted}} in profile, with four limbs, showing an animal with a steep back. The body and the long neck have spots, including the flanks. An image on a cave in Ariège shows an incompletely outlined and deeply engraved figure, representing a part of an elongated neck, smoothly passing into part of the animal’s forelimb on the proximal side. Its head is in profile, with a possibly re-engraved muzzle. The ear is typical of the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena,</b> as it is rounded. An image in the Le Gabillou Cave in Dordogne shows a deeply engraved zoomorphic figure with a head in frontal view and an elongated neck with part of the forelimb in profile. It has large round eyes and short, rounded ears which are set far from each other. It has a broad, line-like mouth that evokes a smile. Though originally thought to represent a composite or zoomorphic hybrid, it is probable it is a <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> based on its broad muzzle and long neck.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> {{has been}} hunted for its body parts {{for use in}} {{traditional}} medicine, for amusement, and for sport, though this is rare, as the species is generally not considered attractive. There is fossil evidence of humans in Middle Pleistocene Europe butchering and presumably consuming spotted hyenas. Such incidences are rare in modern Africa, where most tribes, even those known to eat unusual kinds of meat, generally despise hyena flesh.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the striped}} hyena, {{for which a}} number of {{subspecies}} were proposed in light of its extensive modern range, the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> is a genuinely variable species, both temporally and spatially. Its range once encompassed almost all of Africa and Eurasia, and displayed a large degree of morphological geographic variation, which led to an equally extensive set of specific and subspecific epithets. It was gradually realised {{that all of this}} variation could be applied to individual differences in a single subspecies. In 1939, biologist L. Harrison Matthews demonstrated through comparisons between a large selection of <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> skulls from Tanzania that all the variation seen in the then recognised subspecies could also be found in a single population, with the only set of characters standing out being pelage (which is subject to a high degree of individual variation) and size (which is subject to Bergmann's Rule). When fossils are taken into consideration, the species displayed even greater variation than it does in modern times, and a number of these named fossil species have since been classed as synonymous with Crocuta crocuta, with firm evidence of there being more than one species within the genus Crocuta still lacking.|$|E
5|$|Bosman and Kolben's {{descriptions}} went largely unnoticed until 1771, {{when the}} Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant, in his Synopsis of Quadrupeds, used the descriptions, {{as well as}} his personal experience with a captive specimen, as a basis for consistently differentiating the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> from the striped. The description given by Pennant was precise enough to be included by Johann Erxleben in his Systema regni animalis by simply translating Pennant's text into Latin. Crocuta was finally recognised as a separate genus from Hyaena in 1828.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E

5|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas,</b> who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|R
5|$|Although cheetahs and leopards {{preferentially}} prey {{on smaller}} animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills {{when the opportunity}} presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to hyenas. There are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas. Hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; {{there is at least}} one record of a young adult male leopard dying from a septicemia infection caused by wounds inflicted by a <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena.</b> There is also a case of two spotted hyenas killing and eating a young leopard in Timbavati Game Reserve, after a young hyena was killed by the leopard.|$|E
5|$|Both Björn Kurtén and Camille Arambourg {{promoted}} an Asiatic origin for the species; Kurtén focussed {{his arguments}} on the Plio-Pleistocene taxon Crocuta sivalensis from the Siwaliks, a view defended by Arambourg, who nonetheless allowed {{the possibility of}} an Indo-Ethiopian origin. This stance was contested by Ficarelli and Torre, who referred to evidence of the spotted hyena's presence from African deposists dating from the early Pleistocene, a similar age to the Asian C. sivalensis. Studies on the phylogeographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes indicates three migration events from Africa to Eurasia, though neither the topology of the phylogenetic tree or the fossil record exclude {{the possibility of an}} Asian origin. The earliest migration of spotted hyenas from Africa to Eurasia began less than 3.5 million years ago, most probably from the area where the first <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> fossils were discovered, reaching East Asia and most likely also Pakistan. The second migration of spotted hyenas occurred less than 1.3–1.5 million years ago and resulted in the first arrival of hyenas in Europe and a separation of African spotted hyenas into a southern and a northern population. The third <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> migration took place 0.36 million years ago, starting from the northern African population and reaching both Europe and Asia. Unlike other African carnivores, {{with the exception of the}} leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that spotted hyenas underwent a genetic bottleneck during the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyena</b> was {{widespread}} throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is present in}} all habitats save for the most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests {{and the top of}} alpine mountains. Its current distribution is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded i.a. on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.|$|E
40|$|In Late Pleistocene Italy, <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> {{competed in}} certain niche {{dimensions}} with wolves {{and in other}} dimensions with Paleolithic humans. <b>Spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> of the Italian peninsula consumed essentially the same ungulate species as Paleolithic humans did, and both of these predators depended heavily on bone marrow. Wolves tended to consume more hillside-adapted ungulates {{in the same area}} and period, suggesting some spatial separation of the three predators according to topography. There is complete overlap in the prey age groups commonly harvested by <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> and wolves, but pronounced differences between this pair of predators and Paleolithic humans of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods; from the narrow perspective of ungulate exploitation, Middle and Upper Paleolithic humans were quite similar. Taken together, there is good evidence for niche separation among the three ungulate predators during the Late Pleistocene in Italy. The intensity of bone transport to and modification at dens by hyenas varied greatly with circumstance and prey body size, indicating that prey size must be carefully controlled in comparisons of predator behavior. Populations of wolves and humans appear to have expanded toward the end of <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> ʼ tenure on the Italian peninsula, and disappearance of the <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> from Eurasia may be best explained by rapid transformations of ecosystem structure associated with global warming after 13 KYA.

Lions typically prey on adult males, while both <b>spotted</b> <b>hyenas</b> and leopards tend to prey on young calves.
