The analysis included 2026 barrier impact cases that {{were selected from}} 12 -years of in-depth crash data available through the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) / Crashworthiness Data System (CDS). Secondary collisions were found to occur in approximately one-third of tow-away level crashes where a traffic barrier was the first object struck. Secondary crashes were found to primarily involve an impact to another vehicle, an impact to another barrier, or a rollover; tree and pole impacts were found to represent a much smaller proportion of secondary impacts. Through {{a detailed analysis of}} vehicle trajectory, this study supports previous research suggesting <b>secondary</b> <b>collision</b> risk is substantial even for vehicles not ultimately involved in a <b>secondary</b> <b>collision.</b> Compared to a single barrier impact, the occurrence of a <b>secondary</b> <b>collision</b> was found to increase the risk of serious occupant injury by a factor of 3. 5, equivalent to the serious injury risk difference found between a belted and unbelted occupant in a traffic barrier crash...|$|E

40|$|A {{wireless}} ad hoc {{network is}} a collection of radio nodes (transceivers) located in a geographic region. Each node is equipped with an omnidirectional antenna and has limited transmission power. A communication session is established either through a single-hop radio transmission if the communication parties are close enough, or through relaying by intermediate nodes otherwise. A channel assignment to the nodes in a wireless as hoc network should avoid two collisions. The primary collision occurs when a node simultaneously transmits and receives signals over the same channel. The <b>secondary</b> <b>collision</b> occurs when a node simultaneously receives more than one signals over the same channel. Thus, to prevent the primary collision, two nodes can be assigned the same channel if and only if neither of them is within the transmission range of the other. Similarly, to prevent the <b>secondary</b> <b>collision,</b> two nodes can be assigned the same channel if and only if no other node is located in the intersection of their transmission ranges. The conflict-free channel assignment problem seeks an assignment of the fewest channels to a given set of radio nodes with specified transmission ranges without any primary collision or <b>secondary</b> <b>collision.</b> It is a classic and fundamental problem in wireless ad hoc networks [1][2][4][11][12][16][15]. It is NP-hard even when all nodes are located in a plane and have the same transmission radii [14]. Therefore, only polynomial-time approximation algorithms can be expected. The performance of a polynomial-time approximation algorithm is measured by it...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{farms are}} known to source of {{disturbance}} for the wildlife within {{the area in which}} the farm is build. This disturbance mostly manifests itself in the displacement of animals out of the area. With bird species this disturbance also includes the risk of colliding with the wind turbines, what could result in injuries or death. Collisions with the turbines can be classified as being primary or secondary, in which primary collision concerns the direct contact with parts of the turbine and <b>secondary</b> <b>collision</b> concerns the bird being brought out of balance during fleight, causing it to crash, by the wake behind the turbine. The different air conditions within the wake could surprise the bird during flight, forcing it to deviate from its path. The level of riks is determined by the characterisitics of the bird and the wind turbine. This risk level is mostly calculated by using a bottom up method in which the risk is determined by the amount of victims found beneath the turbines. This number is then extrapolated to the number of birds passing the wind farm. To deternine the risk of collisions prior to the construction of the wind farm, a model can be used. This report describes a model-based approach to determine the expected number of collisions within a certain area prior to the wind farm construction. The method of calculating the risk is divided into a primary collision risk, a <b>secondary</b> <b>collision</b> riks, and a method to calculate the number of birds passing the wind turbines, thereby being at risk of colliding with a turbine. This model provides a full, species specific impression of the number of collision expected when a construction of a wind farm is planned within a certain area. The incorporation of the <b>secondary</b> <b>collision</b> risk is an innovation compared to the already known risk models. The <b>secondary</b> <b>collision</b> risk is equal, or even larger, than the primary collision risk making it a vital component of the collision risk model. This model helps with the disicion of the location of a planned wind farm as it indicates the effects on the bird population within the area of construction. If a negative effect cannot be excluded, changing the location of the wind farm could be necessary...|$|E

In this study a numerical optimization scheme is formulated to minimize the maximum deviation from the original intended lane using individual wheel braking. The optimal braking sequences are analyzed and dynamic switching between several strategies {{is found to be}} necessary. In particular, two distinguished strategies are qualified at the vehicle body level. The results can be used to develop a robust closed-loop control strategy...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the path of}} vehicles following a collision with another vehicle at a metropolitan intersection. The aim was to provide guidance to transport authorities on roadside design at intersections to protect vehicles from secondary impacts with roadside objects. Detailed information from in-depth investigations of 78 intersection crashes was analysed. Crashes at singalised and unsignalised intersections were analysed separately. Thirty two vehicles at signalised and unsignalised intersections (16 at each) {{were involved in a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>collision.</b> Nine of these collisions were more severe than the initial vehicle-to-vehicle collision, three at signalised intersections and six at unsignalised intersections. Following the vehicle-tovehicle impact at both signalised and unsignalised intersections, {{more than half of the}} vehicles came to rest within 10 metres of the impact point. However, more than a quarter travelled 15 metres or further and around 10 % travelled further than 27 metres. It was found that 40 % of vehicles at signalised intersections crossed the designated pedestrian crossing areas following a collision between vehicles. It was also found that 14 % of vehicles involved in crashes at signalised intersections departed the roadway. This poses a significant risk to pedestrians who are in the vicinity of junctions at the time of collisions. Graphical representations of the percentage of vehicles that travel through a given sector relative to the impact point following the metropolitan intersection crashes were developed.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{motivation for}} exotic stable massive particles (SMPs) {{and the results}} of SMP searches at non-collider facilities are reviewed.

The discovery of SMPs would address a number of important questions in modern physics, such as the origin and composition of dark matter and the unifi-cation of the fundamental forces. This review outlines the scenarios predicting SMPs and the techniques used at non-collider experiments to look for SMPs in cosmic rays and bound in mat-ter.

40|$|This paper investigates brake-based path {{control of}} a {{passenger}} vehicle, aimed at reducing <b>secondary</b> <b>collision</b> risk following an initial impact in a traffic accident. Previous results from numerical optimisation showed that, at varying severity levels of post-impact states, there exist three identifiable components within the optimal control strategy so as to reduce the lateral deviation. The paper presents a path controller, based on nonlinear optimal control theory, that incorporates the three components. It is shown that friction adaptation may be implemented in a very efficient manner; the controller deals with different levels of road friction by scaling the dynamic variables from a fixed reference level. The approach provides an algorithm for adapting switching thresholds between the different components of the controller. In this study it is verified that the controller can deal {{with a wide range}} of kinematic conditions, and compares favorably with previous results of open-loop trajectory optimisation.

The double protection system incorporating the stroke limit of the accumulator piston and the unloading circuit can effectively prevent the <b>secondary</b> <b>collision</b> in the testing process.

40|$|Disruptive {{collisions}} in {{the asteroid}} belt produced groups of fragments known as the asteroid families. The studies of identified asteroid families help us to better understand issues related to impact physics, space weathering, asteroid interior, and collisional evolution of the main belt. Here, we analyze a family near the central main belt asteroid (2384) Schulhof. We show that the previously found group of objects around (81337) 2000 GP 36 is actually a sub-cluster in the larger Schulhof family. Using backward integrations we demonstrate that the orbits of sub-cluster asteroids converge to that of (2384) Schulhof at 780 ± 100 kyr ago, suggesting that the breakup event happened very recently. Interestingly, a similar analysis of the two newly discovered members of the Schulhof family may indicate a second event 100 kyr ago (e. g., <b>secondary</b> <b>collision,</b> fission, satellite instability). If confirmed, the formation history of the Schulhof family would suggest that small asteroids may have very colorful lifetimes.

40|$|The {{statistical}} coalescence {{model for}} the production of open and hidden charm is considered within the canonical ensemble formulation. The data for the J/ψ multiplicity in Pb+Pb collisions at 158 A·GeV are used for the model prediction of the open charm yield which has not yet been measured in these reactions. The charmonium states J/ψ and ψ ′ have been measured in nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions at CERN SPS over the last 15 years by the NA 38 and NA 50 Collaborations. This experimental program was motivated by a suggestion [1] to use the J/ψ as a probe of the state of matter created in the early stage of the collision. In this approach a significant suppression of J/ψ production relative to Drell–Yan lepton pairs is predicted when going from peripheral to central Pb+Pb interactions at 158 A·GeV. This is originally attributed to the formation of a quark-gluon plasma, but could be also explained in microscopic hadron models as <b>secondary</b> <b>collision</b> effects (see [2] and references therein).

40|$|The {{calculated}} {{upper limit}} Kipol state {{is used as}} input to investigate the prospects for achieving Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The heating rate of the trap population by <b>secondary</b> <b>collisions</b> of the hot products {{of the process of}} ionization—i. e., ground-state atoms, ions, and dimer-ions—with cold trapped metastable atoms is discussed in terms of a semiclassical model. An important step lies in limiting the depth of the magnetic trap to a value of a few millikelvin, to limit the range of small-angle scattering that contributes to heating. Also, a tight radial confinement reduces the probability for <b>secondary</b> <b>collisions.</b> At a trap depth of 10 mK, a radial dimension of 3 µm, and a density of 2 × 1013 cm- 3 the heating rate is 1. 4 µK/s, which should be compared to the transition temperature to BEC of 0. 6 µK. The collisional heating is dominated by ion—metastable-atom collisions, due to their long-range charge-induced dipole interaction. Keeping the evaporative cooling switched on at T=TC reduces the heating a hundredfold. Using a bright beam of laser cooled neon atoms, an initial population of 2 ̆ 6 gt; 1010 atoms can be loaded into a magneto-optical trap in one second. Tight magnetic traps are easy to achieve for metastable neon atoms, due to their magnetic moment of 3 µB. We conclude that achieving BEC is feasible for metastable neon. This also holds for triplet metastable helium, once the loading rate of traps has been improved. Finally, the semiclassical model used for calculating the heating rate is applicable {{to a wide range of}} inelastic collisions in trapped alkali gases and/or collisions with background gas...|$|R
40|$|In several {{experiments}} with ultracold trapped atoms, a narrow loss feature {{has been observed}} near an atom-dimer resonance, at which there is an Efimov trimer at the atom-dimer threshold. The conventional interpretation of these loss features {{is that they are}} produced by the avalanche mechanism, in which the energetic atom and dimer from 3 -body recombination undergo <b>secondary</b> elastic <b>collisions</b> that produce additional atoms with sufficient energy to escape from the trapping potential. We use Monte Carlo methods to calculate the average number of atoms lost and the average heat generated by recombination events in a Bose-Einstein condensate and in a thermal gas. We improve on previous models by taking into account the energy-dependence of the cross sections, the spacial structure of the atom cloud, and the elastic scattering of the atoms. We show that the avalanche mechanism cannot produce a narrow loss feature near the atom-dimer resonance. The number of atoms lost from a recombination event can be more than twice as large as the 3 that would be obtained in the absence of <b>secondary</b> <b>collisions.</b> However the resulting loss feature is broad and its peak is at a scattering length that is larger than the atom-dimer resonance and depends on the trap depth.
