50|$|E. lineata is {{native to}} shallow {{temperate}} waters in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, where it occurs between Cape Cod and Cape Hatteras. It is typically found in rock crevices and on and under rocks in the <b>sublitoral</b> <b>zone</b> at depths to 20 m, but can also be infaunal, burrowing in soft sediment. It sometimes occurs in large numbers.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} on the soft bottom in the <b>sublitoral</b> <b>zone</b> of the Furugelm Island (Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan) to study formation of benthic communities. Boxes with defauned sediments were placed on depths of 4, 6 and 13 m and exposed during 60 days in the summer period. Half of them were covered with a net with mesh size 2 cm to prevent effect of large predators. It was found that spatial pattern of invertebrates' sinking in the bay conforms to distribution of benthic communities. Larvae of benthic invertebrates sinks in general in places inhabited by their adult species. The main factors responsible for recolonzation are: sediment type and local hydrodynamic conditions. Heart-shaped sea urchin Echinocardium cordatum is numerically dominated in the bay on depth 3 - 4. 5 m, but its larvae sinks in the deeper area. Community structure is supported by mature specimen migration to places inhabited by species. Predators affect largely on the species...|$|E
40|$|The genus Lepidochitona {{is one of}} {{the most}} diverse in the Southern Caribbean. In order to {{describe}} this new species, twenty specimens of L. bullocki sp. nov. were collected by hand on the rocky coast, from 0. 25 to 1. 5 m depth, and a shore distance of 1 to 5 m, between the Northern section of Rodadero beach and Puerto Luz, in Santa Marta, Colombia. The specimens were small, with maximum observed size of 7. 3 mm. This is the fourth species of the genus Lepidochitona described for the Caribbean. The previously known species were L. liozonis (Dall y Simpson 1901), L. rosea (Kaas 1972) and L. rufoi (García-Ríos 2010). L. bullocki differs from L. liozonis and L. rosea in having a rough tegmentum and color. It differs from L. rufoi in having longer and numerous hyaline spicules, bigger size and broader central radula tooth.

Twenty nine stations were sampled from April to July, 1996, including <b>sublitoral</b> and intertidal <b>zones</b> resulting in a preliminary list with 69 taxa.

40|$|El género Lepidochitona (Gray 1821) se encuentra representado en el Caribe por tres especies: L. liozonis (Dall & Simpson 1901), L. rosea (Kaas 1972) y L. rufoi. Veinte ejemplares de L. bullocki sp. nov. Fueron recolectados en un recorrido a lo largo del litoral rocoso, entre el norte de la playa del Rodadero y Puerto Luz, en Santa Marta, Colombia. Los ejemplares son pequeños, hasta 7. 3 mm, fueron recolectados a mano, entre 0. 25 y 1. 5 m de profundidad, a distancias entre 1 y 5 m de la orilla. Esta es la cuarta especie del género que se {{describe}} para el Caribe. Las tres especies previamente descritas son L. liozonis (Dall & Simpson, 1901), L. rosea Kaas, 1972 y L. rufoi García-Ríos, 2010. L. bullocki se diferencia de L. liozonis y L. rosea por tener la superficie del tegumento irregular y de otros colores. La misma se distingue de L. rufoi por tener muchas espículas hialinas largas, mayor tamaño, dientes centrales de la rádula anchos. Es la única especie del género en el Caribe que se localiza con mayor frecuencia en la superficie iluminada de las rocas, en el sublitoral somero.
