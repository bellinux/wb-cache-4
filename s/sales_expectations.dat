The game received generally positive reviews when it was released, with praise for its level design, story, gameplay, combat, soundtrack and multiplayer mode. However, criticism was directed at its dated graphics, lack of challenge and ending. It failed to meet Ubisoft's <b>sales</b> <b>expectations,</b> with sales of two million copies three months after its release.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{original}} game, Maverick Hunter X has received very positive reviews from critics, accumulating aggregate scores of 82% on GameRankings and 79 out of 100 on Metacritic.

5|$|Development of {{the game}} started in May 2012, shortly {{after the release of}} XIII-2s final piece of DLC, and was {{unveiled}} at a special 25th Anniversary Event for the Final Fantasy series in September that year. Most of the previous games' key creative minds and developers returned, and it was developed by Square Enix's First Production Department, with developer tri-Ace helping with the graphics. The development team wanted the game to bring a conclusive end to the story of both Lightning and the XIII universe, and to address criticisms leveled against the last two games. During its first week on sale in Japan, it sold 277,000 units, {{and by the end of}} 2013 become the 17th best-selling game of the year selling over 400,000 copies. It has sold 800,000 copies as of May 2014. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy XIII series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. The Microsoft Windows version has sold over 300,000 copies according to SteamSpy. It has received mixed reviews: while the main praise went to the game's battle system, opinions were more mixed for the graphics, time limit and other aspects of gameplay, while the story and characters were criticized for being weak or poorly developed. Final Fantasy series brand manager Shinji Hashimoto revealed in October 2016 that Lightning Returns met <b>sales</b> <b>expectations</b> and that Square Enix is satisfied with it.|$|E

It went on to sell 2.5 million copies as of July 2014. The album's commercial performance has led numerous publications {{to suggest that it}} had fallen short of its <b>sales</b> <b>expectations.</b> Due to claims of Artpop alleged underperformance, Gaga publicly addressed rumors that the album's sales had lost her label $25 million and had led to staff layoffs, calling them fake.|$|E

25|$|The re-imagination of the Devil May Cry {{series was}} {{requested}} by Capcom, {{resulting in a}} total reboot. Capcom chose Ninja Theory to develop the game, assisting them to ensure that gameplay was reminiscent, but distinct, compared to previous titles. Early reaction to the game was widely negative, generally as a result of Dante's visual redesign; nevertheless, DMC received positive reviews from critics upon release. Critics praised the gameplay, art style, and story of the game, as well as the redesigned Dante. The game initially failed to meet Capcom's <b>sales</b> <b>expectations,</b> but Capcom later revealed that the company was satisfied with the sales of the game.|$|E
25|$|For most of 2014, TSMC saw a {{continuing}} increase in revenues {{due to increased}} demand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted ‘unseasonably strong’ first-quarter results. For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nanometer technology business growing more than 30% from the previous quarter. Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their <b>sales</b> <b>expectations</b> or shipment schedules, and in August 2014 {{it was reported that}} TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.|$|E
25|$|VAM Gremlins {{used the}} updated body {{design of the}} U.S. and Canadian market AMC Spirit two-door sedan, as well as VAM {{versions}} of the Spirit Liftback, called the American GT and the Rally AMX. At the time, cars in Mexico took longer {{to be perceived as}} outdated than in the US and since the VAM Gremlin came to the public until 1974 instead of 1970, it was still relatively fresh among the Mexican buyers. Aside from this, the model kept a positive image throughout its whole run. In fact, it exceeded VAM's <b>sales</b> <b>expectations</b> in its first years. The company originally considered it a temporary low-volume model that would eventually be replaced by the upcoming Pacer model. In the end, the Gremlin stood and became VAM's all-time second best-selling line after the American. For these reasons VAM decided to keep the Gremlin name for the upcoming Spirit sedan model, being a testament of the very favorable image VAM cars in general held in Mexico. This was the third time a case like this happened within the company with Rebel and Matador models kept the name Rambler Classic and the Hornet the Rambler American name.|$|E

40|$|Part 4 : Optimization, TuningInternational audienceWe present {{automated}} {{application of}} inventory optimization based on sales forecast. Inventory stock optimization is very required issue by companies recent years, however inventory models {{are based on}} the <b>sales</b> <b>expectation.</b> Therefore, the problem of optimizing inventory stock is divided into two parts, sales forecast and setting optimal inventory. We describe an automated solution to model selection for sales forecast and the inventory setting based on those predictions. In the end, we present our validation of the system through historical simulation. We compare simulations results against real inventory levels. Due to the large number of different length time series, this simulation was run in parallel on cluster and was parallelized in R.

500|$|Capcom {{announced}} Code: Veronica in August 1998 {{and released}} it in February 2000 after delays {{and a reduction}} in <b>sales</b> <b>expectations</b> due to the struggling Dreamcast platform. Sales were weak compared to series predecessors, but strong compared to other games on the system. The title received critical acclaim, and has been considered both among the best Resident Evil games and Dreamcast games of all-time. Because the Dreamcast had a much smaller user base than the PlayStation 2, Capcom released an updated version for the latter titled Code: Veronica X. The revised version included new cutscenes which revealed more details about the story, and it was later ported to the GameCube in addition to other platforms in later years.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{a supply chain}} system which {{consists}} of one manufacturer and two retailers including a traditional retailer and an online retailer. In order to gain a larger market share, the retailers often take the sales as a decision-making variable in the competition game. We devote ourselves to analyze the bullwhip effect in the supply chain with sales game and consumer returns via the theory of entropy and complexity and take the delayed feedback control method to control the system’s chaotic state. The impact of a statutory 7 -day no reason for return policy for online retailers is also investigated. The bounded rational expectation is adopt to forecast the future demand in the sales game system with weak noise. Our results show that high return rates will hurt the profits of both the retailers and the adjustment speed of the bounded rational <b>sales</b> <b>expectation</b> has an important impact on the bullwhip effect. There is a stable area for retailers where the bullwhip effect doesn’t appear. The supply chain system suffers a great bullwhip effect in the quasi-periodic state and the quasi-chaotic state. The purpose of chaos control on the sales game can be achieved and the bullwhip effect would be effectively mitigated by using the delayed feedback control method...|$|R
