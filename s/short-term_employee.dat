40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of board {{structures}} on risk taking-CEO pay association in Australian financial institutions. Using a panel data of 45 listed Australian financial institutions for the period 2004 - 2015, we examine the empirical relationship between firms expected default probability and CEO pay. Our results show that deposit taking institutions with {{a greater number of}} nonexecutive directors on the board generally have an expected default probability (EDP) that is more sensitive to CEO <b>short-term</b> <b>employee</b> benefits. However, a lower response of EDP to changes in CEO <b>short-term</b> <b>employee</b> benefits in non-deposit taking institutions is observed. To a large extent, this phenomenon is explained by the existence of moral hazard problem in banking industry. As depositors are insured against losses, nonexecutive directors may fail to monitor executives taking on risky investments that generate short-term gains in order to boost their cash bonus and other short-term risk remuneration. Our results suggest that boards associated with more nonexecutive directors&# 039; increase (reduce) the responsiveness of expected default probability to changes in CEO <b>short-term</b> <b>employee</b> benefits (long-term variable remuneration pay). We observe that Australian financial institutions with large boards are linked to EDP which is sensitive to both CEO short-term and long-term remuneration incentives. Institutions with larger boards motivate their CEOs to invest in high risk financial assets, consequently escalating the level of CEO risk-taking. Finally, independence of the board members plays a critical role in reducing the level of CEO risk-taking only if CEO remuneration is largely made of long-term incentives remuneration such as options and share restricted payments. In line with other studies from US, boards should use long-term incentives in CEO remuneration to reduce agency costs and increase firm value...|$|E

40|$|Permission {{to include}} this article granted by NATCONThe Synergistic Model of Organizational Career Development {{is an attempt}} to combine best {{practice}} principles from two domains: organizational development and individual career planning. The model assumes three levels of intervention within an organization: philosophical, strategic, and practical. Interventions at any of the levels may be directed toward the employees, the organization, or the balancing and interactive process that bring the two systems together. At the philosophical level, employees are concerned with becoming or managing to stay meaningfully connected to the world of work, organizations are concerned with defining their central purpose as an organization, and balancing/interactive processes are designed to balance employees' and the organization's long-term needs and goals. At the strategic level, employees are concerned with enhancing their careers, organizations are concerned with best meeting their organizational outcomes, and balancing/interactive processes are designed to balance <b>short-term</b> <b>employees</b> and organization goals. At the practical level, employees are concerned with staying employable, organizations are concerned ensuring that employees perform tasks essential to the organization, and balancing/interactive processes are designed to balance organizational demands with employee performance. The ultimate goal of balancing/interactive interventions must be to bring individual career planning into alignment with effective organizational development strategies.

The quantity and species of pathogens in this sewage-amended manure would reflect the species and prevalence of pathogens in the population using the facilities. Although the prevalence of intestinal pathogens in the Norwegian human population is relatively low, {{it should be noted that}} farms in Norway often provide tourist accommodation, camping facilities, and may house migrant <b>short-term</b> <b>employees</b> during the summer season during which labour requirements are increased. Thus non-Norwegian populations may also use toilet facilities on these farms, and thus when considering the risk of human pathogens, consideration should also be given to people from countries where the prevalence of such pathogens may be higher. As many viruses and parasites are host-specific, the risk of contamination of produce with human pathogens from such manure is likely to be greater than from manure which has not been amended with untreated sewage. Pathogen survival is affected by storage, but it should be noted that some pathogens have robust and environmentally resistant transmission stages (e. g. parasite oocysts, cysts and eggs), a proportion of which may survive for prolonged periods in stored manure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the connections linking {{recent changes in}} Latino migration, the American meatpacking industry, and American immigration policy. As the meatpacking industry has vertically integrated and shifted to rural non-union areas throughout the South, it has grown increasingly dependent on <b>short-term</b> low-skilled <b>employees.</b> This process {{can be understood as}} the industrialization of meatpacking, where profitability depends on continuous high-throughput production. To succeed, the industrialization of meatpacking requires a large pool of easily replaceable labor that has no control over the pace work on of the shop floor. At the same time, as immigrants have been drawn to these new company towns, American immigration policy has turned increasingly towards border enforcement. We argue that the presence of illegal immigrants within the factories reduces the bargaining power of shop workers and increases employer control. Most studies of immigration have focused on the supply of migrant labor, the immigrants attracted to higher paying jobs. We argue that valuable insight is gained by looking at the manufacturers' demand for cheap labor and the implementation of an industrial strategy that requires it. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The use of {{temporary}} workers in organisations is {{for different reasons}} such as cost-savings and improvement of {{the flexibility of the}} workforce. The choice of using temporary workers instead of regular or full-time workers is driven mainly by the desire for competitiveness and success. Business organisations are willing to use temporary workers as efficiently and effectively as possible to achieve and maintain their competitive advantage. However, not all the companies using temporary workers are achieving competitive advantages. This research investigates the effective use of labour brokers by an engineering company. The aim is to find out the truth about the matter and make recommendations that will help the company utilise temporary employment services (TES) efficiently and effectively in order to compete successfully in the market. A qualitative research design was followed as a data collection technique or data analysis procedure that helped in the generation of data for the research. One-on-one interviews were conducted with four temporary workers placed in the company by the labour brokers and five workers who were placed by the labour broker but who have recently been employed permanently by the company. In addition a Human Resources (HR) Manager of the company was also interviewed about using the labour brokers’ and the reasons for choosing to use them. The Manager representing the labour broker supplying the company with workers was also interviewed. Having searched and carefully studied literature, and conducted research on the identified engineering company a conclusion was reached that the company sources all types of workers from TES to fill in vacancies left by permanent staff as well as employees who are temporarily absent from work due to illness, maternity leaves and other short-term absences. In addition the company is paying <b>short-term</b> <b>employees</b> the same rate as long-term employees. These employees also enjoy overtime work at the same rate, the shift allowances, and the inconvenience allowance like their permanent counterparts. However, temporary employees sourced from TES do not have all benefits that are enjoyed by the permanent workers such as medical aid, housing allowance, transport allowance, retained services allowance, and company-based rate of pay for all weekly-paid staff. TES pays the employees that are sourced to the company with the money that the company gives to it depending on hours worked and the rate of pay per hour. TES charges the company a levy for their employees. This levy depends on the rate of pay of the placement [...] . M. Com. (Business Management...|$|R
40|$|Teaching assistants are {{represented}} by unions {{in the majority of}} large universities in Ontario and British Columbia (and in one smaller Saskatchewan university). Both traditional economic motivation and social/psychological/political factors appear to have contributed to unionization. The unionized universities tend to be in urban settings, to have large graduate student enrolments and to have faced greater budgetary concerns at the time of unionization. Graduate students in those first unionized had lower incomes than others and a higher proportion enrolled in the humanities and social sciences and the discrepancy was greater between the income of students in these fields and that of students in other fields. The refusal of labour relations boards in Canada to allow the "student " rela-tionship to invalidate an "employee " relationship contrasts with decisions of the (U. S.) National Labour Relations Board. This and the fact that Canadian public policy is generally more supportive of public sector unionization and more protective of unions during the period of organizing and negotiating a first agreement, perhaps account for the greater extent of T. A. unionization in Canada than in the U. S. Although as <b>short-term,</b> part-time <b>employees,</b> T. A. 's would seem to be unlikely candidates for unionization, T. A. bargaining is now an accepted institutional reality with collective agreement achievements to point to and dues income to draw on.

40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} {{the use of}} {{strengths}} interventions, defined as activities and processes that target the identification, development, and use of individual strengths, as an organizational tool to increase employee well-being. Engaging with one’s strengths {{is assumed to be}} a pleasant activity that elicits positive emotions like joy, pride, and gratitude, which, in turn, contribute to feelings of overall well-being and satisfaction. Building on this assumption, we hypothesized that participating in a strengths intervention leads to increases in general (i. e., psychological capital and satisfaction with life), and work-related well-being (i. e., increased work engagement and decreased burnout), and that positive affect mediates these effects. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a field experiment with a sample of N = 116 Dutch working people who were assigned to either an experimental group (participating in a strengths intervention) or a waitlist control group. All participants filled in a pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 1 month follow-up questionnaire. Results indicate that participating in a strengths intervention creates <b>short-term</b> increases in <b>employee</b> positive affect and short- and long-term increases in psychological capital. We did not find evidence for a positive, direct effect of the strengths intervention on satisfaction with life, work engagement, and burnout respectively, but we did find support for indirect effects via the mediator positive affect...|$|R
50|$|Each Federal Executive Branch {{agency has}} an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). An EAP is a voluntary, {{confidential}} program that helps employees (including management) work through various life challenges that may adversely affect job performance, health, and personal well-being to optimize an organization's success. EAP services include assessments, counseling, and referrals for additional services to employees with personal and/or work-related concerns, such as stress, financial issues, legal issues, family problems, office conflicts, and alcohol and substance abuse. EAPs also often work with management and supervisors providing advanced planning for situations, such as organizational changes, legal considerations, emergency planning, {{and response to}} unique traumatic events. EAP’s can reap benefits for agencies, employees, families and communities. Some of those aspects {{that we will be}} focusing on are: the improvement of productivity and employee engagement, improving employees’ and dependents’ abilities to successfully respond to challenges, developing employee and manager competencies in managing workplace stress, reducing workplace absenteeism and unplanned absences, supporting employees and managers during workforce restructuring, reduction-in-forces, or other workforce change events, reducing workplace accidents, reducing the likelihood of workplace violence or other safety risks, supporting disaster and emergency preparedness, managing the effect of disruptive incidents, such as workplace, injury, or other crises,facilitating safe, timely, and effective return-to-work for <b>employees</b> <b>short-term</b> and extended absences, reducing healthcare costs associated with stress, depression, and other mental health issues, reducing employee turnover and related replacement costs.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{estimate}} the lifetime cost of {{three types of}} employer-sponsored breast cancer screening programs and to identify factors influencing cost. DESIGN: A computerized decision analysis model was constructed to compare lifetime costs of providing breast cancer screening in each of three screening programs: on-site within an employer, mobile unit visiting the employer, and off-site. SUBJECTS: Three hypothetical cohorts of 10, 000 female employees 38 years of age at time of first screening. INTERVENTION: A cohort was enrolled in each screening program and received screening from age 38 through age 64. Employees continued to receive benefits related to breast cancer until age 100 or death. MEASURES: Costs in the model included those for screening, workup for a suspicious mammogram, treatment for breast cancer, <b>short-term</b> losses in <b>employee</b> productivity, and disability due to breast cancer. APPROACH: The model was used to {{estimate the}} mean lifetime cost per employee, to the employer, of the On-Site program. This cost was compared {{to the cost of}} the other programs. RESULTS: Mean lifetime cost per employee was $ 5, 485 for the On-Site screening program. This cost was significantly (P <. 0001) lower than in the Off-Site program (by $ 311) or the Mobile program (by $ 212). The baseline results for the On-Site program were quite sensitive to the cost of screening, the sensitivity and specificity of screening, age at initiation of screening, and the underlying incidence of breast cancer in the population. CONCLUSION: Employers and other entities should consider these factors such as location and content in selecting the most efficient and effective breast cancer screening program...|$|R
40|$|Magister Commercii (Industrial Psychology) - MCom(IPS) Research on stress has {{indicated}} {{that people in the}} helping professions dealing with people, especially those in the teaching profession, are particularly prone to emotional distress. However, information regarding the stress-related emotions specifically experienced by academic lecturers at institutions of Further Education and Training is not abundant. University teaching has traditionally been conceived of as a relatively stress-free occupation, or at least has been seen in this way by outsiders. Nevertheless, there is overwhelming evidence attesting to the fact that academia is a highly stressful occupation. The contemporary academic context in South Africa is characterised by changes such as the incorporation of colleges and the merging of universities and technikons, now referred to as universities of technology. Consequences such as financial predicaments, insecurity of <b>employees,</b> <b>short-term</b> contract positions, fewer fringe benefits, increasing emotional disturbance and stress, are unavoidable. Although they are not highly paid in comparison to professionals in the commercial sector, academics have been envied for their tenure, light workloads, flexibility and freedom to pursue their own research. Concerns about academic stress have been articulated over the past three decades. Research conducted in the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Australia and New Zealand has identified several key stressors commonly associated with stress among academic staff. These include work overload, time constraints, lack of promotion opportunities, inadequate recognition, inadequate salary, changing job role, inadequate management and/or participation in management, inadequate resources and funding and student interactions. Other sources of stress, such as high self-expectations, poor interactions with colleagues, inequality in the system and lack of regular performance feedback have been highlighted in a few studies. Although some studies found high levels of stress relating to work relationships, control, resources and communication and job insecurity, excessive overload and work-life imbalance are among the most frequently reported stressors by academics. Since academics do not represent an homogeneous group of professionals, it is considered inappropriate to examine academic stress without taking all their professional and personal characteristics into account. Research has shown that workload, inadequate salaries and a lack of public recognition were perceived as more significant sources of pressure by men than by women, whilst job insecurity, isolation from colleagues, a lack of institutional recognition of worth and work politics were more salient for women. Since academia is still largely a male dominated occupation, female academics may experience more stressors and strains than their male counterparts {{due to a lack of}} role models, less socialisation from women from their own rank, gender stereotypes and increased role conflict as they endeavour to balance roles at work and at home. Researchers have also noted the importance of age-based differences, and conventionally believe that stress universally declines with chronological age. Data was collected through a biographical questionnaire and the Experience of Work and Life Circumstances Questionnaire (WLQ). A convenience sample of lecturers in an FET College (n= 150) completed the questionnaires, which were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20. Statistical procedures for data analysis include: T-Test, Multiple Regression Analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results in the current research reveal that there are statistically significant differences in stress levels of academic staff at the FET college based on gender, age, race, marital status and tenure. Based on the responses obtained, 35. 33 % of the variance in total stress could be explained by Organisational functioning, Task aspects, Salary, benefits and personnel policies, Extra-organisational factors and Career aspects, and suggest that other unexplored variables could explain the variance in stress levels experienced by academics at the FET college...|$|R
