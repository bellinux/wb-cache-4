5000|$|<b>Sandwich</b> <b>printing</b> is a non-digital {{photographic}} technique which combines two negatives or transparencies {{into a single}} image.|$|E
5000|$|... == Procedure == [...] "Sandwiching" [...] may be {{accomplished}} by putting one original image {{on top of the}} other, placing them into the film carrier of an enlarger, and printing on one sheet of paper. It may also {{be accomplished}} by placing the two [...] "sandwiched" [...] originals in a frame on the surface of a lightbox and taking a third photograph of the combination. <b>Sandwich</b> <b>printing</b> is generally used to create a combination of image elements that would not occur naturally in the world. This technique may be used with either black and white or color images.|$|E
50|$|Vogue Records was a {{short-lived}} United States-based record label of the 1940s, noted for the artwork {{embedded in the}} records themselves. Founded in 1946 as part of Sav-Way Industries of Detroit, Michigan, the discs were initially a hit, because of the novelty of the colorful artwork, and the improved sound compared to the shellac records dominant at the time. The discs were manufactured by first <b>sandwiching</b> <b>printed</b> illustrations around a core of aluminum, then coating both sides with clear vinyl upon which the grooves were stamped.|$|R

Centering its analysis on images {{made with a}} specific form of the negative layering process called "sandwich printing," the essay demonstrates that Morrisroe deployed darkroom manipulation and post-production marking to construct works that emphasize the materiality of the photograph and the contingencies of print making. Turning the camera on his naked body, the artist foregrounds his physical experiences, from frank sexuality to lifelong injury and illness. The essay argues that Morrisroe developed a corporeal model of photography out of these conditions that structured his approach to the <b>sandwich</b> <b>prints</b> and, to a lesser extent, his Polaroid and photogram self-portraits. The essay concludes that Morrisroe's photographs not only insist on signifying as objects, resisting their status as indexical trace, but also, through erotic repetition, assert their ability to become desiring subjects...|$|R
40|$|To {{cope with}} the {{increased}} background induced hit rate of up to 15 kHz/cm^ 2 in the innermost stations of the muon endcap system of the ATLAS experiment after the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC, the currently used precision detectors {{will be replaced by}} resistive strip Micromegas in 2019. In the "New Small Wheel" the Micromegas will be arranged in two times four detection layers built of trapezoidally shaped quadruplets of four different sizes. The Micromegas quadruplets will consist of 5 panels, 3 drift panels and 2 readout panels, made of aluminum honeycomb core <b>sandwiched</b> by <b>printed</b> circuit boards (PCBs). To achieve 15...|$|R
2500|$|Various {{non-specific}} {{claims of}} invention {{relate to the}} term [...] "hamburger steak" [...] without mention of its being a <b>sandwich.</b> The first <b>printed</b> American menu which listed hamburger {{is said to be}} an 1834 menu from Delmonico's in New York. However, the printer of the original menu was not in business in 1834. In 1889, a menu from Walla Walla Union in Washington offered hamburger steak as a menu item.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} large-area-printed flexible {{pressure sensors}} developed with an all screen-printing technique. The 4 Ã— 4 sensing arrays are obtained by printing Polyvinylidene Fluoride-Trifluoroethylene P(VDF-TrFE) and their nanocomposite with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and are <b>sandwiched</b> between <b>printed</b> metal electrodes {{in a parallel}} plate structure. The bottom electrodes and sensing materials are printed sequentially on polyimide (PI) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. The top electrodes with force concentrator posts on backside are printed on a separate PET substrate and adhered with good alignment to the bottom electrodes. The interconnects, linking the sensors in series, are printed together with metal electrodes and they provide the expandability of the cells. Different weight ratios of MWCNTs are mixed in P(VDF-TrFE) to optimize the percolation threshold for a better sensitivity. The nanocomposite of MWCNTs in piezoelectric P(VDF-TrFE) is also explored for application in stretchable interconnects, where the higher conductivity at lower percolation ratios are of significant importance compared to the nanocomposite of MWCNTs in an insulator material. To examine the functionality and sensitivity of sensor module, the capacitancevoltage analysis at different frequencies, and the piezoelectric and piezoresistive response of the sensor are presented. The whole package of foldable pressure sensor is completely developed by screen-printing and is targeted towards realization of low-cost electronic skin...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the preparation of spherical Janus particles by microcontact printing. A set of three different polymer beads (diameter ca. 170 mu m), each bearing different functional groups at their surface, are used to covalently attach distinct functional molecules exclusively on opposing poles of the beads. The covalent modification of the beads involves three different types of click chemistry: epoxide ring opening (ERO), copper catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and thiol-yne addition (TYA). These reactions are compared {{with regard to their}} advantages and disadvantages in the context of "sandwich" microcontact chemistry. The success of surface modification of the beads is verified by fluorescence microscopy and 3 D-time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements and is further supported by reference experiments on planar surfaces bearing the same surface functionality and analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore we demonstrate that <b>sandwich</b> microcontact <b>printing</b> can also be performed on smaller polymer beads with a diameter of ca. 5 mu m. The broad scope of surface chemistry in combination with the simple experimental setup makes this method attractive {{to a wide range of}} material science applications, since it combines orthogonality of surface functionalization with high pattern fidelity...|$|R
