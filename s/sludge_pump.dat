40|$|Low-temperature colossal {{supersaturation}} (LTCSS) {{is a novel}} {{surface hardening}} method for carburization of austenitic stainless steels (SS) without the precipitation of carbides. The formation of carbides is kinetically suppressed, enabling extremely high or colossal carbon supersaturation. As a result, surface carbon concentrations in excess of 12 at. % are routinely achieved. This treatment increases the surface hardness {{by a factor of}} four to five, improving resistance to wear, corrosion, and fatigue, with significant retained ductility. LTCSS is a diffusional surface hardening process that provides a uniform and conformal hardened gradient surface with no risk of delamination or peeling. The treatment retains the austenitic phase and is completely non-magnetic. In addition, because parts are treated at low temperature, they do not distort or change dimensions. During this treatment, carbon diffusion proceeds into the metal at temperatures that constrain substitutional diffusion or mobility between the metal alloy elements. Though immobilized and unable to assemble to form carbides, chromium and similar alloying elements nonetheless draw enormous amounts of carbon into their interstitial spaces. The carbon in the interstitial spaces of the alloy crystals makes the surface harder than ever achieved before by more conventional heat treating or diffusion process. The carbon solid solution manifests a Vickers hardness often exceeding 1000 HV (equivalent to 70 HRC). This project objective was to extend the LTCSS treatment to other austenitic alloys, and to quantify improvements in fatigue, corrosion, and wear resistance. Highlights from the research include the following: • Extension of the applicability of the LTCSS process to a broad range of austenitic and duplex grades of steels • Demonstration of LTCSS ability for a variety of different component shapes and sizes • Detailed microstructural characterization of LTCSS-treated samples of 316 L and other alloys • Thermodynamic modeling to explain the high degree of carbon solubility possible in austenitic grades under the LTCSS process and experimental validation of model results • Corrosion testing to determine the corrosion resistance improvement possible from the LTCSS process • Erosion testing to determine the erosion resistance improvement possible from the LTCSS process • Wear testing to quantify the wear resistance improvement possible from the LTCSS process • Fatigue testing for quantifying the extent of improvement from the LTCSS process • Component treating and testing under simulated and in-line commercial operations XRD verified expanded austenite lattice, with no evidence of carbide precipitation. Carbon concentration profiles via Auger and electron dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) showed carbon levels in excess of 12 at. % in treated, type 316 SS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of pulled-to-failure treated tensile specimens showed slip bands and no de-cohesion of the treated layer, verifying that the layer remains ductile. Compressive stresses in excess of 2 GPa (300 ksi) have been calculated at the surface of the case. Phase diagram (CALPHAD) (ThermoCalc) and Wagner dilute solution thermodynamic models were developed that calculate the solubility of carbon in austenite as a function of alloying content for the process time and temperature. Several commercial alloys have been modeled, and the model has been used to design experimental alloys with enhanced affinity for carbon solubility at treatment temperatures. Four experimental alloys were melted, rolled, and manufactured into test specimens, and the LTCSS treatment indicated successfully enhanced results and validated the predictions based on thermodynamic modeling. Electrochemical polarization curves show a 600 to 800 mV increase in pitting potential in treated (900 - 1000 mV) versus non-treated (200 - 300 mV) type 316 in chloride solutions. Treated 316 L showed crevice-corrosion behavior similar to that of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Hastelloy C 22. Cavitation tests showed significant increases in cavitation resistance for treated materials as compared to the non-treated materials. Standard ASTM pin-on-disk sliding friction and reciprocating friction wear tests also indicate significant enhancement in wear properties. Fatigue testing showed an order of magnitude improvement for treated versus non-treated Type 316 at the same maximum stress level (R = - 1). The maximum stress at 107 cycles and the endurance stress for infinite life, improved by approximately 50 %, from 30 to 45 ksi.

The data are partitioned per weather conditions and relations between influent total chemical oxygen demand (CODT), soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODs), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonium (NH 4) and phosphate (PO 4) concentrations and their corresponding removal efficiencies are investigated. Significant differences in removal efficiencies between various parameters and unexpected increasing of concentrations of CODs, NH 4, PO 4 are observed. The analysis revealed the possibility of establishment of empirical relations between influent concentrations and their corresponding removal efficiencies of the primary clarifier in Castiglione Torinese in case of availability of high frequency data.

40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} {{how well}} two 300 -hp mixer pumps would mix {{solid and liquid}} radioactive wastes stored in Hanford double-shell Tank 241 -AZ- 102 (AZ- 102) and confirmed the adequacy of a three-inch (7. 6 -cm) pipeline system to transfer the resulting mixed waste slurry to the AP Tank Farm and a planned waste treatment (vitrification) plant on the Hanford Site. Tank AZ- 102 contains 854, 000 gallons (3, 230 m{sup 3 }) of supernatant liquid and 95, 000 gallons (360 m{sup 3 }) of sludge made up of aging waste (or neutralized current acid waste). The study comprises three assessments: waste chemistry, pump jet mixing, and pipeline transfer. The waste chemical modeling assessment indicates that the sludge, consisting of the solids and interstitial solution, and the supernatant liquid are basically in an equilibrium condition. Thus, pump jet mixing would not cause much solids precipitation and dissolution, only 1. 5 % or less of the total AZ- 102 <b>sludge.</b> The <b>pump</b> jet mixing modeling indicates that two 300 -hp mixer pumps would mobilize up to about 23 ft (7. 0 m) of the <b>sludge</b> nearest the <b>pump</b> but would not erode the waste within seven inches (0. 18 m) of the tank bottom.

40|$|Renewable {{energy is}} one of the {{cornerstones}} of sustainable energy. Biogas from the anaerobic digestion of organic waste materials can provide a clean, easily controlled source of renewable energy, replacing firewood and/or fossil fuels. In order to maintain the requisite constant homogeneous conditions within digesters, operating conditions must be regulated according to the rheological characteristics of the sludge. An accurate estimate of sludge rheological properties is required for the design and efficient operation of <b>sludge</b> <b>pumping</b> and digester mixing. In this paper, we have determined the rheological behaviour of digested sludge at different concentrations and different temperatures, and highlighted common features. At low shear stress, digested sludge behaves as a viscoelastic solid, but shear banding can occur which modifies the apparent behaviour. At very high shear stress, the behaviour fits well with the Bingham model. Finally, we show that the rheological behaviour of digested sludge is qualitatively the same at different solids concentrations and temperatures, and depends only on the yield stress and Bingham viscosity: by normalising the shear stress with the yield stress and the shear rate with the yield stress divided by the Bingham viscosity, a master curve was obtained independent of both temperature and concentration. These two parameters (Yield stress and Bingham Viscosity) increase when the solid concentration increases but decrease when the temperature increases. Furthermore, we show that the rheological behaviour is irreversibly altered by the thermal history. Dissolution of some of the solids may cause a decrease of the yield stress and an increase of the Bingham viscosity. This result suggests that the solid characteristics decreases with temperature and the usual laws used to describe the thermal evolution of the rheological behaviour of fluids are no longer valid with anaerobic digested sludge...|$|R

Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10-20 years between pumpings.
