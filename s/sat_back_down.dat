500|$|During {{the game}} of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was {{returning}} from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices. Short did not heed the request, and <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning. Short discussed the incident extensively after the event, indicating {{that he did not}} think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device). Initially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations). Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters [...] "ask him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search" [...] while in time trouble and playing a [...] "do-or-die" [...] position, though these details now seem discredited.|$|E

6000|$|It was at {{this instant}} that I heard Mr. Pike's [...] "Plug him!" [...] and pulled the trigger; and of all ungodly things the bullet missed and caught the Faun, who {{staggered}} <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on the hatch, and began to cough.

Then, {{looking at me}} with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply, [...] "I cannot!" [...] and {{remained}} silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe! ...|$|R
60|$|They {{worked on}} steadily, without speaking, losing no time. Each did {{whatever}} was needed, without thought of leaving {{to the other}} the least task that presented itself to hand. Thus, Kama saw when more ice was needed and went and got it, while a snowshoe, pushed over by the lunge of a dog, was stuck on end again by Daylight. While coffee was boiling, bacon frying, and flapjacks were being mixed, Daylight found time {{to put on a}} big pot of beans. Kama came <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{on the edge of the}} spruce boughs, and in the interval of waiting, mended harness.|$|R
5000|$|Chisholm was {{involved}} in a minor controversy in May 2008, when he called NDP MLA Deb Higgins a [...] "dumb bitch" [...] during a debate. Chisholm did not directly say the statement to Higgins personally, but it was audible enough to be recorded as he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> Chisholm resigned as legislative secretary a few days later.|$|E

50|$|At an Allstar wrestling event, one of {{the veteran}} wrestlers on the show called out Kid Krazy from the crowd telling the fans in {{attendance}} that Krazy had been eager {{to get into a}} wrestling ring and this would be his opportunity to lock horns with a real professional. Krazy climbed into the ring and tied up and became embroiled in a chain of wrestling manoeuvres which saw him reverse a wristlock into an armbar. The Allstar wrestler countered the lock, rolled out and flipped into a headspring to escape the hold. Krazy applauded the veteran, thanking him for the lesson and humbly <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> This would be Kid Krazy’s first taster of professional wrestling.|$|E
50|$|At mid-morning the ship’s officer {{returned}} with about 20 Japanese soldiers. They ordered all the wounded men capable of walking to travel around a headland. The nurses heard a quick succession of shots before the Japanese soldiers came <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{in front of}} the women and cleaned their bayonets and rifles. A Japanese officer ordered the remaining 22 nurses and one civilian woman to walk into the surf. A machine gun was set up on the beach and when the women were waist deep, they were machine-gunned. All but Sister Lt Vivian Bullwinkel were killed. Wounded soldiers left on stretchers were then bayoneted and killed.|$|R
6000|$|She came on Monday, {{surrounded}} by a gray halo, which had begun to grow as beautiful to my vision as the delicate tints of early dawn. When she began to read what she had last written, I seated myself in a chair by the grating. When she had finished, I sat silent for a minute, {{got up and walked}} about, came <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> and was silent again.

60|$|Aunty, meanwhile, was distributing her {{substantial}} weight evenly {{between the}} feet of the Irish gentleman and those of his daughter, as she leaned out of the window to converse with a lady friend in a straw hat and hair curlers, accompanied by three dirty and frivolous boys. It was, she stated, lucky that she had caught the train. I could not agree with her. The girl with the brown hair and the eyes that were neither blue or grey was bearing the infliction, I noticed, with angelic calm. She even smiled. This was when the train suddenly moved off with a jerk, and Aunty, staggering <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on the bag of food which Albert had placed on the seat beside him.|$|R
50|$|Davidson, {{the three}} faculty members, {{and three other}} {{engineering}} students assembled in the classroom shortly before 2:00 p.m. The three students were there to support Davidson, and to witness a Master's thesis defense. Liang stood, formally introduced Davidson, stated {{the purpose of the}} meeting, and <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> Davidson then handed Liang a printout of an e-mail, from a prospective employer who was interested in hiring Davidson, that stated that his future employment with the company hinged on a successful Master's thesis defense. Without time for comment from Liang, and without saying anything himself, Davidson turned to the first aid box on the wall, removed a 9mm handgun, and immediately started firing. He hit Liang first, killing him while he was still seated at the faculty table. Lowrey and Lyrintzis were also hit. However, Lowrey tried to escape out the only main access door to the room. There were other doors in the room, but only one door led out to the hallway, {{and other parts of the}} third floor of the Engineering building.|$|E

5000|$|First, Romance and New York {{argued over}} 12 Pack getting {{to stay and}} him leaving. Romance then boasted his new [...] "love", a dog named Bella, looked better than New Yorks chihuahua, Your Majesty. New York learned Mr. Boston has a twin brother, Ben and was {{surprised}} when she kissed him and not Mr. Boston. She also found out that Mr. Boston and , from Flavor of Love, were then dating. New York and [...] were not amicable on stage. New York and [...] start going at it. When [...] leaves the stage, New York says, [...] "Bye, skank. Back to the trailer park." [...] Rumor is that [...] called New York a [...] "nigger" [...] causing Sister Patterson to assault [...] [...] backstage takes out her cell phone and shows {{a picture of her}} and New York making out, in attempt to embarrass New York. Heat and 12 Pack revealed that they have formed a partnership. Sister Patterson replied sarcastically that they make a [...] "nice couple." [...] Chance and Whiteboy had an argument with Tango, to which he told them to act on their threats (even telling Real to come up) and approach the stage. Chance stood up but almost immediately <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> and even tried to tell Whiteboy to sit back down, but Whiteboy walked up to the stage and the security guards held him back. Wood came up to calm Whiteboy down as well. Tango was taken backstage where he made a threat to give them a [...] "Tampa Bay ass-whupin". This was similar to the way the girls on the Flavor of Love (season 2) reunion brawled in an attempt to attack at New York.|$|E
50|$|A violinist friend, Zygmunt Lednicki, told Szpilman about a German officer {{he had met}} at a Soviet POW camp. The officer, {{learning}} that Lednicki was a musician, had asked if he knew Władysław Szpilman. Lednicki had said that he did, but before the German could tell him his name, the guards at the camp had asked Lednicki {{to move on and}} <b>sat</b> the German <b>back</b> <b>down</b> again. When Szpilman and Lendnicki returned to where the camp had been, it had gone. Szpilman did everything in his power to find the officer, but it took him five years even to discover his name. He went to the government in an attempt to secure Hosenfeld's release, but Hosenfeld and his unit, which was suspected of spying, had been moved to a POW camp at a secret location somewhere in Soviet Russia, and there was nothing the Polish government could do. Hosenfeld died in captivity in 1952. He was recognized by Israel as Righteous Among the Nations in 1963.|$|R
50|$|Drummond {{escaped the}} ship in a {{lifeboat}} and came ashore at Radji Beach, Banka Island. Also on the island were 21 other nurses and 20 British servicemen from another ship that had sunk. Once {{it was discovered that}} the island was held by the Japanese, an officer of the Vyner Brooke went to surrender the group to the authorities in Muntok. While he was away Drummond suggested that the civilian women and children should leave for Muntok, which they did. At mid-morning the ship’s officer returned with about 20 Japanese soldiers. They ordered all the wounded men capable of walking to travel around a headland. The nurses heard a quick succession of shots before the Japanese soldiers came <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in front of the women and cleaned their bayonets and rifles.

40|$|It was Super Bowl Sunday, that sacrosanct {{day when}} most American men {{are to be}} found {{watching}} the biggest football game of the year. The flight from New York to Detroit was delayed two hours in departing, and the tension among the passengers— almost entirely businessmen—was palpable. As they finally arrived at Detroit, a mysterious glitch with the boarding ramp made the plane stop some one hundred feet from the gate. Frantic about arriving late, people on the plane leapt to their feet anyway. One of the flight attendants went to the intercom. How could she most effectively get all the passengers to comply with federal regulations requiring they all be seated before the plane could finish taxiing to the gate? She did not announce in a stern voice, “Federal regulations require that you be seated before we can move to the gate. ” Instead, she warbled in a singsong tone, suggestive of a playful warning to an adorable small child who has done something naughty but forgivable, “You’re staaanding!” At that, everyone laughed and <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> until the plane had finished taxiin...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the shear displacement between the body and backrest/seat, range of motion (ROM), and force acting on the lower limb joints during sit-stand-sit transitions by operating an electric-powered standing wheelchair. Methods and Materials. The amounts of sliding along the backrest and the seat plane, ROM of lower limb joints, and force acting on the knee/foot were measured in twenty-four people with paraplegia. Results. Without an antishear mechanism, the shear displacement was approximately 9 cm between the user’s body and the backrest/seat surfaces. During standing up, the user’s back slid down and the thigh was displaced rearward, but they moved in opposite directions when wheelchair <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> A minimum of 60 degrees of ROM at the hip and knee was needed during sit-stand-sit transitions. The maximal resultant forces acting on the knee restraints could reach 23. 5 % of body weight. Conclusion. Sliding between the body and backrest/seat occurred while transitioning from sitting to standing and vice versa. A certain amount of ROM at lower limb joints and force acting on the knee was necessitated during sit-stand-sit transitions.

40|$|Recently a {{professor}} in my department was threatened {{by one of his}} students. The intrusion happened in his classroom. Immediately, students felt the onslaught of tension and turmoil. The perpetrator stood {{up in the middle of}} a lecture, pointed his finger, and searched accusingly around the room for the victims of his verbal anger. He bolstered questions such as, “Who in this room is gay? Who else is a Homo?” After a moment of shocked silence and avoiding eyes, he then approached female students in the room, made advances, and even tried to touch one on the leg. After this outburst and a reprimand from the professor, he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> Then again, this student stood up and demanded, “I need a tutor. Do you think there are any women in this room that want to come home and give me private tutoring? ” After that class, whispers of the student having a gun filled the hallways. I wasn’t there. It wasn’t my class. The prior quotations are paraphrased statements, heresy accounts. I didn’t see the rumored gun. I do not know if he showed students the gun, but some say he did. Others say it wasn’t a gun at all. I do not know all of the details. Perhaps, it is not my story to tell. Yet, what I do know is, after the incident, I felt the panic around the building. When I entered my classroom a few hours later to teach my course, Communication and the Sexes, the fear was palpable. My students look up at me. They stop their chattering and wait, eyes wide, to hear what I have to say about what occurred only a few hours ago in this very room. This is a teachable moment.
