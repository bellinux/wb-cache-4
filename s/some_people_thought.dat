5|$|The {{match between}} Taylor and Bigelow brought the WWF {{mainstream}} press coverage. The {{reactions to the}} match were mixed; <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> that Taylor performed surprisingly well for a non-wrestler. Others thought that the WWF pushing a football player to defeat a wrestler made professional wrestling look bad. Reviews of the event as a whole have also been mixed, and the event has been called both the worst WrestleMania of all time and the event that saved the WWF.|$|E
5|$|The quatrains, {{published}} in a book titled Les Propheties (The Prophecies), received a mixed reaction when they were published. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> Nostradamus was a servant of evil, a fake, or insane, {{while many of the}} elite evidently thought otherwise. Catherine de' Medici, wife of King Henry II of France, was one of Nostradamus's greatest admirers. After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain them and to draw up horoscopes for her children. At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded, but by {{the time of his death}} in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King Charles IX of France.|$|E

50|$|The fire, catastrophic {{though it}} was, {{presented}} {{the opportunity for}} some major new architectural work. Although criticised by <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who <b>thought</b> it lacked imagination, the architects believed that, given {{the history of the}} building and the surviving fabric, the new work had to be Gothic.|$|R
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the}} pace of change under Atatürk was too rapid as, in his quest to {{modernize}} Turkey, he effectively abolished centuries-old traditions. Nevertheless, the bulk of the population willingly accepted the reforms, even though some were seen as reflecting the views of the urban elites {{at the expense of the}} generally illiterate inhabitants of the rural countryside, where religious sentiments and customary norms tended to be stronger.|$|E
25|$|The Tale was {{immediately}} popular and controversial. Consequently, there were rumours of various people {{as the author}} of the work— Jonathan Swift then being not largely known except for his work in the House of Lords for the passage of the First Fruits and Fifths bill for tithing. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> that William Temple wrote it. Francis Atterbury said people at Oxford thought it had been written by Edmund Smith and John Philips, though he thought it was by Jonathan Swift. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> it belonged to Lord Somers. However, Jonathan Swift had a cousin, also in the church, named Thomas Swift. Thomas and Jonathan were in correspondence {{during the time of the}} composition of the Tale, and Thomas Swift later claimed to have written the work. Jonathan responded by saying that Thomas had no hand in anything but the smallest of passages, and he would welcome hearing Thomas 'explain' the work, if he had written it. The controversy over authorship is aggravated by the choice of publisher. Not only did Swift use Tooke after the publication of the Tale, he had used Tooke before its publication as well, so the appearance of the work in John Nutt's shop was atypical.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the text}} was printed in a {{typeface}} resembling typewriter lettering, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> that Suzy Creamcheese was real, and many listeners {{expected to see}} her in concert performances. Because of this, it was decided that [...] "it would be best to bring along a Suzy Creamcheese replica who would demonstrate once and for all the veracity of such a beast." [...] Because the original voice of Suzy Creamcheese, Jeannie Vassoir, was unavailable, Pamela Lee Zarubica took over the part.|$|E
50|$|Barry Bonds is {{once again}} not placed in the game due to his not {{being a part of}} the MLBPA {{licensing}} agreement, and once again is represented by left-fielder Joe Young.

50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> also <b>thought</b> {{that the}} control sticks {{used in the}} PS2 & Xbox {{controllers}} made the essential precision {{a little bit harder}} to achieve in the long run due to the smooth edges and deadzone, whereas those of the Gamecube controller had octagonal edges and no deadzones at all.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> {{who take}} {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants report that {{their experience of}} emotions is 'blunted'. This phenomenon is poorly understood. AIMS: To understand patients' experiences of this phenomenon. METHOD: Qualitative study, gathering data through individual interviews, a group interview and validation interviews; and searching patient websites for relevant posts. RESULTS: There was strong evidence that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> taking SSRIs experience significant emotional symptoms that they strongly attribute to their antidepressant. These emotional symptoms can be described within six key themes. A seventh theme represents {{the impact of these}} side-effects on everyday life, and an eighth represents participants' reasons for attributing these symptoms to their antidepressant. Most participants felt able to distinguish between emotional side-effects of antidepressants and emotional symptoms of their depression or other illness. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional side-effects of SSRIs are a robust phenomenon, prominent in <b>some</b> <b>people's</b> <b>thoughts</b> about their medication, having a demonstrable impact on their functioning and playing a role in their decision-making about antidepressant adherence...|$|R
500|$|In an April 2010 {{interview}} with South Yorkshire newspaper The Star, Grant expressed his disappointment with the side-project band's sudden increase in success and awareness, {{in which he}} claimed that he wanted the band to continue playing in clubs with a slower ascendency to the bigger venues. The tour promoter however suggested that Renegades should play slightly bigger venues for the second tour than of those seen on their debut. Looking back on {{this version of the}} band, Grant Nicholas explained in an {{interview with}} Culture Deluxe, that the project was not a big marketing plan, but announced it without saying exactly what was happening. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> it was a name change, Grant recording a solo album, while others got the idea from the start. He described problems with promoters printing [...] "Feeder" [...] on the tickets, leading to a misunderstanding that a more mainstream set was expected.|$|E
500|$|By October 1974, the Australia-only album High Voltage {{had been}} recorded. It took only ten days and {{was based on}} {{instrumental}} songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd. Later that year they released the single [...] "It's a Long Way to the Top", for which a well-known promotional video was made for the program Countdown, featuring the band miming the song {{on the back of}} a flatbed truck. The song is regarded as their perennial rock anthem. It was included on their second album, TNT (1975), which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand. T.N.T. featured the song [...] "High Voltage", which was the first song written and recorded for the album. Because [...] "High Voltage" [...] was released as a single before T.N.T. was released, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> it was the title track to AC/DC's debut album.|$|E
500|$|In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness. For example, {{the narrator}} notes: [...] "It has been remarked (by a lady {{infinitely}} cleverer {{than the present}} author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised {{to life in the}} early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> too much excitement for one week." [...] As Michel Faber explains in his review for The Guardian, [...] "here we have all the defining features of Clarke's style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare." [...] Gregory Maguire notes in The New York Times that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself: [...] " [...] picks up a book and begins to read...but he is not attending to what he reads and he has got to Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel– the sort of work which above all others he most despises– and he puts it down in disgust." [...] Elsewhere, the narrator remarks, [...] "Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women." [...] The narrator's identity has been a topic of discussion, with Clarke declaring that said narrator is female and omniscient rather than a future scholar from within the real storyline as some had suggested.|$|E

When he was playing that character in several locations, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> really <b>thought</b> him to be a beggar. He got good appreciation from Krishna and Vijaya Nirmala.|$|R
50|$|There's {{plenty of}} {{misleading}} {{information about the}} publishing year {{of the game and}} the sequel. According to Kosola he created the beta version of Turboraketti in 1992 and the final version in 1993. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> have <b>thought</b> that the final version is the sequel but Kosola says that there has never been Turboraketti II.|$|R
50|$|This census {{witnessed}} the forming of the Bosniak nation, but <b>some</b> <b>people</b> still <b>thought</b> of themselves Muslims by nationality, however. Also, {{there are very}} few people left who consider themselves Yugoslavs. But the biggest difference compared to the 1991 census is the dramatic increase in self-identification of many inhabitants as Serbs, which was not the case in Socialist Yugoslavia.|$|R
2500|$|The Christian New Testament {{notes that}} <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> that Jesus was, in some sense, Elijah. But Jesus {{makes it clear}} that John the Baptist is [...] "the Elijah" [...] who was promised to come in [...] Elijah appears with Moses during the Transfiguration of Jesus. Elijah is also a figure in various Christian folk traditions, at times {{identified}} with earlier pagan thunder or sky gods.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> {{the fire}} had {{originated}} when someone dropped cigar ash or something similar into inflammable materials on board Shoo Fly, such as pulu dust, with the fire festering slowly for some time before it was noticed, by which time it was too late. [...] The possibility of arson was discounted, because it was thought {{it would not have}} been perpetrated at so early in the evening.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the}} ozone hole should be above {{the sources of}} CFCs. However, CFCs are well mixed {{globally}} in the troposphere and stratosphere. The reason for occurrence of the ozone hole above Antarctica is not because there are more CFCs concentrated but because the low temperatures help form polar stratospheric clouds. In fact, there are findings of significant and localized [...] "ozone holes" [...] above {{other parts of the}} earth.|$|E

5000|$|Like Sinocentrism, {{which is}} the belief that China is the center of the civilization of the world, in Korea, which was at one time a {{tributary}} state of China, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> have <b>thought</b> that Korea is a [...] "Small China" [...] and thus, a highly civilized state.

5000|$|Examples of such {{insights}} {{include the}} following. State users generally viewed [...] "Facebook as a whole" [...] negatively while {{opinions of the}} company's new Paper app were overwhelmingly positive. Regarding the surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> held conflicted opinions towards Edward Snowden and the Prism programme. As Asseily explained, [...] "In general terms, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who <b>thought</b> Snowden was a villain, also thought Prism was bad and likewise, some thought Snowden was a hero but that Prism was a good thing".|$|R

2500|$|The band caused further {{controversy}} in February 2016 when Oliver Sykes trashed Coldplay's {{table at the}} 2016 NME Awards during a live performance of Bring Me The Horizon's track 'Happy Song'. Although <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> the table trashing was because of a prior feud between the two bands relating to similar album artwork, Sykes later stated that the act wasn't an act of 'dirty protest', and suggested that it was 'pure coincidence' that Coldplay were {{sitting at the table}} he trampled. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin allegedly laughed off the incident, stating that [...] "it was great, very rock and roll".|$|E
2500|$|The IOC {{was stuck}} in a lose-lose {{situation}} {{in which they could}} either allow the women to participate in hijabs, which symbolized for many people the subordinate position of women, or they could force the countries to allow their women to compete without the hijabs and then receive criticism from people who believe that they were stepping on the traditional culture of the countries. [...] They ended up allowing the women to participate in hijabs {{in order to keep the}} countries from removing their women athletes, which <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> was a very hypocritical move by the IOC.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{historians have}} {{commented on the}} {{historical}} significance of the photograph, particularly its depiction of the crossing of gender and racial boundaries. Lehigh University political science professor Saladin Ambar said that the picture suggests [...] "a new American landscape that we're still crossing into". He continued [...] "When Obama was elected, there were <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who <b>thought</b> that we had crossed a racial threshold. What his presidency is revealing {{is that there are}} many crossings." ...|$|R
50|$|In the aftermath, city {{officials}} and corporations blamed each other. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> initially <b>thought</b> a cooking oil manufacturing company was leaking hexane, a flammable liquid similar to (and a component of) gasoline, into the sewers, {{but this was}} later found to be erroneous. Numerous arrests were made {{in an attempt to}} indict those responsible for the blasts. Four Pemex officials were indicted and charged, on the basis of negligence. Ultimately, however, these people were cleared of all charges.|$|R

2500|$|When {{the film}} was finally {{released}} and the reviews came in, they revealed that most critics never caught the differences in [...] accent, diction, and timbre between Scott and Bacall. Bacall's accent is pre-World War II, upper middle-class New York metropolitan, often mistaken for Mid-Atlantic due to the broad [...] "A" [...] and nonrhotic pronunciation of words containing [...] "R". Unlike Scott's inherited low tone, Bacall originally had a naturally high tone with a nasal timbre and fast tempo, but had trained herself to pitch her voice lower and slow down her delivery. Despite Bacall's [...] "mannered toughness" [...] and Scott's [...] "breathy theatricality", when Bacall did the voice-over for a 1990s cat-food commercial, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> it was Scott.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} of 31 January 1985 to Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, {{regarding}} the book Poem of the Man God, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (then Prefect of the Congregation, who later became Pope Benedict XVI), referred to the 1966 notification of the Congregation as follows: [...] "After {{the dissolution of the}} Index, when <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> the printing and distribution of the work was permitted, people were reminded again in L'Osservatore Romano (15 June 1966) that, as was published in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis (1966), the Index retains its moral force despite its dissolution. A decision against distributing and recommending a work, which has not been condemned lightly, may be reversed, but only after profound changes that neutralize the harm which such a publication could bring forth among the ordinary faithful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sixty-three years later, in 1998, Johnson recreated his father’s {{journey with}} his two sons. Johnson {{undertook}} the journey, documented in a 2001 film called Carnauba: A Son’s Memoir, in a replica Sikorsky S-38 amphibious plane like the one his father used. During {{the course of the}} film, Johnson reflects on his somewhat difficult relationship with his often-absent father as well as his own battle with alcoholism. Said Johnson of the journey, [...] "I started to get this idea that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> was crazy, but something was telling me to do it… to recreate my father’s airplane and retrace his journey.
