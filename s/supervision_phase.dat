40|$|We {{define the}} problem of machine {{improvisation}} of music with formal specifications. In this problem, one seeks to create a random improvisation of a given reference melody that however satisfies a “specification ” encoding constraints that the generated melody must satisfy. More specifically, we consider the scenario of generating a monophonic Jazz melody (solo) on a given song harmonization. The music is encoded symbolically, with the improviser generating a sequence of note symbols comprising pairs of pitches (fre-quencies) and discrete durations. Our approach can be de-composed roughly into two phases: a generalization phase, that learns from a training sequence (e. g., obtained from a human improviser) an automaton generating similar se-quences, and a <b>supervision</b> <b>phase</b> that enforces a specifi-cation on the generated sequence, imposing constraints on the music in both the pitch and rhythmic domains. The su-pervision uses a measure adapted from Normalized Com-pression Distances (NCD) to estimate the divergence be-tween generated melodies and the training melody and em-ploys strategies to bound this divergence. An empirical evaluation is presented on a sample set of Jazz music. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{community-based}} clinicians {{have been}} trained to deliver contingency management (CM) treatments, and little data exist regarding the efficacy of CM when administered by clinicians. Method Fifteen clinicians from four intensive outpatient treatment programs received training in CM. Following a didactics seminar and a period in which clinicians delivered CM to pilot patients while receiving weekly supervision, clinicians treated 43 patients randomized to standard care or CM, without supervision. In both treatment conditions, urine and breath samples were collected up to twice weekly for 12 weeks, and CM patients earned the opportunity to win prizes ranging in value from $ 1 to $ 100 for submitting drug-free samples. Primary treatment outcomes were sessions attended, unexcused absences, longest continuous period of abstinence, and proportion of negative samples submitted. Results All therapists completed the training and <b>supervision</b> <b>phase,</b> and 10 treated randomized patients. Patients randomized to CM achieved significantly greater durations of abstinence than patients randomized to standard care (5. 0 ± 3. 8 versus 2. 6 ± 3. 7 weeks) and had fewer unexcused absences (4. 3 ± 1. 2 versus 8. 1 ± 5. 4), but proportion of negative samples submitted and attendance did not differ significantly between groups. Therapist adherence and competence in CM delivery decreased when supervision was no longer provided, and competence in CM delivery was associated with duration of abstinence achieved and attendance. Conclusions Community-based clinicians can effectively administer CM, and outcomes relate to competence in CM delivery. These data call for further training and supervision of community clinicians in this evidence-based treatment...|$|E
40|$|During {{a one-year}} <b>supervision</b> <b>phase</b> the {{function}} {{and operation of}} dynamic axle load weighing equipment was to be investigated at five measuring points on motorways in Hesse according to the bending plate principle {{in conjunction with a}} traffic computer centre, and during this period any longterm data and sporadic data collected on individual vehicles was to be analysed. An evaluation system was to be developed for the long-term data, and this was to be programmed {{in the form of a}} database. Furthermore, correlations between axle load distributions and the vehicle mix, depending on the traffic characteristics of a section, were to be investigated. During the test operation the accuracy of the dynamic axle load equipment was to be checked with the aid of static weighing equipment (wheel load measuring equipment), and the experience gained during the practical operation of the equipment systems was to be documented. The documentation of all breakdowns and malfunctions showed limited breakdown times of a total of one to three weeks for each of the five measuring points during a stipulated eight-month analysis period. In the initial phase there were a few breakdowns and malfunctions in the equipment due to hardware and software errors, which were immediately remedied through exchanging the respective defect electronic components and improving the software - in particular to adapt it to the TLS requirements. With regard to the accuracy of the axle load measurements compared to the static measuring results, relatively limited deviations were determined, and the long-term stability of the calibration setting was proved over a period of six months. After initial difficulties, the equipment system with bending plates which was used for these measurements was hence able to prove its suitability, above all with regard to the further expansion of the network.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDBackground: Syphilis {{transmission}} {{remains a}} global problem with an estimated 12 million people infected each year. Ninety percent of syphilis cases occur in low income countries. Syphilis is a serious source of adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mother and infant. Ideally, syphilis screening should be provided {{as part of a}} package of maternal and newborn health-care services. This thesis reports on a pilot intervention study to develop, implement and evaluate a point of care test for syphilis in antenatal care services in rural Burkina Faso. Methods: This study used a pre post intervention mixed methods quasi-experimental design with a group of health facilities offering ANC services (primary health centers in rural area) as the sampling units. This study was conducted in three phases, which consisted of a situational analysis using qualitative methods (Phase 1), selecting an appropriate test through evaluating 4 candidate tests and the participatory design and implementation of an intervention that included onsite training, provision of supplies and medicines, quality control and <b>supervision</b> (<b>Phase</b> 2), and an evaluation combining review of record tools, interviews, time motion study and estimating incremental costs (Phase 3). The conceptual framework draws on multilevel assessment (MLA), policy triangle framework, MRC framework for designing complex interventions and the Normalization Process Model (NPM). Methods included document review, seventy five interviews were conducted with health providers, district managers, facility managers, traditional healers, pregnant women, community health workers, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) managers in phase I and fourteen in phase III, non-participant observation, time-motion study, incremental cost analysis, and sensitivity, specificity and ease of use analysis of four candidate point-of care tests. Data were collected between 2012 and 2014. Qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis supported by Nvivo software. Quantitative data were analyzed through descriptive statistics such as frequency, mean and median supported by SPSS. Findings: Phase I identified barriers to implementation and uptake of syphilis testing at health provider and community levels. The most important barriers at provider level included fragmentation of services, poor communication between health workers and clients, failure to prescribe syphilis test, and low awareness of syphilis burden. Cost of testing, distance to laboratory and lack of knowledge about syphilis were identified as barriers at community level. Phase II: Alere DetermineTM Syphilis was the most sensitive of the four point-of-care tests evaluated. The components of the intervention were successfully implemented in the selected health facilities. Overall, phase III showed that it is feasible and acceptable to introduce a point of care test for syphilis in antenatal care services at primary health care level using the available staff. The intervention was reported as acceptable, but of 812 pregnant women who came for their first visit 39 % were screened during the study period. Rural facilities had higher coverage (66. 8 %) than the urban ones (25. 6 %). Quality control found no discordance between the rapid test and TPHA results. The average cost of ANC per unscreened pregnant woman was 3. 11 USD (± 0. 14) vs 5. 06 USD (± 0. 16) per screened woman. The main cost driver was the material costs notably the test itself. The test’s cost is comparable to HIV test costs, but funder support for integrating this additional test is less readily available than for HIV tests. Conclusions: The findings suggested that an intervention that introduces point of care test for syphilis at antenatal care services is feasible, acceptable, and of comparable costs to HIV screening in pregnancy. Nonetheless, instructions and supervision need to be clearer to achieve optimal levels of screening and quality control, and barriers identified by health workers need to be overcome. The point-of care test for syphilis is likely to be acceptable by health workers as a routine service and incorporated as a normal practice in Burkina Faso context.

This paper describes the development of a unified national clinical assessment and reporting form that was implemented nationally by all six universities in 2009. Methods: A four phase methodology was used to develop the new assessment form and user guide. Phase 1 included university consensus around domains of student practice and assessment, and alignment with national competency standards; Phase 2 was a national consensus workshop attended by radiation therapists involved in student <b>supervision</b> and assessment; <b>Phase</b> 3 was an action research re-iterative Delphi technique involving two rounds of a mail-out to gain further expert consensus; and stage 4 was national piloting of the developed assessment form. Results: The new assessment form includes five main domains of practice and 19 sub-domain criteria which students are assessed against during placement. Feedback from the pilot centre participants was positive, with the new form being assessed to be comprehensive and complemented by the accompanying user guide. Conclusion: The new assessment form has improved both the formative and summative assessment of students on placement, as well as enhancing the quality of feedback to students and the universities. The new national form has high acceptance from the Australian universities and has been subject to wide review by the profession...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This pilot project, {{which was}} jointly {{conducted}} by a hospital and a university, describes {{the development of the}} Master's Degree Programme in Leadership in Medicine, a course designed to supplement medical specialty training. The aim of the pilot project is to demonstrate how hospital-based projects on personnel and organisational development undertaken under academic supervision can be used to increase leadership responsibility among doctors whose duties include providing initial and follow-on training and to professionalise medical specialty training as a leadership task. This need arose from the nationwide requirements and an internal audit regarding follow-on training. The version of the degree programme described below aims to further the personnel development {{of the participants in the}} field of didactics. Method: Each of the nine modules is made up of two classroom-based phases and one distance learning phase. The distance learning phase involves undertaking hospital-based projects on personnel and organisational development under academic <b>supervision.</b> The pilot <b>phase</b> participants were hospital doctors who, as part of their duties, hold leadership responsibility or are involved in the follow-on training of doctors. Results: The 17 participants successfully implemented more than 30 hospital-based projects during the distance learning phases of the nine modules. These projects included the development of medical specialty curricula, relevant didactic methods and evaluation design and were subsequently presented and subjected to reflection in interdisciplinary groups. The project presentation together with the project report were regarded as proof of competency. Conclusion: In addition to enhancing participant competency, the degree model described, which interlinks theory and practice, promotes organisational development through the implementation of projects undertaken under academic supervision. This has a double impact on the quality of medical follow-on training at the hospital where the participant is based, for not only is the individual's didactic competency enhanced, but so is the "learning organisation" as a whole as a result of continuous project orientation...|$|R

This study asked elementary-school principals to identify their supervisory philosophy and platform and the recommendations they would make regarding supervision that impacted teaching and student learning. This study, supporting R. J. Starratt's work, provided an opportunity for principals to explain the issues they had with supervisory practices and make recommendations for improvements. The research question asked how principals' supervisory philosophies and platforms were reflected in their recommendations for improvement of the process of <b>supervision.</b> The first <b>phase</b> of this study asked eight experienced elementary-school principals to complete the Glickman Supervisory Beliefs Inventory. The second phase asked principals to respond to seven adapted Sergiovanni philosophical platform questions indicating supervision behaviors and attitudes believed to be important. The last phase involved interviewing and recording the responses of the principals regarding their issues, struggles, and recommendations. Primarily qualitative methods were used to analyze the data. Patterns emerged that were reflective of the philosophy and beliefs as they connected with the principals' recommendations. The study findings suggested that the philosophical beliefs and platforms of these principals were connected to a majority of the supervision recommendations. The principal types were either collaborative, nondirective, or both. Of the 10 discrete recommendations made by the three principal types, 6 of 10 had dissimilar philosophies. Regarding their platforms, the majority, 7 of 10, were common to two or more of the principals. Key findings were philosophical differences among the principal types regarding their recommendations and many commonalities regarding their beliefs and attitudes about supervision. The study also indicated that even when principals have similar recommendations regarding supervision practices, their reasons are based on different philosophies, beliefs, and attitudes. These results suggested that what principals believe [...] their attitudes and perceptions [...] are the basis for what they recommend for their schools' supervision process, which suggested a lack of congruence between imposed models and what principals recommended. Recommendations at the conclusion of this study suggested the need for reviewing current supervision practices given the beliefs and philosophies of principals regarding their issues and struggles.

The main goal {{of this study was}} to conduct in-depth research to determine how the field social workers and supervisors perceive supervision in terms of the administrative, educational and supportive functions. The objectives of the study were: to conceptualise social work supervision with regard to the administrative, educational and supportive functions, to conduct an empirical study to explore the nature of supervision as implemented in the Ekurhuleni region of the Department of Social Development, and to formulate conclusions and recommendations according to the findings. The study was guided by a research question which was formulated as follows: “How do the field social workers and supervisors perceive the supervision that is practised in the Department of Health and Social Development, Ekurhuleni region, in terms of the functions of supervision, and how can the quality of supervision be improved?” A quantitative research approach was used in this study. The researcher intended to explore and describe, in a statistical way, the nature of supervision as practised in the Department of Health and Social Development, Ekurhuleni region. This study is applied research because it concentrates on the quality of supervision and how to improve the quality of it – which is a practical problem focused on problem-solving. The research design in this study was a randomized, cross-sectional, quantitative survey design, and a group-administered questionnaire as data collection method was used. The research population consisted of the supervisors and social workers in the service of the Department of Health and Social Development, Ekurhuleni Region. A sample of forty-six social workers completed the questionnaires. In analysing the data, non-parametric tests were used. Primarily, the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskall-Wallis test were used. The literature study emphasised the importance of supervision in social work practice. Supervision is a vital method to enable social workers to grow personally as well as professionally, in order to render an effective and efficient service to the client system. An overall view was provided regarding the definition and objectives of supervision, the characteristics of an effective supervisor, the models of <b>supervision,</b> and the <b>phases</b> in the supervisory process. The study focused mainly on the three functions of supervision – namely, the administrative, educational and supportive functions, which described the different roles of the supervisor comprehensively. The study found that supervision, as it is practised in the Department of Health and Social Development, Ekurhuleni region, is not structured enough, and that more training should be given to newly appointed supervisors, as well as in-service training to supervisors. Recommendations have been made in order to enhance the quality of supervision and, ultimately, service delivery to the client system...|$|R
40|$|This {{discussion}} paper describes a specific approach to content analysing multilevel party manifestos {{building on a}} methodology that was originally developed {{in the context of}} the Manifesto Research Group (MRG). Since 1979, the MRG has been collecting and coding national-level election programs with the aim of estimating policy preferences of political parties. The second phase of the project started in 1989. In the context of its Comparative Manifestos Project (CMP), the Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB) provided resources for updating and expanding the MRG data. Since then, country experts were hired to collect and code national election programs according to a handbook that describes how to identify the coding units and how to apply the classification scheme of policy preferences under central <b>supervision.</b> The third <b>phase</b> of the project took off in 2009. The Manifesto Project is now part of a long-term grant scheme of the German Research Foundation (DFG) which finances quality enhancement, updates, extensions, and distribution of the 50 country text and content analytical data collection under the title Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR). The MRG/CMP/MARPOR Project is solely concerned with national election programs. However, in decentralized political systems, parties also publish local and regional election programs and, in times of globalization, transnational party federations increasingly produce joint programs. Comparing these manifestos in multilevel settings can provide additional answers to questions of multilevel governance. This handbook presents a manual content-analytical approach to identifying parties' multilevel preferences. It instructs coders on how to apply two combined content analytical classification schemes: first, the classification of multilevel policy preferences, based on the MRG/CMP/MARPOR classification developed for national manifestos but adapted to multilevel elections and, second, a classification of territorial authority claims on multiple levels of governance. This double classification scheme is then applied to regional party manifestos in Spain, providing examples of multilevel analysis for training coders and testing their grasp of the complex concepts of parties' multilevel preferences. (author's abstract) Der vorliegende Ansatz zur Inhaltsanalyse von Parteiprogrammen in politischen Mehrebenensystemen basiert auf einer Methodologie, die im Rahmen der Manifesto Research Group (MRG) entwickelt wurde. 1979 begann die MRG Parteiprogramme zu sammeln und zu analysieren, um politische Positionen von Parteien komparativ mittels eines klassischen inhaltanalytischen Ansatzes zu messen. Seit 1989 stellte das Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung (WZB) im Rahmen des Comparative Manifestos Projects (CMP) Mittel zur Verfügung, um die MRG-Daten zu aktualisieren und zu erweitern. Seither werden Länderexperten damit beauftragt, die Wahlprogramme unter zentraler Begleitung und Kontrolle zu kodieren. Dabei erläutert ein Handbuch die Identifikation der Kodiereinheiten und die Anwendung des Klassifikationsschemas der politischen Positionen. Im Jahr 2009 nahm die Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) das Projekt unter dem Titel Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR) in ihr Langzeitförderprogramm auf. Sie finanziert nun in einer dritten Phase des Projekts Qualitätsverbesserungen, Updates, Erweiterungen sowie die Distribution der Datensammlung, die Texte und inhaltsanalytische Daten für 50 Länder umfasst. Das MRG/CMP/MARPOR-Projekt befasst sich ausschließlich mit Parteiprogrammen zu nationalen Wahlen. In dezentralisierten politischen Systemen geben Parteien aber auch lokale und regionale Wahlprogramme heraus und transnationale Parteienzusammenschlüsse verfassen in Zeiten der Globalisierung zunehmend gemeinsame Programme. Ein Vergleich solcher Programme für verschiedene Ebenen kann neue Einsichten in Governanceprobleme von Mehrebenensystemen ermöglichen. Dieses Handbuch stellt einen manuellen inhaltsanalytischen Ansatz vor, mit dem Parteipräferenzen auf verschiedenen Ebenen identifiziert werden können. Coder lernen, wie sie zwei inhaltsanalytische, miteinander kombinierte Klassifikationsschemata anwenden können: einerseits die Klassifikation von Politikpräferenzen auf verschiedenen Ebenen basierend auf der MRG/CMP/MARPORKlassifikation politischer Positionen, die für nationale Parteiprogramme entwickelt wurde, und andererseits die Klassifikation politischer Autonomieansprüche auf verschiedenen Ebenen von Governance. Diese doppelte Klassifikation wird anschließend auf spanische Regionalwahlprogramme angewendet. Daraus ergeben sich Beispiele einer Mehrebenenanalyse, die für die Ausbildung von Codern und für eine Überprüfung ihres Verständnisses der komplexen Konzepte von Parteipositionen in Mehrebenensystemen genutzt werden können.
