Objectives: To {{evaluate}} tennis serve realization in {{the selected}} performance category, to review speed of particular serve types and define the differences. To create detailed movement {{analysis of the}} slice serve from {{the right side of}} the court and <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>trajectory</b> of the centre of gravity. Methods: Case study using kinematic 2 D and 3 D analysis was made. Results: We found out that the flat serve is the fastest type of serve. There are differences in the body centre of gravity trajectory by comparison with elite tennis players. We also found out that serving from {{the right side of the}} court is being hit higher, than from the left side. We assume there is a very close connection between serve speed and the point of impact. Keywords: tennis, serve, kinematic analysis, 2 D, 3...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{spectrum}} of off-diagonal fluctuations between displaced fuzzy spheres in the BMN plane wave matrix model. The displacement is along {{the plane of the}} fuzzy spheres. We find that when two fuzzy spheres intersect at angles classical tachyons develop and that {{the spectrum of}} these modes can be computed analytically. These tachyons can be related to the familiar Nielsen-Olesen instabilities in Yang-Mills theory on a constant magnetic background. Many features of the problem become more apparent when we compare with maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills on a sphere, of which this system is a truncation. We also <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> simple oscillatory <b>trajectory</b> on the displacement between the fuzzy spheres and study the dynamics of the modes as they become tachyonic for part of the oscillations. We speculate on their role regarding the possible thermalization of the system. ar X i...|$|R
40|$|Leukocyte {{telomere}} length (LTL) is {{a predictor}} of age-related disease onset and mortality. The association in adults of psychosocial stress or stress biomarkers with LTL suggests telomere biology may represent a possible underlying mechanism linking stress and health outcomes. It is, however, unknown whether stress exposure in intrauterine life can produce variations in LTL, thereby potentially <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> long-term <b>trajectory</b> for disease susceptibility. We, therefore, as a first step, tested the hypothesis that stress exposure during intrauterine life is associated with shorter telomeres in adult life after accounting {{for the effects of}} other factors on LTL. LTL was assessed in 94 healthy young adults. Forty-five subjects were offspring of mothers who had experienced a severe stressor in the index pregnancy (prenatal stress group; PSG), and 49 subjects were offspring of mothers who had a healthy, uneventful index pregnancy (comparison group; CG). Prenatal stress exposure {{was a significant predictor of}} subsequent adult telomere length in the offspring (178 -bp difference between prenatal stress and CG; d = 0. 41 SD units; P < 0. 05). The effect was substantially unchanged after adjusting for potential confounders (subject characteristics, birth weight percentile, and early-life and concurrent stress level), and was more pronounced in women (295 -bp difference; d = 0. 68 SD units; P < 0. 01). To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence in humans of an association between prenatal stress exposure and subsequent shorter telomere length. This observation may help shed light on an important biological pathway underlying the developmental origins of adult health and disease risk...|$|R
40|$|The precise {{real-time}} space/coordinate {{information in}} the battle field can assist in making proper decision. A UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) system has several desirable characteristics. For example, it can offer the integrated functions of information, surveillance, and reconnaissance. It can provide its own 3 D coordinate through the GPS. Moreover, it can transmit real-time images. Therefore, in this project, we will utilize the UAV system to develop a synthetic vision system to construct an information platform for the battle field. We will integrate four subprojects (1. A Real-time Image Enhancement Technique, 2. Image feature extraction and object detection and recognition, 3. Development of an integrated system of flight information and real-time images, and 4. Integration of UAV video and 3 -D geographical map) to implement a system which can fuse information from different sources so that {{the effectiveness of the}} UAV system can be greatly improved. We will overlay virtual images onto real images and combine the flight information of all kinds to become a new information display platform, which can offer assistance for guidance and control. For example, eHUD can provide information for the control of the UAV. Tunnel-in-The-Sky can <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> specific flight <b>trajectory</b> in three-dimensional space and provide relevant information of the trajectory in advance. In addition, we will utilize the coordinate information from the GPS of the UAV, the pointing angles of the camera, and the GIS database to construct the 3 D synthetic images which can indicate the relative position of the surveillance region in the whole battle field so that the commander can have precise knowledge of the situation. 戰場空間資訊能提供戰場決策的支援，擁有良好的戰場定位資訊及空間分析管理，可適時掌握決策，輔助提供指揮官之決心下達。在本計畫中，我們將利用UAV具備情報、監視與偵察(ISR) 功能的若干特點，及系統具有全球定位導航、即時影像傳輸等功能，來發展合成影像技術，建構戰場空間資訊平台，並將相關戰場資訊顯示螢幕上。我們將整合四個子計畫（即時影像強化技術研究、影像特徵萃取及目標偵測與辨識、飛行訊息與即時影像整合系統之研發、無人載具偵蒐錄影與三度空間地理地圖資訊之整合）以實做一個系統，將飛行資訊、圖資與即時影像作整合顯示，使無人載具系統任務達成的效益性能夠有效提昇。在計畫中，我們將利用虛擬圖像與真實影像的重疊顯示技術，以將各類型的飛行資訊與即時影像結合，達到訊息融合的目的，提供飛行導引與控制之用。例如，eHUD可以輔助飛行操控，與Tunnel in The Sky可以預測飛行路徑，於三度空間中建立特定的飛行軌跡，提供預劃飛行路徑之相關飛行資訊，確保任務遂行。此外，我們計畫利用UAV的GPS地理座標資訊，以及機載偵照系統的指示角度、擷取之影像資訊，復以即時的資料庫圖資比對，構建出戰場偵照空域之地形、地物、地貌三度空間合成影像，並能顯示出偵測目標區域與全戰區區域之相對關係，俾利各級指揮官掌握戰場態勢...|$|R
