50|$|<b>Spamdexing</b> is the {{deliberate}} manipulation of search engine indexes. It uses {{a number of}} methods to manipulate the relevance or prominence of resources indexed in a manner unaligned {{with the intention of}} the indexing system. <b>Spamdexing</b> can be very distressing for users and problematic for search engines because the return contents of searches have poor precision. This will eventually result in the search engine becoming unreliable and not dependable for the user. To tackle <b>Spamdexing,</b> search robot algorithms are made more complex and are changed almost everyday to eliminate the problem.|$|E

50|$|On the Web, the {{predominant}} form of such manipulation is search engine spamming (also known as <b>spamdexing),</b> which involves employing various techniques {{to disrupt the}} activity of web search engines, usually for financial gain. Examples of <b>spamdexing</b> are link-bombing, comment or referrer spam, spam blogs (splogs), malicious tagging. Reverse engineering of ranking algorithms, advertisement blocking, click fraud, and web content filtering may also be considered forms of adversarial data manipulation.|$|E

Although some link farms can be created by hand, most are created through automated programs and services. A link farm {{is a form of}} spamming the index of a web search engine (sometimes called <b>spamdexing).</b> Other link exchange systems are designed to allow individual websites to selectively exchange links with other relevant websites and are not considered a form of <b>spamdexing.</b>|$|E

It involves {{a number of}} methods, such as repeating unrelated phrases, to manipulate the relevance or prominence of resources indexed, in a manner inconsistent {{with the purpose of}} the indexing system.It could be considered {{to be a part of}} search engine optimization, though there are many search engine optimization methods that improve the quality and appearance of the content of web sites and serve content useful to many users. Search engines use a variety of algorithms to determine relevancy ranking. Some of these include determining whether the search term appears in the body text or URL of a web page. Many search engines check for instances of <b>spamdexing</b> and will remove suspect pages from their indexes. Also, search-engine operators can quickly block the results-listing from entire websites that use <b>spamdexing,</b> perhaps alerted by user complaints of false matches. The rise of <b>spamdexing</b> in the mid-1990s made the leading search engines of the time less useful. Using unethical methods to make websites rank higher in search engine results than they otherwise would is commonly referred to in the SEO (search engine optimization) industry as [...] "black hat SEO". These methods are more focused on breaking the search engine promotion rules and guidelines. Not only this, there will be all that much risks for a website to get penalized from Google Panda and Google Penguin search results ranking algorithms.|$|E

These were <b>spamdexing</b> practices that violated Google's webmaster guidelines. As a result, some Traffic Power clients were banned from Google's organic search results.|$|E
50|$|Google bombing {{is related}} to <b>spamdexing,</b> the {{practice}} of deliberately modifying HTML to increase the chance of their website being placed close {{to the beginning of}} search engine results, or to influence the category to which the page is assigned in a misleading or dishonest manner.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{elements}} that a search engine algorithm scans for is the frequency and location of keywords on a Web page. Those with higher frequency are typically considered more relevant. But search engine technology is becoming sophisticated {{in its attempt to}} discourage what is known as keyword stuffing, or <b>spamdexing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some scraper sites link {{to other}} sites {{to improve their}} search engine ranking through a private blog network. Prior to Google's update to its search {{algorithm}} known as Panda, a type of scraper site known as an auto blog was quite common among black hat marketers who used a method known as <b>spamdexing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cloaking {{is often}} used as a <b>spamdexing</b> {{technique}} to try to trick search engines into giving the relevant site a higher ranking.

50|$|This is a SEO {{technique}} in which different materials and information {{are sent to}} the web crawler and to the web browser.

There are three primary methods used to achieve this: ...|$|E
5000|$|Black hat SEO {{could also}} be {{referred}} to as <b>Spamdexing,</b> which utilizes other black SEO strategies and link building tactics. Some black hat link building strategies include getting unqualified links from and participating in Link farm, link schemes and Doorway page. Black Hat SEO could also refer to [...] "negative SEO," [...] the practice of deliberately harming another website's performance.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{also used}} by {{websites}} as a <b>spamdexing</b> technique to fill a page with keywords that a search engine will recognize but are not visible to a visitor. However, Google has taken steps to prevent this by parsing the color of text as it indexes it and {{checking to see if}} it is transparent, giving those pages much lower rankings.|$|E

50|$|Doorway {{pages are}} web pages that are created for <b>spamdexing.</b> This is for {{spamming}} {{the index of}} a search engine by inserting results for particular phrases {{with the purpose of}} sending visitors to a different page. They are also known as bridge pages, portal pages, jump pages, gateway pages, entry pages and by other names. Doorway pages that redirect visitors without their knowledge use some form of cloaking. This usually falls under Black Hat SEO.|$|E

50|$|Keyword {{stuffing}} is {{a search}} engine optimization (SEO) technique, considered webspam or <b>spamdexing,</b> in which a web page is loaded with keywords in the meta tags or in content of a web page {{in an attempt to}} gain an unfair rank advantage in search engines. Keyword stuffing may lead to a website being banned or penalized on major search engines either temporarily or permanently. The repetition of words in meta tags may explain why many search engines no longer use these tags.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{internet}} search engines tend to produce too many matches (known as recall) {{for the average}} search query. Proximity searching is one method of {{reducing the number of}} pages matches, and to improve the relevance of the matched pages by using word proximity to assist in ranking. As an added benefit, proximity searching helps combat <b>spamdexing</b> by avoiding webpages which contain dictionary lists or shotgun lists of thousands of words, which would otherwise rank highly if the search engine was heavily biased toward word frequency.|$|E
50|$|Referrer spam (also {{known as}} {{referral}} spam, log spam or referrer bombing) {{is a kind}} of <b>spamdexing</b> (spamming aimed at search engines). The technique involves making repeated web site requests using a fake referrer URL to the site the spammer wishes to advertise. Sites that publish their access logs, including referer statistics, will then inadvertently link back to the spammer's site. These links will be indexed by search engines as they crawl the access logs, improving the spammer's search engine ranking. Except for polluting their statistics, the technique does not harm the affected sites.|$|E
50|$|The {{strategic}} {{goal that}} Panda, Penguin, and the page layout update share is to display higher quality websites {{at the top}} of Google's search results. However, sites that were downranked as the result of these updates have different sets of characteristics. The main target of Google Penguin is <b>spamdexing</b> (including link bombing). Google updates such as Penguin now entice webmasters to follow Google's Webmaster Guidelines and only use white hat techniques that will benefit the user and ensures that the user will always see the most relevant content on page 1 of the search results.|$|E
50|$|SEO {{techniques}} {{can be classified}} into two broad categories: techniques that search engines recommend as part of good design, and those techniques of which search engines do not approve. The search engines attempt to minimize {{the effect of the}} latter, among them <b>spamdexing.</b> Industry commentators have classified these methods, and the practitioners who employ them, as either white hat SEO, or black hat SEO. White hats tend to produce results that last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing.|$|E
50|$|Spam in blogs (also called simply blog spam, comment spam, {{or social}} spam) {{is a form}} of <b>spamdexing.</b> (Note that blogspam also has another meaning, namely the post of a blogger who creates posts that have no added value to them in order to submit them to other sites.) It is done by posting (usually automatically) random comments, copying {{material}} from elsewhere that is not original, or promoting commercial services to blogs, wikis, guestbooks, or other publicly accessible online discussion boards. Any web application that accepts and displays hyperlinks submitted by visitors may be a target.|$|E
50|$|Employment of the nofollow {{attribute}} by Wikipedia on all external links {{has been}} criticized by web authors for not passing the deserved rank to referenced pages which serve as the original source of each Wikipedia article's content. The decision was enacted on Wikipedia to combat <b>spamdexing</b> on its pages, which are an otherwise tempting target for spammers as Wikipedia is a very high-ranking site on most search engines. The drawbacks for original publishers are that they must compete with the Wikipedia article for a higher rank in search results and that their website does not receive the increase in rank that {{otherwise would have been}} contributed without nofollow.|$|E
