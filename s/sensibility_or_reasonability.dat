5000|$|Two Hearts {{received}} poor reviews {{upon its}} release. In a brief retrospective review, Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it [...] "a bland, synthesized variation on mainstream pop, featuring {{none of the}} melodic <b>sensibilities</b> <b>or</b> subtle humor of their first two albums." ...|$|R

She {{turned away from}} the fame-makers and artist-merchants, often with just scant cause, and generally made herself inaccessible. By choice, she never connected with the major institutions nor lingered for long in the limelight." ...|$|R

Herzog related his {{frustration}} with slowness of the camera in interview with DGA Quarterly, saying [...] "It's an immature camera created by computer {{people who do not}} have a <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> understanding for the value of high-precision mechanics, which has a 200-year history." ...|$|R
25|$|The second, {{and more}} recent, {{sense of the}} word art as an {{abbreviation}} for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century. Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic <b>sensibilities,</b> <b>or</b> to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer work of art.|$|R

25|$|This was not easy. The obvious venue {{would be}} a church, but several churches—including Riis's own—demurred, fearing either that the talks would offend the churchgoers' <b>sensibilities</b> <b>or</b> that they would offend rich and {{powerful}} landlords. However, Adolph Schauffler (of the City Mission Society) and Josiah Strong arranged to sponsor Riis's lecture at the Broadway Tabernacle church. Lacking money, Riis partnered with W.L. Craig, a Health Department clerk.|$|R
60|$|So far, then, as taste {{belongs to}} the imagination, its {{principle}} is the same in all men; there is no different {{in the manner of}} their being affected, nor in the causes of the affection; but in the DEGREE there is a difference, which arises from two causes principally; either from a greater degree of natural <b>sensibility,</b> <b>or</b> from a closer and longer attention to the object.|$|R
6000|$|If we must {{recommend}} one of Miss Austen's novels, perhaps Pride and Prejudice is {{the most}} typical; but {{there is very little}} to justify this choice when the alternative is Northanger Abbey, or Emma, <b>or</b> Sense and <b>Sensibility,</b> <b>or</b> Persuasion, or Mansfield Park. All are good; the most definite stricture that one can safely make is that Mansfield Park is not so good as the others. Four of the novels are confined to country parishes; but in Northanger Abbey and Persuasion the horizon is broadened to include a watering place, whither genteel folk went [...] "to take the air." ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{accidents}} or scandals due to organizational violation-based error frequently occur. One of {{the causes}} might be maladjustment to environmental changes surrounding organization from relief to global society. In this study, the following proposition was hypothesized: Social intelligence (SI), ability to evaluate appropriately the reliability of others, ability to carry out communication smoothly in organization, and emotional aspects (behavior {{on the basis of}} emotion <b>or</b> <b>reasonability)</b> are important factors and keys to prevent violation-based organizational error. A questionnaire which included items related to social intelligence (SI: social awareness and social facility), emotional intelligence (EI), ability to evaluate the reliability of others, ability to communicate smoothly in organization, behavioral characteristics (emotional- or reasonability-based behavior), and ability to make decisions and judge situations. An attempt was made to verify the hypothesis above by a survey using the questionnaire...|$|R

40|$|Background: Postural {{alterations}} of the shoulders, dorsal {{spine and}} hips {{could have an}} influence {{on the development of}} craniomandibular dysfunctions. Aim: To study the influence of body posture on the prevalence of craniomandibular dysfunction. Subjects and methods: One hundred thirty six dental students and 41 patients assisting to the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) clinic at the Freie Universität at Berlin, were studied. Masticator, cervical muscles, temporomandibular joints and occlusions were clinically examined. The position of shoulders and hips was measured with the use of an acromiopelvimeter. Results: No relationship was found between postural alterations of the hips and shoulders, articular noises and <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> pain while palpating the temporomandibular joints. Among students, a relationship between postural alterations of the shoulders and the <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> pain while palpating the TMJ, was observed. When all muscles were considered, a significant relationship between asymmetric shoulders or hips and muscular pain while palpating was observed among students. Conclusions: Some symptoms, especially muscular sensibility is more pronounced in people with hip and shoulder asymmetries. This relation is more pronounced in dental students than in patients...|$|R
30|$|The dynamic {{nature of}} sensor {{networks}} means no structure can be statically defined. Cognitive approach includes new dynamic issues: communication protocol, modulation, frequency, <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> emitted power. The attacker can use these powerful characteristics {{to affect the}} data transmissions between nodes with a concrete purpose. The goal could be from isolate a node {{to try to change}} the behaviour of entire network. Security schemes must be able to operate within this dynamic environment.|$|R

Other members of the group were Mu Shiying, Liu Na'ou, Shi Zhecun, and Du Heng, whose Third Category thesis (that a writer could be on the left but remain independent) Dai defended against the hard line taken by the May Fourth Movement veteran Lu Xun.|$|R
50|$|Self-censorship is {{the act of}} {{censoring}} or classifying one's own blog, book, film, {{or other}} forms of media. This is done out of fear of, or deference to, the <b>sensibilities</b> <b>or</b> preferences (actual or perceived) of others and without overt pressure from any specific party or institution of authority. Self-censorship is often practiced by film producers, film directors, publishers, news anchors, journalists, musicians, and other kinds of authors including individuals who use social media.|$|R
5000|$|The Kroffts {{are often}} {{acknowledged}} for the ambitious vision and creativity of their projects. In {{addition to their}} recognizably colorful and hyper-kinetic programs, they often created children's shows with complex stories, unusual protagonists, uniquely modern <b>sensibilities,</b> <b>or</b> with darker or more action-themed tones than most children's shows. Their [...] "camp" [...] popularity stems largely from their shows' low-budget production values, the often surrealistic feel {{of many of the}} programs, and the uniquely [...] "'70s" [...] style of music and design.|$|R

I come straight from his bedside. He is almost always insensible. In a short restless interval of <b>sensibility,</b> <b>or</b> partial <b>sensibility,</b> I made out that he asked for you to be brought to sit by him. Hardly relying on my own interpretation of the indistinct sounds he made, I caused Lizzie to hear them. We were both sure that he asked for you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Even {{in these}} days, when every man is, by hypothesis, {{as good as}} another, does not the {{question}} sound strange to you? You recognize in the past, as you think, clearly, that national advance takes place always {{under the guidance of}} masters, or groups of masters, possessed of what appears to be some new personal <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> gift of invention; and we are apt to be reverent to these alone, as if the nation itself had been unprogressive, and suddenly awakened, or converted, by the genius of one man.|$|R
40|$|I'm {{sure that}} {{everyone}} can think of something {{in the name of}} culture that continues to trouble them, infuriates them in its refusal to resolve into meaning, coherence and closure. I'm talking about those moments of aesthetic engagement with opaque melodies that would bug most people. I'm talking about a poetics of dislocation. In referring to a poetics of dislocation, rather than pointing to a historical epoch characterised by dislocation, I am citing an ongoing continuum, a trans-historical, para-cultural <b>sensibility,</b> <b>or,</b> as Aristotle would have it, a way of doing things...|$|R
5000|$|Molière {{has been}} accused of not having a consistent, organic style, of using faulty grammar, of mixing his metaphors, and of using {{unnecessary}} words for the purpose of filling out his lines. All these things are occasionally true, but they are trifles in comparison to the wealth of character he portrayed, to his brilliancy of wit, and to the resourcefulness of his technique. He was wary of <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> pathos; but in place of pathos he had [...] "melancholy—a puissant and searching melancholy, which strangely sustains his inexhaustible mirth and his triumphant gaiety".|$|R
5000|$|He {{received}} only scant public recognition {{during his lifetime}} for his labours {{in the cause of}} optical science. Some of his papers were not printed by the Académie des Sciences until many years after his death. But as he wrote to Young in 1824: in himself [...] "that <b>sensibility,</b> <b>or</b> that vanity, which people call love of glory" [...] had been blunted. [...] "All the compliments," [...] he says, [...] "that I have received from Arago, Laplace and Biot never gave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretic truth, or the confirmation of a calculation by experiment".|$|R
5000|$|Rokeya Sultana showed {{increased}} {{activity from}} the nineties. Her work became distinguished by {{the depiction of}} her self-realization andher lived experience. She represented her daily struggle in the known surroundings of her city. Her images are similar to child art. Syed Manzoorul Islam specifies, 'Her works [...] [...] [...] draw strength from primitive <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> from a child's unrestricted vision. She works in prints and other media. Rhythmic lines and figurative imagery lends distinction to her work. Woman's existence, experience and the sensory world from a woman's perception are the materials that make up her work.|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Circulating (serous or plasmic) {{long non-coding}} RNA (lncRNA) as {{biomarkers}} for predicting the diagnosis or prognosis of human disease {{have been well}} documented. Due to the <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> specificity limitation of Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP), a cluster lncRNAs were revealed as fingerprints for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we enrolled all the reported circulating lncRNAs in HCC as candidate targets and examined in an independent cohort. Methods: The candidate lncRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR divided into training and validation sets. The risk score analysis was employed to evaluate the potential diagnosis ability of the lncRNAs independently or combining with AFP value. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was applied for presentation of <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> specificity. Results: Among the ten candidate circulating lncRNA, LINC 00152, RP 11 - 160 H 22. 5, XLOC 014172 and LOC 149086 were screened with significant difference in training set. Further investigation in validation set indicated LINC 00152, RP 11 - 160 H 22. 5 and XLOC 014172 might be the fingerprints for HCC comparing with chronic hepatitis (CH) patients or healthy controls. The risk score analysis revealed the combination of three lncRNAs with AFP could distinguish the HCC from either CH or healthy control with the area under curve value (AUC) of 0. 986 and 0. 985, respectively. Conclusion: The three lncRNAs may act as novel biomarkers for acting as fingerprint in HCC combining with AFP...|$|R
30|$|There {{are four}} {{possible}} explanations for why history textbook authors employ CACs. One reason relates to historical content. History textbook authors intentionally develop unified, nation-state narratives free of contentious views (FitzGerald 1979; Moreau 2004; O’Leary 1999; Zimmerman 2002). No matter how unified (some say “white-washed”) these narratives are, however, conflict amongst historical interpretations cannot always be completely ironed out of the narrative. Whether because of (1) a lack of historical evidence, (2) varied interpretations, (3) political <b>sensibilities,</b> <b>or</b> (4) a combination thereof, relationships between historical events are not always clear. Thus, {{there are times when}} textbook authors surely have to hedge, making implied causal links rather than explicit ones.|$|R
50|$|An energy filter can {{be added}} to the {{instrument}} in order to select the electrons that will contribute to the image. This option is particularly used for analytical applications of the PEEM. By using an energy filter, a PEEM microscope can be seen as imaging UPS or XPS. By using this method, spatially resolved photoemission spectra can be acquired with spatial resolutions on the 100 nm scale and with sub-eV resolution. Using such instrument, one can acquire elemental images with chemical state <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> work function maps. Also, since the photoelectron are emitted only at the very surface of the material, surface termination maps can be acquired.|$|R
5000|$|Call centres have {{received}} criticism for low pay rates and restrictive working practices for employees, {{which have been}} deemed as a dehumanising environment. Other research illustrates how call centre workers develop ways to counter or resist this environment by integrating local cultural <b>sensibilities</b> <b>or</b> embracing {{a vision of a}} new life. Most call centres provide electronic reports that outline performance metrics, quarterly highlights and other information about the calls made and received. This has the benefit of helping the company to plan the workload and time of its employees. However, it has also been argued that such close monitoring breaches the human right to privacy.|$|R

But all the [...] compliments which I have received from M.M.

60|$|Having, in {{the tale}} of the Heart of Mid-Lothian, succeeded in some degree in {{awakening}} an interest in behalf of one devoid of those accomplishments which belong to a heroine almost by right, I was next tempted to choose a hero upon the same unpromising plan; and as worth of character, goodness of heart, and rectitude of principle, were necessary to one who laid no claim to high birth, romantic <b>sensibility,</b> <b>or</b> any of the usual accomplishments of those who strut through the pages of this sort of composition, I made free with the name of a person who has left the most magnificent proofs of his benevolence and charity that the capital of Scotland has to display.|$|R
6000|$|You {{will get}} {{a better idea of}} the sentimentalism that more or less {{influences}} the tables of this country, however, if I tell you that the ladies of the côterie, in which the remarks on the amorous sister were made, once gravely discussed in my presence the question whether Madame de Staël was right or wrong, in causing Corinne to go through certain sentimental experiences, as our canters call it at home, on a clouded day, instead of choosing one on which the sun was bright: or, vice versa; for I really forget whether it was on the [...] "windy side" [...] of <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> not, that the daughter of Necker was supposed to have erred.|$|R
50|$|Supporters of {{alternative}} candidates argue that theirs {{is the more}} plausible author, and that William Shakespeare lacked the education, aristocratic <b>sensibility,</b> <b>or</b> familiarity with the royal court that they say is apparent in the works. Those Shakespeare scholars who have responded to such claims hold that biographical interpretations of literature are unreliable in attributing authorship, and that the convergence of documentary evidence used to support Shakespeare's authorship—title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records—is the same used for all other authorial attributions of his era. No such direct evidence exists for any other candidate, and Shakespeare's authorship was not questioned during his lifetime or for centuries after his death.|$|R

He {{revealed}} that he had initially objected to Hattie Morahan being cast in the role of the eldest Dashwood sister, Elinor. However, he was glad that his objections were ignored, because he fell in love with her performance. Morahan told The Daily Telegraph's Jasper Rees that she deliberately chose not to watch the 1995 film adaptation of Sense and <b>Sensibility</b> <b>or</b> think about Emma Thompson's portrayal of the character.

50|$|Akutagawa's {{stories were}} {{influenced}} by his belief {{that the practice of}} literature should be universal and can bring together western and Japanese cultures. This {{can be seen in the}} way that Akutagawa uses existing works from a variety of cultures and time periods and either rewrites the story with modern <b>sensibilities,</b> <b>or</b> creates new stories using ideas from multiple sources. Culture and the formation of a cultural identity is also a major theme in several of Akutagawa's works. In these stories he explores the formation of cultural identity during periods in history where Japan was most open to outside influences. An example of this is his story Hōkyōnin no Shi ("The Martyr", 1918) which is set in the early missionary period.|$|R
40|$|The {{disasters}} {{with the}} most destructive impact, namely on edified heritage that occurred in Europe during the Modern Era took place in London and Lisbon, with the Great Fire of 1666 and the Great Earthquake of 1755. The different political and cultural circumstances of those capitals and corresponding kingdoms where translated in distinct forms of reconstructing the two cities. Notwithstanding the dissimilar options taken on the urban level, the concerns and precepts of prevention evidenced on the rebuilding of both, {{as well as the}} practices of demolishing, reuse or repair the patrimony that survived the catastrophes where common. In this article, we look at the decisions taken in the panorama of the two rehabilitations, and the various shades of <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> awareness toward heritage demonstrated then...|$|R
