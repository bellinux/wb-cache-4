25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a pentavalent antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>cautiously</b> in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies.

A vampire bat can only survive about two days without a meal of blood, yet they cannot be guaranteed of finding food every night.

This finding suggests that vampire bats are capable of preferentially aiding their relatives, but that they may benefit more from forming reciprocal, cooperative relationships with relatives and non-relatives alike.

These findings contradict the harassment hypothesis—which claims that individuals share food in order to limit harassment by begging individuals.

5000|$|The {{empirical}} {{goal of the}} Follow Through evaluation was {{to determine}} which models were effective in raising student achievement in the three domains as evidenced by positive effects using the selected instruments. Within models, the evaluators compared performance on the various instruments between Follow Through (FT) and non-Follow Through (NFT) comparison groups at each site. Within groups, the evaluators averaged students' scores on each measure (or outcome variable) in order to yield a [...] "group" [...] score. Thus, the group scores of FT students were compared to the group scores of NFT students. An important—and later controversial—statistical adjustment technique was employed by the evaluators in order to [...] "improve {{the integrity of the}} results". Because there were differences between treatment and comparison groups (e.g. the average score on an outcome measure for a NFT group might have been higher than the corresponding average score for a FT group), the evaluators employed a statistical method known as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in order to adjust for these and other differences. The difference between the FT and NFT students was then used to measure the effects of a given model. Sites where models met the criterion for [...] "educational effectiveness" [...] were assigned a value of 1; negative effects were assigned -1; and null effects—"insignificant educationally, statistically, or both"—were assigned a zero. According to Elmore, adjusted results using the ANCOVA technique <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>cautiously</b> for two reasons. First, ANCOVA [...] "is not a substitute for random assignment, but it has become a conventionally accepted technique for handling initial group differences in quasi-experimental data". Second, the larger the initial differences between treatment and control groups, the weaker the strength of the results.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of the aortic dimensions of an investigated mouse on its resulting wall shear stress (WSS) was studied. A numerical model of a mouse aortic arch was created based on a micro-CT scan of a vascular corrosion cast of an 8 -week-old wild type mouse. This model was then rescaled to obtain five models with aortic root diameters corresponding to five different stages in the mouse life cycle varying from late fetal (0. 7 mm) to old adult (1. 5 mm). Consistent with literature, WSS values much higher than those normally encountered in humans were found. WSS was found to decrease rapidly in early life stages and to reach a plateau in adulthood, thus supporting a mediating role for WSS in arterial growth.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the distinguishing ability of intraarticular anesthesia from placebo in orofacial pain patients with pain {{located in the}} temporomandibular joint (TMJ) region, aiming at a validation of intra-articular anesthesia injection as a diagnostic test of pain in the TMJ region. Materials and Methods: A randomized prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted among 19 patients (18 females, I male) with pain in the TMJ region. The short-term effects of intra-articular ultracain and saline injections on pain and maximum mouth opening were measured and analyzed. Results: Compared with placebo injections, {{a statistically significant difference}} in pain scores was found after intraarticular injection of a local anesthetic on Visual Analog Scale values. The maximum mouth opening scores did, however, not differ between the 2 groups. Discussion: TMJ injection with local anesthesia leads to the decrease of pain in patients with preauricular pain. To establish the source of pain, injection of a local anesthetic in the TMJ may be used as a diagnostic tool.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{human genome}} {{comprises}} numerous human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) that formed {{millions of years}} ago in ancestral species. A number of loci of the HERV-K(HML- 2) family are evolutionarily much younger. A recent study suggested an infectious HERV-K(HML- 2) variant in humans and other primates. Isolating such a variant from human individuals would be a significant finding for human biology. Results When investigating expression patterns of specific HML- 2 proviruses we encountered HERV-K(HML- 2) cDNA sequences without proviral homologues in the human genome, named HERV-KX, that could very well support recently suggested infectious HML- 2 variants. However, detailed sequence analysis, using the software RECCO, suggested that HERV-KX sequences were produced by recombination, possibly arising ex vivo, between transcripts from different HML- 2 proviral loci. Conclusion As RT-PCR probably will be instrumental for isolating an infectious HERV-K(HML- 2) variant, generation of "new" HERV-K(HML- 2) sequences by ex vivo recombination seems inevitable. Further complicated by an unknown amount of allelic sequence variation in HERV-K(HML- 2) proviruses, newly identified HERV-K(HML- 2) variants <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> very <b>cautiously.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{citations}} {{to a set}} {{of academic}} articles are typically unevenly shared, with many articles attracting few citations and few attracting many. It is important to know more precisely how citations are distributed in order to help statistical analyses of citations, especially for sets of articles from a single discipline and a small range of years, as normally used for research evaluation. This article fits discrete versions of the power law, the lognormal distribution and the hooked power law to 20 different Scopus categories, using citations to articles published in 2004 and ignoring uncited articles. The results show that, despite its popularity, the power law is not a suitable model for collections of articles from a single subject and year, even for the purpose of estimating the slope of the tail of the citation data. Both the hooked power law and the lognormal distributions fit best for some subjects but neither is a universal optimal choice and parameter estimates for both seem to be unreliable. Hence only the hooked power law and discrete lognormal distributions <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered for subject-and-year-based citation analysis in future and parameter estimates <b>should</b> always <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>cautiously...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} paleobiology to macroevolutionary {{theory has been}} the illumination of deep time patterns of diversification. However, recent work has suggested that taxonomic diversity counts taken from the fossil record may be strongly biased by uneven spatiotemporal sampling. Although morphological diversity (disparity) is also frequently used to examine evolutionary radiations, no empirical work has yet addressed how disparity might be affected by uneven fossil record sampling. Here, we use pterosaurs (Mesozoic flying reptiles) as an exemplar group to address this problem. We calculate multiple disparity metrics based upon a comprehensive anatomical dataset including a novel phylogenetic correction for missing data, statistically compare these metrics to four geological sampling proxies, and use multiple regression modeling to assess the importance of uneven sampling and exceptional fossil deposits (Lagerstätten). We find that range-based disparity metrics are strongly affected by uneven fossil record sampling, and <b>should</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>cautiously.</b> The robustness of variance-based metrics to sample size and geological sampling suggests that they can <b>be</b> more confidently <b>interpreted</b> as reflecting true biological signals.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of literature related to nutritional support reflects its recently recognised role in preventing metabolic complications and gut dysfunction during critical illness. However, some published studies lack relevance to critically ill patients, {{as a result}} of the selection of subjects and outcome variables, or flaws in the study design, as well as in the type, composition, timing, route of administration and amount of nutritional support given. This review will highlight these confounding factors by describing two imaginary (but typical) clinical trials and by analysing some studies published. The point at issue is that basic quality requirements, such as the formulation of a prospective hypothesis and the delineation of the effects of the reference treatment, are often lacking in many studies published. Data analysis was often found to be biased by the absence of statistical power calculation and intention-to-treat analysis. Globally, studies designed to assess the effects of nutritional support on the outcome of critically ill patients, rarely fulfil basic quality requirements and <b>should</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>cautiously.</b> We suggest simple strategies or study design that will allow important questions to be answered by future clinical trials.

The differences between two neighbouring centres in the Antwerp area were surprising. We therefore extended the screening phase of this study to four other areas with different features in this region. Methods Methods and questionnaires of {{the first phase of}} the ECRHS were used to estimate prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms in all areas. Information on some major personal and environmental risk factors was also obtained. Results Higher prevalence rates of both respiratory symptoms and personal risk factors were recorded in Urban Antwerp, Berendrecht-Zandvliet (harbour area) and Zwijndrecht (industrial area) than in Suburban Antwerp, Essen and Kasterlee (both rural).

40|$|Small {{intestinal}} biopsies {{from children}} with treated and untreated coeliac disease have been analysed morphometrically and compared with controls. Two {{methods have been}} used; one, described by Dunnill and Whitehead (1972) provides indices of surface-to-volume ratio and of mucosal volume. The other, described by Meinhard, Wadbrook and Risdon (1965), involves tracing the microscopic image of the biopsy on to computer data cards to produce measured en-coded data for direct analysis with a computer. Biopsies from untreated coeliacs were clearly distinguished from control specimens by both tech-niques. Comparison of these two groups by computer card morphometry shows the mucosal lesion in coeliac disease {{to be associated with}} a spatial re-distribution of the tissue components rather than a change in their absolute amounts. No difference in the total mucosal volume was found so that a true mucosal atrophy does not occur in this condition. Surface-to-volume (c: lh) ratios were measured in twenty-eight children treated empirically with a gluten-free diet for suspected coeliac disease, in biopsies taken before and after a gluten challenge. By this means the diagnosis of coeliac disease was con-firmed in eighteen of these patients. In morphologically normal biopsies correlation of c: lh ratios with age showed significantly smaller values in younger children.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{externally}} validate EPICON, {{a computerized}} system for grouping diagnoses from EMRs in general practice into episodes of care. These episodes {{can be used}} for estimating morbidity rates. DESIGN: Comparative observational study. MEASUREMENTS: Morbidity rates from an independent dataset, based on episode-oriented EMRs, were used as the gold standard. The EMRs in this dataset contained diagnoses which were manually grouped by GPs. The authors ungrouped these diagnoses and regrouped them automatically into episodes using EPICON. The authors then used these episodes to estimate morbidity rates that were compared to the gold standard. The differences between the two sets of morbidity rates were calculated and the authors analyzed large as well as structural differences to establish possible causes. RESULTS: In general, the morbidity rates based on EPICON deviate only slightly from the gold standard. Out of 675 diagnoses, 36 (5 %) were considered to be deviating diagnoses. The deviating diagnoses showed differences for two main reasons: "differences in rules between the two methods of episode construction" and "inadequate performance of EPICON. " CONCLUSION: The EPICON system performs well for the large majority of the morbidity rates. We can therefore conclude that EPICON is useful for grouping episodes to estimate morbidity rates using EMRs from general practices.
