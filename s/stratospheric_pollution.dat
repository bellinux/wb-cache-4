40|$|Important {{chemical}} and physical roles of aerosols are discussed, and properties of stratospheric aerosols as revealed by experimental data are described. In situ measurements obtained by mechanical collection and scattered-light detection yield the overall size {{distribution of the}} aerosols, and analyses of preserved aerosol precursor gases by wet chemical, cryogenic and spectroscopic techniques indicate the photochemical sources of particle mass. Aerosol chemical reactions including those of gaseous precursors, those in aqueous solution, and those on particle surfaces are discussed, in addition to aerosol microphysical processes such as nucleation, condensation/evaporation, coagulation and sedimentation. Models of aerosols incorporating such {{chemical and}} physical processes are presented, and simulations are shown to agree with measurements. Estimates are presented for the potential aerosol changes due to emission of particles and gases by aerospace operations and industrial consumption of fossil fuels, and it is demonstrated that although the climatic effects of existing levels of <b>stratospheric</b> aerosol <b>pollution</b> are negligible, potential increases in those levels might pose a future threat...|$|R

Although the author developed a laser diode lidar system based on RM-CW technique, it has a limit of measurement distance.

40|$|Discrete {{state space}} {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} the development of a model for predicting the reduction in the amount of stratospheric ozone due to <b>stratospheric</b> <b>pollution.</b> The modeling approach is to segment the stratosphere into a number of altitudinal bands and to associate state variables with the state of ozone reduction in each band due to NO(x) injections. The ozone reductions in each band are then combined into an estimate of total global ozone reduction. The model proposed predicts changes in stratospheric ozone based on altitude of pollutant injection and volume of pollutant injected at that altitude. The present approach is not a detailed analysis of stratospheric constituents and their interactions, but rather an analysis procedure for modeling the results of other researchers in the field...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of aerosol light-absorption {{coefficients}} {{are useful}} for studies of radiative transfer and heating rates. Ogren appears to have published the first light- absorption coefficients in the stratosphere in 1981, followed by Clarke in 1983 and Pueschel in 1992. Because most stratospheric soot appears {{to be due to}} aircraft operations, application of an aircraft soot aerosol emission index to projected fuel consumption suggests a threefold increase of soot loading and light absorption by 2025. Together, those four data sets indicate an increase in mid-visible light extinction at a rate of 6 % per year. This trend is similar to the increase per year of sulfuric acid aerosol and of commercial fleet size. The proportionality between stepped-up aircraft operations above the tropopause and increases in stratospheric soot and sulfuric acid aerosol implicate aircraft as a source of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>pollution.</b> Because the strongly light-absorbing soot and the predominantly light-scattering sulfuric acid aerosol increase at similar rates, however, the mid-visible stratospheric aerosol single scatter albedo is expected to remain constant and not approach a critical value of 0. 98 at which stratospheric cooling could change to warming...|$|E

Diffuse and localized (urban) concentrations of CO as pollutant are studied, and anthropogenic sources and sinks for CH 4 and CO are considered. Perturbation of the CH 4 -CO-CO 2 cycle, crucial to self-cleansing mechanisms of the troposphere, by anthropogenic CO emissions, and the effect of CO long life as global pollutant, are investigated...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{directly}} retrieved global distribution of tropospheric column ozone from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) ultraviolet measurements during December 1996 to November 1997. The retrievals clearly show signals due to convection, biomass burning, <b>stratospheric</b> influence, <b>pollution,</b> and transport. They {{are capable of}} capturing the spatiotemporal evolution of tropospheric column ozone in response to regional or short time-scale {{events such as the}} 1997 - 1998 El Nino event and a 10 - 20 DU change within a few days. The global distribution of tropospheric column ozone displays the well-known wave- 1 pattern in the tropics, nearly zonal bands of enhanced tropospheric column ozone of 36 - 48 DU at 20 degS- 30 degS during the austral spring and at 25 degN- 45 degN during the boreal spring and summer, low tropospheric column ozone of 33 DU at some northern high-latitudes during the spring. Simulation from a chemical transport model corroborates most of the above structures, with small biases of <+/- 5 DU and consistent seasonal cycles in most regions, especially in the southern hemisphere. However, significant positive biases of 5 - 20 DU occur in some northern tropical and subtropical regions such as the Middle East during summer. Comparison of GOME with monthly-averaged Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapor by Airbus in-service Aircraft (MOZAIC) tropospheric column ozone for these regions usually shows good consistency within 1 a standard deviations and retrieval uncertainties. Some biases can be accounted for by inadequate sensitivity to lower tropospheric ozone, the different spatiotemporal sampling and the spatiotemporal variations in tropospheric column ozone...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{data from}} flight 8 of NASA's Subsonic Assessment (SASS) Ozone and Nitrogen Oxide Experiment (SONEX) {{exhibited}} signatures consistent with aircraft emissions, stratospheric air, and surface-based pollution. These signatures are examined in detail, focussing {{on the broad}} aircraft emission signatures that are several hundred kilometers in length. A mesoscale meteorological model provides high resolution wind data {{that are used to}} calculate backward trajectories arriving at locations along the flight track. These trajectories are compared to aircraft locations in the North Atlantic Flight Corridor over a 27 - 33 hour period. Time series of flight level NO and the number of trajectory/aircraft encounters within the NAFC show excellent agreement. Trajectories arriving within the <b>stratospheric</b> and surface-based <b>pollution</b> regions are found to experience very few aircraft encounters. Conversely, there are many trajectory/aircraft encounters within the two chemical signatures corresponding to aircraft emissions. Even many detailed fluctuations of NO within the two aircraft signature regions correspond to similar fluctuations in aircraft encountered during the previous 27 - 33 hours. Results indicate that high resolution meteorological modeling, when coupled with detailed aircraft location data, is useful for understanding chemical signatures from aircraft emissions at scales of several hundred kilometers...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} part of a {{research}} program of the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT) entitled ''Pollutants in Aviation'' where it falls under the subproject ''Atmospheric Research'', ''Determination of Exhaust Emissions''. Information concerning the percentage of total emissions in the stratosphere was obtained by analyzing computer flight plans, prepared by a central computer before each flight. In the process, special attention was to be paid to any influences of the seasons, different flight routes and aircraft types. After evaluation of the flight plans provided by various airlines, different influences of the season, flight route and aircraft type were found. The geographical location of the flight route has the highest impact on pollutant immission into the stratosphere. The farther north a flight route runs, the higher is the percentage of emissions. In addition to this, one can establish that beyond a certain geographical latitude the stratosphere is penetrated by no pollutants at all. Another import factor that influences fuel consumption above the tropopause is the seasonal variation of the boundary layer between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Using the results obtained under the present study and taking into account the air traffic data of international organizations such as ICAO and Eurocontrol the global load of the stratosphere is projected at another point within the joint program. In an international cooperation, an attempt should be made to cover more flight regions, such the American and Russian domestic air spaces, with <b>stratospheric</b> <b>pollution</b> data. (orig.)

40|$|Any {{attempt to}} {{reconcile}} observed surface temperature changes {{within the last}} 150 years to changes simulated by climate models that include various atmospheric forcings is sensitive to the changes attributed to aerosols and aerosol-cloud-climate interactions, which are the main contributors that may well balance the positive forcings associated with greenhouse gases, absorbing aerosols, ozone related changes, etc. These aerosol effects on climate, from various modeling studies discussed in Menon (2004), range from + 0. 8 to - 2. 4 W m{sup - 2 }, with an implied value of - 1. 0 W m{sup - 2 } (range from - 0. 5 to - 4. 5 W m{sup - 2 }) for the aerosol indirect effects. Quantifying the contribution of aerosols and aerosol-cloud interactions remain complicated for several reasons {{some of which are}} related to aerosol distributions and some to the processes used to represent their effects on clouds. Aerosol effects on low lying marine stratocumulus clouds that cover much of the Earth's surface (about 70 %) have been the focus of most of prior aerosol-cloud interaction effect simulations. Since cumulus clouds (shallow and deep convective) are short lived and cover about 15 to 20 % of the Earth's surface, they are not usually considered as radiatively important. However, the large amount of latent heat released from convective towers, and corresponding changes in precipitation, especially in biomass regions due to convective heating effects (Graf et al. 2004), suggest that these cloud systems and aerosol effects on them, must be examined more closely. The radiative heating effects for mature deep convective systems can account for 10 - 30 % of maximum latent heating effects and thus cannot be ignored (Jensen and Del Genio 2003). The first study that isolated the sensitivity of cumulus clouds to aerosols was from Nober et al. (2003) who found a reduction in precipitation in biomass burning regions and shifts in circulation patterns. Aerosol effects on convection have been included in other models as well (cf. Jacobson, 2002) but the relative impacts on convective and stratiform processes were not separated. Other changes to atmospheric stability and thermodynamical quantities due to aerosol absorption are also known to be important in modifying cloud macro/micro properties. Linkages between convection and boreal biomass burning can also impact the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, radiation and cloud microphysical properties via transport of tropospheric aerosols to the lower stratosphere during extreme convection (Fromm and Servranckx 2003). Relevant questions regarding the impact of biomass aerosols on convective cloud properties include the effects of vertical transport of aerosols, spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, vertical shift in latent heat release, phase shift of precipitation, circulation and their impacts on radiation. Over land surfaces, a decrease in surface shortwave radiation ({approx} 3 - 6 W m{sup - 2 } per decade) has been observed between 1960 to 1990, whereas, increases of 0. 4 K in land temperature during the same period that occurred have resulted in speculations that evaporation and precipitation should also have decreased (Wild et al. 2004). However, precipitation records for the same period over land do not indicate any significant trend (Beck et al. 2005). The changes in precipitation are thought to be related to increased moisture advection from the oceans (Wild et al. 2004), which may well have some contributions from aerosol-radiation-convection coupling that could modify circulation patterns and hence moisture advection in specific regions. Other important aspects of aerosol effects, besides the direct, semi-direct, microphysical and thermodynamical impacts include alteration of surface albedos, especially snow and ice covered surfaces, due to absorbing aerosols. These effects are uncertain (Jacobson, 2004) but may produce as much as 0. 3 W m{sup - 2 } forcing in the Northern hemisphere that could contribute to melting of ice and permafrost and change in the length of the season (e. g. early arrival of Spring) (Hansen and Nazarenko, 2004). Besides the impacts of aerosols on the surface albedos in the polar regions, and the thermodynamical impacts of Arctic haze (composed of water soluble sulfates, nitrates, organic and black carbon (BC)), the dynamical response to Arctic haze (through the radiation-circulation feedbacks that cause changes in pressure patterns) is thought to have the potential to modify the mode and strength of large-scale teleconnection patterns such as the Barrents Sea Oscillation that could affect other climate regimes (mainly Europe) (Rinke et al. 2004). Additionally, via the Asian monsoon, wind patterns over the eastern Mediterranean and lower <b>stratospheric</b> <b>pollution</b> at higher latitudes (Lelieveld et al. 2002) are thought to be linked to the pollutants found in Asia, indicating the distant climate impacts of aerosols...|$|E
40|$|Because {{environmental}} problems do not respect borders, their solutions often require international cooperation and agreements. The contributors to this book examine how international environmental commitments {{are put into}} practice. Their main concern is effectiveness- {{the degree to which}} such agreements lead to changes in behavior that help to solve {{environmental problems}}. Their focus is on implementation- the process that turns commitments into action- at both domestic and international levels. Implementation is the key to effectiveness because these agreements aim to constrain not just governments but a wide array of actors, including individuals, firms, and agencies whose behavior does not change simply because governments have made international commitments. The book is divided into two parts. Part I looks at international systems for implementation review, through which parties share information, review performance, handle noncompliance, and adjust commitments. Part II looks at implementation at the national level, with particular attention to participation by governmental and nongovernmental actors and to problems in states with economies in transition. The book includes fourteen case studies that cover eight major areas of international environmental regulation: conservation and preservation of fauna and flora, <b>stratospheric</b> ozone depletion, <b>pollution</b> in the Baltic Sea, pollution in the North Sea, trade in hazardous chemicals and pesticides, air pollution in Europe, whaling, and marine dumping of nuclear waste...|$|R
40|$|We use {{satellite}} observations from IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) {{on board the}} MetOp-A satellite to evaluate the springtime daily variations in lower-tropospheric ozone over east Asia. The availability of semi-independent columns of ozone from the surface up to 12 km simultaneously with CO columns provides a powerful observational data set to diagnose the processes controlling tropospheric ozone enhancement on synoptic scales. By combining IASI observations with meteorological reanalyses from ERA-Interim, we develop an analysis method based only on IASI ozone and CO observations to identify the respective roles of the stratospheric source and the photochemical source in ozone distribution and variations over east Asia. The succession of low- and high-pressure systems drives the day-to-day variations in lower-tropospheric ozone. A case study analysis of one frontal system and one cut-off low system in May 2008 shows that reversible subsiding and ascending ozone transfers in the upper-troposphere–lower-stratosphere (UTLS) region, due to the tropopause perturbations occurring {{in the vicinity of}} low-pressure systems, impact free and lower-tropospheric ozone over large regions, especially north of 40 ° N, and largely explain the ozone enhancement observed with IASI for these latitudes. Irreversible stratosphere–troposphere exchanges of ozone-rich air masses occur more locally in the southern and southeastern flanks of the trough. The contribution to the lower-tropospheric ozone column is difficult to dissociate from the tropopause perturbations generated by weather systems. For regions south of 40 ° N, a significant correlation has been found between lower-tropospheric ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) observations from IASI, especially over the North China Plain (NCP). Considering carbon monoxide observations as a pollutant tracer, the O 3 –CO correlation indicates that the photochemical production of ozone from primary pollutants emitted over such large polluted regions significantly contributes to the ozone enhancements observed in the lower troposphere via IASI. When low-pressure systems circulate over the NCP, <b>stratospheric</b> and <b>pollution</b> sources play a concomitant role in the ozone enhancement. IASI's 3 -D observational capability allows the areas in which each source dominates to be determined. Moreover, the studied cut-off low system has enough potential convective capacity to uplift pollutants (ozone and CO) and to transport them to Japan. The increase in the enhancement ratio of ozone to CO from 0. 16 on 12 May over the North China Plain to 0. 28 over the Sea of Japan on 14 May indicates photochemical processing during the plume transport...|$|R
40|$|By {{incorporating}} the probability distribution {{directly into the}} analysis, this paper proposes a new theoretical approach to resolving the perennial dilemma of being uncertain about what discount rate to use in cost-benefit analysis. A numerical example is constructed {{from the results of}} a survey based on the opinions of 2, 160 economists. The main finding is that even if every individual believes in a constant discount rate, the wide spread of opinion on what it should be makes the effective social discount rate decline significantly over time. Implications and ramifications of this proposed "gamma-discounting " approach are discussed. (JEL H 43) The concept of a "discount rate " is central to economic analysis, as it allows effects occurring at different future times to be compared by converting each future dollar amount into equivalent present dollars. Because of this centrality, the choice of an appropriate discount rate {{is one of the most}} critical problems in all of economics. And yet, to be perfectly honest, a great deal of uncertainty beclouds this very issue. The problem of the unsure discount rate has long bedeviled benefit-cost analysis but has acquired renewed relevance lately because economists are now being asked to analyze environmental projects or activities the effects of which will be spread out over hundreds of years, and the evaluation of which is therefore extremely sensitive to the discount rate being used. Prominent examples include: global climate change, radioactive waste disposal, loss of biodiversity, thinning of <b>stratospheric</b> ozone, groundwater <b>pollution,</b> minerals depletion, and many others. I The most critical single problem with discounting future benefits and costs is that no consensus now exists, or for that matter has ever existed, about what actual rate of interest to use...|$|R
