40|$|Religion {{and social}} {{stratification}} {{has been an}} important sociological topic since Max Weber and Karl Marx. It continues to attract scholarly attention nowadays in the United States, giving rise to numerous empirical studies on their complex relationships. However, there is no or inadequate studies on the relations between religion and social stratification in societies that have very different cultural backgrounds compared to the U. S. This research note attempts to expand this sociological topic to non-Christian societies using Taiwan as a case study, where Christianity is not the dominant culture. It first offers a literature review of religion and social stratification in Taiwan, followed by a quantitative study based on a national survey, Taiwan Social Change Survey. Analysis is based on the data from the 2000, 2005, and 2010 dataset. This research note focuses on three important social stratification indicators, namely education level, occupation, and income, and their effects on religious affiliation. Changes in such relations over ten years are also studied. Our analysis has at least five significant findings: (1) respondents belonging to “Protestantism” and “No Religion” tend to be in the upper class. (2) Except for “Protestantism” and “No Religion,” religious affiliation is affected by different social stratification indicators and such effect is particular strong for “Buddhism,” “Taoism,” and “Folk religion. ” While (3) “Catholics” have declining score in occupation and income level, (4) “Buddhists” are achieving higher <b>status</b> <b>in</b> <b>occupation.</b> (5) Education, occupation, and income level are increasing for “Yiguan Dao” practitioners...|$|E

Kanter (1977) suggests that the proportional composition of different social groups shapes interactional dynamics between the ‘dominants’ (numerical majority group) and the ‘tokens’ (numerical minority group). According to this conceptual framework, ‘tokens’ experience high visibility (i.e., {{they are aware of}} their underrepresentation), exaggeration of their differences compared to the dominant group (polarization), and assimilation pressure “to fit preexisting generalizations about their social type” (ibid., p. 965).|$|R

The significant findings are : Koro affected mostly young males below 30 years belonging to Hindu Assamese community, coming from middle class families, suffering preponderantly from genital symptoms. Koro attacks mostly occurred during the night when the patients are indoor. Exposure to hearsay and/or witnessing a koro case is an important predeterminant of the episode of illness.

By observing both leaders and followers during the war and forty years after it, I establish that the most able became wartime leaders, that leading by example from the front was an effective strategy in reducing desertion rates, and that leaders later migrated to the larger cities because this is where their superior skills would have had the highest pay-offs.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} occupational prestige/status {{with the purpose of}} describing and interpreting perceptions of occupational prestige. The analytical focus is the relationship between occupational prestige and gender. Three methods have been used in the study: a survey, focus group interviews and an analysis of public descriptions of occupations. The survey was conducted in 2002 and questionnaires were distributed to 3032 respondents. The response rate was 61 percent. Four focus group interviews were conducted where participants were asked to rank order 20 occupations. The Swedish national labour market board’s (AMS) occupational descriptions were analysed to find out to what extent these reproduced stereotyped images concerning gender and class. The ranking order of occupations is similar to those found in earlier studies. Occupational prestige may be perceived as a stable phenomenon in society. There is a strong agreement on the status of different occupations between different subgroups in society. The ranking orders constructed by the focus groups were also equivalent to the survey ranking order. Levels of income, educational requirements, levels of influence and a positive reputation have a positive influence on occupational prestige. The share of women within an occupation has a negative effect on occupational prestige but only <b>in</b> <b>occupations</b> found {{on the top of the}} occupational ranking order. Educational requirements were stronger criteria for occupational <b>status</b> <b>in</b> some <b>occupations,</b> while income was stronger in others. It also seems as if different factors have varying significance for occupational prestige, depending on the <b>occupation</b> being discussed. <b>In</b> addition, several of these criteria of prestige have also in other studies been associated with masculinity. The public descriptions of occupations that were analysed did not reproduce images of gender. However, class seems to be a factor affecting the occupational descriptions, since prestigious occupations are described with a more advanced language and with a frequent use of titles...|$|R

We use 12 waves of the Dutch Labor Force Survey (1994 – 2006), and use log-linear models to analyze the associations between the labor market positions of spouses. Overall, we find positive associations, implying that favorable positions are accumulated within households. For couples with children, {{the association between}} spouses’ employment status is negative, which means that they divide paid labor. Over birth cohorts, the association between spouses’ employment statuses becomes stronger, and between spouses’ occupational success remains stable. Education is an important contributor to the occupational association, but still half of the association between spouses’ success cannot be attributed to spouses’ education...|$|R

50|$|Social {{mobility}} {{is highly}} dependent on the overall structure of social <b>statuses</b> and <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> a given society. The extent of differing social positions {{and the manner in}} which they fit together or overlap provides the overall social structure of such positions. Add to this the differing dimensions of status, such as Max Weber's delineation of economic stature, prestige, and power and we see the potential for complexity in a given social stratification system. Such dimensions within a given society can be seen as independent variables that can explain differences in social mobility at different times and places in different stratification systems. In addition, the same variables that contribute as intervening variables to the valuation of income or wealth and that also affect social status, social class, and social inequality do affect social mobility. These include sex or gender, race or ethnicity, and age.|$|R

30|$|The missing {{significant}} effect in female-dominated and integrated occupations on depressive symptoms in men {{goes along with}} Kanter’s theory (1993) which implies that male minorities <b>in</b> female-dominated <b>occupations</b> report reduced negative effects. One reason is that men are mainly evaluated based on their experience and skills. This outcome indicates that gender proportions alone are not fully responsible for the negative health effects of being a minority. Thus, working <b>in</b> <b>occupations</b> dominated by the opposite gender explains only a certain proportion of gender differences in health. Moreover, working in female-dominated and integrated professions {{may lead to a}} positive outcome in terms of a higher perceived job control in male employees (Hochwarter et al. 1995).

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{increase}} our knowledge of engagement <b>in</b> <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) {{in order to develop}} client-centred occupational therapy and rehabilitation. In study I, observations of the performance of self-care and household <b>occupations</b> were pursued <b>in</b> 44 participants, and study II identified self-perceived problems <b>in</b> performance of <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> 47 participants. In studies III and IV, in-depth interviews with ten participants revealed experiences related to engagement <b>in</b> <b>occupations</b> and to the process of adaptation of engagement <b>in</b> <b>occupations.</b> The results showed that persons with MS can perceive problems related to all areas of occupations, and at different hierarchical levels. They can be dissatisfied with performance <b>in</b> <b>occupations,</b> especially related to self-care and household occupations and observational assessments confirm that performance <b>in</b> these <b>occupations</b> is impacted on. Furthermore, they can be independent in self-care but dependent <b>in</b> household <b>occupations,</b> and can have problems in their performance regardless of their age, disease severity, or their living arrangements. They can experience that they need to struggle continuously to manage occupations, and that this changes them as a person and make them live their lives differently than they had anticipated. In addition, they experience their adaptation of engagement <b>in</b> <b>occupations</b> as an ongoing, non-linear process, involving both themselves and their family, and they consider who would benefit the most, before they choose their adaptation of engagement <b>in</b> <b>occupations.</b> <b>In</b> summary, this thesis has shown that engagement <b>in</b> <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> persons with MS is a complex phenomenon. All areas of occupations can be affected, and need to be addressed within occupational therapy and rehabilitation. Clients’ own experiences needs to be elucidated in order to facilitate the reconstruction of self, identity and support the process of adaptation of occupations...|$|R

Additionally, as described above, gender differences in psychosocial exposure at the worksite and perceived work-family conflict might contribute to the explanation of depressive symptoms. Therefore, we adjust the relationship between occupational gender segregation and depressive symptoms for work stress and work-family conflict. In order to shed more light on possible associations between working <b>in</b> gender-dominated <b>occupations</b> and depressive symptoms, we also investigate the role of interactions between working <b>in</b> <b>occupations</b> dominated by the opposite gender and work stress as well as work-family conflict in association with depressive symptoms.|$|R

The total number of Mexico City residents counted in 1793 was 104,760 (which excludes 8,166 officials) and in the intendancy as a whole 1,043,223, excluding 2,299 officials. In both the capital and the intendancy, the European population was the smallest percentage, with 2,335 in the capital (2.2%) and the intendancy 1,330 (.1%). The listing for Spaniard (español) was 50,371 (48.1%), with the intendancy showing 134,695 (12.9%). For mestizos (in which he has merged the castizos), in the capital there were 19,357 (18.5%) and in the intendancy 112,113 (10.7%). For the mulatto category, the capital listed 7,094 (6.8%) with the intendancy showing 52,629 (5.0%). There is apparently no separate category for blacks (Negros). The category Indian showed 25,603 (24.4%), with the intendancy with 742,186 (71.1). The capital thus had the largest concentration of Spaniards and castas, with the countryside being overwhelmingly Indian. The population of the capital “indicates that conditions favoring mestizaje were more favorable in the city than the outlying area” and that there were more high <b>status</b> <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> the city.|$|R

We assessed work <b>status</b> <b>in</b> a population-based study of long-term outcomes of CABG. Aim: To determine the association between returning to work after CABG and clinical and socio-demographic factors. Methods: A postal survey of 2500 randomly selected patients 6 – 20 years post-CABG. The outcomes assessed were work <b>status</b> <b>in</b> the year before and after CABG and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measured with SF- 36. Results: Response was 82 % (n = 2061). Employment fell from 56 % in the year prior to CABG to 42 % in the year after. Workers <b>in</b> ‘blue-collar’ <b>occupations</b> were more likely to reduce their work <b>status</b> than those <b>in</b> ‘white collar’ <b>occupations</b> (46 % versus 29 %, p < 0. 001). Independent predictors of reducing employment were increasing age (9 % per year, 99 % CI: 1. 06 – 1. 11, p < 0. 001), ‘blue-collar’ versus ‘white collar’ occupation (OR: 2. 1, 99 % CI: 1. 4 – 3. 1) and female sex (OR: 2. 1, 99 % CI: 1. 1 – 3. 6). HRQOL among participants under 60 years of age at follow-up was better for those who returned to work after CABG surgery.
