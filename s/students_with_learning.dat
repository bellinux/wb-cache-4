As of 2015, the student body {{is made up of}} 815 pupils aged 11–18. The school admits boys on a selective basis for years 7–11 and has a co-educational Sixth Form; there are 60 girls on roll as of 2015. The majority of pupils come from White British backgrounds and very few pupils speak English as an additional language. The number of pupils supported through allowances, including those eligible for free school meals (2.3%), is below average, as is the number of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> disabilities. Pupils are allocated into houses based on their forms. The first house system at Carre's consisted of four sets: scarlet, maroon, green and blue. They became houses in 1933 as Carre, Bristol, Lafford and Welby, named respectively after its founder, the Earls of Bristol, an old name for Sleaford, and Richard Welby, who owned the Gedney lands purchased by Carre.|$|E
