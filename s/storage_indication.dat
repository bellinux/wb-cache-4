This additional application can only be applied in systems which are regularly under a full-charged condition. For this problem we have worked {{for a long time to}} develop a calculator of state of charge (SOC) with a totally new equipment. At the moment, calculators of state of charge in charging applications are available, but they are more expensive than the regulation technology to charge batteries. This is the reason why calculators of SOC are only used in those few big applications not in large amounts. A cost-effective SOC calculator is an important accomplishment for solar stand alone systems. (orig.)

40|$|Current {{strategies}} for early missions to Mars are {{highly dependent on}} the assumption of nuclear power as the primary near-term energy supply. Since political considerations may prohibit the launch of nuclear systems, this paper investigates the potential for utilizing in situ energy sources on Mars to either supplement or replace nuclear power. The current knowledge of solar, wind, and areothermal energy resources on Mars is discussed, and the studies required to identify these resources and further characterize their distribution and abundance is given. A non-nuclear power system for the first Mars mission could {{be based on a}} combination of solar and wind energy coupled with a liquid fuel <b>storage</b> system. <b>Indications</b> are that such a system, using the latest solar cell technology, could be cost competitive with nuclear power in terms of kiloWatts per kilogram delivered to the Martian surface. Areothermal energy has significant potential, but the development of this resource will require longer term space and surface based exploration. The work reported herein advances the current knowledge base with the following accomplishments: (1) collecting models to jointly estimate solar and wind power production; (2) utilizing terrestrial geothermal exploration techniques coupled to remote sensing data from Mars to refine potential regions of exploitable planetary heat sources; and (3) suggesting that an early Mars mission that relies heavily on in-situ energy sources will require additional precursor information on energy resource location, extent, and accessibility. It is proposed that the production of energy on Mars, solely from local resources, may be practical enough to render a small outpost completely self-sufficient. Moreover, the addition of in-situ energy resource development to that for life support and transportation may advance the development of larger permanent self-sufficient human colonies on Mars...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims The most {{plausible}} explanation for treeline formation {{so far is}} provided by the growth limitation hypothesis (GLH), which proposes that carbon sinks are more restricted by low temperatures than by carbon sources. Evidence supporting the GLH has been strong in evergreen, but less and weaker in deciduous treeline species. Here a test is made of the GLH in deciduous-evergreen mixed species forests across elevational gradients, with the hypothesis that deciduous treeline species show a different carbon storage trend from that shown by evergreen species across elevations. Methods Tree growth and concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in foliage, branch sapwood and stem sapwood tissues were measured at four elevations in six deciduous-evergreen treeline ecotones (including treeline) in the southern Andes of Chile (40 °S, Nothofagus pumilio and Nothofagus betuloides; 46 °S, Nothofagus pumilio and Pinus sylvestris) and in the Swiss Alps (46 °N, Larix decidua and Pinus cembra). Key Results Tree growth (basal area increment) decreased with elevation for all species. Regardless of foliar habit, NSCs did not deplete across elevations, indicating no shortage of carbon storage in any of the investigated tissues. Rather, NSCs increased significantly with elevation in leaves (P < 0 · 001) and branch sapwood (P = 0 · 012) tissues. Deciduous species showed significantly higher NSCs than evergreens for all tissues; on average, the former had 11 % (leaves), 158 % (branch) and 103 % (sapwood) significantly (P < 0 · 001) higher NSCs than the latter. Finally, deciduous species had higher NSC (particularly starch) increases with elevation than evergreens for stem sapwood, but the opposite was true for leaves and branch sapwood. Conclusions Considering the observed decrease in tree growth and increase in NSCs with elevation, it is concluded that both deciduous and evergreen treeline species are sink limited when faced with decreasing temperatures. Despite the overall higher requirements of deciduous tree species for carbon <b>storage,</b> no <b>indication</b> was found of carbon limitation in deciduous species in the alpine treeline ecoton...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the efficacy of neem oil and common salt as curing agent to control biodegradation of green hides. A total number of nine intact hides were obtained from slaughtered cattle of 4 and 4 1 / 2 years of age. Three types of curing treatments were employed using various concentrations of neem oil and common salts. T 1 provides 40 % neem oil and 10 % common salt, T 2 includes 10 % neem oil and 20 % common salt and T 3 contains 10 % neem oil and 10 % common salt. The hides of each treatment were kept at 10, 20 and 30 days storage periods. After every 10 days of storage hides were subjected to bacteriological examinations. Storage properties of hides were also determined by the evidence of spot, color changes and sliminess of the skin. The mean value of total bacterial count was recorded lowest 6. 96 � 0. 30 in T 2. Total coliform counts were found almost nil in T 2. None of the treatment was found effective to control the growth of staphylococci. No signs of bacterial spoilage in hides were evident in T 1 upto 10 days of <b>storage.</b> However <b>indication</b> of some sliminess could be noticed in the regions of neck and butt after storage of 20 and 30 days. T 2 exhibited more or less changes in color on the 10 th day of storage and sliminess was noticed fairly distributed on the neck and belly regions on the 30 th day of storage. T 3 exhibited some noticeable changes in the butt region. Putrefactive action started and there was indication of tissue changes, which could be marked, from the 10 th day of storage. At the butt region foul odor was perceptible and few hair slip was evidenced on the 30 th day of storage. It is concluded that the treatment using combination of neem oil and common salt showed antibacterial activity against the growing contaminating putrefactive organisms but less effective against halophiles...|$|R
40|$|In batch {{experiments}} with {{two types of}} soils, chernozem and podzol, radioiodine (125 I) showed an initial rapid sorption, followed by a long and slow further increase. Very little sorption (Rd < 1) was detected in clay minerals. Generally, higher. Revalues were observed for the chernozem soil, characterized by a higher amount of organic substance and of soil biomass. The sorption process was predominantly irreversible, the isotherms were linear at low ion concentrations and deviated from linearity starting at 10 - 5 mmol - ml- 1. Sorption ratio was found to increase with increasing volume to mass ratio. The composition of liquid phases (bidistilled water, synthetic soil water, rain water) highly affected iodine sorption. In {{experiments with}} KBr solution, the sorption of I “ {{was found to be}} strongly preferred to Br”. Incubation of soil samples under varied conditions (decreased or increased soil biomass, 02 -concentration, incubation temperature, soil water content and <b>storage</b> conditions) delivered <b>indications</b> for the participation of soil microflora in iodine immobilization. Test with isolated soil bacteria and fungi showed that radioiodine can be incorporated by soil microorganisms under certain conditions only: Considerable uptake of radioiodine was found in washed (NaCl, CaCl 2) cells with both bacteria and fungi, but no incorporation was detected into cells incubated with radioiodine in the culture medium. © 1991, Walter de Gruyter.

40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric) (Horticulture)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Bitter pit {{fruit in}} {{commercial}} consignments of apples still poses an economic threat to exporters from South Africa. Bitter pit develops pre-harvest, but gets progressively worse during storage {{and is only}} traceable once the lesions appear after <b>storage.</b> Accurate, early <b>indications</b> of bitter pit incidence will allow for remedial pre-harvest measures in the field, e. g. Ca foliar applications, to reduce the potential losses. Similarly, the automatic detection of a bitter pit fruit during packing will reduce financial losses by identifying unacceptable fruit before shipping. Fluorescence imaging is a fast, non-destructive technique, able to evaluate numerous fruits individually. Results of pre-harvest imaging on apples to identify fruit susceptible to bitter pit showed that pitted fruit were correctly classified, but misclassification of non-pitted fruit with fluorescence imaging was still too high. NIR-spectroscopy point meter readings could distinguish visible bitter pit lesions from healthy tissue. Important wavelengths associated with visible bitter pit were identified. This technique could also identify immature apples, more prone to bitter pit development. It could however not distinguish between bitter pit and non-pitted fruit when applied randomly on the calyx end of apples at harvest. Pre-harvest foliar applications to increase fruit Ca content and reduce bitter pit incidence, is a standard practice world wide. External Ca uptake by fruit was monitored to determine the efficacy of applications during different stages of fruit development. Two periods of efficient uptake of external Ca were identified, viz., cell division and {{the last few weeks}} before harvest. Foliar Ca applications from 40 days after full bloom were more effective in increasing fruit Ca content and reducing bitter pit incidence than at 80 days after full bloom, which was recommended previously. Mineral analysis of fruit has been used with variable success to predict bitter pit prior to harvest. The possibility of increasing the accuracy of existing predictive models by using analysis of individual fruit rather than pooled samples, was investigated. By improving the normality of different mineral distributions and decreasing the overlap between pitted and non-pitted fruit classes, it was attempted to improve the reliability of predictions based on variable threshold values. The Ca distribution showed a variation between pitted and nonpitted classes, but still a significant overlap between classes reduced the accuracy of the predictive capacity of this distribution. Even though our results produced a correct classification of 85 % for non-pitted fruit, which can be useful, this was still below the required tolerance, of less that 2 %, expected on the market. The effect of pruning and fruit bearing position on two-year-old wood on dry mass and Ca allocation of fruit was determined. ‘Golden Delicious’ fruit set was the lowest at the basal bearing position compared to the other positions evaluated and was contrary to expectations. Fruit in a terminal bearing position was superior to the basal position regarding total dry weight and fruit size. Distal wood possibly inhibited growth and set on the basal position via auxin distribution. Ca allocation differed between seasons and cultivars and could either be influenced by bearing position or presence or absence of re-growth...|$|R
