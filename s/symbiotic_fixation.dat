40|$|Abstract To {{assess the}} {{symbiotic}} dependency of grain and shrub/tree legumes within five agro-ecological zones of Botswana, fully expanded {{leaves of the}} test species were sampled from about 26 study sites within Ngwaketse, Gaborone, Central, Ghanzi and Kalahari agro-ecological zones. Isotopic analysis revealed significant differences in 1) 15 N values of the grain legumes [cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp), Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea L. Verde.), and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) ] from the 26 farming areas in both 2005 and 2006. Estimates of %Ndfa of leaves also showed significant differences between farming areas, with cowpea deriving more than 50 % of its N nutrition from <b>symbiotic</b> <b>fixation.</b> In terms of distribution, many more symbiotic shrub/tree species {{were found in the}} wetter Ngwaketse agro-zone compared to the fewer numbers in the drier Kalahari region. Acacias were the more dominant species at all sites. Leaf 1) 15 N values of shrub/tree species also varied strongly across Botswana, with 11 out of 18 of these legumes deriving about 50 %, or more, of their N from symbiotic Nz fixation. Acacia caffra, in particular, obtained as much as 93. 6 % of its N nutrition from <b>symbiotic</b> <b>fixation</b> in the wetter Ngwaketse agro-zone. This study has shown that grain legumes sampled from farmer's fields in Botswana obtained considerable amounts of their N from <b>symbiotic</b> <b>fixation.</b> We have also shown that shrub and tree legumes probably {{play an important role in}} the N economy of the savanna ecosystems in Botswana. However, the decline in the number of functional Ny-fixing shrub/tree legumes along an aridity gradient suggests that soil moisture is a major constraint to Nz fixation in the tree legumes of Botswana...|$|E
40|$|The use of legumes {{as green}} manure can {{potentially}} increase crop productivity in saline environments and thus {{contribute to the}} sustainability of agricultural systems. Here, we present results from a field experiment conducted in the Netherlands that addressed the efficiency of nitrogen (N) fixation by a legume at varying salinities. We grew Melilotus officinalis in an agricultural field using drip irrigation with water salinity varying in electrical conductivity between 1. 7 and 20 dS m- 1. In the experiment, nearly 100 % of total plant N in M. officinalis was derived from <b>symbiotic</b> <b>fixation</b> at all but the highest salinity level (20 dS m- 1). Our results indicated that this species derived substantial amounts of N via <b>symbiotic</b> <b>fixation,</b> the N becoming available in the soil (and thus available to crops) when cultivated legumes senesce and decompose.

40|$|Isotopic {{methods for}} the {{measurement}} of symbiotic N 2 fixation by leguminous plants in the field rely {{on the use of}} differences in 15 N enrichment between the N sources potentially available for leguminous crops, soil mineral N and atmospheric N 2. This methodology has been fully documented, especially concerning limitations due to non uniform and non constant distribution of 15 N and to the use of a reference plant to measure it. Although all authors recognise the necessity of isotopic methods for giving yield independent and time-integrated estimates of <b>symbiotic</b> <b>fixation,</b> they also agree that these methods intrinsically remain imperfect. Our aim in this chapter is (i) to briefly review the three major isotopic methods and recall the main assumptions they involve, (ii) to evaluate the theoretical precision of those methods by performing sensitivity analysis to all their parameters, in the perspective of precisely delimiting their validity domain and (iii) to quantify the error made when using the method with the largest spectrum of application and to propose solutions to minimise it. The natural abundance method (NA) is the simplest method as no added fertiliser is required. The method isotopic dilution (ID) requires 15 N-labelled fertiliser application to increase 15 N soil enrichment. The multi-enrichment technique (MET) relies on the use of several treatments receiving the same amount of fertiliser but labelled at variable 15 N enrichments. Using an original mathematical analysis, we show that the precision of NA and MET is likely to be low if the difference in 15 N abundance between the soil and atmosphere is low (lower than 8 ‰). Otherwise, the use of NA or MET requires a very precise determination of the isotopic fractionation rate due to <b>symbiotic</b> <b>fixation</b> (εFix). The ID method circumvents this problem. It has the largest validity domain as it can be used in soils slightly enriched in 15 Nand does not require such precise determination of εFix.. However, the main assumption of the ID method is that the relative uptake of soil and fertiliser N is identical for the fixing and the non fixing plants. If this assumption is not valid, large discrepancies can occur between the actual and calculated contributions of <b>symbiotic</b> <b>fixation</b> to the overall N acquisition by the plants (pA). This error was evaluated {{as a function of the}} level of pA, 15 N enrichments of the soil and fertiliser and the proportion of fertiliser N retrieved by the legume to total mineral N. Recommendations for optimal application of 15 N labelled fertiliser used to enrich the soil mineral N are given...|$|E

30|$|Soybeans [Glycine max L. (Merr.)] {{are one of}} {{the major}} crops in grain-producing {{countries}} worldwide. Particularly in Argentina, production for 2010 has been estimated in about 50.0 million tons, which represents 7 percent less than the record of 54.0 million tons covering a production area of 18.0 million hectares (USDA, 2010). Improved crop productivity has been associated with different practices, such as the incorporation of agronomical, physical, chemical or biological technologies. The use of mineral fertilizers has been subordinated to biological fertilization, principally due to its economical and environmental advantages (Adesemoye and Kloepper, 2009). Inoculation with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobiaceae bacteria has become a simple and effective way to significantly improve soybean yield and productivity. Within the genus Bradyrhizobium, B. japonicum is the best example of successful <b>symbiotic</b> <b>fixation</b> under very large scale field conditions.

In the whole plant phosphorus concentration range of 0. 8 to 1. 5 grams per kilogram dry weight, plants supplied with 20 millimolar nitrate accumulated significantly more dry matter and nitrogen than symbiotic plants without nitrate. This suggested that the higher phosphorus requirement for <b>symbiotic</b> dinitrogen <b>fixation</b> is internal rather than being associated with differences {{in the ability of}} roots in the two nitrogen regimes to absorb phosphorus from the external solution. Increasing the phosphorus concentration in plants solely dependent on dinitrogen fixation resulted in highly significant (P = 0. 0001) increases in whole plant nitrogen concentration as well as highly significant increases (P = 0. 0001) in whole plant dry matter and nitrogen accumulation. This indicated a greater responsiveness of <b>symbiotic</b> dinitrogen <b>fixation</b> than of host plant growth to improvement in phosphorus nutrition. The large increases in whole plant nitrogen concentration were associated with about 3. 5 -fold increases in the ratio of nodule mass to whole plant mass and about 2 -fold increases in specific acetylene reduction (nitrogenase) activity of the nodules. The large increase in nodule mass (> 30 -fold) between the 0 and 2. 0 millimolar phosphorus levels resulted from 11 - and 3 -fold increases in nodule number per plant and average mass of individual nodules, respectively. Root mass per plant over the same concentration range increased 3. 5 -fold. These results indicate that phosphorus has specific roles in nodule initiation, growth, and functioning in addition to its involvement in host plant growth processes...|$|R

Photosynthetic bradyrhizobia interacting with Nod factor (NF) dependent and NF-independent Aeschynomene legumes are able to synthesize homocitrate themselves as they contain a nifV gene encoding a homocitrate synthase. Here, we show that in the model strain ORS 285, nifV is required for free-living and <b>symbiotic</b> dinitrogen <b>fixation</b> with NF-independent Aeschynomene species. In contrast, in symbiosis with NF-dependent Aeschynomene species, the nifV requirement for efficient nitrogen fixation was found to be host plant dependent. Interestingly, orthologs of FEN 1 were found in both NF-dependent and NF-independent Aeschynomene species. However, a high nodule specific induction of FEN 1 expression was only observed in A. afraspera, a host plant in which nifV is not required for <b>symbiotic</b> dinitrogen <b>fixation.</b> These data indicate that efficient <b>symbiotic</b> nitrogen <b>fixation</b> in many of the tested Aeschynomene species requires rhizobial homocitrate synthesis.
