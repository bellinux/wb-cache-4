25|$|Without these features, any ext3 {{file system}} {{is also a}} valid ext2 file system. This {{situation}} has allowed well-tested and mature file <b>system</b> <b>maintenance</b> utilities for maintaining and repairing ext2 file systems to also be used with ext3 without major changes. The ext2 and ext3 file systems share the same standard set of utilities, e2fsprogs, which includes an fsck tool. The close relationship also makes conversion between the two file systems (both forward to ext3 and backward to ext2) straightforward.|$|E
25|$|The {{software}} utility Cron is a time-based {{job scheduler}} in Unix-like computer operating systems. People {{who set up}} and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates <b>system</b> <b>maintenance</b> or administration—though its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals. The origin of the name cron is from the Greek word for time, χρόνος (chronos).|$|E
25|$|In Australia, {{there are}} no {{quantitative}} performance targets for rainwater tanks, such as size of tank or targeted reductions in potable water demand, in policies or guidelines. The various guidelines provided by state governments however, do advise that rain water tanks be {{designed to provide a}} reliable source of water to supplement mains water supply, and maintain appropriate water quality. The use of rainwater tanks should consider issues such as supply and demand, water quality, stormwater benefits (volume is reduced), cost, available space, maintenance, size, shape and material of the tank. Rainwater tanks must also be installed in accordance with plumbing and drainage standards. An advised suitable configuration may include a water filter or first flush diversion, a mains water top-up supply (dual supply <b>system),</b> <b>maintenance</b> drain, a pump (pressure system), and an on-site retention provision.|$|E

500|$|... '458' {{was part}} of a {{cross-country}} flight of two aircraft when its radio failed while landing at Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwest Idaho. The aircraft was ordered to effect repairs at Mountain Home AFB and then return to MCAS El Toro. Diagnostic tests at Mountain Home revealed that the aircraft had an inoperative radio, inoperative transponder, oxygen system leak, and a degraded radar <b>system.</b> <b>Maintenance</b> personnel were able to fix the radio and confirm the oxygen leak, but the base did not have the necessary personnel to repair either the transponder or the radar.|$|E
500|$|The IANA {{time zone}} {{database}} maps {{a name to}} the named location's historical and predicted clock shifts. This database is used by many computer software systems, including most Unix-like operating systems, Java, and the Oracle RDBMS; HP's [...] "tztab" [...] database is similar but incompatible. When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary <b>system</b> <b>maintenance.</b> In Unix-like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name, as in TZ=':America/New_York'. In many of those systems {{there is also a}} system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the /etc/localtime file, which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in timezone-independent epoch time; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.|$|E

2500|$|WaterPartners {{contracted}} with Emory University in 2006 to systematically assess {{a random sample}} of projects completed over the last ten years. Few NGOs have conducted systematic studies of the sustainability of their water supply projects. This study represents a significant step towards quantifying results and identifying opportunities for improvement. Results indicated that the systems continued to deliver water at levels demanded by users, people were very satisfied with the new services, and that systems were making positive impacts in users’ daily lives. Challenges identified in the evaluation include dissociation of the local water committees with the local partner organization, [...] "relaxation of <b>system</b> <b>maintenance,</b> financial instability of water committees, poor water quantity in the dry summer months, and contamination and deforestation at the source." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diesel engine {{generator}} sets {{are often used}} for prime power in communities not connected to a widespread power grid. [...] Emergency (standby) power systems may use reciprocating internal combustion engines operated by fuel oil or natural gas. [...] Standby generators may serve as emergency power for a factory or data center, or may also be operated in parallel with the local utility system to reduce peak power demand charge from the utility. [...] Diesel engines can produce strong torque at relatively low rotational speeds, which is generally desirable when driving an alternator, but diesel fuel in long-term storage can be subject to problems resulting from water accumulation and chemical decomposition. [...] Rarely used generator sets may correspondingly be installed as natural gas or LPG to minimize the fuel <b>system</b> <b>maintenance</b> requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Many PEI {{homes and}} {{businesses}} are serviced by central sewage collection and/or treatment systems. These are operated either by a municipality or a private utility. Many industrial operations have their own wastewater treatment facilities. Staff members with the Department of Environment, Labour and Justice provide advice to operators, as needed, on proper <b>system</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The IRAC regulates municipal water and sewer in the province, now under the Environmental Protection Act. [...] Since around 1900, {{the residents of the}} City of Charlottetown have benefited from a central sanitary sewer service. Early disposal practices, while advanced for their time, eventually were found to compromise the ecological integrity of the nearby Hillsborough River and the Charlottetown Harbour. By 1974, the Commission had spearheaded the development of a primary wastewater treatment plant, known as the Charlottetown Pollution Control Plant, together with the construction of several pumping stations along the City’s waterfront, and outfall piping deep into the Hillsborough River.|$|E
