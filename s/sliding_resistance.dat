It was divided into two phases: in the first one, the sediments consisted of sand; in the second one, a local clay (Leda) was used instead. Testing was done in a concrete flume, 6 by 2. 6 m in surface area, located in the CHC ice tank, and incorporating a four-sided enclosure (the 2 ̆ 018 wagon 2 ̆ 019) 2 m by 2 m in surface area, used to contain the ice rubble. The ice was loaded incrementally with concrete slabs, for a total normal stress up to 20 kPa. The wagon was pulled by an actuator over a maximum distance of about 120 mm per test, while the force {{required to do so}} was measured with two load cells. Displacement rates ranged from 0. 0035 to 0. 3 mm/sec. The location of shear failure {{is believed to have been}} at the ice-sand interface for all tests. Testing with sand yielded friction coefficients of 0. 65 and 0. 62, for peak and residual shear stresses, respectively, with the peak response being attributed to dilatation. No effect of displacement rate was noted. Sediment freeze-up at the icesand interface increased friction substantially.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to improve understanding of the mechanical behaviour of soils subjected to internal erosion in hydraulic works. The approach is based on a homogenisation technique for deriving the stress–strain relationship of a granular assembly from forces and displacements at the particle level. The soil's local behaviour is assumed to follow a Hertz–Mindlin elastic law and a Mohr–Coulomb plastic law. <b>Sliding</b> <b>resistance</b> on each plane is made to depend on the actual void ratio of the granular assembly. The solid fraction removal is modelled by progressively increasing the granular assembly void ratio, which provokes a decrease of the <b>sliding</b> <b>resistance</b> of each interparticle contact, leading to macroscopic deformations of the soil specimen. At elevated stress levels, large deformations can develop and lead to soil failure. Numerical simulations also demonstrate that a type of failure called diffuse failure can occur in eroded soil masses whenever an increase in pore pressure is generated within the soil. These numerical results appear to be coherent with observations made on embankment dams that have suffered internal erosion and, in particular, with the description of their modes of failure...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of flagellar counterbend in sea urchin sperm {{show that the}} mechanical induction of curvature {{in one part of}} a passive flagellum induces a compensatory countercurvature elsewhere. This apparent paradoxical effect cannot be explained using the standard elastic rod theory of Euler and Bernoulli, or even the more general Cosserat theory of rods. Here, we develop a geometrically exact mechanical model to describe the statics of microtubule bundles that is capable of predicting the curvature reversal events observed in eukaryotic flagella. This is achieved by allowing the interaction of deformations in different material directions, by accounting not only for structural bending, but also for the elastic forces originating from the internal cross-linking mechanics. Large-amplitude static configurations can be described analytically, and an excellent match between the model and the observed counterbend deformation was found. This allowed a simultaneous estimation of multiple sperm flagellum material parameters, namely the cross-linking <b>sliding</b> <b>resistance,</b> the bending stiffness, and the sperm head junction compliance ratio. We further show that small variations on the empirical conditions may induce discrepancies for the evaluation of the flagellar material quantities, so that caution is required when interpreting experiments. Finally, our analysis demonstrates that the counterbend emerges as a fundamental property of <b>sliding</b> <b>resistance</b> in cross-linked filamentous polymer bundles, which also suggests that cross-linking proteins may contribute to the regulation of the flagellar waveform in swimming sperm via counterbend mechanics...|$|E
40|$|Subsea {{infrastructure}} for deep-water {{oil and gas}} developments is often supported by mudmat foundations. Traditionally, subsea mudmats are designed to resist the loads imposed by pipeline {{thermal expansion and contraction}} while remaining stationary. As subsea facilities have grown, the required size andweight of the mudmats challenge the handling capacity of installation vessels and raise costs. Tolerable mobility of a subsea mudmat can significantly relieve the applied loads, leading to reduced mudmat size and weight. In this paper, the cyclic shearing and reconsolidation response of fine-grained soil around a tolerably mobile mudmat is investigated through results of finite-element analysis using a critical state soil model. The mudmat was subjected to a simulated lifetime of operation, with many cycles of undrained sliding with intervening consolidation between cycles. The <b>sliding</b> <b>resistance</b> was shown to rise exponentially with cycles and reach the drained limit, accompanied by significant strength gain in the subsoil because of the intervening consolidation between movements. The degree of reconsolidation between slides affects the number of cycles required to mobilise the drained limit.

Expressions for the rate of hardening of <b>sliding</b> <b>resistance</b> of a tolerably mobile mudmat foundation are proposed in this paper to assist design practice. </p...|$|E
