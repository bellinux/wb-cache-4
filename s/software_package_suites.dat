40|$|Kiamilev, FouadPrinted Circuit Board {{design and}} {{implementation}} is a research topic most any company or group manufacturing electronic devices must address. There are issues {{in every aspect of}} design, ranging from schematics to pad stacks to routing. An error in any one of these steps propagates through the remaining steps. There are many approaches and <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> for moving a design from schematics to a physical PCB. However, <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> can range from being free to costing thousands. This thesis describes the design process from start to nish of a multi-purpose FPGA-based printed circuit board in two competing <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> It will detail issues encountered along the way, and how these issues were resolved. Commercially available products will be used throughout the process, including the Xilinx Spartan 3 E FPGA. The di ering design processes in the <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> Cadence Allegro Design Entry HDL and Advanced Circuits PCB Artist will be detailed and explored in order to determine which characteristics of each <b>package</b> <b>suites</b> various types of hardware design.

This model proposes that Enterprise Systems, when used to integrate, optimise and informate, can help firms achieve alliance innovation, process innovation and reshaped business strategy. The paper also provides preliminary empirical evidence that supports the propositions. This model will be tested further through primary case studies and a survey. This research, once completed, will assess the strategic role of Enterprise Systems in enabling business transformations beyond operational benefits. <br /...|$|R

The most significant contributor to application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> project failure lies in the misalignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality of the application <b>software</b> <b>package.</b> While various IT control frameworks that may assist in the implementation of application <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> are available, the question arises why industry still reports that the success rate of application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implementation projects remains low. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the extent to which the Projects in Controlled Environment (PRINCE 2) framework assists in the alignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality provided by the application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implemented.

40|$|AbstractThe Sagaing Fault {{is a major}} tectonic {{structure}} between the Indian Plate and Sunda Plate. The fault measures 1200  km along north–south and cuts through the centre of Myanmar. Many urban areas lie along the fault. As a result, Myanmar has established a continuous Global Positioning System (cGPS) network across the Sagaing Fault since 2011. The cGPS network consists of eight cGPS stations that form two transects across the fault. The data analysis covers a period of four years from 2011 to 2014. GAMIT, GLOBK, and TRACK <b>software</b> <b>suite</b> <b>packages</b> are used for GPS data processing and analysis. This study consists of two main objectives. The first objective is to analyse the Myanmar cGPS network observations {{in order to measure}} the moving rate and direction of movement for each cGPS station using GAMIT/GLOBK <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> The second objective is to investigate the co-seismic moving rate associated with the earthquake event using TRACK kinematic positioning program. The analysis results indicate that {{the east side of the}} Sagaing Fault moves southeastward at the average rate of approximately 32 – 40  mm/a, whereas the west side of the fault moves northeastward at the rate of about 31 – 35  mm/a. For co-seismic analysis, two cGPS stations are analysed in connection with the 2012 M 6. 8 Thabeikkyin earthquake. These stations are located 50 – 60  km away from the epicentre. The GPS data analysis clearly showed that the station at the east side of the Sagaing Fault immediately moved south by 15. 0  cm, whereas the station at the west side of the fault moved north by 3. 0  cm. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the Sagaing Fault's tectonic activities can be monitored by cGPS observations using geodetic processing techniques. We believe that such investigation brings contribution to better understand of the tectonic activities in Myanmar and South East Asia...|$|R
