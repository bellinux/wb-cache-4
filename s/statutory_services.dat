50|$|Ambulance service within Australia can {{be divided}} into two basic groups; the <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> and also {{volunteer}} groups. In all Australian states, with the exception of Western Australia, and in the Northern Territory, statutory ambulance services are provided by the state/territorial government, as a single-entity, third-service model, government department. In Western Australia, and in the Northern Territory, all statutory ambulance service is provided by St John Ambulance Australia, under contract to the state/territorial government. In all other states and territories, the activities of St John Ambulance are limited to first aid training and special events support, with the occasional disaster response. In all states with the exception of Queensland and Tasmania, users who are not on welfare benefits are billed directly for their usage of an ambulance. In addition, while not strictly ambulance services, some jurisdictions also have private companies offering medical transportation services on a fee-for-service basis. Ambulance services in Australia operate on the Anglo-American (as opposed to the Franco-German) EMS service delivery model.|$|E
40|$|South African welfare {{policies}} {{and social problems}} dictate social service rendering in South Africa. Social workers are involved in various service delivery interventions of which community development (macro focus) and <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> (micro focus) are two separate specialised interventions. In social work practice {{there is a need}} for both interventions, however, there is no clear guidelines for social workers how to integrate these interventions in practice. The aim of this study was to determine how community development and <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> as two distinctive social work interventions could be integrated in order to render effective, integrated social services within a developmental approach. A qualitative research approach was utilised for the study and data was gathered by means of four focus group interviews. Respondents for the study included social workers and clients who were involved in both statutory and community development interventions. Research findings indicated that statutory and community development interventions are guided by different processes, time frames, and models of implementation, such as the legislative framework in the case of statutory work as opposed to participatory models in community development. The study concluded that there is not only confusion with regard to the role of social workers, but also a high risk of clients loosing trust in the helping relationship when one social worker simultaneously does community work and render <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> in the same community. The distinctive nature of <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> and community development calls for other options for the integration of these two intervention levels. This study proposed three options for social workers and NGOs to integrate <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> and community development. Based on the research findings and conclusions of the study, the researcher proposed guidelines for (1) the development of an integrated model and (2) a policy framework for the integration of <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> and community development within a developmental approach and finally recommended that such a designed model and policy framework be implemented and the impact thereof on social service delivery be researched.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} independent advocates’ perspectives on their roles in Scottish adult support and protection (ASP) work, and the facilitators and barriers impacting on these roles in practice.   Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 managers and staff from six independent advocacy agencies operating across nine local authority areas.   Findings – Participants described key roles in supporting individuals to understand their rights and to negotiate ASP processes. They conceptualised their independence to be the key distinguishing feature of their role. Participants noted lower than expected rates of referral of ASP concerns to advocacy and variable experiences of communication with the <b>statutory</b> <b>services.</b> Particular emphasis was placed on the late stage at which many referrals are received. Awareness, understanding and acceptance of advocacy amongst the <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> was felt to vary at both practice and strategic levels.   Research limitations/implications – The sample is not a representative one. However, some commonalities are worthy of note: particularly the participants’ commitment to ASP work and the perceived impact of statutory agencies on their involvement in it. The issue of late referrals merits some consideration at a national level. Issues of awareness and understanding amongst the <b>statutory</b> <b>services,</b> and their links with referral rates, are for further local-level exploration. The independent advocacy community might wish to discuss further the impacts on them of incorporation into statutory frameworks. Originality/value – Advocacy perspectives have been little drawn on in pre-existing ASP research...|$|E
40|$|With growing {{emphasis}} on an ageing society, {{and the increasing}} number of people with chronic conditions, both the World Health Organisation and European Union have suggested health care needs reform. The use of information and communication technologies, specifically telecare, is a possible catalyst for positive change within such reform. Based on a 12 month pilot study of telecare deployment for people with Chronic Heart Failure, this paper reports the findings and discusses some of the difficulties <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> face when wishing to re-engineer services, especially the perceived levels of research evidence required to support the decision making process. Focus is also given to the hypothesis that if <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> are unable to respond to the opportunities suggested by telecare then consumers are likely to drive change through private purchases. The challenge is therefore to develop a strategy and sustainable business model for a mainstream telecare service through a mixture of public and private initiatives...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{clarify the}} {{relation}} between the dependency of elderly people and the assistance they receive from others by using a detailed but simple measure of dependency. DESIGN [...] Secondary analysis of data from a survey of people aged 70 and over. SETTING [...] Two general practices in south Wales. SUBJECTS [...] 1280 people aged 70 and over. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Dependency on others to perform essential functions; detailed data on who assists with those functions. RESULTS [...] Increasing dependency was associated with increased use of more than one member of the family or friends and an increase in the provision of <b>statutory</b> <b>services.</b> CONCLUSION [...] The complexity of {{the relation between}} dependency and those who care for dependent people has previously been underestimated. The presence of providers of <b>statutory</b> <b>services</b> at the household of elderly dependent people suggests that these services can be developed further to help those caring for elderly people at home...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{community}} stigmatisation upon service usage {{has been largely}} overlooked from a social identity perspective. Specifically the psychological mechanisms by which stigmatisation hinders service use remain unspecified. The present study examines how service providers, community workers, and residents recount their experience s of the stigmatisation of local community identity and how these shape residents’ uptake of welfare, education and community support services. 20 individual and group interviews with 10 residents, 16 community workers, and 6 <b>statutory</b> <b>service</b> providers in economically disadvantaged communities in Limerick, Ireland w ere thematically analysed. Analysis indicates that <b>statutory</b> <b>service</b> providers endorsed negative stereotypes of disadvantaged areas as separate and anti-social. The awareness of this perceived division {{and the experience of}} ‘stigma consciousness’ is reported by residents and community workers to undermine trust, leading to under-utilisation of community and government services. We argue that stigmatisation acts as a ‘social curse’ (Kellezi & Reicher, 2012) turning a potentially cooperative intragroup relationship into a fraught intergroup one by undermining shared identity between service users and providers. We suggest that tackling stigma is an important step towards creating positive service interactions for both service users and providers that are based on a sense of shared identity, trust and co-operation...|$|R
