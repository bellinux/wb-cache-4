40|$|Abstract – The {{purpose of}} this paper was to find an {{effective}} method for measuring electromagnetic torque produced by a brushless DC motor with <b>single-phase</b> <b>current</b> sensing in real-time. A torque equation is derived from the theory of brushless DC motor. This equation is then validated experimentally with a motor dynamometer. A computer algorithm is also proposed to implement the electromagnetic torque estimation equation in real-time. Electromagnetic torque is a linear function of phase current. Estimating the electromagnetic torque in real-time using <b>single-phase</b> <b>current</b> is not appropriate with existing equations, however, because of the rectangular alternating-pulse nature of the excitation current. With some mathematical manipulation to the existing equations, the equation derived in this paper overcame this limitation. The equation developed is simple and so it is computationally efficient, and it takes only motor torque constant and <b>single-phase</b> <b>current</b> to evaluate the electromagnetic torque; no other parameters such as winding resistances, inductances are needed. The equation derived is limited to the three-phase brushless DC motor. It can, however, easily be extended to the multi-phase brushless DC motor with the technique described in this paper...|$|E

In those cases, it is necessary to apply sophisticated signal processing analysis methods in order to reliably follow the time evolution of the fault-related harmonics in the signal. In this paper, the zero-sequence current (ZSC) is analysed using the high-resolution spectral method of multiple signal classification (MUSIC). The analysis of the ZSC signal has proved to have several advantages over the analysis of a <b>single-phase</b> <b>current</b> waveform. Experimentation is performed on a healthy motor, a motor with one broken rotor bar, and a motor with two broken rotor bars.

The interpretation of the <b>single-phase</b> <b>current</b> spectrum provides direct information on the presence of abnormal conditions, while their quantification is an open problem as signature spectral lines depend also on motor load and inertia.

The aim of this paper is the performance evaluation of this diagnostic index to state the rotor breakage severity in induction machines. It is shown that instantaneous current components bear the same features as instantaneous power components. Moreover, it is possible to switch from amplitudes and angular displacements of reactive and active current components to the (1 Â± 2 s) w sidebands and therefore to verify the link among torque ripple, speed ripple, flux and current components.

40|$|Introduction. Earthing device {{electrical}} substation {{in modern}} conditions must meet both {{the requirements of}} electrical safety of people and animals, as well as electromagnetic compatibility requirements established her electrical equipment. These requirements are intended to address issues of protection against surges and interference caused by lightning impulse currents and switching. Aim. To investigate the distribution of <b>single-phase</b> short-circuit <b>current</b> in the substation grounding devices. Task. On {{the basis of the}} proposed design scheme of substitution substation grounding device, consisting of a substation earthing system and «cable-supported» an algorithm for calculating the resistance of the grounding device substation and distribution of <b>single-phase</b> short-circuit <b>current</b> on the circuit elements. Method. Mathematical modeling and calculation engine. Results. On the basis of calculations and studies analyzed the <b>current</b> distribution of <b>single-phase</b> short-circuit between the substation earthing system and earthing «rope-reliance». Studies carried out for the actual range of variation of the circuit parameters, showed that the earthing resistance substation substantially affects the current distribution in the one-phase short circuit fault. For example, using the graph shows that with increasing resistance grounding system of "rope-supported" the proportion of <b>single-phase</b> short-circuit <b>current</b> flowing from the substation earthing increases, while the proportion of <b>single-phase</b> short-circuit <b>current</b> flowing from the grounding device supports decreases and vice versa. In addition, when rationing grounding systems at substations for the touch voltage is necessary to analyze all the possible modes of operation of the network, which is substationed. Conclusion.
