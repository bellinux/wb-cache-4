40|$|The known {{confectionery}} <b>spreadable</b> <b>cream</b> {{product category}} includes well-known cocoa - hazelnut pastes {{as well as}} peanut butter, products that became very popular in the last decades due to their pleasant taste and ease of eating. However, health constraints appeared both hazelnut and peanut are food allergens, while cocoa excites central nervous system (CNS) and on everyday consumption causes dependence. The aim of this work was to characterize the aroma and sensory of an innovative product that belongs to the same confectionery <b>spreadable</b> <b>cream</b> product category. Six <b>spreadable</b> <b>cream</b> prototypes were produced by using sugar, roasted sunflower kernel, carob or cocoa powder, palm or coconut fat and, lecithin. The obtained samples were firstly analyzed by using the nine point hedonic scale test. The volatile compounds profile analysis (“In Tube Extraction” - GC-MS) {{was performed on the}} best samples (in terms of sensory) containing cocoa or carob powder, as well as a control. The main volatile compound of all three samples was pinene (42 - 51 %) which is a characteristic flavor of turpentine, wood. Acetophenone instead (20 - 25 %) gives flavors of almond, floral, sweetish. Benzaldehyde (8. 11 - 9. 73 %) is characteristic for almond flavor with hints of caramel. The study revealed that the analyzed spreadable creams have similar volatile profiles, even if carob and cocoa powder showed different volatile compounds profiles, with the major compound for both being Propanoic acid, 2 -methyl. Thus, with similar taste to cocoa sample, carob-sunflower <b>spreadable</b> <b>cream</b> is an alternative that not include ingredients with allergic potential or CNS stimulants.  </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the case}} {{referred}} to in this survey, we have verified {{the possibility of using}} avocado oil, pure or mixed with olive oil, as an ingredient in the production of gianduja chocolate <b>spreadable</b> <b>cream.</b> The results achieved by such application show a high oxidative stability of the cream added with avocado oil, even if maintained in experimental conditions, lasting for several days, with high temperatures and in the presence of oxygen. This {{may be due to the}} presence of antioxidant compounds of the oil itself, or to a synergistic effect of the latter with the phenolic compounds of cocoa, bringing out the antioxidant and protective action on the lipid component. From preliminary tests carried out on small volumes it can be said, moreover, that tested avocado oil gives sensory features that distinctly characterize the <b>spreadable</b> <b>cream,</b> even compared to the one containing extra virgin oil from taggiasca olives, currently in use at Venchi S. p. A. Confirmation tests carried out on a larger scale (industrial or semiindustrial) are needed, particularly to provide for proper mixing and tempering stages, which have not been carried out yet under laboratory conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNineteen {{samples of}} food in glass jars with twist {{closures}} were collected by the national food inspectors at Danish food producers and a few importers, focusing on fatty food, such as vegetables in oil, herring in dressing or pickle, soft <b>spreadable</b> cheese, <b>cream,</b> dressings, peanut butter, sauces and infant food. The composition of the plasticizers in the gaskets was analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. ESBO and phthalates were determined in the homogenized food samples. ESBO was the principal plasticizer in 5 of the gaskets; in 14 it was phthalates. ESBO was found in seven of the food samples at concentrations from 6 to 100 mg/kg. The highest levels (91 – 100 mg/kg) were in oily foods like garlic, chilli or olives in oil. Phthalates, i. e. di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP) and di-iso-nonylphthalates (DINP), were found in seven samples at 6 to 173 mg/kg. The highest concentrations (99 – 173 mg/kg) were in products of garlic and tomatoes in oil and in fatty food products like sauce béarnaise and peanut butter. For five of the samples the overall migration from unused lids to the official fatty food simulant olive oil was determined and compared to the legal limit of 60 mg/kg. The results ranged from 76 to 519 mg/kg {{and as a consequence}} the products were withdrawn from the market...|$|R
40|$|C Spreadable creams are solid-oil suspensions, {{a mix of}} fats {{represents}} the oil phase, the dispersed phase consisting usually of sugar, cocoa powder, milled and roasted nuts, dried milk and whey. For improving the viscosity of the final product emulsifiers are used, most common being lecithin and mono and diglycerides. The present paper refers to a spreadable confectionery product group, creamy, proper to be eaten as it is, as well as spread on a bread slice or as a filling for cookies or chocolate cream. According to this work, the following ingredients were used: roasted sunflower kernels, sugar, palm oil, cocoa or carob powder and lecithin. The obtained product can be consumed also by persons who suffer from allergies, due the fact that sunflower seeds were replacing the peanuts or almond, the ingredients known as allergens and which are usually used in the technological process of obtaining these creams. The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize the obtaining confectionery spreadable creams based on sunflower kernels, cocoa or carob powder. It was determined the chemical composition of the prototypes obtained, a <b>spreadable</b> <b>cream</b> having no cocoa or carob, one with cocoa and one with carob powder. The antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content of the obtained samples were also assessed. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} shows {{results of a}} {{calculation}} of carbon footprint (CFP) resulting from the production of nuts added value products for a large consumer market. Nuts consumption is increasing {{in the world and}} so is the consumer awareness of the environmental impact of goods, hence the calculation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of food production is of growing importance for producers. Calculation of CO 2 eq emissions was performed for all stages of the production chain to the final retail point for flour, grains, paste, chocolate covered nuts and <b>spreadable</b> <b>cream</b> produced from almonds, pistachios and hazelnuts grown and transformed in Italy and for peanuts grown in Argentina and transformed in Italy. Data from literature was used to evaluate CFP of raw materials, emissions from transport and packing were calculated using existing models, while emissions deriving from transformation were calculated empirically by multiplying the power of production lines (electrical and/or thermal) by its productivity. All values were reported in kg of CO 2 equivalent for each kg of packed product (net weight). Resulting values ranged between 1. 2 g of CO 2 /kg for a 100 g bag of almond to 4. 8 g of CO 2 /kg for the 100 g bag of chocolate covered almond. The calculation procedure can be well used for similar cases of large consumer food productions...|$|E
40|$|Sunflower is {{the basic}} oil-crop in Central and Eastern Europe. As {{sunflower}} seeds are mainly used for oil production, {{the most of the}} kernels available on the market show high oil content (> 55 %). Consequently, when sunflower kernel paste (tahini) is used in different food products, oil exudation occurs. The aim of current work was to use entirely the sunflower seeds by partially defatting and obtaining different fat content sunflower pastes with multiple food applications, while using the husks for developing an ecological package. Sunflower kernels were industrially roasted in a continuous roasting drum.   Raw and roasted kernels were pressed at pilot plant scale by using a laboratory expeller. Partially defatted sunflower paste was obtained from the press cakes by employing a ball mill. Different fat content tahini samples were obtained by adding the required amount of oil to the partially defatted paste. Tahini samples fat content ranged from 45 to 60 %. Tahini and halva were chosen as a study model. Decreasing tahini oil content increased its colloidal stability during storage, a similar trend being noticed when halva samples were stored. Moreover, halva texture analysis and sensory characteristics were assessed for selecting the optimum tahini oil content and thermal treatment. Various sunflower kernel food applications were proposed by obtaining the related prototypes at pilot plant scale: roasted sunflower kernel biscuits, sunflower <b>spreadable</b> <b>cream</b> filled biscuits, hummus, sunflower paste coated in chocolate, sunflower kernel chikki and bars, as well as an innovative ecological package based on the resulting sunflower husks and a starch adhesive.  </p...|$|E
