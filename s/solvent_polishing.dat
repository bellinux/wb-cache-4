40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new application in cultural heritage {{and other areas}} for a highly surface specific analytical technique originally developed for semiconductor research. The technique, ultra-low-energy dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (uleSIMS), is microdestructive, but has a sensitivity typically better than 1 atom in 10 (6). It can provide an analysis within the top nm, or the top few put of a surface, and gives chemical fingerprinting as well as atomic composition information. It is complimentary to other near-surface techniques such as SEM-EDX, XRD and electrochemical methods. Here, we describe the use of uleSIMS with SEM and SEM-EDX {{in a study of}} the tarnishing of museum silver. We report on the initial stages in the development of reference surfaces for control experiments, and on the data obtained from a lightly tarnished sterling silver test coupon exposed in a museum environment for 2 years. First results from a study of a XVIIc. silver fragment, aimed at detecting differences in the tarnish or coating in different areas are also presented. Overall we show that the surface chemistry of all these surfaces is a complex mixture of that due to corrosion, contaminants deposited by <b>solvents,</b> <b>polish</b> media (in an overlayer which may only be a few nm thick), handling and the environment, as well as particulates - both from the environment and from polishes. However, surfaces with different histories show large variations in their uleSIMS spectra and depth profiles, and we attempt {{to lay the groundwork for}} the interpretation of these.

50|$|Sudan I (also {{commonly}} known as CI Solvent Yellow 14 and Solvent Orange R), is an organic compound, typically classified as an azo dye. It is an intensely orange-red solid that is added to colourise waxes, oils, petrol, <b>solvents,</b> and <b>polishes.</b> Sudan I has also been adopted for colouring various foodstuffs, especially curry powder and chili powder, although the use of Sudan I in foods is now banned in many countries, because Sudan I, Sudan III, and Sudan IV have been classified as category 3 carcinogens (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Sudan I is still used in some orange-coloured smoke formulations and as a colouring for cotton refuse used in chemistry experiments.|$|R
40|$|A multistep direct {{liquefaction}} process specifically {{aimed at}} low-rank coals (LRCs) {{has been developed}} at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC). The process consists of a preconversion treatment to prepare the coal for solubilization, solubilization of the coal in the <b>solvent,</b> and <b>polishing</b> using a phenolic solvent or solvent blend to complete solubilization of the remaining material. The product of these three steps can then be upgraded during a traditional hydrogenation step. This project will address two research questions necessary for the further development and scaleup of this process: (1) determination of the recyclability of the solvent used during solubilization and (2) determination of the minimum severity required for effective hydrotreatment of the liquid product. The project will be performed as two tasks, the first consisting of ten recycle tests and the second consisting of twelve hydrotreatment tests performed at various conditions...|$|R

This project showed that the solvent could be recycled during the preconversion, solubilization and polishing steps of the multistep process and that lower-severity conditions {{can be used to}} successfully hydrotreat the product of the multistep process. The success of this project indicates that additional studies should be performed to evaluate the liquid-phase reactions taking place during batch tests in which the gas flow is continuous (i. e., the gas effects would be negligible). In addition, the entire multistep process (including hydrotreatment) should be evaluated during continuous unit operations. 2 refs., 11 figs., 27 tabs...|$|R

40|$|Various {{mechanical}} properties of whole endosperm, starch granules, and storage protein deposits {{were compared to}} determine whether the findings were consistent with the current theories on wheat hardness. All mechanical measurements were performed in situ without the use of <b>solvents,</b> resins, or <b>polishing</b> compounds that could alter the properties of the specimens. The results showed that the starch and protein components had elastic and creep properties. There {{were no significant differences in}} any of the {{mechanical properties}} of the starch and protein components either within a variety or among soft, hard, and durum wheat types. Tensile strength (Su), compressive strength (Smax), toughness (Wmax), modulus of elasticity (E) and strain to fracture (emax) were measured in samples of whole endosperm from various soft, hard, and durum wheats. The mean values for each parameter were highest for durum caryopses and lowest for non-vitreous caryopses of soft wheats. The hard wheat samples were intermediate. The mechanical properties of some vitreous caryopses of two soft wheat varieties were comparable to those of durum and hard wheat caryopses. These results do not support theories that suggest endosperm hardness is directly attributable to a cell product made exclusively in either hard or soft wheat varieties...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Employees in nail salons, largely Vietnamese immigrant women in Boston, {{are exposed to}} a range of volatile organic chemicals from the products used in sal-ons, including <b>solvents,</b> glues and <b>polishes.</b> Some of these chemicals have the potential to cause short and long-term adverse health effects. Only limited research has been performed on assessing occupational exposures. This pro-ject aimed to characterize total volatile organic compound (TVOC) and PM 2. 5 concentrations in nail salons as a function of ventilation, building characteristics, customer and employee occupancy, and type of services being per-formed. Students conducted sampling in 21 salons in Boston, MA from September to December, 2011. Study visits included: indoor environmental quality measure-ments (TVOCs, PM 2. 5 and carbon dioxide), site observa-tions, and an interview. CO 2 levels in 15 of 21 salons exceeded 800 ppm, suggesting that these salons may have insufficient ventilation. Higher TVOC and PM 2. 5 levels were found in salons with less ventilation (as estimated using CO 2 concentrations). Contrary to our a priori hypothesis, average levels of TVOCs, CO 2 and PM 2. 5 were consistent throughout salons, indicating that exposures may not be restricted to areas in the salon where work is being performed (e. g., at the manicure table). Higher TVOC concentrations were observed when tasks were being per-formed, yet were not dependent upon the number of tasks being performed. Improving ventilation conditions in sal-ons to meet minimum outdoor air delivery requirements can reduce exposures to TVOCs...|$|R
30|$|Titanium foils with {{thickness}} of 0.25 mm (99.5 % purity; Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA, USA) {{were used for}} anodic growth of TNA. Titanium foils were first polished by sonication in chemical <b>polishing</b> <b>solvent</b> which contained nitric acid, ammonia fluoride, urea, ethanol, and hydrogen peroxide in 12 : 5 : 5 : 3 : 12 v/v ratio and rinsed subsequently with deionized (DI) water, acetone, and methanol. The anodization reaction {{was carried out in}} a two-electrode electrochemical cell with polished Ti foil (2 × 2.5 cm 2) which served as the anode-working electrode and Pt foil (thickness 0.025 mm; Alfa Aesar) as the counter electrode. The separation between Ti electrode and Pt electrode was about 3.5 cm. The anodization electrolyte contains 0.3 wt% NH 4 F and 2 vol% H 2 O in ethylene glycol solution. The anodization was operated under a constant potential of 60 V at low temperature of 15 °C with magnetic stirring. The reaction period controlled the {{thickness of}} TiO 2 nano-tube arrays. Typically the TNA samples with tube length of approximately 15 μm were obtained after 2 h of anodization process. It is evident that increasing the TNA length leads to the increase of short-circuit photocurrent density due to the higher surface area available for dye adsorption. The TNA foils were then carefully washed with deionized water to remove the surface residual electrolyte in the nano-tube arrays. Such prepared TNA samples were then annealed at 450 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 °C/min in order to transform the TNA from amorphous to anatase crystalline phase.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} of the French Cooperative PAARC (Pollution Atmosphérique et Affections Respiratoires Chroniques) survey, was to test whether occupational exposures to dusts, gases, or chemical fumes or to specific hazards, estimated by job exposure matrices, were related to a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). METHODS [...] The most recent occupation was recorded in adults, aged 25 - 59, from non-manual worker households. Analysis was restricted to 10, 046 subjects whose occupation was encountered at least 10 times {{in the study and}} who performed good FEV 1 tracings. From occupational title, exposures to dusts, gases, and chemical fumes, and to specific hazards were classified in three categories (no, low, and high) with a British, a French, and an Italian job exposure matrix. Specific hazards were analysed for the British and French job exposure matrices for the same 42 specific dusts, gases, and chemical fumes. To limit spurious associations, a selection of seven hazard groups and 12 specific hazards was set {{before the start of the}} analysis. Based on the consistency of the relations according to sex and the British and French job exposure matrices, associations of age, height, city, and smoking adjusted FEV 1 score with occupational exposures were classified as very likely, possible, or unlikely. RESULTS [...] For the three job exposure matrices and both sexes clear exposure-response relations between the level of exposure to dusts, gases, and chemical fumes, and a decrease in FEV 1 were found. Associations with FEV 1 were classified as very likely for known hazards such as organic dusts and textile dusts, and not previously recognised hazards such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and detergents, and as possible for <b>solvents,</b> waxes and <b>polishes,</b> and diesel fumes. Associations found for PAHs and solvents were confirmed by the Italian job exposure matrix. Associations remained significant in women, but not in men, after adjustment for educational level. CONCLUSIONS [...] Hypotheses have been generated for exposure to detergents, PAHs, and solvents, but they need to be interpreted with caution before replication. Significant associations found for known risk factors with a decrease in FEV 1 are arguments for the validity of the matrices. Despite the expected limitations of job exposure matrices, these results encourage further work to improve exposure assessment by job exposure matrices...|$|R
