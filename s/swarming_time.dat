Tijekom 2014. godine 12 mokro-suhih parova crnih Theysohn® naletno barijernih feromonskih klopki postavljeno je u dvije g. j. UŠP Gospić na različitim nadmorskim visinama. Šest parova klopki postavljeno je u g. j. Žitnik na 500 metara nadmorske visine, a preostalih šest na nadmorskoj visini od 1100 metara u g. j. Štirovača u blizini nacionalnog parka Sjeverni Velebit. Između testiranih klopki nije utvrđena statistički značajna razlika broja ulovljenih potkornjaka, iako je suha feromonska klopka ulovila veći broj jedinki smrekovog pisara i šesterozubog smrekovog potkornjaka. Mokra i suha feromonska klopka pokazale su jednaku selektivnost prema predatorskoj entomofauni – Thanasimus formicarius i Nemozoma elongatum. U suhim feromonskim klopkama utvrđena je redukcija broja ulovljenih potkornjaka djelovanjem predatora. Kod vrste T. formicarius uočena je mogućnost bijega iz suhih feromonskih klopki. Rezultati provedenog istraživanja omogućuju racionalniji pristup monitoringu populacija smrekovih potkornjaka sustavom suhih i mokrih naletno barijernih Theysohn feromonskih klopki. Efficiency of dry and wet flight barrier Theysohn® pheromone traps in {{catching the}} {{spruce bark beetle}}s Ips typographus L. and Pityogenes chalcographus L. Eight toothed spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) and six toothed spruce bark beetle (Pityogenes chalcographus L.) are most imported pests of mature spruce forests in whole Europe. When the populations are low they usually attack the trees which are weakened by snow, wind, highlight or some other biotic or abiotic factors. When the populations increase higher they can attack and kill living standing trees and-thus become primary pests. Monitoring of populations with pheromone traps is an important tool in integrated forests protection. During {{the last two decades}} the foresters in Croatia mainly use the classic black Theysohn® flight barrier pheromone traps for monitoring of spruce bark beetle populations in spruce forests. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate is there any significant difference in catches between dry and wet flight barrier pheromone traps, is there any possibility that bark beetles can escape from pheromone traps after they fall down in plastic box at the bottom of pheromone traps, and is there any difference in selectivity of compared traps to predator species (Thanasimus formicarius L., Nemozoma elongatum L.). In 2014. a field experiment was set up in spruce stands in two sites, one in higher elevation and one in lower elevation. In each site three black Theysohn® flight barrier pheromone traps using water in collecting box were compared with three traps with dry boxes, for each bark beetle species. The holes on the bottom of collecting boxes on wet traps were sealed with silicone. Also new made holes at the side of collecting boxes were covered with plastic net to stop the loss of captured bark beetles with water overflow. The traps were loaded with pheromone lures – Pheroprax® lure for I. typographus and Chalcoprax® for P. chalcographus. Totally for each species were set up six pairs of dry-wet pheromone traps, three pairs on lower and three pairs on higher elevation. The experiment started 17 th of May and was finalized in the last week of September. The traps were emptied every eight days. The caught beetles were kept in 60 % ethanol until the moment when they were determined and counted. Except the two main bark beetle species, also the predator species T. formicarius and N. elongatum were counted. In total 73. 994 specimens of I. typographus were caught in dry, and 71. 212 specimens in wet traps. In dry traps 214. 950 specimens of P. chalcographus were caught, and 179. 146 specimens in wet traps. There was no significant difference between dry and wet pheromone traps for both bark beetle species. It can be concluded easily that I. typographus and P. chalcographus could not escape from traps after they fall down in collecting box at the bottom of traps, what isn’t case with Tomicus species (Hrašovec & Pernek, unpublished results). In both case bigger number of bark beetles (no statistically significant) were caught in dry traps. The reason may be the production of 1 -hexanol and verbenon in wet traps. More dead bark beetles was found in wet pheromone traps what is logical because after they fall down in plastic hunting box which is full of water they get drown after some time, what is no case with bark beetles in dry pheromone traps. Increasing the number of dead beetles can reduce the efficiency of pheromone traps (Kretschmer, 1990; Bakke et al, 1983). The smell of dead bark beetles significantly reduce the efficiency of pheromone traps, but in the moment it wasn’t known which component were responsible for it. Lower efficiency of pheromone traps is consequence of production 1 -hexanol and verbenon from dead bark beetles (Zhang et al., 2003). Pernek (2006), Pernek & Lacković (2011) had a better monitoring results of silver fir bark beetle species (genus Pityokteines) with wet traps compared to dry traps. The classic black Theysohn® traps were used like in this experiment. The reason why the wet pheromone traps had shown a better results in previous research (Pernek, 2006; Pernek & Lacković, 2011) probably is consequence of different factors: biology and pheromone communication, <b>swarming</b> <b>time,</b> weather conditions and different type of stands. All this factor could have a important impact on pheromone trap catches. There is no significant difference in selectivity of compared traps to predators. The dry pheromone traps catch less individuals of T. formicarius L. and more individuals of N. elongatum compared to wet traps. It had been observed the escape possibility of T. formicarius from dry traps. During the analysis of some samples just the eaten bark beetles had been found in dry traps, and there wasn’t any Thanasimus specimens. N. elongatum couldn’t escape from dry traps, and there was some reduction of caught six tooth bark beetles in dry pheromone traps by this predator. The results support the use of both type of traps in monitoring of spruce bark beetle species. Although, dry trap setting in the field, collecting and analyzing of dry catches is much easier...|$|E

While it may seem obvious that it is optimal to allocate the full server capacity, we show that this is not always the case surprisingly enough when the user churn rate is not high.

40|$|Abstract Swarms {{of flying}} robots are a {{promising}} alternative to ground-based robots for search in indoor environments with advantages such as increased speed {{and the ability}} to fly above obstacles. However, there are numerous problems that must be surmounted including limitations in available sensory and on-board processing capabilities, and low flight endurance. This paper introduces a novel strategy to coordinate a swarm of flying robots for indoor exploration that significantly increases energy efficiency. The presented algorithm is fully distributed and scalable. It relies solely on local sensing and low-bandwidth communication, and does not require absolute positioning, localisation, or explicit world-models. It assumes that flying robots can temporarily attach to the ceiling, or land on the ground for efficient surveillance over extended periods of time. To further reduce energy consumption, the swarm is incrementally deployed by launching one robot at a time. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that increasing the time between consecutive robot launches significantly lowers energy consumption by reducing total <b>swarm</b> flight <b>time,</b> while also decreasing collision probability. As a trade-off, however, the search time increases with increased inter-launch periods. These effects are stronger in more complex environments. The proposed localisation-free strategy provides an energy efficient search behaviour adaptable to different environments or timing constraints...|$|R

In Rio Claro city, São Paulo state, Brazil, the number of calls to the fire brigade for removal of bee swarms, and the number admissions in local hospitals due to bee stings were investigated during 2002 and 2003, and a correlation between these data and the average temperature, rainfall and relative humidity was found. The study period was divided into three phases according {{to the number of}} times that the fire brigade was called to remove <b>swarms</b> (263 <b>times)</b> : January to July 2002 - 51 calls (19. 39 %); August 2002 to July 2003 - 140 calls (53. 23 %); and August to December 2003 - 72 calls (27. 38 %). A significant correlation among the number of calls, the local temperature and rainfall was detected. The number of accidents was not associated with environmental variables.
