While there is an {{important}} push in the use of wind energy, gears and bearing components of the turbines often fail due to contact fatigue, causing costly repairs and downtime. The objective of this work is to investigate the potential tribological benefits of two phosphonium-based ionic liquids (ILs) as additives to a <b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant</b> without additives and to a fully formulated and commercially available wind turbine oil. In this work, AISI 52100 steel disks were tested in a ball-on-flat reciprocating tribometer against AISI 440 C steel balls. Surface finish also affects the tribological properties of gear surfaces. In order to understand the combined effect of using the ILs with surface finish, two surface finishes were also used in this study. Adding ILs to the commercial available or <b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant</b> reduced the wear scar diameter for both surface finishes. This decrease was particularly important for trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide, where a wear reduction of the steel disk around 20 % and 23 % is reached when 5 wt % of this IL is added to the commercially available lubricant and to the <b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant</b> without additives, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Over the years, {{different}} lubricants {{have been}} used to operate hip simulators. The current applicable ISO standard (ISO 14242 - 1 : 2002) recommends the use of 25 % calf serum diluted with deionised water. The standard further recommends that the fluid be changed and the acetabular cup be weighed every 500 000 cycles. This procedure results in a loss of both the third body wear particles and the wear pattern. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a <b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant</b> that would map the viscosity and lubricity properties of joint fluid (“synovial fluid”) over the whole duration of a simulator test, which is typically five million cycles. The first objective of this study was to find the effect of temperature increase on the viscous and lubricative properties of joint fluid retrieved from both primary and revision patients prior to surgery. The lubricity tests were done on a Linear-Oscillation Test Machine (SRV machine). Three test temperatures were used namely 38 ºC, 50 ºC and 60 ºC. The load at failure and the average coefficient of friction were parameters measured during these tests. A decrease in the load at failure was found for an increase in test temperature, while the coefficient of friction stayed relatively stable. The viscosity tests were done using a Brookfield Viscometer. The three test temperatures mentioned above, were copied. The joint fluid tested showed pseudoplastic flow behaviour. An increase in the viscosity as a function of test temperature increase and a magnitude of shear rate was observed. The second objective of this study was to develop a <b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant</b> that had the same average properties than that found for the retrieved joint fluid. A mixture of three different chemicals, namely Poloxamer 188, Xanthan Gum and Lube Boosterâ II was used to map the viscous and lubricative properties of the joint fluid. A comparative test using the <b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant</b> and bovine serum was performed in a custom-built simulator. Wear debris was sampled at 500 000 cycle intervals up to 4 500 000 cycles. During these intervals the bovine serum stations were drained and washed with deionised water, but not stripped and weighed as specified in the ISO standard. This was done intentionally to preserve the wear pattern during the entire test. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant</b> stations were not stripped or drained during these intervals. This ensured that the wear pattern was maintained and that the effect of accumulative wear could be investigated throughout the duration of the test. The wear debris from the test was then compared to wear debris retrieved from scar tissue of revision patients. The wear debris that was found in the scar tissue retrieved from patients was similar in shape and size to that which was found in the simulator using bovine serum and the <b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant.</b> It can thus be concluded that an acceptable lubricant had been developed to replace the current test medium in the simulators.

40|$|The {{integrated}} use of low-value hydrocarbons {{from the}} refining {{of crude oil}} under Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) conditions can satisfy the demands of heat and steam of the refining process itself {{while at the same}} time reducing CO 2 emissions up to 50 % in oil refineries. This work evaluated the use of three different fossil liquid fuels, i. e., diesel, mineral lubricant oil and <b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant</b> oil in a 1 kWth CLC continuous unit working with a Fe-based oxygen carrier prepared by impregnation method. The effect of key parameters of the CLC process behavior was studied with the same batch of oxygen carrier particles for a total of 150 operation hours. With regard to the results obtained, every fuel tested was able to achieve 90 % combustion efficiency being <b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant</b> oil the most reactive fuel studied. Hydrocarbon reactivity seems to depend on the nature of the chemical bonds, being higher for alkenes (<b>synthetic</b> <b>lubricant</b> oil) than for alkanes (diesel and mineral lubricant oil). CH 4 was revealed as a relatively stable intermediate combustion product for these liquid fuels. Therefore, oxygen carrier’s reactivity towards this gas becomes crucial for the overall conversion. The characterization carried out to the oxygen carrier after operation revealed no evidence of changes derived from the sulphur or impurities present in the fuel. Therefore, the Fe-based material herein used seems to be suitable for conversion of fossil liquid fuels.

Sediment from an uncontaminated site was collected, spiked {{with one of the}} oils and deployed in O'Brien Bay, East Antarctica. Sediment samples were then collected over 5 yr. All the oils caused changes in the microbial community in the top 1 cm of sediment, as determined by 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The greatest effect was observed in the SAB diesel treatment. The biodegradable oil did not {{have a significant effect on}} the communities initially, but the communities present at 2 and 5 yr were significantly different to the controls.
