Coppice-working almost died out, though a few men continued in the woods. A small, and growing, number of people make a living wholly or partly by working coppices in the area today.|$|E
50|$|A {{regeneration}} method which {{depends on}} the sprouting of cut trees. Most hardwoods, the coast redwood, and certain pines naturally sprout from stumps and can be managed through coppicing. Coppicing is generally used to produce fuelwood, pulpwood, and other products dependent on small trees. A close relative of coppicing is pollarding. Three systems of coppice woodland management are generally recognized: <b>simple</b> <b>coppice,</b> coppice with standards, and the coppice selection system.|$|E

The study {{is based on}} the data obtained from two non-replicated research blocks located at Butwal and Dharan, which were established in 1988 and 1989 respectively by the Department of Forest Research and Survey. Out of four blocks in each site, one block was of <b>simple</b> <b>coppice</b> management option. <b>Simple</b> <b>coppice</b> management option had four treatments, i. e. 1) 3 s/s, 2) 1 s/s, 3) 3 - 2 - 1 s/s, and 4) Control, which were designed for fodder and fuelwood production [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The soil {{seed bank}} plays a fundamentalin forest regeneration. In this paper {{we report on}} the effects of a {{coppicing}} a 60 years old chestnut stand on the seed bank. The results confirm that the regeneration of chestnut coppice can be achieved through a <b>simple</b> <b>coppicing,</b> using both the resprouting capacity of the chestnut stools and the germination capacity of the chestnut fruits. In case of species displaying an annual irregulariti in seed production as oaks, the cut should take place following a mast year. Following this findings, the opportunity of a systematic standard for seed production in a coppiced chestnut stand could be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Standards in {{chestnut}} coppice system: {{cultural heritage}} or coltural requirement? This paper aims at evaluating {{the role of}} standards in chestnut coppices from a biological and functional perspective. In addition to {{a detailed analysis of}} Italian regulations on the issue, the technical definition of the term is analysed: (i) as for the functional role of standards; (ii) to assess whether the required functions are technically necessary and are being actually performed. In this contex, the results of an experimental trial are reported. The goal of the trial were to assess the shoots’ parameters, the stand productivity, the dynamics of canopy cover in coppices with or without standards. In 2001, at harvesting operations in a coppice aged 30 with standards managed by the local community, two experimental plots 2500 m 2 each were established. The two theses being compared were: <b>simple</b> <b>coppice</b> and coppixce with standards (100 standards per hectare). The released standards were qualified immediately after final harvesting. Sprouting ability, growth pattern and stool vitality were surveyed in March 2004 (at age 2), in May 2008 (at age 6) and in April 2010 (at age 8). First results highlighted the evidence of statistically {{significant differences between the two}} thesis. The high number of standards effected negatively both vitality and growth pattern of the stools. <b>Simple</b> <b>coppice</b> recorded a lower shoot mortality, a higher diametrical growth and canopy cover degree as well; the heigth growth was, on the opposite, significantly lower. These results, although referred to a limited lifespan (1 / 3 of the rotation time) and to one site only, underline productive, ecological and environmental benefits and as a consequence suggest the widening of the experimental network and the development of new, more relevant and consistent rules, making acceptable the <b>simple</b> <b>coppice</b> as a possible silvicultural choice to be applied to chestnut coppices...|$|E
40|$|In {{the forest}} area of Tlemcen, green oak on its large expanse is abundantly {{represented}} in two forms: <b>simple</b> <b>coppice</b> and trees on stump. This study, try {{to verify the}} effect of the silvicultural treatments and exposure on leaf morphology. To this end, we tested this hypothesis on 240 mature leaves of these two populations collected from the four cardinal directions. The results show that the length of midrib is 4. 85 cm in the case of high trees, 4. 80 cm in the coppices. The surface of leaf-blade is 8. 87 cm 2 in the high trees and 8. 35 cm 2 in coppices. Angle of insertion of the secondary rib with the main rib is 122. 86 ° in the case of high trees, 121. 22 ° in the coppices. Variance analysis indicates that there is no effect of the silvicultural treatments and exposure on leaves morphological parameters...|$|E
40|$|Conventional clear-felling and {{replanting}} {{is increasingly}} being recognised as inappropriate for those broadleaved woodlands {{which have a}} high value for landscape, amenity and for nature conservation. This prompted an investigation into 'non-plantation', 'uneven-aged' and 'irregular' silvicultural systems, which are, or could be, used in Britain. A new classification of such systems is proposed, with an initial division into coppice and high forest systems. The latter is then subdivided into 'clear-fell', 'shelterwood', and 'selection' systems. 'Group' and 'strip' variants {{of each of these}} three can then be identified. All systems can use planting, natural regeneration or a combination. For each system the following is presented: i) a description based on European use, ii) an account of British examples, iii) discussion of techniques, iv) analysis of profitability, v) evaluation of benefits for landscape, amenity and conservation. No really convincing examples of selection and shelterwood systems could be found in Britain, but some efficient group shelterwood and group selection systems exist. The failure of natural regeneration should be tackled by concentrating on prolific-seeding species such as ash and sycamore rather than oak and beech, and by more thorough preparation for good seed years especially by cultivation and careful management of overstorey density. Although establishment costs for shelterwood systems were lower than for clear-fell, the overall profitability for oak was similar. The Net Present Values of some 'low-input' options, such as <b>simple</b> <b>coppice,</b> were surprisingly high. Most profitable of all was an ash/sycamore shelterwood system. For landscape and conservation, coppice, or group systems using natural regeneration, are probably the most beneficial. A uniform shelterwood system can be as undesirable as a clear-fell and replant operation if very intensively managed. The establishment of long-term trials of the various systems is recommended, and more information is needed on the effect of degrees of canopy shading on weed and seedling growth. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to make a}} {{diagnosis}} of the forests planted in the basin of ‘Pardo’ river (Rio Pardo), in RS state, by contemplating the characterization of properties, of forestations, and of the availability and consumption of wood in the region. The area of reach {{of the study is}} in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul state, which main economy is the tobacco crop, enclosing 13 cities that compose the performance area of the Management Committee of Rio Pardo Hydrographic Basin. The data collect were conducted during year 2008. In order to determine the size of the sample, it was made a sampling with its probability proportional to the size, where the criterion of the sample unity distribution took in consideration the numbers of trees per city and, inside the cities, the number of trees per class of property size. The sampling method utilized on the forest inventory was by Prodan, in addition to interviews taken with the producers The region is characterized by small agricultural producers, and 61. 4 % of the firewood used in the cure of tobacco leaves is acquired from others, moreover, the majority of the forestation possess reduced spacing (2. 26 m²/plant) and low survival indices, in order of the 34. 4 % after 7 years of the plantation. The wooden current supply is of 2, 781. 069 m³, what guarantees a supplying for only 3. 5 years. The collected data allow to evidence that the resources necessary to invest in the self-sufficiency of firewood for the crop tobacco, are of R$ 12, 250, 000, 00, that could be placed annually, during seven years, equivalent the rotation in <b>simple</b> <b>coppice,</b> resulting in an area of 80 ha/year/city...|$|E
40|$|The forest {{resource}} {{of the middle}} hills and factors (related to ecology, demand and implementation) which affect the choice of silvicultural options for it are given to provide a context for {{the description of the}} trials set up to date as part of the management research programme of the Nepal-UK Silvicultural Research Project. The procedures for the research in Schima Castanopsis forest are given. Results of the initial measurement of the standing crop, its treatment and in one case its remeasurement are given. Silvicultural options examined were <b>simple</b> <b>coppice,</b> coppice-with-standards (one of 40 % crown cover of standards, another of 70 % crown cover of standards) and high forest. Initial estimates of productivity in these unmanaged forests (see Chapter 5 for description) are as follows: In Nagarkot the wood dry mean annual increment (MAl) was 4. 9 t/ha/yr at 5 years. Standing foliage biomass was 2. 7 t/ha. In Aushadi the wood dry MAl was 6. 5 t/ha/yr a 9 years with 7. 5 t/ha standing foliage biomass. It must be stressed that these results are first estimates of yields from particular sites. However in the virtual absence of yield data for the broadleaf forests in the middle hills they may provide a useful indication of potential yields. Some 50 - 60 % of trees in these forests were identified as of fodder value although in a 2 -year old forest at Khalti this fell to 30 - 35 % due to the presence of non-fodder pioneer species. Management shows potential for increasing and improving fodder production, improving access and allowing the selection of species for end use but only limited information on the quantity and distribution of yield is available at this early stage. It is concluded that given adequate protection the trials can provide important information on the effects of the different silvicultural options on the quantity and distribution of forest produce which will be of practical benefit to the forest manager. </p...|$|E
