60|$|The causes which bring {{money into}} or {{carry it out}} of a country (1) through the exchanges, to restore the {{equilibrium}} of trade, and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others, are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend, if it were never imported except (2) as a merchandise, and never except directly from the mines. When the value of money in a country is permanently lowered (1) [as a medium of exchange] by an influx of it through the balance of trade, the cause, if it is not diminished cost of production, must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment, more favorable to the country, of the equation of international demand—namely, either an increased demand abroad for her commodities, or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries. Now, an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country, or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities, are the very causes which, on the general principles of trade, enable a country to purchase all imports, and consequently (2) the precious metals, at a lower value. There is, therefore, no contradiction, but the most perfect accordance, in the results of the two different modes [(1) as a medium of exchange; and (2) as merchandise] in which the precious metals may be obtained. When money [as a medium of exchange] flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities, and by so doing alters its own local value, it merely realizes, by a more rapid process, the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals [as merchandise] flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries. As, therefore, we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things, either in the same country or internationally, depend, so neither does it alter the law {{of the value of the}} precious metals itself; and there is in the whole doctrine of international values, as now laid down, a unity and harmony which are a <b>strong</b> <b>collateral</b> presumption of truth.|$|E

Although the economy has traditionally been bank-dominated, banks have preferred to lend to large firms with <b>strong</b> <b>collateral</b> (land and real estate) rather than to individuals or smaller firms. Banks' underdeveloped credit risk assessment techniques also restricted their entry into consumer and small business financing. Thus, where consumer borrowing from a bank is considered shameful and often requires a guarantor, sarakin loans can be as little as $100, borrowers need identification but not collateral, and transactions at kiosks akin to automated teller machines take just a few minutes. Loan rates used to be as high as 29.2%, substantial given that official interest rates are near zero. After an outcry at the high levels of debt and the repayment tactics, a law in 2006 capped interest rates at 20% by 2010, and regulated collection methods.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{economic}} principles underlying {{the relationship between}} the real sector (non-financial) and the banking sector structures. Most literature has so far focused on the structure of conglomerates (Keiretsu/Chaebol) in East Asia in explaining the fast economic growth and/or recent crisis in the region. Traditionally, the strong vertical relationship between core companies and their subsidiaries in the real sector was believed to be a driving force for the economic success in the region. However, the degree of vertical relationship varies depending upon macroeconomic fluctuations and subsequently affects their relationship banks. The paper analyses the information sharing in a bilateral oligopoly framework. When banks prefer <b>strong</b> <b>collaterals</b> and/or credible third party repayment guarantees, a weaker vertical relationship in the real sector should lead to a consolidation in the banking sector via mergers or exits.

40|$|This article proposes an {{explanation}} of the structures of external financing by analysing the consequences of a leasing decision for unsecured creditors. A leasing decision generates two effects: the appearance of an agency cost related to the retrogradation of the existing banking claims and a reduction in the agency cost of debt related to the asset substitution problem. In opposition to a lessor, the banking creditor bears the agency cost that it passes on to the firm and its shareholders by an increase in the debtor rate or <b>stronger</b> <b>collateral.</b> The presence of excessive agency costs can however lead the creditor to ration the firm, and consequently constrains firms in their choice of external financing. Therefore, we can expect to observe quite marked ex ternal financing policies. The empirical study carried out on a sample of 817 Belgian companies shows two results: the companies seem to privilege rather typified financing policies: weak or significant recourse to leasing. Few companies in the sample have balanced structures. In the same way, the amplitude of the agency costs of leasing is reflected in the interest rate and the amount of collateral required...|$|R

40|$|Many {{operations}} {{have been devised}} to correct paralytic drop foot but none has proved reliable. The two most commonly used today are Lambrinudi’s (1927) arthrodesis and the posterior bone block devised by Campbell (1923).

40|$|During {{the last}} {{financial}} crisis, {{what should the}} Federal Reserve (the Fed) have done when lenders stopped making loans, even to borrowers with sterling credit and <b>strong</b> <b>collateral?</b> Because the central bank is the last resort for funding, the conventional answer had been to lend freely at a penalty rate against good collateral, as Walter Bagehot suggested in 1873 about the Bank of England. Acting thus as a lender of last resort, the central bank will keep solvent banks liquid but let insolvent banks go out of business, as they should. The Fed tried this, but when the conventional wisdom did not work, it provided liquidity to new products and firms using authority enacted during the Great Depression to deal with financial emergencies—section 13 (3) of the Federal Reserve Act (the Act). This Article focuses on the historical, legal, and policy justifications for the Fed’s actions and concludes that the Fed’s actions were readily defensible on several grounds. First, the Fed’s recent efforts were just the latest expression of the Fed’s open-ended authority to trade financial products for its own account, especially during credit emergencies. Second, the policy rationale for these efforts is that credit market dynamics had become influenced by a “shadow banking” sector that a traditional lender of last resort could not reach. To influence the contemporary version of the traditional credit function—borrowing short to lend long term—the Fed would have to expand its emergency liquidity facilities. Finally, the Fed’s market making is congruent with the Fed’s century-old symbiotic relationship with banks, so we should reconsider our naiveté about what {{has long been a}} corporatist relationship...|$|E
40|$|The nano-structuring of {{transparent}} {{media with}} subpicosecond laser pulses has attracted significant interest {{due to its}} unique applications. In contrast to nanosecond pulses where the energy introduced to the lattice is absorbed, leading to melting/boiling of the material around the focal volume, femtosecond lasers can alter material properties of the glass at high pressures without excessive production of heat, modifying the structures with sub-micron resolution. Permanent modifications can then be induced without <b>strong</b> <b>collateral</b> damage. Although femtosecond pulses are beneficial for material processing, short pulse durations and broad spectral bandwidths require a novel approach to femtosecond pulse control. It {{is well known that}} laser induced modification depends on fluence, wavelength and polarization. Another dependence of material modification is the spatio-temporal properties of the ultrashort pulse. These spatio-temporal couplings give rise to intrinsic nonlinear optical phenomena, which are well known in experiment but otherwise lack a clear explanation. While the formation mechanisms with respect to the nano-structuring of transparent media is still under debate, {{a better understanding of the}} nonlinear optical phenomena that affects the formation would provide insight into the physics of ultrafast light-matter interaction. In this thesis, the origin and thorough investigation of spatio-temporal induced phenomena are reported. By controlling the spatio-temporal couplings separately, I demonstrate complete control of all of the dependencies with the use of prism compressors and grating compressors and discuss the intricacies behind the control of the spatio-temporal couplings with complete characterization of the pulse. By investigating two of the main phenomena associated with spatio-temporal couplings, which give rise to a directional dependence when writing in the bulk (“quill-writing effect”) and a photosensitive anisotropy (“blade effect”), a more thorough understanding of the light-matter interaction is demonstrated and reported. I demonstrate that spatio-temporal couplings are inherent for all ultrafast laser systems with chirped-pulse amplification and result in a strongly anisotropic light-matter interaction. I identify angular dispersion in the focus as the main cause for the anisotropic photosensitivity coming from the spatially chirped pulse, which shows to yield a 200 % increase in modification strength. With tighter focusing (NA ≥ ~ 0. 4), this non-paraxial effect leads to a more apparent manifestation of spatio-temporal couplings in photo-induced modification. I control the anisotropy and exploited it as a new degree of freedom in tailoring laser induced modification in transparent material. A non-paraxial field structure analysis near the focus is conducted, with an elliptical optical beam, to provide insight on the origin of the photosensitive anisotropy. After a complete identification of the spatio-temporal properties of the electric field, the quill-effect was confirmed to be due to pulse front tilt in the focus with a direct comparison with other major spatio-temporal couplings including wavefront rotation. I reveal that the non-reciprocity during femtosecond laser writing in transparent media induces either an isotropic damage-like structure or a self-assembled nanostructure depending on the movement direction of the beam - known as the “quill-writing effect. ” I also identify the switching of the modification regime from the formation of isotropic damage-like to anisotropic grating-like structures observed when the translation of the beam is in the direction of the tilt and is qualitatively described in terms of the first-order phase transition in the irradiated volume of a transparent dielectric. The structural evolution from void modification to self-assembled nanogratings in fused silica for moderate (NA > 0. 4) focusing conditions is also discussed in this thesis. Void formation appears before the geometrical focus after the initial few pulses with nanogratings gradually occurring at the top of the induced structures after subsequent irradiation. Nonlinear Schrödinger equation-based simulations are conducted to simulate the laser fluence, intensity and electron concentration in the regions of modification. Comparing the experiment with simulations, the voids form due to cavitation in the regions where electron concentration exceeds 10 20 cm - 3 but remains below critical. In this scenario, the energy absorption is insufficient to reach the critical electron concentration that was once assumed to occur in the regime of void formation and nanogratings, shedding light on the potential formation mechanism of nanogratings. In-situ observations of harmonic generation during the ultrafast laser writing is presented to better understand the underlying physics that occur during the process of nanograting formation. Second and third harmonic generation is observed, with third harmonic distributed as two lobes following the polarization orientation of the electric field, identified as Cherenkov Third Harmonic. These harmonics are observed and correlated with the different regimes of material modification to understand whether they are part of the nanograting formation or corollary to give insight on the formation mechanisms of the self-assembled nanostructures. Finally, I discuss the work on the concept of an on-axial simultaneous spatio-temporal focusing with the use of a simple polarization dependent circular grating for the purpose of material modification using the expertise of the group on polarization gratings. The design and theoretical validation of the technique is reported in this thesis with the potential of further work in perfecting it for material modification and chirped-pulse amplification applications. </p...|$|E

At the same time it went about boosting homeownership by selling public housing at deeply discounted prices, without knowing that this would immediately reduce the flow of funds from the richer public housing tenants into the housing market. The result was a collapse in property prices that amounted to several years of Hong Kong’s GDP.

Unilateral hindlimb ischemia was surgically induced in BALB/c nude mice, and cells were transplanted into the thigh muscles. All effects were assessed at four weeks. ResultsThe messenger ribonucleic acid expression and protein production of hHGF were confirmed. Assay of growth inhibition by ganciclovir revealed that the 50 % (median) inhibitory concentration of 50 at first mention (50 % “I?” concentration) > NIH 3 T 3 + hHGF + TK was 1, 000 times lower than that of NIH 3 T 3 + hHGF.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} understand the relationships between monetary policy, housing markets, and household consumption behavior. The three chapters establish a causal relationship between these variables using disaggregated data and discuss potential aggregate effects and policy implications. The study first develops an housing model with heterogeneous construction costs to analyze price and construction dynamics following a shock to interest rates. Land-constrained areas exhibit larger price and small construction responses relative to unconstrained areas where new homes can be built cheaply. Using an MSAlevel panel linked to land availability and zoning regulations data, these results are largely confirmed empirically. This result forms the basis for identifying the marginal propensity to consume out of housing. Following a shock to interest rates, homeowner consumption responses are compared between land constrained with house price gains to unconstrained areas with little price growth. Under the assumption that land availability and zoning regulations do not affect consumption responses directly, this identifies the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of housing. Results from two household panels linked to non-public geographic identifiers are presented. Identified responses show homeowners exhibit an MPC of 0. 04 - 0. 06 out of home equity with little response for renters. These MPCs fall over the life-cycle with MPCs as high as 0. 08 for those under 40 and 0. 04 for those at retirement. Furthermore, credit constrained households exhibit larger MPCs with negligible effects on those with high liquidity or low leverage. These results are indicative of a <b>strong</b> role for <b>collateral</b> effects rather than wealth effects in driving the consumption response to housing. The study also shows that these effects result in an quantitatively important “homeowner balance sheet channel” for monetary policy. Loose money causes higher demand for housing, raising house values in inelastic-supply cities. This loosens credit constraints for homeowners in those cities, stimulating consumption.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we use {{computational}} neural network models {{to examine the}} dynamics and functionality of the CA 3 region of the mammalian hippocampus. The emphasis of the project is to investigate how the dynamic control structures provided by inhibitory circuitry and cellular modification may effect the CA 3 region during the recall of previously stored information. The CA 3 region is commonly thought {{to work as a}} recurrent auto-associative neural network due to the neurophysiological characteristics found, such as, recurrent <b>collaterals,</b> <b>strong</b> and sparse synapses from external inputs and plasticity between coactive cells. Associative memory models have been developed using various configurations of mathematical artificial neural networks which were first developed over 40 years ago. Within these models we can store information via changes in the strength of connections between simplified model neurons (two-state). These memories can be recalled when a cue (noisy or partial) is instantiated upon the net. The type of information they can store is quite limited due to restrictions caused by the simplicity of the hard-limiting nodes which are commonly associated with a binary activation threshold. We build a much more biologically plausible model with complex spiking cell models and with realistic synaptic properties between cells. This model is based upon some of the many details we now know of the neuronal circuitry of the CA 3 region. We implemented the model in computer software using Neuron and Matlab and tested it by running simulations of storage and recall in the network. By building this model we gain new insights into how different types of neurons, and the complex circuits they form, actually work. The mammalian brain consists of complex resistive-capacative electrical circuitry which is formed by the interconnection of large numbers of neurons. A principal cell type is the pyramidal cell within the cortex, which is the main information processor in our neural networks. Pyramidal cells are surrounded by diverse populations of interneurons which have proportionally smaller numbers compared to the pyramidal cells and these form connections with pyramidal cells and other inhibitory cells. By building detailed computational models of recurrent neural circuitry we explore how these microcircuits of interneurons control the flow of information through pyramidal cells and regulate the efficacy of the network. We also explore the effect of cellular modification due to neuronal activity and the effect of incorporating spatially dependent connectivity on the network during recall of previously stored information. In particular we implement a spiking neural network proposed by Sommer and Wennekers (2001). We consider methods for improving associative memory recall using methods inspired by the work by Graham and Willshaw (1995) where they apply mathematical transforms to an artificial neural network to improve the recall quality within the network.

40|$|Extracellular {{electrophysiological}} {{recordings of}} the hippocampus were carried out in freely moving Long-Evans rats. Large-scale and high-density electrodes were used to target all subregions simultaneously. We were able to record both local field potentials (LFPs) and single unit activity, which allowed {{for the analysis of}} population activity and individual cells, respectively. We recorded the animals while they performed spatial navigational tasks and during sleep in their home cages. We focused our investigations on the information processing of the hippocampus during its two main general functions: spatial navigation and memory consolidation. In particular, two main questions were addressed in this work:How the different subregions of the hippocampus contribute to spatial coding within the hippocampus. How the distinct subregions of the hippocampus coordinate to generate sharp-wave ripples complexes, known to be essential in memory consolidation To investigate the contribution of the different subregions of the hippocampus to spatial coding, we recorded simultaneously place cells (neurons which selectively respond to crossing locations in the environment) from CA 1, CA 2 and CA 3 during spatial navigation. We analized the fine function of the distinct anatomical portions of these areas separating CA 1 into proximal, intermediate and distal and CA 3 into CA 3 c, CA 3 b and CA 3 a subregions. We could also record neurons located at several depths of the soma layers so we treated the deep (toward stratum oriens) and the superficially (toward stratum radiatum) located cells inthe CA 1, CA 2 and CA 3 regions separately. We analyzed the distinct properties of the place cells located in the different subregions and found significant differences which characterize the spatial coding in these parts and correlate with the anatomy. The CA 1 and CA 2 regions in general had a higher number of place cells than the CA 3 region. Furthermore, more fields per cell were found in CA 1 neurons and CA 2 compared to their CA 3 peers. Firing rates inside the fields and peak firing rates were also higher for CA 1 and CA 2. The more spatially informative place cells were the ones located in CA 3, and the less informative the CA 2 ones. Inside the different subregions, CA 1 proximal cells appeared 43 to be more spatially informative, showed higher firing rates in-field and a tended to have one single place field whereas toward CA 1 distal they fired less, had more place fields and contained less spatial information. For the CA 3 region, more spatially informative and selective place cells were located in CA 3 c, with preferentially single fields but lower firing rates than in their CA 3 a peers. No significant differences were found within the cells located at different depths in the CA 3 area, whereas in CA 1 and CA 2 a tendency characterized the deep cells with more number of place cells, higher in-field firing rates but less selective and spatially informative than their superficial peers. These findings are in correlation with the axonal distribution of the different afferents to the hippocampus, mainly from the entorhinal cortex. The medial part of the entorhinal cortex (where the highly spatially selective grid cells are located) is preferentially connected with the proximal CA 1 (more spatial selectivity than the distal part) and the lateral portion of the entorhinal cortex (where mainly object and environmental cues coding cells are located) mainly target the distal part of CA 1 (more place fields per cell and less spatially informative). Unlike the CA 1, cells in the CA 3 region have <b>strong</b> recurrent <b>collaterals,</b> which can account for the lower number and highly spatially selective place cells in this region. The least informative cells during spatial navigation were the ones located in CA 2, which is in line with the discovery of a specific network which code for space during immobility inside this region. The phase precession was weaker in place cells from the CA 2 region, which can be also explained by the distinct combination of inputs arriving to this part of the hippocampus. The theta phase locking of the different subregions also correlates with anatomical inputs. While a relatively preserved phase preference was found in CA 1 cells from all subregions during RUN (ascending phase of the cycle), a gradual shift was notable from the CA 2 -CA 3 a border (ascending phase) toward the CA 3 c (descending phase). During REM, an important percentage of cells shift their firing with 180 º in the CA 1 region, {{but this is not the}} case for the cells located in CA 2 or CA 3 regions. Therefore, this is assumed to be related to the specific entorhinal layer III input to the CA 1 region. To investigate the generation and propagation of sharp-wave-ripple (SPW-Rs) complexes we detected these population events in all hippocampal regions (CA 1, CA 2 and CA 3). We found that ripples detected in the different subregions can generate different current source density (CSD) and local field potentials (LFP) patterns in the CA 1 region. The 44 CA 3 initiated events gave rise to characteristic CSD pattern with a sink in stratum radiatum (due to the input from the Schaffer collaterals axons into the CA 1 population) and two sources surrounding it (output of currents through the soma and lacunosum-moleculare layer). In the LFP this is visible as a slow negative sharp-wave in the stratum radiatum of CA 1 and the high frequency oscillation (‘ripple’, 150 - 240 Hz) generated by the synchronization of the pyramidal-interneurons spiking activity. However, the CA 2 initiated events generate an additional CSD-LFP pattern characterized by a sink with the corresponding slow wave in the stratum oriens of CA 1, confirming the direct transmission of information from CA 2 to CA 1. This later pattern was found to be dominant during awake states, supporting the specific role of the CA 2 region during awake immobility. We then examined the contribution of single pyramidal cells to SPW-Rs detected in CA 1. We found that although the vast majority of pyramidal neurons located in CA 1 and CA 3 respond with an excitation (increasing their firing rate) to SPW-Rs, in the CA 2 region two equally large subpopulations exist. One showed positive (phasic cells) and the other one showed negative modulation during ripples (ripple-ramping cells, decreasing their firing rate). We also found that the ripple-ramping cell population shows a preceding slow excitation prior to inhibition that coincides with SPW-R events. This pattern is followed by the phasic neurons (also in the CA 2 region) and then by the propagation to the CA 3 a, CA 3 b, CA 3 c, and finally CA 1 population of cells. We then detected ripples in the CA 2 region and study again the firing dynamics of all pyramidal subpopulations. We found that the two subpopulations distinguished in the CA 2 region, ramping and phasic cells, identically increased their firing rates during local ripples. The first population in the temporal sequence of response was still the CA 2 ramping cells group, followed by the CA 2 phasic, and then CA 3 subregions and CA 1. These results prompt to the CA 2 region as a potential trigger of SPW-Rs in the hippocampus. The SPW-Rs events show a very clear increase in power of the corresponding frequency band (150 - 240 Hz) in the LFP. We tested the spatio-temporal response of the distinct subregions during SPW-Rs in the time-frequency domain. The CA 2 region increased the ripple-band frequency power earlier than any other, followed by CA 3 and CA 1. We concluded then that the first region becoming active before SPW-Rs events was the CA 2 particularly, ripple-ramping neurons, which then became silent when the ripples reached the 45 CA 1 region. The next group of cells becoming active was the CA 2 phasic neurons group, followed by the CA 3 a, CA 3 b, CA 3 c and finally the CA 1 neurons. These results show a clear pattern of propagation of local excitation in time, from CA 2 to CA 3 and to CA 1, which correlate with the known anatomy. This was observed during both states, SLEEP and WAKE. However, during the WAKE state the onset of the CA 2 subpopulations was even earlier than the SPW-R triggers in CA 1. Also, during WAKE state but not running periods, CA 2 pyramidal neurons showed a very high firing rate. These results together with the earlier timing during WAKE state can be related with the specific network which code for immobility, recently found to be located in the CA 2 region. Different functional characteristics were already attributed to the CA 1 cells located in deep and in superficial layers. Then, we investigated whether the two functional subpopulations we found in the CA 2 have also distinct anatomical locations. We found that deep CA 2 pyramidal neurons and superficial CA 2 pyramidal neurons correlate with the firing dynamics of the CA 2 ripple-ramping and CA 2 phasic groups, respectively. We show a significant segregation of the location of the ramping cells toward deep layers and the phasic cells toward superficial layers of the immunolabeled CA 2 region. This anatomical segregation of the two different types of cells together with the role of CA 2 during SPW-Rs could be explained by the unique anatomical wiring of this region compared to the neighboring areas, CA 1 and CA 3. ...|$|R
