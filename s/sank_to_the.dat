5|$|Every planet {{began its}} {{existence}} {{in an entirely}} fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts, but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel, and mantles of silicates. Jupiter and Saturn {{are believed to have}} cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen. Uranus and Neptune, which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water, ammonia, methane and other ices. The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The Illinois Freedom Bell {{is located}} in Mount Morris, Illinois, United States, and is the {{official}} freedom bell of the U.S. state of Illinois. The bell was created for a church in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin as {{a replica of the}} Liberty Bell in 1862. In 1910, while it was being moved across the frozen Geneva Lake following a fire at the church, the ice cracked and the bell <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the lake. It was salvaged in 1960 and the village of Mount Morris acquired it in 1966. The Illinois Freedom Bell is rung during the annual Let Freedom Ring festival, and it can be found beneath a gazebo on the village square. The bell has been credited with starting an Independence Day bell-ringing tradition across the United States. The bell was designated the official Illinois Freedom Bell in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The two Football League {{clubs are}} Bristol City and Bristol Roversthe former {{being the only}} club from the city {{to play in the}} {{precursor}} to the Premier League. Non-league clubs include Bristol Manor Farm, Hengrove Athletic and Brislington. Bristol City, formed in 1897, were Division One runners-up in 1907 and lost the FA Cup final in 1909. In the First Division in 1976, they then <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom professional tier before reforming after a 1982 bankruptcy. Bristol City were promoted to the second tier of English football in 2007, losing to Hull City in the playoff for promotion to the Premier League that season.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{problem of}} {{congestion}} in sensor networks is {{significantly different from}} conventional ad-hoc networks {{and has not been}} studied to any great extent thus far. In this paper, we focus on providing congestion control from <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sensors in a sensor field. We identify the different reasons for congestion from <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sensors and show the uniqueness of the problem in sensor network environments. We propose a scalable, distributed approach that addresses congestion from <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sensors in a sensor network. Through ns 2 based simulations, we evaluate the proposed framework, and show that it performs significantly better over a basic approach which does not provide any congestion control. I...|$|R

5|$|The bay {{has been}} {{strategically}} {{important for the}} military. General Zachary Taylor stationed his men on Rincon Point during the Mexican-American War, and a Union invasion was halted by Confederates on the same point in 1862, during the American Civil War. The Port of Corpus Christi {{was used by the}} Confederates to bring in supplies during the war effort until the Union bombarded Corpus Christi and occupied the bay and port from 1863 to 1870. In 1940, the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi was established on the bay, and by 1944 had transformed into a major base with one main air station and six additional stations. Notably, during a March 1960 practice run from the base, future Senator John McCain lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom. He squeezed out of the cockpit, swam ten feet to the surface, and was carried to safety by a rescue helicopter, therefore escaping without major injuries.|$|E
5|$|The entire opening {{sequence}} of the film was shot in Bulgaria during the winter, but was meant {{to take place in}} tropical South Asia. Digital effects were used to remove the snow and deciduous trees present and replace them with tropical flora. The alterations required over 340 shots alone. The scene was further complicated by Jet Li's scheduling conflict, which meant the interior sets had to be shipped to Hong Kong, reassembled and shot with him there, and the exterior sets had to be digitally built and then merged with footage of Li shot on Chroma key. A fish tank in the opening was filled with digital eels based on South Asian river eels, but increased in size by three times, after the real fish died and <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom. The finale in the airport was another complex digital environment, shot in three entirely differently locations in two seasons, which were then merged to create one seamless location. When the trucks break through glass to exit the airport, the scene is entirely digital and was filmed on Chroma screens in the middle of Sofia. Numerous digital matte paintings were used to modify the winter Bulgarian terrain in different scenes to represent its intended location.|$|E

25|$|The bridge's {{two towers}} were built by {{floating}} two caissons, giant upside-down boxes made of southern yellow pine, {{in the span}} of the East River, and then beginning to build the stone towers on top of them until they <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the river. Compressed air was pumped into the caissons, and workers entered the space to dig the sediment, until the caissons <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bedrock. The whole weight of the bridge still sits upon a 15-foot thickness of southern yellow pine wood under the sediment.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} heavily damaged by bombs, torpedoes and {{resulting}} explosions and fires, but the crew prevented her from capsizing by counter-flooding {{a number of}} compartments.

25|$|An {{automatic}} system was fitted which filled {{part of the}} fuel tanks with seawater {{to compensate for the}} consumption of fuel and resulting rise in the center of gravity and hence loss of stability.

25|$|The ammonites {{that form}} ammolite {{inhabited}} a prehistoric, inland subtropical sea that bordered the Rocky Mountains—this area is {{known today as}} the Cretaceous or Western Interior Seaway. As the ammonites died, they <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom and were buried by layers of bentonitic mud that eventually became shale. Many gem-quality ammonites are found within siderite concretions. These sediments preserved the aragonite of the shells, preventing it from converting to calcite.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the sale}} to Independent Continental Lines, the Europa was renamed Columbus C., painted in Costa Cruises colours {{and set in}} cruise traffic. Her career with Costa was short however, as on 29 July 1984 the Columbus C. accidentally rammed a {{breakwater}} near Cadiz, Spain. Her keel was badly damaged in the collision, but the ship managed to reach the port of Cadiz under her own power. Her passengers and crew were evacuated, but the ship continued sinking, listing to starboard side. She eventually <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the shallow harbour, remaining only partially submerged.|$|E
25|$|The freshly arrived Marines were {{assigned}} to provide land defense for Subic Bay. Seaward defenses included the batteries at Fort Wint on Grande Island and a minefield, which had been laid off the entrance to Subic Harbor. As the Marines built beach defenses, Consolidated PBY-4 Catalinas from VP-101 & VP-102 of Patrol Wing 10, which was stationed at Subic Bay, were conducting daily patrols off Luzon {{as a response to}} rumors that the Japanese were approaching the Philippines. On December 11, seven Catalinas had just returned from patrol when Japanese Zeroes appeared and strafed the aircraft. One ensign was killed and all Catalinas <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of Subic Bay's inner basin.|$|E

The keys for the ship's {{magazine}} had been taken ashore and no lookouts had been posted. Cherkassov could only watch in helpless horror from the Eastern & Oriental Hotel as his ship <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the Straits. He was court-martialled for negligence and sentenced to 3½ years in prison, reduction in rank and expelled from the navy. His deputy, Lt. Kulibin, was sentenced to 1½ years in prison. However, Tsar Nicholas II changed both sentences; they were sent to the front as ordinary seamen. Both men later distinguished themselves in combat and were decorated with the Cross of St. George.|$|E

25|$|After {{the gold}} rush the A. J. Goddard spent much of its time in the towing {{business}} on Lake Laberge. In 1899 the company behind her was sold to a competitor, the Canadian Development Company, which appears to have confined the vessel’s service between Whitehorse and {{the foot of the}} Thirty Mile River. On October 11, the A. J. Goddard entered Lake Laberge with a large barge in tow. Here she sank during a storm. The little ship was blasted with freezing rain and snow and pounded by waves. Despite the crew’s efforts, she began to take on water, which extinguished the boiler fires and left the ship without power. She <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lake bottom only a few hundred metres from shore. Three of the crew, Charles MacDonald, Fay Ransom and John Thompson, drowned while two were rescued by a local trapper in a rowboat.|$|E
25|$|Digital reconstructions of Ida's teeth {{reveal that}} she has unerupted molars in her jaw, {{indicating}} by comparison with modern squirrel monkeys that she was 9–10 months old and would have reached adulthood at 36 months. The shape of Ida's teeth provides clues as to her diet; jagged molars would have allowed her to slice food, suggesting {{that she was a}} leaf and seed eater. This is confirmed by the remarkable preservation of her gut content. Furthermore, the lack of a baculum (penis bone) found in all lower primates means that the fossil was from a female. X-rays performed on Ida revealed that her right wrist was healing from a fracture which may have contributed to her death. The scientists speculate whether she was overcome by carbon dioxide fumes while drinking from the Messel lake. Hampered by her broken wrist, she slipped into unconsciousness, was washed into the lake and <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom, where unique fossilisation conditions preserved her for 47 million years.|$|E
25|$|Though fossils {{revealing}} ichthyosaur behavior remain rare, one ichthyosaur fossil {{is known}} to have sustained bites to the snout region. Discovered in Australia, and analyzed by Benjamin Kear et alii in 2011, measurements of the wounds reveal that the bite marks were inflicted by another ichthyosaur, likely of the same species, a probable case of face biting during a conflict. The wounds show signs of healing in the form of bone growth, meaning that the victim survived the attack. Another, very large ichthyosaur close to nine metres in length was found in Svalbard; it was nearly complete save for its tail. Scrutiny of the find revealed that while hunting ammonites (as evidenced by an ammonite shell in the throat region), the ichthyosaur was ambushed and attacked, likely by a pliosaurid (known from the same habitat), which severed its tail. The ichthyosaur then <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> depths, drowning and eventually becoming fossilized in the deep water. The find was revealed to the public in the National Geographic special Death of a Sea Monster.|$|E

50|$|Gold panning is {{a simple}} process. Once a {{suitable}} placer deposit is located, some alluvial deposit are scooped into a pan, where it is then gently agitated in water and <b>the</b> gold <b>sinks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the pan. Materials with a low specific gravity are allowed to spill out of the pan, whereas materials with a higher specific gravity <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the sediment during agitation and remain within the pan for examination and collection by the prospector. These dense materials usually consist primarily of a black, magnetite sand with whatever stones or metal dust that {{may be found in}} the deposit that is used for source material.|$|R
