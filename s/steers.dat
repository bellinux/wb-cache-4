5|$|Grove {{began his}} career with the Dallas <b>Steers</b> of the Texas League {{at the start of the}} 1938 season. He played with the <b>Steers</b> until {{management}} began to replace young players with veterans due to the team's struggling form and moved Grove to the Longview Cannibals. As his first minor league season drew to a close, Grove planned on returning to Proviso High School to complete his education. At the end of the season, the St. Paul Saints purchased Grove's contract to replenish their pitching staff.|$|E
5|$|Jackalow {{became a}} wanted man, and his {{description}} was widely disseminated. On March 25, {{news of the}} fate of the Spray reached Guilford. That same day, the pilot boat George <b>Steers</b> reached the Spray and towed her to Jersey City.|$|E
5000|$|When the <b>steer</b> wrestler {{is ready}} he [...] "calls" [...] for the <b>steer</b> by {{nodding his head}} and the chute man trips a lever opening the doors. The {{suddenly}} freed <b>steer</b> breaks out running, shadowed by the hazer. When the <b>steer</b> reaches {{the end of his}} rope, it pops off and simultaneously releases the barrier for the <b>steer</b> wrestler. The <b>steer</b> wrestler attempts to catch up to the running <b>steer,</b> lean {{over the side of the}} horse which is running flat out and grab the horns of the running <b>steer.</b> The <b>steer</b> wrestler then is pulled off his horse by the slowing <b>steer</b> and plants his heels into the dirt further slowing the <b>steer</b> and himself. He then takes one hand off the horns, reaches down and grabs the nose of the <b>steer</b> pulling the <b>steer</b> off balance and ultimately [...] "throwing" [...] the <b>steer</b> to the ground. Once all four legs are off the ground, an official waves a flag marking the official end and a time is taken. The <b>steer</b> is released and trots off.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steer</b> roping, {{also known}} as <b>steer</b> {{tripping}} or <b>steer</b> jerking, is a rodeo event that features a <b>steer</b> and one mounted cowboy.|$|R
5000|$|Chute dogging is a rodeo event {{related to}} <b>steer</b> wrestling, {{in which the}} <b>steer</b> used weighs between 400 and 500 lb. However, the {{competitor}} starts the event in a roping chute with the <b>steer</b> as opposed to grabbing onto the <b>steer</b> from horseback. The event is designed to give novices a chance to prepare for <b>steer</b> wrestling.|$|R
5|$|To {{steer the}} canoe in mid-ocean on a {{consistent}} course, the navigator selects a star and keeps the canoe pointed toward it. Should it become cloud-blocked, or rise too high in the sky, he selects another star but offsets his reference to remain true to the first, or <b>steers</b> at the same relative angle to the swell as when steering toward the star.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Koblenz Dallas (Tom Skerritt) is {{the captain}} of the Nostromo and the only human crew member with access to Mother, the onboard computer. When he {{receives}} a distress signal from the Derelict, an Engineer ship, Dallas <b>steers</b> the Nostromo off course to investigate the beacon. After the Alien hatches from Gilbert Kane's chest and murders Samuel Brett, Dallas enters the ship's air ducts to lure it to the airlock and eject it into space. He is attacked by the Alien and disappears – presumed dead – leaving only his flamethrower.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually <b>steers</b> {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
50|$|Fy {{compliance}} <b>steer.</b> The {{lateral force}} at the contact patch causes the wheel to rotate about the <b>steer</b> axis, generating a <b>steer</b> angle.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the chute}} opens, the {{competitor}} must bring the <b>steer</b> {{to a line}} ten feet from the chute and wrestle (or [...] "dog") the <b>steer</b> to the ground. In order to count as a legal fall, all four feet of the <b>steer</b> {{must be in the}} air when the <b>steer</b> is on the ground. Other falls are called [...] "dog falls," [...] and the competitor must try to let the <b>steer</b> get up and try to get all four legs in the air. The competitor can be disqualified for losing contact with the <b>steer</b> or tripping the <b>steer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{preferred}} {{method of}} wrestling the <b>steer</b> {{to the ground}} is to lean from the galloping horse which is running beside the <b>steer,</b> transferring {{the weight of the}} upper body to the neck of the <b>steer,</b> with one hand on the near horn of the <b>steer</b> and the far horn grasped in the crook of the other elbow. One then lets the horse carry his feet by the <b>steer</b> until his feet naturally fall out of the stirrups. The <b>steer</b> wrestler then slides with his feet turned slightly to the left, twisting the head of the <b>steer</b> toward one by pushing down with the near hand and pulling up and in with the far elbow. Finally the <b>steer</b> wrestler lets go of the near horn, and puts the <b>steer's</b> nose in the crook of his left elbow, and throws his weight backwards causing the <b>steer</b> to become unbalanced and fall to the ground.|$|R
5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast the shark with the impulses, {{causing it to}} leap {{out of the water}} again, igniting the bomb as Ellen <b>steers</b> the sailboat towards the shark while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} in Arizona are not common, {{since the}} predominant wind pattern <b>steers</b> most storms that {{form in the}} Eastern Pacific either parallel or away from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico. As a result, most storms that could affect Arizona are carried away from the United States, with only 6% of all Pacific hurricanes entering US territory. Not all Arizona hurricanes originate from the Pacific Ocean, however; in July 2008 an Atlantic hurricane named Hurricane Dolly produced rainfall in the eastern portion of the state, and another Atlantic storm reached Arizona as a tropical depression. Many, but not all, of these systems also impacted California.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother <b>steers</b> him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E
50|$|Bump <b>steer</b> or roll <b>steer</b> is {{the term}} for the {{tendency}} of {{the wheel of a}} car to <b>steer</b> itself as it moves through the suspension stroke. It is typically measured in degrees of <b>steer</b> per metre of upwards motion or degrees per foot.|$|R
2500|$|Chute Dogging is {{an event}} to teach pre-teen boys how to <b>steer</b> wrestle. The {{competitor}} enters a bucking chute with a small <b>steer.</b> The boy will then place his right arm around the <b>steer's</b> neck and left {{hand on top of}} its neck. When ready, the gate is opened and <b>steer</b> and contestant exit the chute. Once they cross over a designated line, the competitor will grab onto the horns of the <b>steer</b> (colloquially, to [...] "hook-up" [...] to the <b>steer)</b> and wrestle it to the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>steer</b> roper starts {{behind a}} [...] "barrier" [...] - a taut rope {{fastened}} with an easily broken string which is fastened lightly to the <b>steer.</b> When the roper {{calls for the}} <b>steer,</b> the chute man trips a lever, opening the doors. The <b>steer</b> breaks out running. When the <b>steer</b> reaches {{the end of the}} tether, the string breaks, releasing the barrier for the horse and roper. Should the roper break the barrier, a 10-second penalty is added to his time). The roper must throw his rope in a loop around the <b>steer's</b> horns.|$|R
5|$|Red {{follows a}} {{familiar}} scent and is reunited with her sister, {{a single mother}} with three chicks. The two hunt together and bring food back to the nest for the young. A white pterosaur, one Red has seen since she hatched, helps the two by finding carrion and prey {{in exchange for a}} helping of meat. On one hunting expedition, when the two adult Utahraptor are stalking a herd of Iguanodon, Red spies a young male Utahraptor that is watching their prey. He begins a courtship dance for Red, but Red's sister chases him off, hissing. Her growls agitate the Iguanodon, who stampede; the male hastily leaves. After climbing into a tree to escape a flash flood, Red encounters the male raptor again, who performs a courtship dance while hanging onto the tree branches. Red's sister begrudgingly allows the male to stay with them, provided he <b>steers</b> clear of her chicks.|$|E
5|$|The {{batteries}} in OR–7's Global Positioning System tracking unit expired in October 2015. Officials decided {{to replace the}} collar {{in order to keep}} track of the pack, which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts to trap OR-7 or other members of the pack failed, and further tracking of OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four <b>steers</b> were killed by wolves in Wood River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR–7 was last seen, biologists said efforts to trap and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with the pack in Wood River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, the collar on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements and behaviors of the pack.|$|E
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and <b>steers</b> the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the rope}} {{is around the}} <b>steer's</b> horns, a {{right-handed}} roper throws the slack of the rope over the <b>steer's</b> right hip and then turns his horse to the left; when the rope comes tight, it pulls on the <b>steer's</b> hip up and turns the <b>steer's</b> head around, tripping or unbalancing the <b>steer</b> so that it falls. [...] The roper dismounts while his horse continues to gallop, pulling the <b>steer</b> along the ground, which prevents the animal from getting back to its feet. The horse is trained to slow once the rider is completely off the horse and has reached the <b>steer,</b> but to keep the rope taunt while the contestant ties three of the <b>steer's</b> legs together with a piggin string using a half hitch knot colloquially called a hooey.|$|R
50|$|Tunnel boring {{machines}} are <b>steered</b> by hydraulic tilting of the cutter head. Rail track vehicles (i.e. trains, trams) are <b>steered</b> by curved guide tracks, including switches, and articulated undercarriages. Land yachts on wheels and kite buggies are <b>steered</b> similarly to cars. Ice yachts and bobsleighs are <b>steered</b> by rotating the front runners {{out of the}} direction of travel. Snowmobiles <b>steer</b> the same way by rotating the front skis. Tracked vehicles (i.e. tanks) <b>steer</b> by increasing the drive force on the side opposite of the direction of turn. Horse-drawn sleighs and dog sleds are <b>steered</b> by changing the direction of pull. Zero-turn lawn mowers use independent hydraulic wheel drive {{to turn on the}} spot.|$|R
50|$|As Vixen {{gathered}} speed, she <b>steered</b> {{south by}} east, clearing the armored cruiser Brooklyn's field of fire, about two points on Vixen's port bow. The yacht then <b>steered</b> west by south, as Sharp wanted to <b>steer</b> a course parallel {{to that of}} the Spanish fleet that was then under fire from the other American ships. Unfortunately, the helmsman erred and <b>steered</b> southwest by south—a mistake not discovered until Vixen had <b>steered</b> farther from the action.|$|R
5|$|A giant {{meteoroid}} {{approaches the}} earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle, while a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predicts {{the end of}} the world. The meteoroid misses the earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their ship, the Aurora, is helmed by Tintin's friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another team has set out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary, backed by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel; wherefore, the expedition becomes a race to land on the meteorite. On the day of departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick of dynamite on the Aurora, but it is found and thrown overboard. In the North Sea, the Aurora is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock <b>steers</b> out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of Akureyri, when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three then secretly run a hose from Chester's ship, Sirius, to the Aurora, and thus trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need.|$|E
5|$|Close to the Peary, the Aurora {{receives}} an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition {{has reached the}} meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin makes camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly, and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, and immense, explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the Aurora {{with a piece of}} Phostlite. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes. As the Aurora returns home, Captain Haddock <b>steers</b> the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey.|$|E
