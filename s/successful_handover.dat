50|$|Despite Portugal's size, China has {{a genuine}} {{interest}} in developing relations with Portugal and grants Portugal a similar treatment to the main European countries and both countries maintain friendship and relative intense relations, {{this is due to}} three main reasons, the first and main one is the <b>successful</b> <b>handover</b> of Macau, which is regularly praised by Beijing, given the issues over Taiwan and the troubled transition of Hong Kong and some tensions with the United Kingdom. A second reason is that Portugal is part of a linguistic universe of over 200 million people, including some countries of growing international importance, with which China wants to promote relations. A final factor is Portugal's prestige in Asia, and the antiquity and peaceful character of relations between Portugal and China.|$|E
50|$|No {{arbitrarily}} reliable {{data transfer}} without end-to-end acknowledgment and re-transmission mechanisms: The ARPANET {{was designed to}} provide reliable data transport between any two end points of the network much like a simple I/O channel between a computer and a nearby peripheral device.

However, in spite of significant efforts, perfect reliability as envisaged in the initial ARPANET specification {{turned out to be}} impossible to providea reality that became increasingly obvious once the ARPANET grew well beyond its initial four node topology. The ARPANET thus provided a strong case for the inherent limits of network based hop-by-hop reliability mechanisms in pursuit of true end-to-end reliability.|$|E

40|$|Background: Leading {{international}} health {{organizations have}} focused on {{improving the quality of}} clinical handovers. Research demonstrates areas for improvement where clinical handovers in healthcare are essential for quality, safety, and continuity of patient care. One hospital had received many incident reports about the quality of interdepartmental handovers between the Emergency Department and somatic wards, and wanted to improve them. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore how clinical handovers are experienced between the ED and ward nurses, and gather suggestions for improvement. Method: This study pursued a qualitative, inductive, explorative approach with 6 focus group interviews of nurses (N= 19) on both ends of the ED-Ward handover (2 ED, 1 surgical, 3 medical). The interdepartmental handover is by telephone from ED to ward nurses. Graneheim and Lundman’s (2004) content analysis method was used to analyze interview texts. Rasmussen’s system approach and Dynamic Safety Model formed the theoretical basis for interpretation. Results: Four bodies of data emerged from the interviews: Poor <b>handovers</b> and <b>Successful</b> <b>handovers</b> from ED or Wards’ perspectives. Poor handovers occurred in a busy ED without handover structure where efficiency trumps quality causing consequences for nurses and patients on the wards. Nursing assessments and documentation lacked, and patients’ status upon arrival on wards didn’t always match the <b>handover</b> description. <b>Successful</b> <b>handovers</b> were described as bridging needs of patients and nurses. Conclusion: The results provide evidence for improving the interdepartmental handover but will take organizational buy-in and collaboration over time to develop and implement evidence-based, locally suitable handover routines and protocols...|$|R

The technologies will allow full mobility of the user and enable dynamic management policies that ensure end-to-end secure transmission of data and services across heterogeneous infrastructures and networks. The concept of ubiquitous and scalable system is applied in the IST WINNER II project to deliver optimum performance for different deployment scenarios from local area to wide area wireless networks. The integration of cellular and local area networks in a unique radio system will provide a great advantage to final users and operators, compared with the nowadays situation, where there are many standalone systems and users equipped with different subscriptions, radio interfaces and terminals. To this issue, the IST project WINNER II has defined three system modes suited to local, metropolitan and wide area respectively. This paper describes the mobility management and access selection schemes that are proposed for the WINNER system that is designed as a candidate Beyond 3 G type of system. A radio resource management (RRM) architecture that fully enables the functionality of these schemes will also be presented.

We provide an analysis of mobility scenarios in combination with QoS signaling and propose to use an additional node local Flow Information Service element that supplies the necessary mobility support within NSIS capable mobility-aware nodes.

Heightened expectations of the business sector, globalisation and increased media attention {{on the role of}} business in society are casting an intense spotlight on this issue. As a result, pressure has built on business to play a larger role in bringing about socio-economic development to many local communities where they operate. While for a long time companies {{have been involved in the}} community on a philanthropy basis, many companies today are reassessing the manner in which they conduct their corporate {{social responsibility}} programmes. Many companies are including corporate social responsibility issues into their strategic planning process and overall corporate strategy. Emphasis is given to certain strategic indicators that must be present in order for a company to be said to have taken a strategic approach to corporate social responsibility. This study adopted a critical-realist approach using a case study method to evaluate DaimlerChrysler South Africa’s corporate social investment programmes in the local community of the Border-Kei region against these strategic indicators. This new form of engagement is even challenging for a multinational corporation, which may feel that it is only obliged to assist the local community where its corporate headquarters is located. But as companies derive an everlarger share of revenue and profits from international operations, multinational companies are being called upon to redefine “community”, by looking beyond local, domestic and geographical communities to include those in regions where they have factories or factories operated by key suppliers.

When MSs begin to move, for example, certain MSs may do the handover from a BS to another BS due to the movements, which will increase the Handover Ranging messages in networks. Against the increase of Handover Ranging messages in networks, the ARCA scheme automatically increases the quantity of ranging codes allocated to the Handover Ranging code subgroup in to order to improve <b>successful</b> <b>handover</b> probability and eventually increase the total transmission success rate.

Handover in a wireless network is usually based on signal strength measurements, but that approach {{does not consider}} levels of congestion within the network.

A scheme that analyses the jitter is used to establish the relationship between congestion and loss in WLANs. This Moving Average of Negative Jitter is {{used as the basis}} of a handover scheme which can minimize loss. The handover scheme uses a client with two simultaneous connections to the same server through two separate WLANs, and it is shown that the client can compare the jitter in the two streams to determine which network delivers the best performance; this information is then used to determine when to perform a handover.
