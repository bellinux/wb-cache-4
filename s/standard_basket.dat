For instance, in the construction of price indices for inflation, the nature of goods in the economy changes over time as well as their prices. A price index constructed in 1950 using a <b>standard</b> <b>basket</b> of goods based on 1950 consumption would not well represent the prices faced by consumers in 2000, as goods in some categories are no longer traded in 2000, new categories of goods have been introduced, and the relative spending on different categories of goods will change drastically. Furthermore, the goods in the basket may have changed in quality.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to obtain {{quantitative}} data on the metabolic flows (energy consumption, {{not only by the}} establishment but also in the transportation of workers and customers, and packaging use) and their resulting environmental impacts of a <b>standard</b> shopping <b>basket</b> purchase in five city center municipal markets and a hypermarket in a suburban retail park in the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). The main results show that a <b>standard</b> shopping <b>basket</b> purchased in a retail park requires 20 times more energy than one purchased in a municipal market (11. 1 kWh and 0. 57 kWh, respectively). Customer transportation represents 83. 2 % of energy consumption in a retail park, while the greatest impacts in a municipal market stem from the establishment itself (49. 5 %) and worker transportation (40. 4 %). Secondly, the packaging use inventory is higher in a hypermarket (253 g) than in a municipal market (102 g). However, the overall environmental impact associated with a <b>standard</b> shopping <b>basket</b> is 10 times higher on average in a hypermarket than in a municipal market, and the carbon footprints of the hypermarket and the municipal market are 3. 8 and 0. 4 kg of CO₂ eq., respectively. According to the sensitivity analysis, current policies for reducing the amount of plastic bag packaging have little repercussion in a retail park because its relative weight in terms of total packaging use is only 7 %. Nevertheless, they have notable effects in municipal markets where plastic bags represent 25 % of the packaging use. Finally, if customers selected the least packaged products available in hypermarkets, each shopping basket could reduce up to 47. 2 % of its used packaging weight and between 15. 4 and 59. 0 % of its associated environmental impact...|$|R

It traces {{the relationships between the}} state, industry, and sick funds from before the establishment of National Health Insurance (NHI) in 1995 to the beginning of this decade, in particular as they have grappled with the challenge of making national formulary decisions in a rational manner. Subsequent to the introduction of NHI there have been shifts in the modes and mix of governance. This research shows empirically that a relatively complex mix of hierarchical and network modes of governance can be successfully established {{over an extended period of}} time when flexibility is maintained through the implementation process. The system for defining and updating a <b>standard</b> <b>basket</b> of health services has coped well with the challenge of managing a range of difficult and potentially volatile stakeholder relationships in the pharmaceutical sector and of distancing ministers from controversies of funding and listing decisions. Government has succeeded in containing drug costs whilst still maintaining a basket of reimbursable drugs that, from an international perspective, is comprehensive and technologically advanced. On the other hand, network arrangements appear to have delayed the introduction of suitable accountability relationships and hindered their development. The state has traditionally played an intermediary role between unavoidable corporate interests of industry and sick funds, with little transparency and to the detriment of more pluralistic access to decision making. Governance arrangements in Israel appear to limit the potential and incentive of the state and the sick funds to realize their potential countervailing powers in subsidy and pricing decisions...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the process of price {{determination}} by the market in the existing variable fiat money regime and its consequences. Design/methodology/approach – Scientific knowledge pertaining to units and measurement has been applied to study the issue of wealth measurement and to arrive at the consequences of monetary manipulation. As regards Shariah perspective it may be described as guided application of science to the issue of currency and wealth measurement to analyze and solve economic problems. Findings – Manipulation of currency that is manipulation of quantity of what determines purchasing power of money does not allow market to determine just prices implying lack of justice in exchange. Profitability of economic activities no longer relates to their utility for the economy implying gross inefficiency in profit driven investment. Market fails to maintain economic balances. These amount to extreme losses. It has led to massive economic uncertainty, instability, disparity, corruption and conflicts. Economic growth, justice and peace become unattainable. It is a serious crime as currency being unit of wealth is the most important unit and it is strictly prohibited in Shariah. Unless corrected for monetary manipulation financial modes recommended by Shariah seem to be unjust and impractical. Research limitations/implications – Application of scientific approach and scientific knowledge to economic issues especially the issue of wealth measurement needs higher emphasis, efforts and resources. Practical implications – Governments ought to be persuaded not to manipulate money. Right solution is to link currency with a <b>standard</b> <b>basket</b> of national products with sufficient weight for gold and silver having most stable purchasing power. Unless accounting is corrected for monetary manipulation preferred Islamic modes of finance seem to be unjust and impractical. Where currency is manipulated Shariah/justice requires accounting for dues, capital, profit and loss to be corrected for this manipulation and in present scenario relative change in Consumer Price Index and Whole Sale Price Index may be used as a measure of currency manipulation. Originality/value – Monetary manipulation has been clearly defined and extreme severity of the problems it creates has been established.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of construction performance is a vexed problem. Despite much research effort, there remains little agreement {{over what to}} measure and how to measure it. The problem is made even more complicated {{by the desire to}} benchmark national industry performance against that of other countries. As clearly construction cost forms part of the analysis, the mere adjustment of cost data to an ‘international currency’ has undermined past attempts to draw any meaningful conclusions. This paper proposes a new method for comparing international construction performance, and in so doing integrates cost with time and quality to determine ratios capable of ranking projects, building contractors, cities and even entire industries – not only today, but retrospectively over time. The aim in this paper, therefore, is to outline the new model and test it using what is understood {{to be one of the}} largest samples of construction project data ever assembled across two sample countries: Australia and the United States. The research comprises 337 high-rise projects of 20 storeys or more, completed between 2003 and 2012, throughout the five largest cities in Australia and the United States and representing two-thirds of the known population of such buildings in these locations. The ensuing analysis not only demonstrates the practical application of the model, but provides new insight into the efficiency track-record of the construction industry in Australia and the United States by city over the last decade. Cost is measured as the number of standard ‘citiBLOC’ baskets necessary to construct a project, where a <b>standard</b> <b>basket</b> comprises common and globally-applicable construction items priced in each city in local currency, removing the need to apply currency exchange rates that otherwise introduce volatility and erroneous outcomes. Time is measured as the quantity of finished gross floor area completed per month, inclusive of delays related to the construction process on site. Quality is measured as a function of unit price and implicitly includes factors such as complexity, innovation, building height, extent of fit-out, environmental performance, compliance, standard of finish and supervision levels. Construction efficiency is extracted and defined as the ratio of construction cost per month, and is used to comment on the relative performance of the procurement process in different locations. It is concluded that, based on data from the largest five cities in each country, efficiency on site is improving in both countries. The growth in baseline cost/m 2 suggests a possible rise in project complexity over time. While the trend in efficiency improvement is similar, there is evidence that base costs in Australia have outstripped the United States, meaning that ‘real’ construction efficiency in Australia is relatively less. If Australia held an advantage in the past, then it seems that advantage might be disappearing. Notwithstanding the larger number of projects found in the United States (251) compared to Australia (86), the top 10 US performers in terms of construction efficiency have higher scores that the top project found in Australia, and the reasons underpinning this clearly demand future project-level investigation...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{concern that}} a dollar peg exposes East Asian economies to {{fluctuations}} in the dollar-yen exchange rate has stimulated research on currency basket regimes as alternatives for these economies. However, existing studies have mostly ignored an important characteristic of East Asia, i. e., most of its international trade is invoiced in the U. S. dollars. This paper investigates how the preponderance of dollar invoicing affects optimal currency basket regimes for East Asian economies. I develop a three-country center-periphery sticky-price dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for the analysis. The model is solved numerically by taking second-order approximations to the policy functions with the expected lifetime utility of households chosen as the welfare criterion. Contrary to the conjecture of existing literature, I show that predominance of dollar invoicing implies that the dollar should receive a smaller weight than suggested by bilateral trade shares between emerging markets in East Asia and the United States. The results hinge on the interaction of different degrees of pass-through implied by the choice of invoice currency and endogenous responses of monetary policies in the center countries.

Methods - Literature was searched in a systematic manner. In 2012, the store-turnover method was used to quantify dietary intake of the five APY communities that have a Mai Wiru (good food) store. Results were compared with those available from 1986. Prices of a <b>standard</b> market <b>basket</b> of basic foods, implementation of nutrition policy requirements and healthy food checklists were also assessed in all seven APY community stores from 2008 and compared with available data from 1986. Results - Despite concerted efforts and achievements decreasing intake of sugar and increasing the availability and affordability of healthy foods, particularly fruit and vegetables, and consequent improvements in some nutrient indicators, the overall effect has been a decrease in diet quality as indicated primarily by the increased supply and proportion of energy intake from discretionary foods, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages, convenience meals and take-away foods. Conclusions - The study findings reinforce the notion that, in the absence of supportive regulation and market intervention, adequate and sustained resources are required to improve nutrition and prevent diet-related chronic disease on the APY Lands.

40|$|To {{examine the}} utility of {{ultrasound}} visualization for guiding ablation of cardiac tissue, an intracardiac ultrasound cardioscope incorporating a catheter visualization/delivery system into the imaging head of the device was examined in 16 dogs. The ultrasound ablation probe (Acuson 7. 5 MHz/ 8 mm) was introduced via the right external jugular vein into the right atrium/ventricle. Long axis imaging from the probe to a depth exceeding 7 cm enabled high resolution visualization extending from the pulmonary veins, through the level of each cardiac valve to the left ventricular apex. Ablation catheters along with tip electrodes were readily visualized, allowing their non-fluoroscopic passage across the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves for ventricular mapping and ablation. Specific parallel or perpendicular catheter tip/tissue orientation was readily documented in each case, as was the catheter tip/tissue contact {{with the use of}} <b>standard</b> and <b>basket</b> array catheters. For ablation of right heart structures, an ablation catheter port incorporated into the imaging head facilitated direct visualization of the catheter-tissue interface and evolving tissue injury and thrombus formation during ablation.

Perfusion catheter tip flow used to ameliorate the ablation-related impedance rise was also documented by color flow techniques.

The bills specify emissions reductions to be achieved through 2050 for the <b>standard</b> six-gas <b>basket</b> of greenhouse gases. They fall into two groups: one specifies emissions reductions of 50 % to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050; the other establishes a tightening target for emissions intensity and stipulates a time-path for a “safety valve ” limit on the emission price that approximately stabilizes U. S. emissions at the 2008 level. A set of three synthetic emissions paths are defined that span the range of stringency of these proposals, and these “core ” cases are analyzed for their consequences in terms of emissions prices, effects on energy markets, welfare cost, the potential revenue generation if allowances are auctioned and the gains if permit revenue were used to reduce capital or labor taxes. Initial period prices for the first group of proposals, in carbon dioxide equivalents, are estimated between $ 30 and $ 50 per ton CO 2 -e depending on where each falls in the 50 % to 80 % range, with these prices rising by a factor of four by 2050. Welfare costs are less than 0. 5 % at the start, rising in the most stringent case to near 2 % in 2050.

These treatment programs oftentimes involve the use of cryotherapy or ankle taping to create an optimal environment for healing. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the individual and simultaneous effects of ankle taping and cryotherapy on mechanical power and velocity. Sixteen (16) Division IA Baseball players (Age 20. 53 +/- 1. 15 yrs, Wt 878. 45 +/ 105. 68 N, Ht 1. 85 +/- 0. 087 m) served as subjects for this study. Subjects met the following criteria: 1) all were asymptomatic from any lower extremity injury for at least six months prior to testing. 2) none had any known cold allergy (ie. hives, hypersensitivity to cold). This study utilized a counterbalanced repeated measures design, in which subjects participated in three treatments, cryotherapy, ankle taping and a combination treatment of cryotherapy and ankle taping. For the taping treatment, each subject was taped using a <b>standard</b> closed <b>basket</b> weave technique` with porous 1. 5 " cloth athletic tape (Johnson and Johnson, Coach). The cryotherapy treatment was administered a 20 minute ice immersion treatment at 10 deg Celsius to the leg and ankle. In the combination treatment, both treatments were administered with the ice immersion preceding ankle taping. The effects of these treatments on mechanical power and velocity were measured by a Kistler amplifier and force plate platform during a one leg standing vertical jump. The two-way repeated measures ANOVA's for power and velocity showed no significant interaction between cryotherapy, taping or combination treatment. However, significant pre-post treatment effects for power were discovered after cryotherapy and combination treatment. As a result of these findings, it is evident that immediate return to participation after cryotherapy or combination treatment will lead to decreases in muscular performance or injury.

40|$|The Thatcher and Reagan administrations led a {{shift towards}} more market {{oriented}} regulation of {{economies in the}} Anglo-American countries, including efforts to reduce the power of organized labor. In this paper, we examine the development of employment and labor law in six Anglo-American countries (the U. S., Canada, the U. K., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand) from the Thatcher/Reagan era to the present. At {{the outset of the}} Thatcher/Reagan era, the employment and labor law systems in these countries could be divided into three pairings: the Wagner Act model based industrial relations systems of the United States and Canada; the voluntarist system of collective bargaining and strong unions in the United Kingdom and Ireland; and the highly centralized, legalistic Award systems of Australia and New Zealand. Indeed, such a historical perspective contradicts the idea {{that there has been a}} longstanding Anglo-American model of liberal market economic ordering as has sometimes been suggested, e. g. in the varieties of capitalism literature. However, looking at the current state of the employment relations systems in these six countries, we argue that there has been growing convergence in two major areas. There has been a convergence in the area of labour rights toward private ordering of employment relations and away from the idea of work and employment being a matter subject to public ordering. By private ordering, we mean the idea that work and employment terms and conditions are primarily determined at the level of the individual organization, whether through collective bargaining between unions and employers at the organizational level, through individual negotiations, or through unilateral employer establishment of the terms and conditions of employment. The shift away from public ordering of work and employment is most dramatic in the cases of Australia and New Zealand, where the publicly established system of centralized Awards has given way to organizational level ordering of employment relations through workplace or individual level agreements. In the United Kingdom, the shift to greater private ordering is most evident in the breakdown of multi-employer collective bargaining, the weakening of industry wide standards enforced by strong unions, and the growth of nonunion representation at the enterprise level. By contrast, the much lesser degree of change in the labour rights area in North America reflects the historical situation that the Wagner Act model was from the outset a model built around the idea of private ordering. When we turn to the area of employment rights, we also see a convergence across the six Anglo-American countries toward a model in which the role of employment law is to establish a <b>basket</b> of minimum <b>standards</b> that are built into the employment relationship, which can then be improved upon by the parties. Within these general trends, we do see some variation in the degree of convergence on these models of labour and employment rights regulation across the Anglo-American countries. The strongest degree of similarity in adoption of the private ordering in labour rights and the minimum <b>standards</b> <b>basket</b> in employment rights is found in four of the countries: Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and, with recent legislative changes, Australia. Each of these countries has adopted labour laws that favour organizational level economic ordering, but with reasonably substantial protections of trade union organizing and bargaining rights, and a set of minimum employment standards that includes similar sets of minimum wage, basic leave entitlements and unfair dismissal protections. The first outlier in this study is Ireland. The Irish employment relations system stands out as the only one that has continued to have a significant degree of central coordination and public ordering of employment relations. Although there is substantial coordination at the central level, at the organizational level, the Irish system resembles the other Anglo-American countries much more closely, suggesting that it has the potential to evolve in a similar direction. The other outlier is the United States. Structurally its system is similar to the other Anglo-American countries in emphasizing private ordering in labour law and the role of employment law as being to establish a minimum <b>basket</b> of basic <b>standards.</b> However, where the United States diverges from the other countries is that its system has involved a general favouring of the interests of employers over those of employees and organized labour in the implementation of the model...|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} direct coal liquefaction work using the Short Contact Time Batch Reactor (SCTBR) {{we have had}} recovery of product of approximately 75 to 85 % due to hold up of the reaction mixture in the preheater, precooler {{and also in the}} blow case. This has forced us to determine conversion by use of aliquots and using an ash balance. This has worked out quite well when we were running coal liquefaction reactions without catalyst or were using small amounts of soluble catalyst which did not leave significant amounts of mineral matter in the product. Now however, we are interested in running catalyzed liquefactions with solid and often supported catalysts which contribute significant amounts of mineral matter to the reaction system, thereby reducing the precision of the conversion determination. It therefore has been important to develop a method of determining conversion by other means. To do this, we have redesigned the reactor system to increase the recovery by reducing the hold up of material in the system. This was done by redesigning the blow case so {{there is little or no}} bypassing of the compressed gas used to drive the reaction mixture into the reactor, by changing the condenser system so that there is less hold up of material there, and to reduce the length of the tubing in the preheater and precooler. With these changes, we have been able to increase our recovery to over 90 to 95 %. This should permit a more accurate determination of conversion by product material balance provided one determines the amount of tetralin solvent in the recovered liquid product and the solids content in that product. The solids content is determined by filtration and weighing of the insoluble material. For the tetralin content, a gas chromatographic method on the liquid portion of the reaction mixture has been developed, using methyl naphthalene as the reference <b>standard.</b> A <b>basket</b> is being fabricated to hold catalyst in the SCTBR reactor during liquefaction. This is designed to hold the solid catalyst in the reaction mixture during the reaction, but be able to be recovered after rinsing with the solvent for studies of catalyst activity and changes that may have taken place. This should allow the testing of various solid catalysts for activity and to separate them from the reaction mixture after the reaction is finished so that the high mineral matter catalyst will not interfere with the conversion determination. Various catalyst compositions both coated and uncoated will be tested. The first basket that was fabricated needed to be modified. That modification is in progress, but further modifications may be required as the system is tested...|$|R
40|$|The MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis {{model is}} applied to an {{assessment}} {{of a set of}} cap-and-trade proposals being considered by the U. S. Congress in spring 2007. The bills specify emissions reductions to be achieved through 2050 for the <b>standard</b> six-gas <b>basket</b> of greenhouse gases. They fall into two groups: one specifies emissions reductions of 50 % to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050; the other establishes a tightening target for emissions intensity and stipulates a time path for a "safety valve" limit on the emission price that approximately stabilizes U. S. emissions at the 2008 level. A set of three synthetic emissions paths are defined that span the range of stringency of these proposals, and these "core" cases are analyzed for their consequences in terms of emissions prices, effects on energy markets, welfare cost, the potential revenue generation if allowances are auctioned and the gains if permit revenue were used to reduce capital or labor taxes. Initial period prices for the first group of proposals, in carbon dioxide equivalents, are estimated between $ 30 and $ 50 per ton CO 2 -e depending on where each falls in the 50 % to 80 % range, with these prices rising by a factor of four by 2050. Welfare costs are less than 0. 5 % at the start, rising in the most stringent case to near 2 % in 2050. If allowances were auctioned these proposals could produce revenue between $ 100 billion and $ 500 billion per year depending on the case. Emissions prices for the second group, which result from the specified safety-valve path, rise from $ 7 to $ 40 over the study period, with welfare effects rising from near zero to approximately a 0. 5 % loss in 2050. Revenue in these proposals depends on how many allowances are freely distributed. (cont.) To analyze these proposals assumptions must be made about mitigation effort abroad, and simulations are provided to illuminate terms-of-trade effects that influence the emissions prices and welfare effects, and even the environmental effectiveness, of U. S. actions. Sensitivity tests also are provided of several of the design features imposed in the "core" scenarios including the role of banking, the specification of less than complete coverage of economic sectors, and the development of international permit trading. Also, the effects of alternative assumptions about nuclear power development are explored. Of particular importance in these simulations is the role of biofuels, and analysis is provided of the implications of these proposals for land use and agriculture. Finally, the U. S. proposals, and the assumptions about effort elsewhere, are extended to 2100 to allow exploration of the potential role of these bills in the longer-term challenge of reducing climate change risk. Simulations using the MIT Integrated System Model show that the 50 % to 80 % targets are consistent with global goals of atmospheric stabilization at 450 to 550 ppmv CO 2 but only if other nations, including the developing countries, follow...|$|R
