40|$|We {{report the}} {{occurrence}} of a bilateral pneumothoraces after unilateral central venous catheterization of the right subclavian vein in a 70 -year-old patient. The patient had no history of pulmonary or pleural disease and no history of cardiothoracic surgery. Two days earlier, she had a median laparotomy under general and epidural anaesthesia. Prior to the procedure, the patient was hemodynamically stable and her transcutaneous oxygen saturation was 97 % in room air. We punctured the right pleural space before cannulation of the right subclavian vein. After the procedure, the patient slowly became hemodynamically instable with respiratory distress. A chest radiograph revealed a complete left-side pneumothorax and a mild right-side pneumothorax. The right-side pneumothorax became under tension after left chest tube insertion. The symptoms finally resolved after insertion of a right chest tube. After a diagnostic work-up, we suspect a congenital “Buffalo chests ” explaining bilateral pneumothoraces and a <b>secondary</b> <b>tension</b> pneumothorax. Copyright © 2009 F. Pazos et al.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Sociology, 2014 This {{research}} {{is based on}} qualitative interviews conducted from the spring semester of 2012 to the spring semester of 2013 with 12 first-generation-transfer (FGCT) students and 3 transfer students on the Humboldt State University campus. The thesis addresses FGCT student???s postsecondary navigation experiences {{in relation to their}} self in transition from pursuing a bachelor degree. Analysis captures multi-dimensional understanding of a primary tension in self of being both similar and different as a college student, through FGCT student???s understanding of their postsecondary transitions from the intersection of institutional categories of First-Generation College (FGC) and Transfer student. A <b>secondary</b> <b>tension</b> in self of being both confident and doubtful of one???s place in the field of higher education arises as a means of persisting and navigating across institutions to a bachelor degree. Bourdieu???s conceptualization of field (1993) and habitus (1984) provide a theoretical lens for the analysis of data, representing the distinction held within the symbolic capital of a bachelor degree for both society and the self. The analysis also draws attention to the various ???nontraditional??? student categories of higher education as embodying new forms of symbolic cultural and social capital (Bourdieu 1986), represented through college student???s lived experiences. FGCT students straddle more than one cultural sphere of reality creating tensions in self. This research adopts intersectional multi-dimensional models as a means of studying college and university students in the twenty-first century who straddle multiple cultural spheres of reality, and offers recommendations for future approaches to educational research on both FGC and transfer student experiences. This thesis concludes with specific recommendations for Humboldt State University to assist FGCT students in their transition to the university by developing and enhancing current transitional programs and resources available to transfer students on the campus...|$|E

40|$|Voltage-clamp {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to study the effect of Ca, Ba and La on the contractile responses of short (approximately 1. 5 mm) muscle fibres. In the absence of external Ca or when 1. 8 mM-Ca was substituted by 1. 8 mM-Ba the contractile responses to short depolarizing pulses (400 ms) were not modified and only a minor shift in the tension-voltage relationship was observed. At high concentration (76 mM) of Ba or Ca, or {{in the presence of}} 2 mM-La, shifts in the tension-voltage relationship of 30, 41 and 25 mV respectively were observed. In addition the steepness of the activation curve was decreased in high Ba and Ca solutions. In the presence of 76 mM-Ba, the rate of the relaxation phase which follows membrane repolarization after a short pulse was diminished, possibly due to an intracellular action of Ba. In the absence of Ca, or when Ca was substituted by 1. 8 mM-Ba the area under the prolonged contractile responses (contractures) was reduced considerably. In the presence of 76 mM-Ba, the normal contracture time course was altered, showing a late slower relaxation phase, occasionally with a <b>secondary</b> <b>tension</b> development. In the presence of high Ca or La, the time course of the contractures was greatly prolonged. The steady-state inactivation curve was shifted toward more negative potentials, in the absence of external Ca or when 1. 8 mM-Ca was substituted by 1. 8 mM-Ba. In the presence of 76 mM-Ba the steady-state inactivation curve was not affected. In the presence of 76 mM-Ca or 2 mM-La the curve was shifted toward less negative potential, with a marked decrease in its steepness. Ba at a concentration as high as 1 or 2 mM did not activate tension development in chemically skinned muscle fibres. Ba at 1 or 2 mM did not appreciably alter the Ca uptake capacity of isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. At 5 mM a decrease in the Ca uptake capacity was observed. The results indicate that Ba at low (1. 8 mM) concentration is not effective in substituting for Ca. The effects of divalent cations at high concentration, and of La, on the tension-voltage relationship and on the steady-state inactivation curve are most probably mediated by interaction with the external surface of the fibre membrane.

40|$|AbstractThe inter-fibre/matrix failure under {{transverse}} tension {{has already}} been the object of several micromechanical studies by the authors, for single fibre case or dilute packing. These studies {{have made it possible}} to understand the initiation and later progress of failure at the micromechanical scale, which leads to the macro-failure of the material. The generation of damage at this scale is directly associated to the appearance of small debonds or interface cracks at the fibre-matrix interfaces. In the present work the influence, at micro scale, of a secondary transverse load perpendicular to the transverse tension nominally responsible for the failure, is studied for all phases of the mechanism of damage.

40|$|Ouabain, {{when applied}} to rings of the left {{circumflex}} coronary artery of the dog (which contains both alpha 1 -adrenoceptors leading to contraction and beta 1 -adrenoceptors leading to relaxation) caused an initial contraction which peaked within 15 minutes and a later <b>secondary</b> increase in <b>tension</b> which peaked within 60 minutes. These contractions were prevented by Ca 2 + removal or by verapamil. Adrenergic denervation with 6 -hydroxydopamine {{did not affect the}} initial contraction. Thus it is due to a nonadrenergic effect of the glycoside. Since the <b>secondary</b> increase in <b>tension</b> was prevented by adrenergic denervation and prazosin, {{it is likely to be}} due to norepinephrine released from adrenergic nerves acting on alpha-adrenoceptors. This interpretation was confirmed by the finding that ouabain, after a latent period of about 35 minutes, augmented the output of 3 H-norepinephrine from helical strips of the artery previously incubated with tritiated transmitter. In rings contracted with prostaglandin F(2 α), ouabain reduced beta-adrenergic relaxations caused by isoproterenol or exogenous norepinephrine, but not those caused by sodium nitroprusside. Thus, in this artery, ouabain depresses the response of the beta-adrenoceptors to the norepinephrine which it releases, thereby permitting the neurotransmitter to cause contraction by activating postjunctional alpha 1 -adrenoceptors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Pathology within the chest, including pneumothorax, tension hemothorax and pericardial tamponade, may also decrease the ECMO flow because of compression of the cannula and decreased atrial volume. Air from a tension pneumothorax may be transmitted from the pleural space to the pericardial and contralateral pleural spaces, as well as the peritoneal cavity if significant pressure is applied to either side of the diaphragm, even without diaphragmatic disruption.

40|$|Hypertension, {{defined in}} simple terms, {{means that the}} blood circu­ lates through the arteries at a pres­ sure which is higher than ncrmal. Pressure in the arteries is deter­ mined {{by a number of}} factors, begin­ ning with the {{contraction}} of the heart it self, the source of the energy that makes blood circulate through the body. Hypertension is an important public health problem in all industri­ alized societies because it is so widespread and because it leads to disability and in many cases to pre­ mature death. Essential, primary, or idiopathic hypertension is arterial hypertension of unknown causing over 95 percent of all cases of arte­ rial hypertension. <b>Secondary</b> hyper­ <b>tension</b> is arterial hypertension of known cause like renal (chronic nephritis), endocrine (primary aldo­ steronism), pregnancy-induced hy­ pertension and coarctation of the aorta.

Evidence available at present indi­ cates that diseases of the arteries and arterioles are the result of high pressure within blood vessels.

40|$|Isolation of the zygomaticomaxillary suture {{from the}} {{remainder}} of the growing skull by surgically sectioning the zygomatic arch and interfering with the regional muscle and fascial attachments produced growth reduc-tions ranging from 30. 9 % to 87. 5 %. This indicated that the suture is an area of com-pensation rather than of primary growth initiation. There is general agreement among investiga-tors that sutures are active sites of con-nective tissue proliferation and bone deposi-tion during certain periods of growth and development. However, their role in initiat-ing cranial growth is still in dispute. The literature presents two opposing roles played by sutures in the growth of the skull. One school of thought credits the suture with producing a primary growth force through the proliferation of its con-nective tissue. 1 - 3 The other claims that growth in the suture is <b>secondary</b> to <b>tensions</b> placed on it by enlargement of adjacent soft tissue organs such as the brain and eye-balls, and the growth of the cartilaginous synchondroses, the nasal cartilage, and the functional soft tissue matrix. 4 9 The purpose of this investigation was to test the latter hypothesis by reducing the influence of extraneous forces on the zygomaticomaxillary suture.

40|$|In {{isolated}} cat muscle spindles the receptor potential {{responses of}} {{primary and secondary}} endings as well as tension responses to sinusoidal length changes in the steady state have been analysed. 1. At a given stimulus frequency, receptor potential per unit length change (receptor potential gain) in both primary and secondary endings is constant when displacement is less than about 10 micrometer. With larger stretches, receptor potential gain decreases approximately as a power function of displacement, the gain of primary endings decreasing more rapidly with increasing displacement than that of <b>secondary</b> endings. <b>Tension</b> per unit length change (tension gain) shows a similar constant range above which it also decreases as a power function of displacement. 2. In spite of the large reduction in gain at high displacement amplitudes, response wave forms remained essentially sinusoidal. The gain reduction results principally from a displacement-dependent non-linearity which has a rapid onset and slow decay. 3. Receptor potential and tension responses to small amplitude sinusoidal stretch depend, in a parallel manner, on the initial length of the preparation. 4. Both receptor potential and tension responses are highly dependent on frequency of sinusoidal stretch. In primary endings receptor potential gain increased as a power function of frequency over the range 0. 01 to about 40 Hz, above which frequency the gain decreased; phase advance remained relatively constant up to 10 Hz then decreased to become a phase lag at higher frequency. In secondary endings receptor potential gain remained fairly constant between 0. 01 and 1 Hz then rose as a power function of frequency but less steeply than in primary endings. 3.

40|$|International audienceTrees {{can control}} their shape and resist gravity {{thanks to their}} ability to produce wood under tensile stress.

Thickness of secondary wall layer (SL) and gelatinous layer (GL) were measured from cambium to mature wood in several trees sampled at different times after tilting. Measurements on wood fibres produced before tilting show the progressive increase of secondary wall thickness during the growing season. After the tilting date, SL thickness decreased markedly from normal wood to tension wood while the total thickness increased compared to normal wood, with the development of a thick GL. However, even after GL formation, SL thickness continues to increase during the growing season. GL thickening was observed to be faster than SL thickening. The development of the unlignified GL is proposed to be a low cost, efficient strategy for a fast generation of tensile stress in broadleaved trees...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} pointed to changes in tissue {{mechanics}} as a contributory element {{to the development of}} malignancies. Increased tissue rigidity is associated with the unfolding of the Type III domains of fibronectin within the extracellular matrix.

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of a peptide representing a partially unfolded intermediate of the first Type III repeat of fibronectin (FnIII- 1 c) on inflammatory gene expression in adult human lung fibroblast cells. FnIII- 1 c induced expression of cytokines, CXCL 1 - 3, IL- 8 and TNF-&# 945;, by lung fibroblast cells. The increase in IL- 8 expression was dependent on Toll-like receptor 2 and NF&# 954;B.

40|$|ObjectivesLimited {{data are}} {{available}} regarding the surgical strategies for an anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ACAPA) in adulthood. We reviewed our surgical experience with ACAPA in adults. MethodsFrom January 1960 to July 2011, 10 adults (30 % men), aged 18 to 78 years (median, 43), underwent surgical repair of ACAPA. Anomalous left (ALCAPA) was present in 7, anomalous right (ARCAPA) in 2, and anomalous left anterior descending artery in 1. Most (90 %) were symptomatic, with 7 (70 %) having ischemic changes on a preoperative at rest or stress electrocardiogram. One patient had undergone previous ligation of ALCAPA in childhood. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 56 % ± 10 %, with mild dysfunction in 4. ResultsOf the 10 patients, 7 underwent repair by coronary artery button transfer to the aorta, with 2 requiring an interposition saphenous vein graft. In 3 patients, coronary transfer was not possible, and coronary artery bypass grafting with closure of the ACAPA was performed. The mean follow-up was 8. 6 years (maximum, 37). Two late deaths occurred from noncardiac causes. One patient with ALCAPA who underwent direct reimplantation subsequently required coronary artery bypass grafting for left main stenosis, likely <b>secondary</b> to <b>tension.</b> At the last follow-up visit, all patients were in New York Heart Association class I or II. The postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was similar at 53 % ± 9 %; No significant improvement was seen in those with below normal ejection fraction. ConclusionsEstablishment of a dual coronary artery system with coronary transfer is preferred, even if an interposition graft is required. Coronary artery bypass grafting with closure of ACAPA should be reserved for when coronary transfer is not feasible.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 A commercially {{important}} polyelectrolyte, xanthan, {{was chosen}} for a systematic analysis {{of the relationship between}} molecular conformation and surface properties. In the first study the effects of ionic strength, xanthan concentration and temperature on the xanthan molecular conformation were investigated by potentiometric titration. The effects of the same factors and of the degree of ionization on the surface tension of xanthan solutions were then analyzed by the drop weight and the Wilhelmy plate methods. Potentiometric titration studies showed that the ordered xanthan conformation is stabilized mainly by hydrogen-bonds which can be disrupted by increasing the electrostatic potential of the molecule or by increasing the solution temperature. Adding salt or increasing the xanthan concentration did not affect the <b>secondary</b> structure. Surface <b>tension</b> studies showed that the random coil is more surface active than the helix xanthan structure. The rate of xanthan adsorption at the interface of the random coil is also faster than that of the helix structure. Surface tension was also shown to be dependent on the electrostatic potential of the polyelectrolyte. Added salt screened the electrostatic repulsive force and therefore decreased the surface tension of xanthan solution...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: Experiments were {{designed}} to determine the modulation by nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations (EDHF-mediated responses) of endothelium-dependent contractions in renal arteries of normotensive and hypertensive rats. Experimental approach: Rings, with or without endothelium, of renal arteries of 8 -month-old Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were suspended in myographs for isometric force recording. Key results: ACh evoked relaxations in preparations contracted with phenylephrine. L-NAME (inhibitor of NOS) attenuated (WKY) or abolished (SHR) these relaxations. TRAM- 34 plus UCL 1684 (inhibitors of EDHF-mediated responses) did not decrease the relaxation, except in rings of WKY when L-NAME was also present. High concentrations of ACh caused a <b>secondary</b> increase in <b>tension,</b> augmented in rings of WKY by L-NAME or TRAM- 34 plus UCL 1684. The increase in tension was prevented by indomethacin. Under baseline tension, ACh induced endothelium-dependent contractions, prevented by indomethacin (COX inhibitor) or terutroban (TP receptor antagonist). The calculated endothelium-dependent contractions were larger in rings of SHR {{compared with those of}} WKY. In preparations of SHR, the contractions were augmented by L-NAME in the presence of SC 19220 (EP- 1 receptor antagonist). In arteries of WKY, the endothelium-dependent contractions were augmented by TRAM- 34 plus UCL 1684. The responses were reduced by SC 19220. Conclusions and implications: In the renal artery of the rat, EDCF-mediated contractions are augmented by hypertension. The endothelium-dependent contractions are facilitated by NOS inhibition (in the presence of an EP- 1 receptor antagonist) and by the withdrawal of EDHF-mediated responses. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the outcomes of hiatal hernia repair with human dermal mesh reinforcement of the crural closure in combination with tension reduction techniques when necessary. Study DesignWe retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who had hiatal hernia repair using AlloMax Surgical Graft (Davol), a human dermal biologic mesh. Objective follow-up was with videoesophagram and/or upper endoscopy at 3 months postoperatively and annually. ResultsThere were 82 patients with a median age of 63 years. The majority of operations (85 %) were laparoscopic primary repairs of a paraesophageal hernia with a fundoplication. The crura were closed primarily in all patients and reinforced with an AlloMax Surgical Graft. A crural relaxing incision was used in 12 % and a Collis gastroplasty in 28 % of patients. There was no mesh-related morbidity and no mortality. Median objective follow-up was 5 months, but 15 patients had follow-up at 1 or more years. A recurrent hernia was found in 3 patients (4 %). ConclusionsTension-reducing techniques in combination with human biologic mesh crural reinforcement provide excellent early results with no mesh-related complications. Long-term follow-up will define the role of these techniques and this biologic mesh for hiatal hernia repair...|$|R

The gas turbine SGT- 800 has thirty burners and each burner has four fuel injectors. In this thesis just {{a quarter of}} one burner is simulated. The main objective {{is to get the}} diesel spray combustion simulation to work and set a frame work for future investigation. Spray consists of two fundamental and consecutive steps: the primary breakup and the secondary breakup. The Blob method is used to model primary breakup and secondary breakup is modeled by Cascade Atomization and Breakup model (CAB). The trajectory and velocity of generated fuel droplets is determined by Lagrangian Particle Tracking. Fuel evaporation is modeled by simulating the mass and heat transfer of generated fuel droplet. The mixing of evaporated fuel with air and combustion of combustible mixture is modeled by multicomponent flow formulation. Burning Velocity Model (BVM) is used to simulate combustion. Flamelet Library for diesel fuel is generated by a special version of CFX-RIF. In order to speed up simulations the reduced Flamelet Library is used. At the end a parameter study is performed to find out important parameters on the fuel concentration field. Studied parameters are working conditions (part load and over load), injection direction (axial and angled injection), injector diameter, fuel surface <b>tension,</b> <b>secondary</b> breakup models, turbulence model and mesh. Also, experiments and their corresponding simulation with ANSYS CFX are done in order to predict droplet distribution size after injection. In this study water is used instead of diesel.

40|$|The {{encapsulated}} sensory endings of mammalian skeletal {{muscles are}} all mechanoreceptors. At {{the most basic}} functional level they serve as length sensors (muscle spindle primary and <b>secondary</b> endings), <b>tension</b> sensors (tendon organs), and pressure or vibration sensors (lamellated corpuscles). At a higher functional level, the differing roles of individual muscles in, for example, postural adjustment and locomotion {{might be expected to}} be reflected in characteristic complements of the various end-organs, their sensory endings and afferent nerve fibres. This has previously been demonstrated with regard to the number of muscle-spindle capsules; however, information on the other types of end-organ, as well as the complements of primary and secondary endings of the spindles themselves, is sporadic and inconclusive regarding their comparative provision in different muscles. Our general conclusion that muscle-specific variability in the provision of encapsulated sensory endings does exist demonstrates the necessity for the acquisition of more data of this type if we are to understand the underlying adaptive relationships between motor control and the structure and function of skeletal muscle. The present quantitative and comparative analysis of encapsulated muscle afferents is based on teased, silver-impregnated preparations. We begin with a statistical analysis of the number and distribution of muscle-spindle afferents in hind-limb muscles of the cat, particularly tenuissimus. We show that: (i) taking account of the necessity for at least one primary ending to be present, muscles differ significantly in the mean number of additional afferents per spindle capsule; (ii) the frequency of occurrence of spindles with different sensory complements is consistent with a stochastic, rather than deterministic, developmental process; and (iii) notwithstanding the previous finding, there is a differential distribution of spindles intramuscularly such that the more complex ones tend to be located closer to the main divisions of the nerve. Next, based on a sample of tendon organs from several hind-foot muscles of the cat, we demonstrate the existence in at least a large proportion of tendon organs of a structural substrate to account for multiple spike-initiation sites and pacemaker switching, namely the distribution of sensory terminals supplied by the different first-order branches of the Ib afferent to separate, parallel, tendinous compartments of individual tendon organs. We then show that the numbers of spindles, tendon organs and paciniform corpuscles vary independently in a sample of (mainly) hind-foot muscles of the cat. Grouping muscles by anatomical region in the cat indicated the existence of a gradual proximo-distal decline in the overall average size of the afferent complement of muscle spindles from axial through hind limb to intrinsic foot muscles, but with considerable muscle-specific variability. Finally, we present some comparative data on muscle-spindle afferent complements of rat, rabbit and guinea pig, one particularly notable feature being the high incidence of multiple primary endings in the rat...|$|R
40|$|THIS paper {{describes}} {{a relatively simple}} clinical test devised to estimate the facility of outflow of aqueous from an eye while external pressure is being applied to the globe; such a test is obviously of value {{in the investigation of}} cases of glaucoma. The fact {{that it is possible to}} reduce the tension in the eye by massage has been known for many years, and interest in the subject was revived during the latter part of the 19 th century, when the invention of the tonometer enabled changes in the intra-ocular pressure to be measured with some degree of accuracy. Schiotz (1908) himself noted that if the tonometer were left too long on the eye the tension was reduced, and Polak-van Gelder (1911) stated that this fall in tension was due to the expression of aqueous from the eye, and that its magnitude depended on the ease with which the aqueous could escape. She also stated that a greater amount of massage was necessary to produce the same fall in tension in glaucomatous as in normal eyes, and she appears, in fact, to have been the first person to use massage with a tonometer as a diagnostic test. Since then numerous attempts have been made to develop the potentialities of this technique, but, though manyworkers agreed that in general the pressure did not fall so much in glaucomatous eyes, especially those which were already in a state of increased tension, they were unable to produce a standard minimal fall in tension below which limit an eye can be considered abnormal. Thomassen (1946) studied the effects of compressing the eye with various weights. Although he found that eyes with advanced glaucoma were not so easily compressed, he came to the conclusion that it was not possible by this method to detect any significant difference between the fall produced in normal eyes and that in glaucomatous eyes with normal tension. Conse-quently, most of his work was devoted to the study of the <b>secondary</b> rise in <b>tension</b> that occurs after compression. His monograph includes a very comprehensive review of all the previous work done on this subject. Moses and Bruno (1950) studied the fall in tension produced by leaving an electric tonometer on the eye for 2 minutes, and stated that the rate of Received for publication August 10, 1953...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Workplace {{mental health}} {{promotion}} (WMHP) aims {{to prevent and}} effectively manage {{the social and economic}} costs of common mental illnesses such as depression. The mental health of managers and employees within small-medium enterprises (SMEs) is a neglected sector in occupational health research and practice, despite the fact that this sector is the most common work setting in most economies. The availability and propensity of SME staff to attend face-to-face training/therapy or workshop style interventions often seen in corporate or public sector work settings is a widely recognised problem. The 'Business in Mind' program employs a DVD mode of delivery that is convenient for SME managers, particularly those operating in regional and remote areas where internet delivery may not be optimal. The objective of the intervention program is to improve the mental health of SME managers, and examine whether employees of managers' whose mental health improves, report positive change in their psychosocial work environment. The mechanisms via which we aim to improve managers' mental health are through the development of their psychological capital (a higher order construct comprised of hope, self efficacy, resilience and optimism) and their skills and capacities for coping with work stress. Methods/Design The effectiveness of two versions of the program (self administered and telephone facilitated) will be assessed using a randomised trial with an active control condition (psychoeducation only). We aim to recruit a minimum of 249 managers and a sample of their employees. This design allows for 83 managers per group, as power analyses showed that this number would allow for attrition of 20 % and still enable detection of an effect size of 0. 5. The intervention will be implemented over a three month period and postal surveys will assess managers and employees in each group at baseline, intervention completion, and at 6 month follow up. The intervention groups (managers only) will also be assessed at 12 and 24 month follow-up to examine maintenance of effects. Primary outcomes are managers' levels of psychological capital (hope, resilience, self-efficacy and optimism), coping strategies, anxiety and depression symptoms, self-reported health, job satisfaction and job <b>tension.</b> <b>Secondary</b> outcomes are participating managers subordinates' perceptions of manager support, relational justice, emotional climate and job tension. In order to provide an economic evaluation of the intervention, both employees and manager rates of absenteeism and presenteeism will also be assessed. Discussion The intervention being trialled is expected to improve both primary and secondary outcomes. If proven efficacious, the intervention could be disseminated to reach a much larger proportion of the business community. Trial registration Current controlled trials ISRCTN 62853520 </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of three papers using empirical methods to study issues in public and social economics. My first paper, co-authored with Julian Betts, analyzes the performance of San Diego's charter schools using fixed-effect methods on panel student data. We find that charter school performance in San Diego varies by subject matter, grades served, school type and years of operation. In many cases, we find that charter school performance is indistinguishable from that of traditional public schools. Startup elementary charter schools perform poorly in math in early years, but catch up after year three, while conversion charter schools persistently underperform in both elementary math and reading, {{as well as in}} middle school reading. Checks for dynamic selection indicate that transitory performance dips preceding switches between school types do not strongly bias our estimates. Differences in performance {{do not seem to be}} due to school characteristics such as average class size and teacher experience. Analyses of differential impacts by student race and ethnicity suggest that charters may benefit some students more than others. Finally, an alternative test score measure indicates that charter schools at the middle school level may focus less on state -developed content standards than traditional public schools. My second paper investigates the relationships between measures of conflict and group composition and economic and social variables in US primary and <b>secondary</b> schools. Racial <b>tension</b> occurs most often when there is no majority group. More of it occurs when Asians or whites are the largest group than when blacks or Hispanics are the largest group. It is most prevalent in middle schools, and occurs more frequently in larger schools than smaller schools. When the race of the largest group is controlled for, racial tension increases with poverty, indicating there may be an economic component to racial tension. I find no strong evidence for any relationship between racial tension and between-group income disparities. I also find no evidence that recent changes in school racial composition are related to racial tension. Racial diversity in schools is associated with more racial tension, but not more violent activity or more gang activity. My third paper analyzes a panel of United States areas to investigate the contention that rising income inequality may increase crime rates. I first replicate findings from previous research that a strong positive correlation between local crime rates and local household income inequality appears across specifications in cross- section ordinary least squares regressions. I then demonstrate that the positive relationship between inequality and crime does not survive, and in fact reverses in some cases once local fixed effects are controlled for. I discuss and examine the possible reasons for this statistical reversal. While rising income inequality may have some negative social consequences, I find no strong evidence that it causes increased crime, at least in the short-ter...|$|R
