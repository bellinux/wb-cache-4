40|$|Abstract. Construction of a {{real estate}} project is close {{to one side of}} the metro station which has {{finished}} main structure building. The diagram of the metro station is used as supporting during the excavation of the pit of the real estate project, which will result in the one <b>side</b> <b>unloading</b> of the metro station. Bearing the unbalanced soil pressure, the metro station will have additional deformation and internal force. During the pit design, the additional deformation and internal force is analyzed for every step of the excavation. And the additional force is superimposed with the original force of the metro station to calculate the final internal force of the metro station. By adjusting the design parameters of the pit, the safety of the metro station is evaluated...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explains}} {{the physics of}} weight transfer. You will often hear instructors and drivers say that applying the brakes shifts weight {{to the front of}} a car and can induce oversteer. Likewise, accelerating shifts weight to the rear, inducing understeer, and cornering shifts weight to the opposite <b>side,</b> <b>unloading</b> the inside tires. But why does weight shift during these maneuvers? How can weight shift when everything is in the car bolted in and strapped down? Briefly, the reason is that inertia acts through the center of gravity (CG) of the car, which is above the ground, but adhesive forces act at ground level through the tire contact patches. The e#ects of weight transfer are proportional to the height of the CG o# the ground. A flatter car, one with a lower CG, handles better and quicker because weight transfer is not so drastic as it is in a high ca...|$|E
40|$|Wall flumes are {{vertical}} conduits {{attached to}} the walls of grain bins through which grain can flow. Flumes are thought to encourage funnel flow throughout {{the height of the}} bin while reducing the dynamic loads and moments associated with plug flow and <b>side</b> <b>unloading.</b> Discharge outlets from the flume can be placed at any location along the vertical line of the flume. Tests were performed with soft red winter wheat in a smooth-walled, model grain bin 2. 44 m in diameter and 7. 44 m tall, constructed of galvanized steel. Tests were conducted both with and without the flume. During unloading, the wall flume created an Ã¢Â€ÂœartificialÃ¢Â€Â funnel flow regime within all parts of the bin which produced wall loads smaller than those measured during filling, other than at the onset of discharge in which a small load spike was observed. However, in unloading through the flume unbalanced wall loads were observed around the circumference of the bin, which produced overturning moments in the plug flow zone. Tests were conducted in which flow was transferred from the wall flume to the center discharge gate. This switch in the discharge position created wall loads significantly larger than those measured during filling at the flume location where the switch occurred. Operator caution should be used in performing these types of flow switches within bins when using wall flumes...|$|E
50|$|The railway branch was {{constructed}} in the shortest possible time. In order to ensure the commissioning of the station and ferrying it {{was constructed}} simultaneously from both <b>sides.</b> <b>Unloaded</b> at the station Yandyki rail-shpalnye bars on heavy vehicles were taken to build power stations Olga. Transported to the same puteukladchik went to the station Yandyki collecting railway line.Station port Olya, sludge {{and the way the}} way to go port berths were built at the same time. Administrative building of the station was equipped with the necessary means of communication with computers, office equipment, conditions for eating the station employees.|$|R
5000|$|From 1975 to 1985, the {{entrance}} and exit building had overhead speakers playing the big band and orchestral portion of RCA's song [...] "Here's to the Future and You". The entrance lobby had the softer portion of this song; however the music heard in the Star Corridor and in the Zig-Zag corridor near the loading station remain original from 1975. (For a brief period in the late '70s, RCA switched the song over to [...] "Colortrak Keeps The Color On Track!", {{in reference to the}} company's new line of Colortrak TVs.) The warning spiel for the trains, and most sound effects are also original from 1975. Riders could hear music to the song [...] "Music Makers" [...] and [...] "Sentimental Journeys" [...] where the left and right <b>side</b> <b>unload</b> corridors merged to form the line for the post show.|$|R
5000|$|As well as {{the main}} station building, the station precinct {{had a number of}} sidings and a small goods (freight) {{platform}} and goods shed. There was also a livestock <b>siding</b> with <b>unloading</b> facilities and stock yards. Pirron Yallock had an adjacent racecourse and the station was quite busy at race times with trains conveying racegoers to these events. There were locomotive servicing facilities - a locomotive watering tower for steam locomotives remains on site.|$|R
50|$|Brawlin is {{the site}} of a railway <b>siding</b> used to <b>unload</b> and upload goods, however that siding is no longer in operation. The {{community}} location is only found by taking the Brawlin to Lockhart dirt road that runs west off the Coolac to Cootamundra road.|$|R
50|$|After four {{cars had}} been sold in 1904 two tracks were lifted. One was relaid to {{accommodate}} the extra cars when the fleet was expanded in 1927 but the outside road, used for car washing, was lifted. In its place a pair of sidings were laid from the GWR line which ran along the southern side of the site. This was used by wagons bringing coal to the generating station, which were winched up to the coal hopper at {{the west end of}} the <b>siding</b> for <b>unloading.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rutherford has a {{historical}} association with racing from 1858 onwards. In 1886 a landscaped racecourse was constructed {{for use by}} the Northern Jockey Club. The complex was progressively expanded, including the addition of a 1 km private rail <b>siding</b> with <b>unloading</b> facilities, as well as two grandstands each seating up to 1000, a bar and visitor amenities. A major meeting in 1921 saw a record crowd of 7777. The racecourse was also used as a landing ground by pioneer aviators Charles Kingsford Smith and Bert Hinkler.|$|R
50|$|The two frescoes, The Arts of Industry as Applied to War and The Arts of Industry as Applied to Peace, {{celebrate}} human artistic achievements. War {{portrays the}} princess and courtiers of an Italian Renaissance city state setting out for battle. Peace {{is set in}} a classical world of order and plenty. It is designed to evoke a sense of beauty rather than illustrate a specific narrative, and depicts a central group of wealthy elegant women dressing while, either <b>side,</b> workmen <b>unload</b> luxurious carpets and ceramics from barges.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} made {{available}} on 7 February 1939, for traffic {{to a point}} beyond Hoskinstown where a temporary <b>siding</b> and <b>unloading</b> facilities were provided. Loads of concentrate were conveyed from Captains Flat by road to this transfer point. The line was open to Captain's Flat under construction conditions from 28 November 1939, however Mines Department records indicate that conveyance of concentrates from the mine began in October, 1939. The Captain's Flat line opened for general traffic on 17 June 1940 when the tri-weekly rail motor service began.|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} and {{founding of the}} town of Hysham is intertwined with its ranching and railroad history. A large cattle ranch, the Flying E, ran thousands of heads of cattle in the region. Charlie J. Hysham had moved from the town of Red Oak, Iowa, to manage the ranch. In order to facilitate the delivery of the large amounts of supplies the Flying E ranch required, the Northern Pacific Railroad built a <b>siding</b> to <b>unload</b> goods and materials that Hysham had ordered from Billings and Forsyth. In 1907, the siding became the nucleus for the town of Hysham. (Cheney 1984; Kimball 1976).|$|R
50|$|The TTC added {{a railway}} <b>siding</b> with an <b>{{unloading}}</b> ramp at the Hillcrest Complex for the unloading of Flexity streetcars shipped by Bombardier. (The ramp was not finished {{in time for}} the arrival of 4400.) A CLRV streetcar is used as a tractor to pull a new Flexity off of the railway flatcar and down the ramp.|$|R
5|$|When Kizirian was 15 years old, {{his father}} died. Harry became {{responsible}} {{for the care of}} himself and his mother. To take care of the family's immediate needs, Kizirian worked at a meat packing plant <b>unloading</b> <b>sides</b> of beef from freight cars. He then got a temporary position at the Providence post office for two years while finishing high school.|$|R
50|$|They {{were loaded}} {{from above and}} unloaded, like covered wagons, through the <b>side</b> doors. Because <b>unloading</b> {{involved}} a lot of manual work, alternatives were already being sought by the 1920s. In the 1950s the self-discharging wagon with roof (see below) completely ousted the lidded wagon from its original field of operations. The last large batch of lidded wagons was procured by the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1958.|$|R
50|$|The service east of Yonge Street {{bridge was}} {{terminated}} in the 1960s when that bridge was closed. The last commercial organization {{to use the}} spur east of Yonge Street was Dominion Coal whose coal silos were built in 1928. The switch connecting the spur to the <b>unloading</b> <b>siding</b> was removed when the Mount Pleasant bridge over the Belt Line was rebuilt in 1976. The silos were demolished in 2001.|$|R
50|$|The {{second type}} of slip sheet is the multi-lip slip sheet. This type of slip sheet is {{generally}} used on a container placed onto a railroad car or an ocean delivery vehicle due to the necessary loading/unloading patterns. This allows a loading device to load the slip sheet unit load from one <b>side</b> and an <b>unloading</b> device to unload the load from another side depending on the number and pattern of the remaining lips.|$|R
2500|$|The Voyages {{station is}} themed as a 17th-century ship, with the {{basement}} being the cargo hold, {{the second level}} being the deck, and the ride operator's controls being the [...] "Captain's Quarters". The station has three levels: a ground floor, a second floor, and a basement. Before entering the station, guests may be redirected to several outdoor queue switchbacks. Once the switchbacks have been navigated, guests enter {{the ground floor of}} the station. The ground floor includes two staircases to the basement; however, most of it is composed of maintenance areas. Depending {{on the size of the}} line, the park may or may not open the basement. If the basement is open, guests will walk down the stairs immediately after entering the ground floor of the station. The basement is filled with nothing but queue switchbacks. Once these switchbacks have been navigated, guests will walk up the stairs to the ground floor before continuing up the stairs to the second floor. The second floor of the station holds the roller coaster's loading and unloading areas, as well as the two transfer tracks and maintenance bays. On the loading side of the station there are fourteen air-powered queue gates, one for each row of the train. On the <b>unloading</b> <b>side</b> of the station there are free shelves and lockers that riders may use to hold their belongings for the duration of the ride. The <b>unloading</b> <b>side</b> is also home to the ride operator's controls and two exit gates: a sliding gate near the front of the train and a swinging gate near the rear of the train. Beyond the <b>unloading</b> <b>side</b> of the station is an area that holds two maintenance bays. These allow unused trains to be stored during normal operation and also provides an additional area for maintenance crews to inspect the roller coaster trains.|$|R
50|$|The line {{past the}} factory was opened on 24 March 1891, as the Outer Circle line, but the paper mill itself {{did not exist}} at this time. This section of the line was closed on 12 April 1893. It was not until 29 July 1919, that the line from Fairfield was reopened to the paper mill, and new sidings opened to serve it. From the Heidelberg Road - Chandler Highway intersection, the track left the {{alignment}} of the former Outer Circle railway, and slewed east into the mill itself. Once inside the factory, the siding spread into three branches: the east was used to unload paper pulp, the centre <b>siding</b> for <b>unloading</b> of coal wagons, and the western one being the longest running, almost to the mill's southern fence.|$|R

Finally, to confirm {{the validity of the}} derived circuit, calculated waveforms are compared with measured waveforms. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Ravens {{station is}} Gothic-themed, {{resembling}} a house one may {{find in the}} early 1800s, which was the time period Edgar Allan Poe published the rides theming inspiration, [...] "The Raven". The station has two accessible levels, though it is three or four stories tall in appearance. The first story of the station is at ground level; however, before entering the station, guests will encounter multiple, outdoor queue switchbacks. Once the switchbacks have been navigated, guests will walk directly under part of the roller coasters track and into the station. The first story of the station features only a small porch and a staircase {{leading up to the}} second story. The second story of the station holds the roller coasters loading and unloading areas. On the loading side of the station there are twelve air-powered queue gates, one for each row of the train. The loading side is also the location of the ride operators controls. On the <b>unloading</b> <b>side</b> of the station there are free shelves and lockers that riders may use to hold their belongings {{for the duration of the}} ride. The <b>unloading</b> <b>side</b> is also the location of a single sliding exit gate.|$|R
5000|$|The Legends {{station is}} themed after a schoolhouse {{such as the}} one Ichabod Crane taught at in [...] "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow". The station has only one {{accessible}} level, plus an enclosure for a school bell on the roof. Before entering the station, guests first go {{down a flight of stairs}} and under the roller coasters brake run. At the bottom of the stairs, there is a multitude of queue switchbacks, going all the way back to the beginning of the brake run and the final two turns of the ride. After navigating the switchbacks, guests walk up a flight of stairs that is right next to the third-to-last turn of the ride. At the top of the stairs guests enter the station, where more switchbacks must be navigated before continuing on to the loading area of the ride. On loading side of the station, there are twelve air-powered queue gates, one for each row of the train, as well as the pull handle for the bell. On the <b>unloading</b> <b>side</b> of the station there are free shelves and lockers that riders may use to hold their belongings for the duration of the ride. The <b>unloading</b> <b>side</b> is also the location of the ride operators controls and a single swinging exit gate.|$|R
500|$|The {{railway tunnel}} ran in a {{straight}} line for a distance of about [...] Along its west <b>side</b> was an <b>unloading</b> platform which gave access to ten cross galleries (numbered 3–13 by the Germans), driven at right angles to the main tunnel at intervals of [...] Each gallery was fitted with a [...] gauge railway track. On {{the east side of the}} tunnel were chambers intended to be used as store rooms, offices and quarters for the garrison.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{people with}} lateralized disorders, such as stroke, Weight-Bearing Asymmetry (WBA) is common. It is {{associated}} with postural instability, however, WBA {{is one of several}} abnormalities that may affect postural stability in these disorders. Therefore, we investigated the isolated effects of WBA on dynamic postural stability in healthy individuals. METHODS: Ten young participants were subjected to multidirectional stance perturbations by support surface translations at three levels of WBA (0, 10 and 20 % of body weight unloading of one leg). The stepping threshold was determined iteratively for each condition and in four perturbation directions (forward, backward, leftward and rightward). The stepping threshold was defined as the highest perturbation intensity recovered from with a feet-in-place response. The Margin of Stability (MOS) at the stepping threshold was defined as the smallest distance between the vertical projection of the Extrapolated Center of Mass (XCOM) and the edge of the base of support. RESULTS: WBA decreased the stepping threshold (stability decreased) for perturbations towards the loaded side (translations towards the <b>unloaded</b> <b>side),</b> whereas it increased stepping thresholds for perturbations towards the <b>unloaded</b> <b>side.</b> No significant effects of WBA were found on the MOS. WBA increased the frequency of stepping with the unloaded leg upon forward and backward perturbations. CONCLUSION: WBA increased dynamic stability towards the unloaded leg following external balance perturbations and resulted in a greater probability of stepping with this leg. Future studies are needed to evaluate the functional significance of these WBA-related effects on postural stability in people with lateralized disorders...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} depth onto the tooth flank of a jet of oil at different velocities {{pointed at the}} pitch line on the outgoing side of mesh was determined.

In some cases the jet will strike the loaded side of the teeth, and in others it will strike the <b>unloaded</b> <b>side</b> of the teeth. In nearly all cases the top land will be cooled regardless of the {{penetration depth}}, and postimpingement oil spray will usually provide adequate amounts of oil for lubrication but is marginal or inadequate for cooling...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the railway}} terminus, on the {{southern}} side of the railway formation, a stone embankment was built in 1902 by the OK Copper Mines Development Syndicate NL. The OK Mine, smelter and township complex was located {{to the north of}} Mungana and made good use of the latter's new railhead. The OK Company used the <b>siding</b> to <b>unloaded</b> coke (for its smelter) and stores (for the town), and load refined copper for export. At first horses did the carrying from Mungana to OK, but in 1905 the OK Company arranged for 400 camels to take over the carriage, managed by Abdul Wade's [...] "Bourke Carrying Company", which was also a shareholder in the OK Company. Within months Abdul Wade quickly replaced the camels with traction engines to overcome labour problems and because camels were too expensive to feed and were poisoned after eating native bushes. The six traction engines each capable of hauling eight tons cost £7,000. The embankment was still being used in 1913 after the OK smelters closed and miners had to cart the ore in to Mungana themselves for railing to the Chillagoe smelters.|$|R
40|$|Various {{methods have}} been {{employed}} to study the efficacy of multipurpose penetrating oils but these techniques do not investigate the rate which these oils penetrate surfaces. This paper outlines a novel, non-invasive ultrasonic method that provides a direct means of mapping fluid penetration in threaded systems. An apparatus with piezoelectric elements was developed to pulse ultrasonic waves into a nut specimen where the waves reflected from the threaded interface. The reflected signal amplitude shifted as fluid penetrated the thread, allowing the fluid to be mapped to provide a measure of ingress rate. The results for three fluid samples are presented. Measurements suggest the fluid tracks helically down the <b>unloaded</b> <b>side</b> of the thread and radially into the loaded thread surfaces...|$|R

By comparison with their sham-operated controls, it was observed in paraplegia a sustained increase of bone blood flow, a demineralization of the skeleton more pronounced in the trabecular bone of the epiphyse and metaphyse, a clearance of calcium 45 decreased and a temporary stimulation of bone marrow. This particular pattern was not modified by an oral administration of indomethacin. In a model of tibial unloading, a decrease in bone length on the other limb was observed and a diminished bone density and bone calcium load on the <b>unloading</b> <b>side.</b> This model was mainly related to a diminished growth on the overloaded limb.

The west gate was widened to ease access to Hanshin Koshien Stadium, covering a camphor tree in the south of the station. The east entrance is situated near the east gate making it easier for passengers to access the eastern area of the station. A large roof covers the center of the platforms and the tracks.|$|R
5000|$|In 1830, merchants from Alexandria, Virginia, {{which was}} still part of the District of Columbia at the time, {{proposed}} linking their city to Georgetown {{to capitalize on the}} new Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. [...] Congress granted a charter to the Alexandria Canal Company in 1830, and construction soon began on the Aqueduct Bridge that would carry canal boats across the Potomac River and downriver on the south <b>side</b> without <b>unloading</b> in Georgetown. The bridge was designed by Major William Turnbull. [...] Construction of the bridge and Alexandria Canal began in 1833, and both were completed in 1843. [...] To withstand Potomac ice floes, the piers were made of gneiss, with icebreakers made of granite. The water-filled bridge was a weatherproofed-timber, queen-post truss construction. The bridge was 110 ft wide across the top. It had eight piers, each set on riverbottom bedrock and 7 ft wide at the top. The third and sixth piers were 16 ft wide at the top. Each pier was designed so that its top was 30 ft above the mean high water level. A narrow carriageway ran alongside the bridge. Later, a separate level for pedestrian and carriage traffic was added to the bridge. The tolls from the addition inhibited trade between Georgetown and Virginia, thus benefiting Alexandrian businessmen who retained Virginian trade.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical method {{to calculate the}} buckling stress of a rectangular thin plate under nonuniform applied axial stresses. Two cases are considered, buckling of a plate simply supported on all four sides and buckling of a plate simply supported on three <b>sides</b> with one <b>unloaded</b> edge free and the opposite unloaded edge rotationally restrained. These two cases illustrate the influence of stress (moment) gradient on stiffened and unstiffened elements, respectively. The axial stress gradient is equilibrated by shear forces along the supported edges. A Rayleigh-Ritz solution with an assumed deflection function as {{a combination of a}} polynomial and trigonometric series is employed. Finite element analysis using ABAQUS validates the analytical model derived herein. The results help establish {{a better understanding of the}} stress gradient effect on typical thin plates and are intended to lead to the development of design provisions to account for the influence of moment gradient on local and distortional buckling of thin-walled beams...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{change in}} {{behaviors}} occurring beneath {{and around the}} foundation which caused by changes in foundation dimensions is studied numerically, by {{taking into account the}} interaction between earth and foundation. To do so, two dimensional and constant computational models with constant domain under uniform distributed load for both large and small foundation have been analyzed using ANSYS software, version 8. 1. The results of this analysis clearly show that the earth beneath and around small foundations is shearing and general failure mechanism, which {{is the same as the}} predicted behavior and accepted failure mechanism most researchers believe in. But, based on the results obtained from this research, the earth located in the central areas as well as the earth under the large foundations is mainly bearing compressive and comprehensive stresses having hardening. Consequently, their endurance is gradually increasing. Hence, the stress concentrations as well as the deformations are directed toward this region. In case loading is constant, the regions outside the foundation and beneath (the <b>sides)</b> bear <b>unloading</b> (localization). While footing dimensions increase, rigid wedge angle will be increased up to 90 °. Thus, the failure mechanism in large foundations is local and forming a resistant. Such resistance creates bearing column beneath the foundation and punching effect which happens between the earths under the vicinity of the foundation is clearly seen. Namely, if soil behavior and properties change, the foundation geometry will change as well. So, with regard to geometry increase and with the change in the behaviors of the earth material, the stiffness matrix changes which is in the form of coupled...|$|R
40|$|Two {{versions}} of the planetary reduction stages from U. S. Army OH- 58 helicopter main rotor transmissions were tested at NASA Lewis.

Typical stress variations as the gear tooth moves through mesh are illustrated. At the tooth root location of the thin rimmed sun gear, a significant stress was produced by a phenomenon other than the passing of a planet gear. The load variation among the planets was studied. Each planet produced its own distinctive load distribution on the ring and sun gears. The load variation was less for a three planet, nonsequential design as compared to that of a four planet, sequential design. The reported results enhance the data base for gear stress levels and provide data for the validation of analytical methods...|$|R
