40|$|Xenotransplantation is {{considered}} to be a solution for the human donor shortage. However, there is a potential risk of transmitting animal infections from the transplanted organ. The known transmissibility and clinical significance of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection after allotransplantation led us to evaluate whether baboon cytomegalovirus (BCMV) transmission could occur after a baboon-to-human liver xenotransplant. We examined serial blood samples from a baboon liver recipient and isolated replication-competent CMV-like agents on days 29, 36, and 42 after xenotransplantation. BCMV and HCMV DNAs were detected in the day 29 isolate, while only HCMV DNA was detected in the other isolates.

40|$|Leptospirosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease of global distribution, maintained in nature by chronic renal infection of carrier animals.

40|$|A {{microbial}} {{basis for}} bioreductive generation of phosphine is proposed, which could account {{at least in}} part for the presence of this toxic gas in natural anaerobic environments and in sewage and landfill gases. Phosphine generation under anaerobic growth conditions was dependent upon both the culture inoculum <b>source</b> (<b>animal</b> faeces) and enrichment culture conditions. Phosphine was detected in headspace gases from mixed cultures under conditions promoting fermentative growth of mixed acid and butyric acid bacteria, either in {{the presence or absence of}} methane generation. Monoseptic cultures of certain mixed acid fermenters (Escherichia coli, Salmonella gallinarum, and Salmonella arizonae) and solvent fermenters (Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium acetobutyricum and Clostridium cochliarium) also generated phosphine. Such fermentative bacteria participate in the multi-stage process of methanogenesis in nature. Generation of phosphine by these bacteria, rather than by methanoarchaea themselves, could explain the apparent correlation between methanogenesis and the formation of phosphine in nature. NER...|$|E

Several preparations of injectable HA used {{for clinical use}} include Synvisc® and Synvisc-One® (Genzyme); Gel-One® (Zimmer); Hyalgan® (Fidia); Supartz FX™ (Bioventus); Orthovisc® (Anika); Euflexxa®, previously named Nuflexxa (Savient); Monovisc® (Anika Therapeutics); and Gel-Syn™ (Institut Biochimique SA) [25]. Each product differs in many characteristics, including <b>source</b> (<b>animal</b> versus bacterial bio-fermentation using modified organisms), mean molecular weight ranging from (500 to 6000  kDa), distribution of molecular weight, molecular structure (linear, cross-linked or both), method of crosslinking, concentration (0.8 – 30  mg/mL), volume of injection (0.5 – 6.0  mL), and posology [26]. Although Animal source of HA (rooster combs) was considered as a traditional source for many years. However, many investigations have been performed to develop alternatives for obtaining HA, such as bio-fermentation using genetically modified organisms. This modified bacterial source is currently used as the main source as it’s associated with lower costs and less side effects [27, 28].|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Although {{several major}} {{immunologic}} hurdles {{need to be}} overcome, the pig is currently considered the most likely <b>source</b> <b>animal</b> of cells, tissues and organs for transplantation into humans. Concerns have been raised {{with regard to the}} potential for the transfer of infectious agents with the transplanted organ to the human recipient. This risk is perceived to be increased as {{it is likely that the}} patient will be iatrogenically immunocompromised and the organ-source pig may be genetically engineered in such a way to render its organs particularly susceptible to infection with human viruses. Furthermore, the risk may not be restricted to the recipient, but may have consequences for the health of others in the community. The identification of porcine endogenous retroviruses and of hitherto unknown viruses have given rise to the most concern. We document here the agents we believe should be excluded from the organ-source pigs. We discuss the likelihood of achieving this aim and outline the potential means by which it may best be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} a sample that received human rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in Virginia {{as a result}} of animal exposures in 2002 and 2003 and {{to determine the extent to}} which PEP decisions were appropriate. Methods: PEP surveillance data were requested from 35 Virginia health districts within 5 regions. Retrospective chart review was used to gather demographic, exposure and <b>source</b> <b>animal</b> data from patient records and animal exposure reports. Descriptive statistics are presented. True exposures and appropriateness of PEP were defined using the 2004 Virginia Rabies Control Guidelines and the Recommendations of the 1999 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The 2003 sample was analyzed for appropriateness of PEP because it was more representative than the 2002 sample. Stepwise syntax was created in SPSS utilizing 3 key decision variables and the 2004 Virginia Rabies Control Guidelines Algorithm for PEP decisions to determine appropriateness of PEP. Results: The 2002 and 2003 sample consisted of 838 PEP records, (73. 6 %) of 1139 PEP reported to the Division of Zoonotic and Environmental Epidemiology (central office of the Virginia Department of Health). Most PEP patients were young (mean 32. 3 years) and had true exposures during spring or summer that resulted from approaching and handling a potentially rabid animal. Over half of the source animals were not captured. For the analysis of appropriateness, 55. 2 % (270 / 489) of PEP was appropriate, 22. 5 % (110 / 489) was inappropriate and 22. 3 % (109 / 489) of PEP had missing data on key decision variables. Inappropriate PEP primarily resulted from not true exposures [79 % (87 / 110) ]. Group exposures represented 42 % more inappropriate PEP than individual exposures. Conclusion: Much PEP could be avoided in Virginia if more source animals were captured. The majority of inappropriate PEP occurred because PEP was given for exposures that were not true. New educational strategies for health care providers, public health personnel and the public are recommended to reduce the number of inappropriate PEP. Standardization of data collection methods, linking human and <b>source</b> <b>animal</b> data, computerization and formation of a central database are recommended to improve human rabies PEP surveillance in Virginia...|$|E
40|$|Development of feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) infection in cats {{as a small}} animal model for lentiviral immunodeficiency disease has been hampered by the prolonged and variable disease course following experimental infection. To address this issue, we generated high-titer, unselected FIV stocks by pooling plasma from cats acutely infected with a subgroup C FIV isolate designated CABCpadyOOC (FIV-C-PGammer). Subsequent infection with this virus pool resulted in rapidly progressive, fatal disease in greater than 50 % of infected cats. Accelerated FIV disease was characterized by rapid and progressive CD 4 + T-cell loss, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, lymphoid depletion, and severe thymic atrophy. Mortality and rate of disease progression were affected {{by the age of}} each cat at infection and whether the virus <b>source</b> <b>animal</b> was in the acute or chronic stage of infection. The rapid FIV disease syndrome was consistently associated with systemic lymphoid depletion, clinical disease, and susceptibility to opportunistic infections, analogous to accelerated and/or terminal HIV- 1 infection.

Chronic myocardial ischemia was induced in eight adult sheep by anterior coronary artery legation. Forty-five days after coronary artery legation, sheep underwent autologous myoblasts implantation to the infarct area to improve local tissue regeneration. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals before and after the induced coronary ischemia and myoblast implantation and serum levels of cTnI were assessed with chemiluminescent immunodosage using a commercially available anti-human cTnI monoclonal antibody. cTnI levels began to increase the day after coronary legation and after myoblast implantation and gradually recovered to physiological levels in the next 14 days. Furthermore, the commercial anti-human antibody was shown to completely cross react with the ovine polypeptide as well as with canine, swine and equine sera...|$|E

However, {{few studies have examined}} the impact of higher protein breakfasts with differing protein sources. Our objective was to determine if protein <b>source</b> (<b>animal</b> protein (AP) versus plant protein (PP)) influences postprandial metabolic response in participants consuming a high protein breakfast (~ 30 % energy from protein). Normal weight (NW; n= 12) and overweight women (OW; n= 8) aging 18 – 36 were recruited to participate. Participants completed two visits in a randomized, cross-over design with one week between visits. Subjects had 15 minutes to consume each breakfast. Blood glucose and appetite were assessed at baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes postprandial. Participants kept a 24 -hour dietary record for the duration of each test day. No difference was found between NW and OW participants or breakfasts for postprandial appetite responses. AP had a significantly lower glucose response at 30 minutes compared with PP (− 11. 6 %; 127 ± 4 versus 112 ± 4 [*]mg/dL; P< 0. 05) and a slower return to baseline. There was no difference in daily energy intake between breakfasts. These data suggest that protein source may influence postprandial glucose response without significantly impacting appetite response in breakfast consumers...|$|E
40|$|Xenotransplantation {{faces the}} dilemma of an {{unlimited}} supply of cells, tissues and organs {{on the one hand}} and severe obstacles and limits on the other. One reason for the limitations is that the <b>source</b> <b>animal</b> of choice, the pig, and the human recipient separated 90 million years ago during evolution, a time in which biological characteristics such as anatomy, physiology and immunology have had much time to drift far apart. The acceptance of such an evolutionary widely divergent organ, especially the heart of a pig, could evoke refusal of xenotransplantation in conservative and religious patients. New legal aspects of allocation of xenografts have therefore to be reflected upon and appropriate guidelines developed. Inquiries show, however, that the acceptance of all types of porcine organs would be high if the quality of life after receiving such a xenograft is comparable to that after receiving the same allograft. This individual benefit of a xenograft could lead to a disregard of the collective risk in terms of xenozoonoses, often presented as a catastrophic scenarium. Therefore, transplantation societies and ethics committees have published comments and even guidelines for handling future clinical xenotransplantation. All three monotheistic religions and Hinduism support the idea of saving and improving human life with the help of an animal organ. Copyrght (C) 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel. ...|$|E
