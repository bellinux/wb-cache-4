5|$|From {{the point}} of view of sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} is related to Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the <b>spectral</b> sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris <b>spectral</b> sequence) in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This <b>spectral</b> sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} Adams <b>spectral</b> sequence has E2 term {{given by}} the Ext groups ExtA(p)∗,∗(Zp,Zp) over the mod p Steenrod algebra A(p), and converges to something {{closely related to the}} p-component of the stable homotopy groups. The initial terms of the Adams <b>spectral</b> sequence are themselves quite hard to compute: this is sometimes done using an auxiliary <b>spectral</b> sequence called the May <b>spectral</b> sequence.|$|E
5|$|Although some {{radio waves}} are emitted {{directly}} by astronomical objects, {{a product of}} thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed {{is the result of}} synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields. Additionally, a number of <b>spectral</b> lines produced by interstellar gas, notably the hydrogen <b>spectral</b> line at 21cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|At {{least four}} of the fifteen stars visible to the unaided eye are orange giants of <b>spectral</b> class K. The second {{brightest}} star in the constellation—at apparent magnitude 4.1—is Zeta Telescopii, an orange subgiant of <b>spectral</b> type K1III-IV. Around 1.53 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 512 times its luminosity. Located 127 light years away from Earth, it {{has been described as}} yellow or reddish in appearance. Epsilon Telescopii is a binary star system: the brighter component, Epsilon Telescopii A, is an orange giant of <b>spectral</b> type K0III with an apparent magnitude of +4.52, while the 13th magnitude companion, Epsilon Telescopii B, is 21 arcseconds away from the primary, and just visible with a 15cm aperture telescope on a dark night. The system is 417 light-years away. Iota Telescopii and HD 169405—magnitude 5 orange giants of <b>spectral</b> types K0III and K0.5III respectively—make up the quartet. They are around 370 and 497 light-years away from the Sun respectively. Another ageing star, Kappa Telescopii is a yellow giant with a <b>spectral</b> type G9III and apparent magnitude of 5.18. Around 1.87 billion years old, this star of around 1.6 solar masses has swollen to 11 times the Sun's diameter. It is approximately 293 light-years from Earth, and is another optical double.|$|E
5|$|Close {{examination}} of the <b>spectral</b> lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, <b>spectral</b> lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single <b>spectral</b> line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple <b>spectral</b> lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of <b>spectral</b> lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E
5|$|Eta Circini is {{a yellow}} giant of <b>spectral</b> type G8III and {{magnitude}} 5.17, located around 276light-years distant, and Zeta Circini is a blue-white main sequence star of <b>spectral</b> type B3V and magnitude 6.09, located around 1273light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Lambda Tucanae is {{an optical}} double—that is, {{the name is}} given to two stars (Lambda1 and Lambda2) which appear close {{together}} from our viewpoint, but are in fact far apart in space. Lambda1 is itself a binary star, with two components—a yellow-white star of <b>spectral</b> type F7IV-V and an apparent magnitude of 6.22, and a yellow main sequence star of <b>spectral</b> type G1V and an apparent magnitude of 7.28. The system is 186 light-years distant. Lambda2 is an orange subgiant of <b>spectral</b> type K2III that is expanding and cooling and has left the main sequence. Of apparent magnitude 5.46, it is approximately 220 light-years distant from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Pavo {{contains}} several {{variable stars}} of note. Lambda Pavonis {{is a bright}} irregular variable ranging between magnitudes 3.4 and 4.4; this variation can be observed with the unaided eye. Classed as a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable or shell star, it is of <b>spectral</b> type B2II-IIIe and lies around 1430 light years distant from Earth. Kappa Pavonis is a W Virginis variable—a subclass of Type II Cepheid. It ranges from magnitude 3.91 to 4.78 over 9 days and is a yellow-white supergiant pulsating between <b>spectral</b> classes F5I-II and G5I-II. NU and V Pavonis are pulsating semiregular variable red giant stars. NU has a <b>spectral</b> type M6III and ranges from magnitude 4.9 to 5.3, while V Pavonis ranges from magnitude 6.3 to 8.2 over two periods of 225.4 and 3735 days concurrently. V is a carbon star of <b>spectral</b> type C6,4(Nb) with a prominent red hue.|$|E
5|$|The Serre <b>spectral</b> {{sequence}} {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the nth homotopy group of a space X is the first homotopy group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first homology group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of X to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre <b>spectral</b> sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre <b>spectral</b> sequence tends to have many non-zero differentials, which are hard to control, and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful <b>spectral</b> sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.|$|E
5|$|The raven's breast {{is marked}} by Beta Corvi, a star of {{magnitude}} 2.7 located 146 ± 1 light-years from Earth. Roughly 206 million years old and 3.7 ± 1 times as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted its core hydrogen and expanded and cooled to a surface temperature of around 5,100K {{and is now a}} yellow bright giant star of <b>spectral</b> type G5II. It likely spent most of its existence as a blue-white main sequence star of <b>spectral</b> type B7V. Bearing the proper name of Minkar and marking the raven's nostril is Epsilon Corvi, located some 318 ± 5 light-years from Earth. It is a red giant of <b>spectral</b> type K2III that is around 54 times the Sun's radius and 930 times its luminosity. Around 4 times as massive as the Sun, it spent much of its life as a main-sequence star of <b>spectral</b> type B5V. Lying to the south of the quadrilateral between Beta and Epsilon Corvi is the orange-hued 6 Corvi, an ageing giant star of <b>spectral</b> type K1III that is around 70 times as luminous as the Sun. It is 331 ± 10 light-years away from Earth.|$|E

25|$|Spectra {{of atoms}} and {{molecules}} often {{consist of a}} series of <b>spectral</b> lines, each one representing a resonance between two different quantum states.

The hydrogen <b>spectral</b> series in particular was first successfully explained by the Rutherford-Bohr quantum model of the hydrogen atom.

25|$|Flame color {{depends on}} several factors, the most {{important}} typically being black-body radiation and <b>spectral</b> band emission, with both <b>spectral</b> line emission and <b>spectral</b> line absorption playing smaller roles. In {{the most common type}} of flame, hydrocarbon flames, {{the most important}} factor determining color is oxygen supply and the extent of fuel-oxygen pre-mixing, which determines the rate of combustion and thus the temperature and reaction paths, thereby producing different color hues.|$|E
