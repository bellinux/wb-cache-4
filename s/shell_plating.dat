5|$|During early August 1940, {{while she}} was still being {{outfitted}} and was in a semi-complete state, Prince of Wales was attacked by German aircraft. One bomb fell between the ship and a wet basin wall, narrowly missing a 100-ton dockside crane, and exploded underwater below the bilge keel. The explosion took place about six feet from the ship's port side {{in the vicinity of the}} after group of 5.25-inch guns. Buckling of the <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> took place over a distance of 20 to , rivets were sprung and considerable flooding took place in the port outboard compartments in the area of damage, causing a ten-degree port list. The flooding was severe, due to the fact that final compartment air tests had not yet been made and the ship did not have her pumping system in operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{round bow}} of Murtaja was modeled after Eisbrecher I, a German {{icebreaker}} designed by engineer Ferdinand Steinhaus from Hamburg and built in 1871, even though Robert Runeberg, an experienced Finnish naval architect {{and son of}} the national poet of Finland, had recommended a sharper ice-cutting bow instead of the spoon-shaped one. The angle of the stem, {{the first part of}} the icebreaker to encounter ice and bend it under the weight of the ship, was 33 degrees. The hull was extremely strong for its size and the <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> thickness at the ice belt, , was twice as thick as in the strongest winter ships at that time.|$|E

25|$|The Finnish {{ice class}} rules {{published}} in 1932 introduced the ice classes 1A, 1B and 1C for ships strengthened for navigation in ice, ice class 2 for ships classified for unrestricted service but not strengthened for navigation in ice and ice class 3 for other vessels. Ice class 2 was further divided to two subclasses, 2A and 2B, and vessels {{were eligible for}} the former {{if they had a}} radio. Detailed minimum requirements, again as an additional percentage of the open water requirement, were given for the stem, <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> at the waterline, stiffeners, rudder and rudder bearings, and the propulsion machinery. In the lowest ice class, 1C, the requirements were limited to the bow of the vessel.|$|E
500|$|The mines caused {{extensive}} {{damage to the}} ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated [...] off the port bow. A fuel oil tank was ruptured, <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> was torn, a large indentation was formed {{in the bottom of}} the ship, and bulkheads in the double bottom buckled. Some [...] of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a list of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No. 1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings. The ship's two Arado Ar 196 floatplanes were thrown by the explosive concussion and completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin remarked that the successful repair effort was [...] "one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War." [...] Repairs lasted until 2 April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contours}} of Poltavas hull were slightly sharper compared to its progenitors Riga, Vyborg and Pernov. This was {{criticized by the}} Englishman John Dan, who served from 1711 to 1722 as a naval officer in the Russian Navy. Dan believed the ship was too narrow in the stern and would not withstand open sea waves. The top part of the hull was bent inwards in order to hinder boarding from an attacking vessel. The <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> was about [...] thick.|$|E

2500|$|The first Finnish {{ice class}} rules that {{included}} the fairway fees were published in 1920. According to the rules the ships were to pay [...] "ice fees" [...] according to their net register tonnage, classification and strengthening for navigation in ice during the winter season, which began on 1 December and ended on 16 April in the Gulf of Finland and in the Bothnian Sea, and from 1 November until 1 May in the northern parts of the Gulf of Bothnia. In 1923 a circular about the classification of ice-strengthened ships {{was sent to the}} largest classification societies. The ice strengthening of the hull was defined as a percentage that was added to the minimum requirements set by the classification societies, such as 45% increase in <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> thickness.|$|E

50|$|The Greek-derived name Polyplacophora {{comes from}} the words poly- (many), plako- (tablet), and -phoros (bearing), a {{reference}} to the chiton's eight <b>shell</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chitons have a shell {{composed}} of eight separate <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> or valves. These plates overlap slightly {{at the front}} and back edges, and yet articulate well with one another. Because of this, the shell provides protection {{at the same time as}} permitting the chiton to flex upward when needed for locomotion over uneven surfaces, and even allows the animal to curl up into a ball when dislodged from rocks. The <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> are encircled by a skirt known as a girdle.|$|R
40|$|By {{evolving}} bilaterally separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates,</b> bivalves {{acquired a}} unique body plan {{in which their}} soft tissues are completely protected by hard <b>shell</b> <b>plates.</b> In this unique body plan, mobility between the separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> is provided by novel structures such as a ligament and adductor muscles. As a first step towards understanding how the bivalve body plan was established, we investigated {{the development of the}} separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> and ligament. Over 100 years ago, it was hypothesized that the development of separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> is tightly linked with the unique cell cleavage (division) pattern of bivalves during development, wherein each bilateral daughter cell of the 2 d descendant 2 d 1121 develops into one of the bilateral shell fields. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by tracing the cell lineages of the Japanese purple mussel Septifer virgatus. Although the shell fields were found to be exclusively derived from the bilateral descendant cells of 2 d: 2 d 11211 and 2 d 11212, the descendants of these cells were not restricted to shell fields alone, nor were they confined to the left or right side of the shell field based on their lineage. Our study demonstrated that ligament cells are also derived from 2 d 11211 and 2 d 11212, indicating that the ligament cells emerged as a subpopulation of shell field cells. This also suggests that the establishment of the novel developmental system for the ligament cells was critical for the evolution of the unique body plan of bivalves...|$|R

5000|$|Short and stubby icebreakers are {{generally}} built using transverse framing {{in which the}} <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> is stiffened with frames placed about 400 to 1000 mm apart as opposed to longitudinal framing used in longer ships. Near the waterline, the frames running in vertical direction distribute the local ice loads on the <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> to longitudinal girders called stringers, which in turn are supported by web frames and bulkheads that carry the global hull loads. While the <b>shell</b> <b>plating,</b> which is {{in direct contact with}} the ice, can be up to 50 mm thick in older polar icebreakers, the use of high strength steel with yield strength up to [...] in modern icebreakers results in the same structural strength with smaller material thicknesses and lower steel weight. Regardless of the strength, the steel used in the hull structures of an icebreaker must be capable of resisting brittle fracture in low ambient temperatures and high loading conditions, both of which are typical for operations in ice-filled waters.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{operculum}} {{is a novel}} {{structure in}} gastropod molluscs. Because the operculum shows notable similarities to the <b>shell</b> <b>plate,</b> we asked whether there were an evolutionary link between these two secretory organs. We found {{that some of the}} genes involved in shell-field development are expressed in the operculum, such as dpp and grainyhead, whereas engrailed and Hox 1 are not. Specific knockdown of dpp by injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) resulted in malformation of the <b>shell</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> was smaller due to failure of activation of cell proliferation in the shell-field margin. The expressions of grainyhead and chitin synthase 1 in the shell field margin were suppressed by dpp-dsRNA. However, matrix secretion was not completely abolished, and the expressions of ferritin, engrailed or Hox 1 were not affected by dpp-dsRNA, indicating that dpp is partly involved in the developmental pathway for shell matrix secretion. We also present evidence that dpp performs a key role in operculum development. Indeed, dpp-dsRNA impaired matrix secretion in the operculum as well as expression of grainyhead. Based on these observations that dpp is important for development of both the <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> and operculum, we conclude that co-option of dpp to the posterior part of the foot contributed to the innovation of the operculum in gastropods...|$|R

50|$|In {{longitudinal}} framing, {{very heavy}} transverse frames are spaced much further apart than in traditional framing - about 12 ft A {{large number of}} longitudinal frames are then attached to hold the <b>shell</b> <b>plating.</b> The longitudinal frames at the sides fit into notches cut into the transverse frames, while the ones {{near the bottom of}} the ship are sometimes made continuous between transverse bulkheads.

Strong tie bars extend from the face angle on the transverses to the tank top plating.
