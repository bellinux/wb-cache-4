40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{we propose}} a leg-shaped robot (Leg-Robot) with a magnetorheolo-gical fluid clutch (MRFC) to {{demonstrate}} virtual haptic of <b>spastic</b> <b>movements</b> of brain-injured patients.

Then, control meth-ods and experimental results of three types of <b>spastic</b> <b>movements</b> are described...|$|R

50|$|Stage 2: Stage 2, {{also known}} as the {{excitement}} stage, is the period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity.

40|$|Abstract. We present {{our efforts}} towards a multi-camera mouse-replacement system for {{computer}} users with severe motion impairments. We {{have worked with}} individuals with cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis who use a publiclyavailable interface that tracks the user’s head movements with a single video camera and translates them into mouse pointer coordinates on the screen. To address the problem that the interface can lose track of the user’s facial feature due to occlusion or <b>spastic</b> <b>movements,</b> we started to develop a multi-camera interface. Our multi-camera capture system can record synchronized images from multiple cameras and automatically analyze the camera arrangement. We recorded 15 subjects while they were conducting a hands-free interaction experiment. We reconstructed via stereoscopy the three-dimensional movement trajectories of various facial features. Our analysis shows that single-camera interfaces based on twodimensional feature tracking neglect {{to take into account}} the substantial feature movement in the third dimension. ...|$|R

40|$|Neuroexcitatory {{peptides}} (NEX) in the A-superfamily of peptides in {{the venom}} of fish-hunting cone snails {{are known to}} cause tetanic paralysis (<b>spastic</b> <b>movements</b> due to overstimulation of neurons). The precise mechanism by which NEX peptides cause tetanic paralysis and their molecular target remains unknown. One prevalent NEX peptide in the prey-injected venom of Conus catus is c 4 a, which is similar in sequence and mass to another NEX peptide of C. catus, c 4 e. Based on previous research done in our lab, we hypothesized that a possible molecular target for NEX peptides is the persistent sodium current. In this study we used a spinal motility assay of larval zebrafish, Danio rerio, to compare the physiological effects of our NEX peptides with pharmacological reagents. We tested two pharmacological reagents: SKA- 31, an activator of certain types of Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels and veratridine, which activates persistent-like sodium currents. Our data showed that at high doses SKA- 31 interferes with the stimulation of the CPG and antagonizes the effect of c 4 a/e in zebrafish larva. This is notable because the activation of Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels interferes with the persistent sodium current. Our data also shows that veratridine induces low levels of c 4 a/e-like spastic activity {{at a very high}} dose suggesting different selectivities of veratridine and c 4 a/e for their targets. Veratridine is the first neuroexcitatory molecule, beside c 4 a/e, to induce motility in our assay. This helps to strengthen our hypothesis that NEX peptides, like c 4 a/e, target the persistent sodium current...|$|R
50|$|Children {{and adults}} in wheelchairs or seating devices that are rigid and/or semi-reclined can require {{significant}} physical {{effort to change}} their body posture on their own. Additionally, positioning accessories may be restrictive {{in an effort to}} counteract low tone, to restrain involuntary <b>spastic</b> <b>movement,</b> or to optimize body symmetry. Unfortunately, such positioning effectively prevents development of active postural movement control. Since the spinal motion of these individuals is constrained between their secured pelvis and the backrest of the wheelchair or chair, their potential to acquire an improved ability for active postural repositioning is negligible. Their movement can be limited to that of the upper extremities only. Thus, for wheelchair users, this static body posture may not only lead to physical strain, discomfort, and health issues, but can also interfere with performance of functional movement tasks.|$|E

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: Therapeutic {{options for}} stringhalt in horses are limited, whereas medical {{experiences}} with botulinum toxin type A (Botox) have been positive. To evaluate its effectiveness in horses, surface electromyography (sEMG) signals {{before and after}} injection need to be quantified. HYPOTHESIS: Treatment of healthy ponies and cases with Botox should reduce muscle activity in injected muscles and reduce <b>spastic</b> <b>movements</b> without adverse side effects. METHODS: Unilaterally, the extensor digitorum longus, extensor digitorum lateralis and lateral vastus muscles of 6 healthy mature Shetland ponies and 2 talented Dutch Warmblood dressage horses with stringhalt were injected (maximum of 400 iu per pony and 700 iu per case; 100 iu in 5 ml NaCl divided into 5 injections) with Botox under needle EMG guidance. Surface EMG data were evaluated using customised software, and in the individuals gait was analysed using Proreflex. Statistical analysis was performed using mixed models and independent sample t test (P < 0. 05). RESULTS: Surface EMG signals were quantified using customised software. The area under the curve (integrated EMG) in time was used as variable. It became significantly reduced in injected muscles after injection of Botox in normal ponies (P < 0. 05). This effect was present from Day 1 until Day 84 after injection. In the 2 cases, after injection of 3 muscles, the integrated EMG in time became significantly reduced in all 3 muscles. Kinematic measurements confirmed reduction of frequency and amplitude of hyperflexing or hyperabducting strides of the affected hindlimbs. The duration of effect was also seen in the cases until around 12 weeks after injection. CONCLUSIONS AND POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: After EMG guided injections of Botox, sEMG signals recorded from injected muscle were reduced, which proves {{this to be a}} useful tool in statistically evaluating a treatment effect. The positive results of this pilot study encourage further research with a larger group of clinical case...|$|R

50|$|Assessment of a {{movement}} disorder featuring spasticity may involve several health professionals depending on the affected individual's situation, and the severity of their condition. This may include physical therapists, physicians (including neurologists and rehabilitation physicians), orthotists and occupational therapists. Assessment is needed of the affected individual's goals, their function, and any symptoms that {{may be related to}} the movement disorder, such as pain. A thorough assessment will include analysis of posture, active movement, muscle strength, movement control and coordination, and endurance, as well as spasticity (response of the muscle to stretch). Spastic muscles typically demonstrate a loss of selective movement, including a loss of eccentric control (decreased ability to actively lengthen). While multiple muscles in a limb are usually affected in the upper motor neuron syndrome, there is usually an imbalance of activity, such that there is a stronger pull in one direction, such as into elbow flexion. Decreasing the degree of this imbalance is a common focus of muscle strengthening programs. <b>Spastic</b> <b>movement</b> disorders also typically feature a loss of stabilisation of an affected limb or the head from the trunk, so a thorough assessment requires this to be analysed as well.|$|E
40|$|Antispastic {{medications}} that are directed to reduce clinical signs of spasticity, such as exaggerated reflexes and muscle tone, do not improve the movement disorder. Medication can even increase weakness which might interfere with functional movements, such as walking. In clinical practice, signs of exaggerated tendon tap reflexes associated with muscle hypertonia are {{the consequence of}} spinal cord injury (SCI). They are generally thought {{to be responsible for}} <b>spastic</b> <b>movement</b> disorders. Most antispastic treatments are, therefore, directed at the reduction of reflex activity. In recent years, a discrepancy between spasticity as measured in the clinic and functional <b>spastic</b> <b>movement</b> disorder was noticed, which is primarily due to the different roles of reflexes in passive and active states, respectively. We now know that central motor lesions are associated with loss of supraspinal drive and defective use of afferent input with impaired behaviour of short-latency and long-latency reflexes. These changes lead to paresis and maladaptation of the movement pattern. Secondary changes in mechanical muscle fibre, collagen tissue, and tendon properties (e. g., loss of sarcomeres, subclinical contractures) result in spastic muscle tone, which in part compensates for paresis and allows functional movements on a simpler level of organisation. Antispastic drugs should primarily be applied in complete SCI. In mobile patients they can accentuate paresis and therefore should be applied with caution...|$|E

500|$|A user's motor abilities, {{communication}} skills and needs, cognition and vision are assessed {{in order to}} determine the most appropriate match to a communication system. Depending on the individual's physical status, recommendations of an alternative access method, a change in seating/positioning, a mounting system and/or communication aid adaptations may be needed. For example, someone with <b>spastic</b> arm <b>movements</b> may require a key guard on top of the keyboard or touchscreen to reduce the selection of non-target items. The person's needs and abilities determine the symbols chosen and their organization, with the goal being that the communication system can be used as efficiently as possible in different contexts, with different communication partners, and for different social purposes. Researcher Janice Light identified four social purposes of communicative interaction in AAC: the expression of needs and wants to a listener, the transfer of information as in more general conversation, the development of social closeness through such things as jokes and cheering, and finally social etiquette practices such as [...] "please" [...] and [...] "thank you". These four purposes vary in terms of the relative importance of the content, rate, duration and the focus of the interaction. It is important that the AAC systems selected also reflect the priorities of the individual and their family. In Western cultures, professionals may see a communication device as helping to promote an individual's self-determination, i.e., the ability to make one's own decisions and choices. However, cultural and religious factors may affect the degree to which individual autonomy is a valued construct, and influence family attitudes towards AAC.|$|R
40|$|Hiccups are a spasmodic {{contraction}} of the diaphragm and usually transient phenomenon that affects nearly everyone.

40|$|Botulinum toxin, one of {{the most}} {{poisonous}} biological substances known, is a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. C. botulinum elaborates eight antigenically distinguishable exotoxins (A, B, C 1, C 2, D, E, F and G). All serotypes interfere with neural transmission by blocking the release of acetylcholine, the principal neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction, causing muscle paralysis. The weakness induced by injection with botulinum toxin A usually lasts about three months. Botulinum toxins now play a very significant role in the management {{of a wide variety of}} medical conditions, especially strabismus and focal dystonias, hemifacial spasm, and various <b>spastic</b> <b>movement</b> disorders, headaches, hypersalivation, hyperhidrosis, and some chronic conditions that respond only partially to medical treatment. The list of possible new indications is rapidly expanding. The cosmetological applications include correction of lines, creases and wrinkling all over the face, chin, neck, and chest to dermatological applications such as hyperhidrosis.

40|$|Head injury {{has often}} been {{described}} as the 'silent epidemic of the twentieth century', for whilst it is estimated that about one in every three hundred families will be affected by the condition', the public as a whole knows relatively little about it. Furthermore as an increasing number of the more severely brain injured are now surviving due to advances in medical and scientific technology, both the skills and resources of the rehabilitationists are being stretched to new limits. The physical problems that may result from injury are frequently diverse and complex in their presentation, the situation often being further compounded by cognitive deficits, as well as orthopaedic and respiratory complications. However, in general terms and particularly in the early stages, the problems that pose the most significant obstacles in rehabilitation are due to the presence of abnormal tonus and the development of severe spasticity 2. These can be summarised broadly as follows: * Contracture and deformity (fig 1) * Establishment of abnormal <b>spastic</b> patterns of <b>movement</b> with consequent loss of * postural control and selectivity * Myositis Ossificans * Pain and trauma due to joint mar-alignment and superimposed trauma In order to control, as far as is possible the development of these problems, therapy has necessarily undergone a significant evolution in recent years.

40|$|Spasticity {{associated}} with abnormal muscle tone {{is a common}} motor disorder following stroke, and the spastic ankle may affect ambulatory function. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the short-term effect of dynamic-repeated-passive ankle movements with weight loading on ambulatory function and spastic hypertonia of chronic stroke patients. In this study, 12 chronic stroke patients with ankle spasticity and inefficient ambulatory ability were enrolled. Stretching of the plantar-flexors of the ankle in the standing position for 15 minutes was performed passively by a constant-speed and electrically powered device. The following evaluations were done before and immediately after the dynamic-repeated-passive ankle <b>movements.</b> <b>Spastic</b> hypertonia was assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS; range, 0 – 4), Achilles tendon reflexes test (DTR; range, 0 – 4), and ankle clonus (range, 0 – 5). Improvement in ambulatory ability was determined by the timed up-and-go test (TUG), the 10 -minute walking test, and cadence (steps/minute). In addition, subjective experience of the influence of ankle spasticity on ambulation was scored by visual analog scale (VAS). Subjective satisfaction with the therapeutic effect of spasticity reduction was evaluated by a five-point questionnaire (1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = acceptable, 4 = good, 5 = very good). By comparison of the results before and after intervention, these 12 chronic stroke patients presented significant reduction in MAS and VAS for ankle spasticity, the time for TUG and 10 -minute walking speed (p < 0. 01). The cadence also increased significantly (p < 0. 05). In addition, subjective satisfaction with the short-term therapeutic effect was mainly good (ranging from acceptable to very good). In conclusion, 15 minutes of dynamic-repeated-passive ankle joint motion exercise with weight loading in the standing position by this simple constant-speed machine is effective in reducing ankle spasticity and improving ambulatory ability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT A) is the {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} cervical dystonia. However, although BoNT A has a favorable safety profile and {{is effective in}} the majority of patients, in some cases the treatment out-come is disappointing or side effects occur when higher doses are used. It is likely that in such cases either the target muscles were not injected accurately or unintended weakness of non-target muscles occurred. It has been demonstrated in clinical trials for <b>spastic</b> <b>movement</b> dis-orders that sonography-guided BoNT A injections could improve treatment outcome. As the published evidence for a benefit of sonography-guided BoNT injection in patients with cervical dystonia is scarce, it is the aim of this review to discuss the relevance of sonography in this indication and provide a statement from clinical experts for its use. The clear advantage of sonography-guided injections is non-invasive, real-time visualization of the targeted mus-cle, thus improving the precision of injections and poten-tially the treatment outcomes as well as avoiding adverse effects. Other imaging techniques are of limited value due to high costs, radiation exposure or non-availability in clinical routine. In the hands of a trained injector, sonog-raphy is a quick and non-invasive imaging technique.

40|$|In recent decades, several novel {{approaches}} of spinal cord repair have revealed promising findings in animal models. However, {{for a successful}} translation of these into a clinical trial in humans the specific conditions pertaining to human spinal cord injuries (SCI) have to be appreciated. Firstly, transection of the spinal cord is commonly applied in animal models, whereas spinal cord contusion is the predominant type of injury in humans, and generally leads to more extensive injury {{in two to three}} spinal cord segments. Secondly, the quadrupedal organization of locomotion in animals and the more complex autonomic functions in humans challenge the translation of animal behavior into recovery from human SCI. Thirdly, so far, no adequate animal model has been developed to resemble <b>spastic</b> <b>movement</b> disorder in human SCI. Fourthly, the extensive damage to spinal motor neurons and nerve roots in human cervical and thoracolumbar in spine trauma is but little addressed in current translational studies. This damage has direct implications for rehabilitation and repair strategies. Fifthly, there is increasing evidence for a neuronal dysfunction below the level of the lesion in chronic complete SCI.

40|$|Cerebral palsy (CP) is a {{most common}} cause of <b>spastic</b> <b>movement</b> {{disorders}} with children. One of methods of treating spasticity is application of Botulinum toxin (BoNT). BoNT therapy has widely been used for 20 years now during which time it {{has proven to be a}} safe treatment. Botulinum toxin is natural purified protein and the strongest biological toxin &ndash; neurotoxin. Its medicinal application in USA dated back to year 1981 and in Europe &ndash; 1992. Botulinum toxin blocks neuromuscular conductance, i. e. it blocks transmission of acetyl-holin and in neuro muscular presynaptic &ndash; this is so called temporary (reversible) local chemodenervation. It does not influence synthesis of acetyl-holin. During 2 - 6 months neural collaterals are formed so that neuromuscular conductance is reestablished and spasm develops again. Botulinum toxin therapy can become inefficient due to three reasons. First is improper application of the toxin itself, second reason is predominant muscular fibrosis and third is presence of antibodies. Interdisciplinary European group of clinical experts in field of movement disorders and experienced users of Botulinum toxin (BoNT), updated its Consensus on Botulinum toxin application dated 2006. Consensus is based on two types of proof: published works and works based on application praxis. In the first part of consensus, authors have formed tables and collected proof, merging data and experience from 36 institutions in 9 European countries, that include more than 10, 000 patients and over 45, 000 particular treatments. In second part, graphs of motor development, based on Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), are updated in such a way to get a graphical representation of how motor disturbances with children with cerebral palsy should be treated. Name of this graph is &ldquo;CPGraph Treatment Modalities &ndash; Gross Motor Function&rdquo;. Its purpose is to ease communication between parents, therapists and doctors, dealing with reachable motor functions, setting realistic goals and perspectives for children with cerebral palsy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Optogenetics is the {{constellation}} of optics, genetics and bioengineering which unites genetic engineering with optics to notice and manage the function of genetically targeted groups of cells with light, often in the intact animal, via light-sensitive microbial membrane proteins (opsins). Light-sensitive genes specifically including the genetically targeted light-gated channels channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR) result in intracellular ion flow during optical illumination. Afterward, the neurons encounter a series of changes resulting from membrane depolarization or hyperpolarization. Although the rooted origins of optogenetics is from neuroscience, it can be potentially applied in neuropsychocardioncology (neurology, psychiatry, oncology, and cardiology). This critical review will explicate a comprehensive summary of the roles of optogenetics {{in the field of}} neuropsychocardioncology. Optogenetics can be potentially developed as neuroprosthetics and direct NpHR in the management of <b>spastic</b> <b>movement</b> disorders. Optogenetics can control of larynx muscle contraction in vivo, using both transgenic ChR 2 expressing mice and viral transduction of muscle. In epilepsy, the efficacy of optogenetics is proved. Pyramidal cells in the cortex were transduced with halorhodopsin, and photoinhibition of the neurons decreased electrical seizure activity. Optogenetic and DREADD technologies are in their early stages, particularly with respect to PD research or therapy. In autism and schizophrenia, behavioral deficits may arise from elevation in the cellular balance of excitation/inhibition (E/I balance) within neuronal microcircuits. This hypothesis was tested by optogenetically elevating the E/I balance in the medial-prefrontal cortex using a step-function opsin (SSFO), together with red-shifted opsins (C 1 V 1). Increased excitation in excitatory pyramidal neurons, lead to social-cognitive dysfunctioning which are similar to those seen in autism. Cortical gamma oscillations are an indicator of enhanced information processing, which is highly affected in schizophrenic patients. Using optogenetic technology, researchers divulge the characterization of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) in Rac 1 -dependent lamellipodial motility in PC- 3 prostate cancer cells. PI 3 K, acting downstream of Rac 1, has {{an important role in the}} initiation of lamellipodial extension, which underlies prostate cancer cell invasion and metastasis. As in Parkinson, human cells can be engineered to deliver the excitatory (hM 3 Dq receptor) and/or the inhibitory (hM 4 Di receptor) form so that cellular activity may be turned up or down. The optogenetic TCU (tandem-cell-unit) strategy can be valuable in appraising tissue graft integration and cell delivery in the myocardium during cardiac tissue repair procedures. Low-energy pacing strategies can be srutinized by optogenetic investigations. Specifically, optical stimulation can be aimed for strategic structures of the conduction system.     Optogenetic studies have already contributed to a better understanding of the neural circuits affected in many disorders. A conceptual and mutual understanding of multidisciplinary approaches and collaboration will enable researchers, clinicians, stakeholders, government develop and apply optogenetics in comprehensive medical services and health care.
