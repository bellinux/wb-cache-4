Calculations of the V 3 doublet system indicate that the 6 - 311 +G(d) basis set is sufficiently flexible to provide reliable minimum energy <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> vibrational <b>frequencies,</b> that these <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequencies</b> are insensitive to spin contamination of the wave function when the BPW 91 functional is used, and that changing to the B 3 LYP functional may result in very different <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequencies.</b> A computationally less expensive scalar relativistic treatment of Au 4 clusters gives structural properties that are in good agreement with those obtained using a four-component method.

The apparatus is a tandem mass spectrometer with a radio frequency ion trap that utilizes the following scheme: the cluster ion to be studied is first mass selected; spectroscopic interrogation then occurs in the radio frequency ion trap; finally, a fragment ion is selected and detected using ion counting techniques.

The longitudinal transport of indole- 3 -acetate was strongly basipolar, while that of carboxyfluorescein was essentially apolar. The longitudinal transport of IAA, like carboxyfluorescein, was mainly in the stele. IAA exhibited a much higher lateral mobility from stele to cortex than did carboxyfluorescein.

Recent European regulations prescribe that the managing body of large European airports (more than 5, 000, 000 passengers/year or 100, 000 tonnes/year of freight) have to define quality standards of service level for ground handler operations. In case a handler fails to meet these minimum requirements, the airport has to report it these irregularities, potentially imposing a fine or even suspending, partly or fully, the handler’s services.
