40|$|The {{benefits}} of using pin fin heat sinks with multiple perforations are investigated using complementary experimental and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods. An experimental heat sink with multiple perforations is designed and fabricated and parameter {{studies of the}} effect of perforated pin fin design on heat transfer and pressure drops across the heat sinks undertaken. Experimental data is found to agree well with predictions from a CFD model for the conjugate heat transfer into the cooling air stream. The validated CFD model is used to carry out a parametric study of the influence of the number and positioning of circular perforations, which shows that the Nusselt number increases monotonically with the number of pin perforations, while the pressure drop and fan power required to overcome the pressure drop all reduce monotonically. Pins with five perforations are shown to have a 11 % larger Nu than for corresponding <b>solid</b> <b>pin</b> cases. These benefits arise due to not only the increased surface area but also heat transfer enhancement near perforations through the formation of localised air jets. In contrast, the locations of the pin perforations are much less influential.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Short pin-fin arrays are used to enhance the heat transfer in cooling channels of gas turbine airfoils, combustor liners, electronic chips, bearing housings etc. Numerous experimental and numerical past studies ascertain the optimal spacing and length to height ratios within arrays of round short pin-fins for optimal heat transfer. However, the heat transfer enhancement in pin-finned channels is achieved {{at the expense of}} a significant pressure drop across the channel. Augmentation of pin-fins to improve the flow and heat transfer characteristics through the channel, may however lead to further improvements. This paper presents measured pressure drop characteristics in a channel with a staggered array of round short pin-fins where each pin has two through slots. The two slots located at the two ends of each pin have an identical slot-depth to pin-diameter ratio and slot-width to pin-diameter ratio which is 0. 48. The slots are oriented parallel to the mean flow direction in the pin-fin array. The pin-height to diameter ratio used is 1. 28 and pitch to diameter ratio in both streamwise and pitchwise direction of the pin-fin array is 2. The array consists of 13 staggered rows of pin-fins. Pressure drop in the channel is also measured with conventional solid round pin-fins. The same array spacing, pin-diameter and pin-height was used as with the slotted pin-fin array for comparison. The Reynolds number based on the mass averaged velocity and pin hydraulic diameter ranges between 3, 300 and 32, 800 covering different cooling applications. The objectives of the measurements are to investigate the effect of the pin-slots on the pressure drop over the array of pin-fins and recirculation region downstream of the slotted pin in the channel. The recirculation regions are responsible for low heat transfer coefficients on the end wall in the immediate vicinity downstream of the pin-fins. In general, the normalized pressure drop over the slotted pin-fin array decreases as Reynolds number decreases. The pressure drop over the slotted pin-fin array was also lower than the predicted pressure drop over an array of <b>solid</b> <b>pin</b> fins without slots. The normalized pressure distribution around the slotted pin circumference at mid-height shows a stagnation region over the frontal section of the slotted pin. The normalized pressure distribution changes little between 90 ° and 180 ° over the Reynolds number range that was used; this indicates a region of local flow separation. A short pin-fin array with slotted pins as described in this paper reduces the pressure drop over an array when compared to an unslotted array with the same geometrical arrangement. Slotting of pin fins may enhance the performance of an array of short pin-fins by reducing the pressure drop across the array. cf 201...|$|E

Moreover, WS-A resonance is found to show dispersion {{with respect to the}} size of transmission line, indicating that WS-A has a large correlation length (exceeding ∼ 100 μm); in contrast no such behavior is found for WS-B.

A common way to cool a tip is to use serpentine passages with 180 -deg turn under the blade tip-cap {{taking advantage of the}} three-dimensional turning effect and impingement like flow.

40|$|Since {{industrial}} devices create {{power dissipation}} {{in the form}} of heat created as a by-product, which can {{have a negative effect on}} their performance, certain temperature limit constraints are required for almost all these applications to work within suitable conditions. That is, these engineering devices might fail in some way if these limitations are surpassed by overheating. In all the related industries, inexorable increases in power densities are driving innovation in heat exchange techniques. Furthermore, electronic devices are becoming smaller at the same time as their thermal power generation increases. Thus, heat sinks can be applied for cooling critical components in many important applications ranging from aero-engines and nuclear reactors to computers, data centre server racks and other microelectronic devices. The most common cooling technique for heat dissipation for thermal control of electronics is air cooling. Reduced cost, simplicity of design, the easy availability of air, and increased reliability are the main benefits of this cooling method. Heat sinks with a fan/blower are commonly used for air-cooled devices as a forced convection heat transfer. An amount of heat is dissipated from the heat source to environmental air utilising a heat sink as a heat exchanger, which is a vital practice employed in air-cooling systems. This transfer mechanism is easy, simple and leads to reduced cost and increased reliability, and pinned heat sinks are more beneficial than plate fin heat sinks. The main interest of this study is to investigate the benefits of using perforated, slotted, and notched pinned heat sinks with different configurations to reduce CPU temperature and fan power consumption to overcome the pressure drop and maximise a heat transfer rate through the heat sink. An experimental heat sink with multiple perforations is designed and fabricated, and parameter studies of the effect of this perforated pin fin design on heat transfer and pressure drops across the heat sinks are undertaken, to compare it to <b>solid</b> <b>pinned</b> heat sinks without perforations. Experimental data is found to agree well with predictions from a CFD model for the conjugate heat transfer and turbulent airflow model into the cooling air stream. The validated CFD model is used to carry out a parametric study of the influence of the number and positioning of circular perforations, and slotted/notched pinned heat sinks. Then, the multi-objective optimum pinned heat sink designs are tested to obtain CPU temperature and fan power consumption as lowest as possible through the heat sink. In addition, the limitations in application of pinned heat sinks based on the pin density and applied heat flux are reported for active air-cooling electronic systems. An overview of the findings indicates that the CPU temperature, the fan power consumption, and the heat transfer rate in terms of Nusselt number are enhanced with the number of pin perforations and slotted/notched pinned heat sinks, while the locations of the pin perforations are much less influential. These benefits arise due to not only the increased surface area but also to the heat transfer enhancement near the perforations through the formation of localised air jets. Finally, the perforated heat sinks will be lighter in weight compared with <b>solid</b> <b>pinned</b> heat sinks. ...|$|R

This is currently performed by sequential deposition of probes on a target surface with split or <b>solid</b> <b>pins.</b> In this article, we present a cost-effective procedure namely microcontact printing using stamps, for a parallel deposition of probes applicable for manufacturing biochips. Results Contrary to a previous work, we showed that the stamps tailored with an elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) material did not require any surface modification {{to be able to}} adsorb oligonucleotides or PCR products. The adsorbed DNA molecules are subsequently printed efficiently on a target surface with high sub-micron resolution. Secondly, we showed that successive stamping is characterized by an exponential decay of the amount of transferred DNA molecules to the surface up the 4 th print, then followed by a second regime of transfer that was dependent on the contact time and which resulted in reduced quality of the features. Thus, while consecutive stamping was possible, this procedure turned out to be less reproducible and more time consuming than simply re-inking the stamps between each print. Thirdly, we showed that the hybridization signals on arrays made by microcontact printing were 5 to 10 -times higher than those made by conventional spotting methods. Finally, we demonstrated the validity of this microcontact printing method in manufacturing oligonucleotides arrays for mutations recognition in a yeast gene. Conclusion The microcontact printing can be considered as a new potential technology platform to pattern DNA microarrays that may have significant advantages over the conventional spotting technologies as it is easy to implement, it uses low cost material to make the stamp, and the arrays made by this technology are 10 -times more sensitive in term of hybridization signals than those manufactured by conventional spotting technology. </p...|$|R
