25|$|One of Méliès' last féeries was Cinderella or the Glass Slipper, a fifty-four-minute {{retelling of}} the Cinderella legend, shot with new deep focus lenses, {{outdoors}} instead of against theatrical backdrops. Pathé hired Méliès's longtime rival Ferdinand Zecca {{to trim the}} film to thirty three minutes, and it too was unprofitable.

25|$|It is {{not known}} when Changmarín left his aunt's house, but he went to Panama City, where he did a series of odd jobs.

25|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} {{has recently}} been a hindrance to {{the completion of the}} construction of Interstate 99 near State College, Pennsylvania. However, this acid rock drainage didn't come from a mine; rather, it was produced by oxidation of pyrite-rich rock which was unearthed during a road cut and then used as filler material in the I-99 construction. A similar situation developed at the Halifax airport in Canada. It is from these and <b>similar</b> <b>experiences</b> that the term acid rock drainage has emerged as being preferable to acid mine drainage, thereby emphasizing the general nature of the problem.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of generation identity on the reminiscence bump {{can be attributed}} to the idea that all members of the subgroup are likely to have memories of similar types of experiences. Evidence attesting to the {{influence of}} generation identity on the reminiscence bump has been witnessed in populations that have experience with traumatic events. In 1999, researchers compared younger and older groups of Bangladeshis. The younger group (ages 20–42) showed the usual increase in memories during the reminiscence bump while the older group (ages 46–86) showed a second increase in memories between the ages of 35 and 55. The second bump experienced by the older group corresponded to the period of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The two generations showed similar patterns and timing of memory recall within their own subgroup, suggesting that they did have <b>similar</b> <b>experiences,</b> either living or not living through the war. This finding may suggests that each generation remember personal events and generational events.|$|E

Every experiment in such a free-falling environment has the same results as it would for an observer at rest or moving uniformly in deep space, far from all sources of gravity.|$|E

500|$|More {{discussion}} on gender {{and sexual orientation}} identity has affected how many women label or view themselves.

Lesbians in Western cultures generally share an identity that parallels those built on ethnicity; they have a shared history and subculture, and <b>similar</b> <b>experiences</b> with discrimination which has caused many lesbians to reject heterosexual principles. This identity is unique from gay men and heterosexual women, and often creates tension with bisexual women.|$|E
