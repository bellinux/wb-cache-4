The cyanate thermally reacts with {{the surface of the}} workpiece to form alkali carbonate. The bath is then treated to convert the carbonate back to a cyanate.

The diffusion layer contains nitrides and carbides. The surface hardness ranges from 800 to 1500 HV depending on the <b>steel</b> <b>grade.</b> This also inversely affects the depth of the case; i.e. a high carbon steel will form a hard, but shallow case.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this article, an {{economic}} optimization tool is developed {{taking into account}} different <b>steel</b> <b>grades,</b> inlet pressure, diameter and booster stations for point-to-point pipelines {{as well as for}} simple networks. Preliminary results show that gaseous CO 2 transport is cost effective for relatively small mass flows and short (trunk) pipelines. For instance, for a pipeline transporting 5 Mt/y over 100 km of agricultural terrain, gaseous transport would cost 10. 2 €/t and liquid transport 12. 1 €/t (including initial compression). In terms of materials, the results indicate that higher <b>steel</b> <b>grades</b> (X 70) are the most cost effective for onshore pipelines transporting liquid CO 2 while for gaseous CO 2 lower <b>steel</b> <b>grades</b> (X 42) are more cost effective...|$|R
