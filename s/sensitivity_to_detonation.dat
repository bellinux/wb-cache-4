50|$|In 1927, Harry Ricardo {{published}} {{a study on}} the concept of the sleeve valve engine. In it, he wrote that traditional poppet valve engines would be unlikely to produce much more than 1,500 hp (1,100 kW), a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines. In order to pass this limit, the sleeve valve would have to be used, to increase volumetric efficiency, as well as to decrease the engine's <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>detonation,</b> which was prevalent with the poor quality fuels in use at the time. Halford's office was next to Ricardo's in London, and while Ricardo started work with Bristol Engines on a line of sleeve-valve designs, Halford started work with Napier, using the Dagger as the basis. The layout of the H-block, with its inherent balance and the Sabre's relatively short stroke, allowed it to run at a higher rate of rotation, to deliver more power from a smaller displacement, provided that good volumetric efficiency could be maintained (with better breathing), which sleeve valves could do. Another important effect of increasing the number of cylinders was that the piston area increases (for a given capacity and bore/stroke ratio) and this brings higher power.|$|E

In the GDT, detonation pressure, wave speed and cell width measurements were made in hexane-oxygen-nitrogen mixtures with and without the addition of lower molecular weight fuels. Stoichiometric mixtures of hexane-oxygen were studied with nitrogen dilution varying from fuel-oxygen to fuel-air. Hexane-air mixtures were investigated with varying fractions of lower molecular weight fuels (hydrogen, acetylene, ethylene, and carbon monoxide).

40|$|Abstract: A general {{assessment}} {{of the state of}} the art regarding direct initiation modes for successful cylindrical or spherical detonations in uniform gaseous media is presented. Energy is recognized as being the most appropriate parameter to be used as a relative measure of the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>detonation</b> of any given explosive mixture. A spherical detonation wave can be initiated either by a point source or a confined planar detonation wave transmission at the open end of a tube into an unconfined environment. Consequently, the critical conditions characterizing the amount of initial energy required to create the detonation are, respectively, the initiation radius for a point source and the critical tube diameter for a diffraction. The description of the phenomenology of critical conditions for gaseous detonation is proposed through notions having been diversely expressed by different authors. Nevertheless, these notions differ as far as their formulation and their analysis of the concepts proposed is concerned. It's a real jungle!. So, this is why it is important to provide some information on the current state of the art regarding the initiation modes for cylindrical or spherical detonations. ...|$|E

40|$|LX- 04 - 1 is DOE`s safest ``creep resistant`` {{conventional}} {{high explosive}} (CHE) with excellent thermal {{and long term}} compatibility properties. Because LX- 04 - 1 contains 15 % Viton by weight, it exhibits outstanding resistance to mechanical stimuli such as could be encountered in an accident scenario at the Pantex Plant. A large energy fluence is required to initiate LX- 04 - 1. The most likely methods to generate this energy into the individual cracked W 70 HE is via dropping the unit onto the floor (or tooling) or the cracked HE rubbing against itself.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2012. Emulsion {{explosives}} {{are classified}} as highly concentrated Water-in-Oil emulsions with an internal phase volume fraction of approximately 94 %, i. e. far beyond the close packing limit of spherical droplets of 74 %. These emulsions are thermodynamically unstable compounds and their instability {{is related to the}} crystallisation in the dispersed phase, which is a supersaturated solution of ammonium nitrate salt in water. This presents a problem, because the emulsion weakens or becomes unstable, which results in droplet crystallisation, so that the explosive generally loses at least some of its <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>detonation.</b> Considerable effort has been applied to the improvement of emulsion stability by explosive manufacturers, but important aspects such as the effect of salt and surfactant content/type in emulsions are not fully understood and described in the literature.

40|$|A {{study of}} detonations in {{high-molecular}} weight hydrocarbon fuels {{of interest to}} pulse detonation engine applications was performed in a 280 -mm diameter, 7. 3 -m long facility. Detonation pressure, wave speed, and cell width measurements were made in JP- 10 mixtures and in mixtures representative of the decomposition products of JP- 10. Experiments were performed in vapor-phase JP- 10 mixtures at 353 K over a range of equivalence ratios (0. 7 ≤ φ ≤ 1. 4), nitrogen dilutions (fuel-oxygen to fuel-air), and initial pressures (20 – 130 kPa). The cell widths of the JP- 10 mixtures {{are found to be}} similar to those of propane mixtures. A fuel blend representative of thermally decomposed JP- 10 was studied at 295 K. This blend consisted of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, acetylene, ethylene, and hexane with varying fractions of oxygen and nitrogen. The measured cell width of the fuel blend-air mixture is about half that of JP- 10 -air. The addition of components of the fuel blend (acetylene, ethylene, and methane) to JP- 10 in air at 353 K was characterized. Nitrogen diluted mixtures of stoichiometric hexane-oxygen were studied and the cell widths for hexane-air and JP- 10 -air are found to be comparable.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemistry)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. The {{subject of}} this current study {{concerns}} highly concentrated emulsions of the explosive grade. A distinguishing characteristic of these systems is a high internal to external phase volume ratio. The volume fraction of the aqueous phase of such an emulsion generally far exceeds the close packing limit. Continuous phase {{of the system is}} a supersaturated aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate inorganic salt. In combination with high internal phase concentration, this inevitably leads to the destabilisation of the system. The thermodynamic instability of such systems is attributed to two major factors: 1) crystallisation of dispersed phase and 2) coalescence of the individual droplets within the bulk. This poses a significant problem since destabilisation of the bulk emulsion in turn leads to partial or complete loss of <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>detonation</b> of the final product of which highly concentrated emulsion is the base. Since the invention of such types of bulk explosives, a considerable and on-going effort has targeted the improvement of the stability of these systems, with a scope primarily focused on the use of various surfactant agents with different properties as well as stabilising mixtures containing numerous surfactants. In recent years, a new approach has been explored: the stabilisation of highly concentrated emulsions with the use of solid fumed silica nanoparticles. This is a promising new field of study, already being implemented by manufacturers and actively developing. The focus of this present study is to investigate and lay the ground work for further research in the principally new approach towards the stabilisation of highly concentrated emulsions {{with the use of the}} polyhedral oligomeric silsesquiozane nanomolecules. These are unique compounds possessing hybrid inorganic-organic structures and properties, and carrying a range of advantages over currently implemented surfactants. As opposed to silica nanoparticles, these compounds are not solid particles but can be regarded as molecular silica. This investigation will focus on the general possibility of implementation of such compounds as stabiliser agents for emulsions in general, and highly concentrated emulsions of the explosive grade in particular, and the resultant effects on the stability. Effects on stability will be investigated both when used solely and in combination with common surfactants. In addition, stability both on shelf and under stress will be investigated within the framework of the study...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePerchlorate (ClO 4 -) is {{a stable}} {{energetic}} oxyanion of chlorine forming high water-soluble salts. Chronic exposure to perchlorate distrub thyroïdic functions. During 2011 - 2015, ClO 4 -has been detected {{in drinking water}} with concentrations above french recommanded levels, in the northeast of France, along frontlines of World War I (WWI), and outside, in agricultural environment. For time, there are no scientifical large scale researchs focusing on the real perchlorate sources in France and theirs relationships with the observed contamination. Moreover, the extent, the time and space fates of the contamination of groundwater have not been studied yet. This desktop study aims to highlight the origins and possible ClO 4 -sources in the speficic historical frame of France. Detailled archivistic researchs have been conducted in France, in London and in the USA. Furthermore, high explosives (HE) loading shells of Great War, discovered near Verdun have been sampled by the BRGM and analyzed for perchlorate, chlorate (ClO 3 -), nitrate, ammonium and NitroAromatic Compounds (NAC). Two origins of perchlorate have been identified: natural ClO 4 -as impurity of chilean nitrates and (electro) synthetic perchlorate. Chilean nitrates had been massively imported in France before the WWII as fertilizers for intensive agriculture of beet and wheat and to supply the industry in nitrogen to produce nitric acid, synthetic fertilizers and NAC. ClO 4 -has thus polluted " conversion salpeter " (KNO 3), entering the composition of traditionnal black powder, ammonium nitrate and TNT of artillery shells, increasing dangerously the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>detonation</b> when firing the projectiles. The presence of ClO 4 -impurites had been measured by the BRGM in sampled NAC HE as well in black powder by german chemists {{at the end of}} the XIX th century. Premature blastings of shells during firing due to ClO 4 -impurities were described by the gunners since 1880. During Trench War (1915 - 1917), enormous needs of HE for trench artillery and grenades motivated the development and large scale production of 4 types of synthetic (per) chlorated HE compositions, based on mixes of ClO 3 -or ClO 4 -energetic oxidizer with paraffinic fuels colored by methylen blue. 130 900 tons of (per) chlorate HE have been produced in France during WWI in France. The paraffin coating the salts may drasticaly hindered the dissolution rates of the explosives. The perchlorate could be introduced in the soil by old soil fertilizing, sparsed low-order detonation of projectiles, corrosion of the thin steel bodies of unexplosed ordnances, or by massiv ammunition surpluses breaking-down operations during the interwar period. Further researches are needed to define the kinetic dissolution of ClO 4 -in HE, to develop analytical and isotopic tools to fingerprint the origin of perchlorate. Specific methodologies are required too to define the sources, agricultural and/or military, of perchlorate in the specific case of France. Projects aiming these objectives are currently starting in the Vosges Mountain, in the region of Verdun, and in the Champagne area...|$|E

40|$|Munition {{development}} {{has always been}} driven by the necessity of delivering enough explosives to a targeted object to destroy it. Targets that are protected by steel reinforced concrete housings have become increasingly more difficult to destroy. Improvements must be made in munitions engineering design to either deliver more payload to the target or to make the weapon more potent. In most cases, due to aircraft weight limitations, the delivery of more payload is not an option. Therefore, improving the destructive power of a weapon of a given payload {{requires the use of}} more powerful explosives. However, when the potency of an explosive is increased, its <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> premature <b>detonation</b> also increases. The characteristics of the metal casing containing the explosive contribute significantly <b>to</b> the weapon's <b>detonation</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Casing experience significant heating during weapon penetration. This heating can cause the weapon to detonate before it reaches its target location. In the past, computer codes used to model detonating weapons have not taken heating into account in their performance predictions. Consequently, the theoretical models and the actual field tests are not in agreement. New models, that include temperature information, are currently being developed which are based on work done in the area of computational fluid dynamics. In this research, a remotely located, high-speed, infrared (IR) camera is used to obtain detailed measurements of the passive radiation from an object in an energetic environment. This radiation information is used to determine both the emissivity and the temperature of the surface of an object. However, before the temperature or emissivity was determined, the functional form of the emissivity was calculated to be an Mth degree polynomial with respect to wavelength dependence. With the advent of large, high-speed, IR detector arrays, it has now become possible to realize IR imaging spectrometers that have very high spatial resolution. The IR spectrometer system developed in this research utilized a large detector array to allow multiple spectral images to be formed simultaneously on the image plane. In conjunction with the correct emissivity model, this imaging IR spectrometer can determine temperature to within ± 5 degrees Celsius. These experimentally verified temperature maps were then integrated into the newly developed computer models. This additional information will result in more accurate computer codes for modeling the energetic environment. In turn, this will allow the weapon designer to accurately optimize weapon performance with respect to different materials, geometries and kinetics...|$|R
