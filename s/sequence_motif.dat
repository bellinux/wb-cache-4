5|$|The processive {{polyadenylation}} {{complex in}} the nucleus of eukaryotes works on products of RNA polymerase II, such as precursor mRNA. Here, a multi-protein complex (see components on the right) cleaves the 3'-most part of a newly produced RNA and polyadenylates the end produced by this cleavage. The cleavage is catalysed by the enzyme CPSF and occurs 10–30 nucleotides downstream of its binding site. This site often has the polyadenylation signal sequence AAUAAA on the RNA, but variants of it that bind more weakly to CPSF exist. Two other proteins add specificity to the binding to an RNA: CstF and CFI. CstF binds to a GU-rich region further downstream of CPSF's site. CFI recognises a third site on the RNA (a set of UGUAA sequences in mammals) and can recruit CPSF even if the AAUAAA sequence is missing. The polyadenylation signal– the <b>sequence</b> <b>motif</b> recognised by the RNA cleavage complex– varies between groups of eukaryotes. Most human polyadenylation sites contain the AAUAAA sequence, but this sequence is less common in plants and fungi.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Information {{about local}} protein <b>sequence</b> <b>motifs</b> is very {{important}} to the analysis of biologically significant conserved regions of protein sequences. These conserved regions can potentially determine the diverse conformation and activities of proteins. In this work, recurring <b>sequence</b> <b>motifs</b> of proteins are explored with an improved K-means clustering algorithm on a new dataset. The structural similarity of these recurring sequence clusters to produce <b>sequence</b> <b>motifs</b> is studied in order to evaluate the relationship between <b>sequence</b> <b>motifs</b> and their structures. To the best of our knowledge, the dataset used by our research is the most updated dataset among similar studies for <b>sequence</b> <b>motifs.</b> A new greedy initialization method for the K-means algorithm is proposed to improve traditional K-means clustering techniques.

25|$|Internally {{eliminated}} sequences (IES) are noncoding {{regions of}} the germ-line genome found in Ciliates. They are defined as sections of DNA removed from the diploid micronuclear genome during which {{a copy of the}} micronuclear genome is converted to the macronuclear genome even though errors occur in which an IES sequence may not be deleted. There is little conservation of motifs between Ciliate species; however, C. uncinata, like other ciliate species, show a conserved IES <b>sequence</b> <b>motif</b> within a species. It is unknown if IES sequences have a function in the genome, but in the ciliate Paramecium, an IES sequence is used to determine the mating type of an individual. When a specific IES sequence is not deleted from the developing somatic nucleus, then it is type O mating type. However, if that IES is deleted from the developing macronucleus, it is type E mating type. Paramecium can only mate with individual of opposite mating type.|$|E

2500|$|The {{secondary}} {{structure of a}} LSm protein is a small five-strand anti-parallel beta sheet, with the strands identified from the N-terminal end to the C-terminal end as β1, β2, β3, β4, β5. The SCOP class of All beta proteins and the CATH class of Mainly Beta are defined as protein structures that are primarily beta sheets, thus including LSm. [...] The SM1 <b>sequence</b> <b>motif</b> corresponds to the β1, β2, β3 strands, and the SM2 <b>sequence</b> <b>motif</b> corresponds to the β4 and β5 strands. [...] The first four beta strands are adjacent to each other, but β5 is adjacent to β1, turning the overall structure into a short barrel. [...] This structural topology is described as 51234. [...] A short (two to four turns) N-terminal alpha helix is also present in most LSm proteins. [...] The β3 and β4 strands are short in some LSm proteins, and are separated by an unstructured coil of variable length. [...] The β2, β3 and β4 strands are strongly bent about 120° degrees at their midpoints [...] The bends in these strands are often glycine, and the side chains internal to the beta barrel are often the hydrophobic residues valine, leucine, isoleucine and methionine.|$|E
2500|$|Coiled-coil α helices {{are highly}} stable forms {{in which two}} or more helices wrap around {{each other in a}} [...] "supercoil" [...] structure. Coiled coils contain a highly {{characteristic}} <b>sequence</b> <b>motif</b> known as a heptad repeat, in which the motif repeats itself every seven residues along the sequence (amino acid residues, not DNA base-pairs). The first and especially the fourth residues (known as the a and d positions) are almost always hydrophobic; the fourth residue is typically leucine this gives rise to the name of the structural motif called a leucine zipper, which is a type of coiled-coil. These hydrophobic residues pack together in the interior of the helix bundle. In general, the fifth and seventh residues (the e and g positions) have opposing charges and form a salt bridge stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Fibrous proteins such as keratin or the [...] "stalks" [...] of myosin or kinesin often adopt coiled-coil structures, as do several dimerizing proteins. A pair of coiled-coils a four-helix bundle is a very common structural motif in proteins. For example, it occurs in human growth hormone and several varieties of cytochrome. The Rop protein, which promotes plasmid replication in bacteria, is an interesting case in which a single polypeptide forms a coiled-coil and two monomers assemble to form a four-helix bundle.|$|E
40|$|The N-terminal transit {{peptides}} of nuclear-encoded plastid proteins {{are necessary}} and sufficient for their import into plastids, but the information encoded by these transit peptides remains elusive, {{as they have}} a high sequence diversity and lack consensus sequences or common <b>sequence</b> <b>motifs.</b> Here, we investigated the sequence information contained in transit peptides. Hierarchical clustering on transit peptides of 208 plastid proteins showed that the transit peptide sequences are grouped to multiple sequence subgroups. We selected representative proteins from seven of these multiple subgroups and confirmed that their transit peptide sequences are highly dissimilar. Protein import experiments revealed that each protein contained transit peptide–specific <b>sequence</b> <b>motifs</b> critical for protein import into chloroplasts.
