Successful zero energy building designers typically combine time tested passive solar, or artificial/fake conditioning, principles that work with the on-site assets. Sunlight and solar heat, prevailing breezes, and {{the cool of the}} earth below a building, can provide daylighting and stable indoor temperatures with minimum mechanical means. ZEBs are normally optimized to use passive <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>gain</b> and shading, combined with thermal mass to stabilize diurnal temperature variations throughout the day, and in most climates are superinsulated.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{influence}} of solar radiation on the built environment is a basic issue in building physics and currently it is extremely important because glazed envelopes are widely used in contemporary architecture. In the present study, the removal of <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> by radiant cooling systems is investigated. Particular attention is given to the portion of solar radiation converted to cooling load, without taking part in thermal absorption phenomena due to the thermal mass of the room. This specific component of the cooling load is defined as the Direct Solar Load. A simplified procedure to correctly calculate the magnitude of the Direct Solar Load in cooling load calculations is proposed and it is implemented with the Heat Balance method and the Radiant Time Series method. The F ratio of the <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> directly converted to cooling load, {{in the case of a}} low thermal mass radiant ceiling, is calculated for different kinds of office rooms with a large glazed external surface.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the optimal {{geometric}} form of a building that minimizes direct solar irradiation incident on the envelope, and to find useful guidelines for building designers at the early decision-making stage. To achieve this goal, the mathematical theory of Calculus of Variation is used to find the theoretical optimal solutions and, based on this analytical approach, a simplified model to calculate annual <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> is introduced. The benefit of using a totally analytical optimization is to provide simple and universal geometrical rules applicable in a general scenario, despite of using a numerical optimization that is more suitable to solve specific and complex cases by considering all of the aspects involved, e. g. the internal structure of the building or the optical/thermal properties of material used. The optimization is applied to various cases with different constraints. Our results suggest some rules to follow, even in the general case whereby the plan is fixed by the building’s designer, to achieve a reduction in the total amount of direct solar irradiation without necessarily reducing the annual <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>gains.</b> For this reason our results could be applied not only in hot regions but also in mild and cold ones...|$|R
