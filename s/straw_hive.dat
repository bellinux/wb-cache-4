Intermediate stages in hive design were {{recorded}} for example by Thomas Wildman in 1768/1770, who described advances over the destructive old skep-based beekeeping {{so that the}} bees {{no longer had to}} be killed to harvest the honey. Wildman, for example, fixed a parallel array of wooden bars across the top of a <b>straw</b> <b>hive</b> or skep (with a separate straw top to be fixed on later) [...] "so that there are in all seven bars of deal" [...] a 10 in [...] "to which the bees fix their combs". He also described using such hives in a multi-story configuration, foreshadowing the modern use of supers: he described adding (at the proper time) successive straw hives below, and eventually removing the ones above when free of brood and filled with honey, so that the bees could be separately preserved at the harvest for a following season. Wildman also described a further development, using hives with [...] "sliding frames" [...] for the bees to build their comb, foreshadowing more modern uses of movable-comb hives. Wildman acknowledged the advances in knowledge of bees previously made by Swammerdam, Maraldi, and de Reaumur - he included a lengthy translation of Reaumur's account of the natural history of bees - and he also described the initiatives of others in designing hives for the preservation of bee-life when taking the harvest, citing in particular reports from Brittany dating from the 1750s, due to Comte de la Bourdonnaye.|$|E

Wildman's book acknowledged the advances in knowledge of bees previously made by Swammerdam, Maraldi, and de Réaumur—he included a lengthy translation of Réaumur's account of the natural history of bees—and he also described the initiatives of others in designing hives for the preservation of bee-life when taking the harvest, citing in particular reports from Brittany dating from the 1750s, due to Comte de la Bourdonnaye.However, the forerunners of the modern hives with movable frames that are mainly used today are considered the traditional basket top bar (movable comb) hives of Greece, known as “Greek beehives”. The oldest testimony on their use dates back to 1669 although it is probable that their use is more than 3000 years old.|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} honey production in Delta State using traditional hives. Structured questionnaires, survey and interviews {{were used to}} elicit information from respondents in fifteen Local Government Areas of Delta State where traditional beekeeping has been identified to thrive. Data collected were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics using frequency count and percentages. Analysis of variance {{was used to test}} for significance and LSD used to separate significant means at 0. 05 level of probability. The results showed that more men were into traditional beekeeping and that the <b>straw</b> <b>hive</b> was more popular and the best in terms of yield when compared with clay pot and the Calabash. More awareness and education were recommended...|$|E

[...] "Come, old trapper, you must acknowledge this is but a slow way of getting out of danger. If we tarry here much longer, it will be in the fashion that the bees lie around the <b>straw</b> after the <b>hive</b> has been smoked for its honey. You may hear the fire begin to roar already, and I know by experience, that when the flame once gets fairly into the prairie grass, it is no sloth that can outrun it." ...|$|R
50|$|Beekeeping using fixed comb hives is an {{essential}} part of the livelihoods of many communities in poor countries. The charity Bees for Development recognizes that local skills to manage bees in fixed comb hives are widespread in Africa, Asia, and South America. Internal size of fixed comb hives range from 32.7 liters (2000 cubic inches) typical of the clay tube hives used in Egypt to 282 liters (17209 cubic inches) for the Perone <b>hive.</b> <b>Straw</b> skeps, bee gums, and unframed box hives are unlawful in most US states, as the comb and brood cannot be inspected for diseases. However, skeps are still used for collecting swarms by hobbyists in the UK, before moving them into standard hives. Quinby used box hives to produce so much honey that he saturated the New York market in the 1860s. His writings contain excellent advice for management of bees in fixed comb hives.|$|R
40|$|Transformation of culture, {{although}} modern in {{investigation of}} the present moment, {{is not only the}} speciality of our time. Every great change of historical period was in fact a cultural change. In the past this process was very slow because the patterns did not reach all the people so quickly as to-day the west-european and American civilization does by means of TV, film and press. These new processes did not extend themselves everywhere the same, because somewhere the old, even the ancient, persisted up to now. Such very important historical events took place on our territory and manifested itself in some forms of bee-hives. In the Mediterranean and some parts belonging to the old megalith culture, stone hives made out of stone blocks were built into a stone wall. To-day such hives are known in the Baleares (Spain), Apulia (Italy) and on Brač and Hvar. Such had the old Romans too. Keeping the bee-hives in walls is not a rarity (Mediterranean, Orient). This particular way of keeping bees reminds us of bee boles, niches in stone fences or walls of houses from the 15 th - 18 th century in England and on the Isle of Man. Before these stone hives, much simpler forms can be found in our country. There is a custom in preparing niches on the banks of rivers or in cliffs where wild bees come to swarm. People then take such swarms home and in this way the number of their bee-hives increase. This custom dominates in Macedonia and similar niches in stone are known in the parts around Obrovac. Something similar existed among the Čeramis on Volga Bee-hives in tree trunks are very ancient. The honey is collected {{from the bottom of the}} trunk and such bee-hives are known in the whole of the Roman Europe. The Slavs accepted this form probably because of its simple form and simple handling, and that 2 ̆ 7 s why we can explain its general expansion; while the Slavic form, the trunk bee-hive with a door opposite the flight of the bees, is rarely mentioned. Bee-hives in the form of standing boxes, show the same expansion as trunk bee-hives. The speciality of both in Dalmatia is a stone tile roof. In Slovenia such wooden boxes, in a horizontal line, completely belong to the alpen cultural areal and represents the youngest form of bee-hives in the Alps; they are thought to be late Roman origin. No doubt the custom of keeping bees in stave vessels in northern Dalmatia belongs to the Roman influence which appeared after 1 st century A. D. Bee hives weaved from twigs, in the past existed in the whole country. In Panonia they were displaced with the <b>straw</b> weaved <b>hives</b> which came to our parts from the middle Europe through Hungary, and the Government of the Military Border intensively worked on their expansion...|$|R
