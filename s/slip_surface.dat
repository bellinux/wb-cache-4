[...] This is combined with increased soil weight due to the added groundwater.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{variation}} of soil shear strength parameters with depth on slope stability considering spatial variability of soil parameters has not been studied systematically. A probabilistic method is proposed for infinite slope stability analysis considering the variation of soil shear strength parameters with depth. First, the Karhunen-Loeve expansion is adopted to simulate the random field of spatially varying soils. Second, the effect of spatial variability of soil parameters on failure probability and critical <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> is investigated. Finally, an infinite slope is presented {{to demonstrate the validity}} and capacity of the proposed method. The results indicate that the spatial variability of soil shear strength parameters has a significant influence on the failure probability of the infinite soil slope. The failure probability decreases with the increasing correlation length of soil shear strength parameters. For an undrained clay slope, a significant change in the undrained shear strength parameter varying with depth results in a smaller failure probability. Most of the critical <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> will occur {{at the base of the}} slope. For a frictional/cohesive slope, the failure probability does not monotonically decrease with the increase of the variation of the soil shear strength parameters with depth.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to identify the fully specified representative <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> (RSSs) of layered soil slopes and to compute their system probability of failure, Pf,s. Spencer's method is used to compute the factors of safety of trial <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) is employed to efficiently evaluate their reliability. A custom-designed Genetic Algorithm (GA) is developed to search all the RSSs in only one GA optimization. Taking advantage of the system aspects of the problem, such RSSs are then employed to estimate the reliability of the slope system, and a proposed linearization approach-based on first or second order (FORM or SORM) reliability information about the identified RSSs-is used to efficiently estimate Pf,s. Three typical benchmark-slopes with layered soils are adopted to demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and robustness of the suggested procedure, and advantages of the proposed method with respect to alternative methods are discussed. Results show that the proposed approach provides reliability estimates that improve previously published results, emphasizing the importance of finding good RSSs-and, specially, good (probabilistic) critical <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> that might be circular or non-circular-to obtain good estimations of the reliability of soil slope systems...|$|R

40|$|Widening of {{existing}} highways {{often results in}} new mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) walls being placed in front {{of existing}} stable walls. The design of these walls is unique because limited right-of-way often forces the length of the reinforcing strips to be shorter than normally used. This research addressed such walls placed in a confined space. The Plaxis finite element software was used to study the vertical and horizontal stresses in the backfill behind nondeformable walls constructed in a confined space. The vertical stresses were generally found to be less than the computed overburden pressure. A vertical stress influence factor is presented to describe the reduced vertical stresses {{as a function of the}} depth below the top of the wall and the wall aspect ratio. Horizontal earth pressures were also found to be less than those for walls that are not in a confined space. A chart was developed for estimating these reduced horizontal stresses.

Previously, deformation bands were divided into single deformation bands, zones of deformation bands and <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> (Aydin, 1978). Shipton and Cowie (2001) recognised that, in outcrop, a unit of fine-grained material is always found in association with <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Shipton and Cowie (2001) refer to this unit as fault core.

40|$|Along {{the southeastern}} {{termination}} of the Padul normal fault zone, southern Spain, a potentially active tectonic structure as long âˆ¼ 15 km with throw of âˆ¼ 800 m, there are several small normal faults with lengths up to âˆ¼ 2 km and throws up to âˆ¼ 100 m. These small faults are vertically segmented, and crosscut lithologically heterogeneous Miocene carbonates of the Lecrin Basin. Within the carbonate multilayer, we recognized three fundamental structural elements: joints, pressure solutions and deformation bands., Joints are present preferentially within calcarenitic beds (Uniaxial Compressive Strength, UCS= âˆ¼ 70 N/mm 2; 2 D porosity, [U+F 066]= âˆ¼ 5 %), whereas pressure solution seams localized in marl-rich microconglomeratic beds (UCS= âˆ¼ 21 N/mm 2; [U+F 066]= âˆ¼ 7 %). On the contrary, in a clay-rich conglomeratic unit (UCS= âˆ¼ 40 N/mm 2; [U+F 066]= âˆ¼ 10 %) underneath the carbonate multilayer, deformation banding was predominant. According to their abutting relationship, first generation structures consist of two orthogonal sets of bed-perpendicular joints and one set of bed parallel solution seams, both probably formed in response to overburden loading. One additional generation of high-angle to bedding joints developed thanks to shearing across the pre-existing bed-perpendicular joints sets. Similarly, low-angle to bedding pressure solution seams formed at the extensional quadrants of normally sheared, pre-existing bed parallel pressure solution seams due bed tilting and contemporaneous uplift an exhumation. Within the individual carbonate beds, normal faulting initiated by shearing across all the aforementioned generations of joints and pressure solution seams, with formation of new sets of high-angle joints and low-angle pressure solution seams along the sheared parental discontinuities. Continued slip caused the linkage among structures present in neighboring beds, forming and discontinuous <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> surrounded by pods of fragmented rocks. With further deformation, the isolated <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> coalesced together forming through-going, segmented <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> along which brecciation and cataclasis took place. In the conglomerate unit, normal faulting initiated by mean of two conjugate sets of compressive shear bands, which formed due to clast rotation and translation within the clay-rich matrix. Ongoing deformation was accompanied by smearing of the clay-rich matrix within the proto-faults (offsets up to several cm), jointing and dilational of the pre-existing discontinuities present within the individual clasts. Discontinuous <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> formed along the sheared fractures and, often, on the hanging wall side of the deformation bands. Further deformation was solved by linkage of adjacent <b>slips</b> <b>surfaces,</b> diffuse jointing, and cataclastic deformation which localized along the evolving <b>slips</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The original fluid flow properties of the individual carbonate beds were alterated by the different structural elements: joints, sheared joints and sheared pressure solution seams enhanced the fluid flow in a direction parallel to these structures, whereas pressure solution seams and deformation bands inhibited the fluid flow in a direction orthogonal to them. Within the fault-bounded blocks, the fluid flow properties varied according to the structural elements they contained. Along the major faults, the fluid flow was compartimentalized along the through-going <b>slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> and fault breccia of the core, and in the fault damage zones. Conversely, the matrix-supported cataclasites formed seals for cross-fault fluid flow.
