5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all <b>say</b> <b>some</b> people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{was killed}} during the coup, both the CUP and Freedom and Accord claimed {{that they had been}} {{planning}} to give Minister of the Navy Nazım Pasha a position in their next cabinet. The CUP's Talaat Bey went as far as to <b>say</b> <b>some</b> time after the coup that the CUP had previously offered Nazım Pasha the position of Grand Vizier and the leadership its cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{episode of}} O'Brien's {{tenure at the}} show came from when Letterman asked to appear as a guest and <b>say</b> <b>some</b> kind words to him. O'Brien {{considered}} this the turning point that changed everything for him, which he mentioned while paying tribute to Letterman in an opening monologue of his own talk show on TBS, which aired the same night as Letterman's final show; O'Brien notably asked his viewers to turn him off and watch Letterman {{later on in the}} monologue.|$|E

25|$|Of {{particular}} {{significance is}} the plenary indulgence {{attached to the}} Apostolic Blessing that a priest is to impart when giving the sacraments to a person in danger of death, and which, if no priest is available, the Church grants to any rightly disposed Christian {{at the moment of}} death, on condition that that person was accustomed to <b>say</b> <b>some</b> prayers during life. In this case the Church itself makes up for the three conditions normally required for a plenary indulgence: sacramental confession, Eucharistic communion and prayer for the Pope's intentions.|$|E
25|$|I’m {{well aware}} that I {{sometimes}} “shoot from the hip” and speak on things about which I know very little. In this present situation, I published my personal opinions about drug addiction without knowing very much about the neuroscience behind addiction, or the addiction recovery field. Not only did I <b>say</b> <b>some</b> deeply regrettable and insensitive things, but as I’ve learned more about the questions and issues at hand, I accept that I have been wrongheaded {{on a number of}} topics related to these issues. Even at 84, I’m still learning. Please bear with me, folks.|$|E
25|$|No other {{candidates}} were proposed and the Returning Officer called for Dyer {{to give a}} speech to the electors regarding what he would advocate for and his goals if he became the Member of Parliament for Bruce. However, before Dyer made his speech John Hardy stepped in and asked if he could <b>say</b> <b>some</b> words as Henry Clapcott's representative, an action opposed by other electors. Hardy said that in reply to some observations by J. L. Gillies regarding the state of the province of Otago without a treasurer— he would then also like to nominate Marryatt—who was himself an elector for the by-election. The observations were concerning the fact that Clapcott would be forced to resign as Treasurer to take up his role as MP for Bruce. Marryatt had opposed the stepping in of Hardy, without a clue that he would be nominated for the role. Laughingly, J. L. Gillies seconded that nomination. However, Gillies said that an elector may only nominate one person for a role at an election. The Returning Officer then justified that an elector may nominate as many people as they like. Returning the compliment, Marryatt nominated Hardy for the role, seconded by George E. Brown. However, the Returning Officer took no notice of the nominations, stating that it was immature of the electors to make a joke on such a serious duty. Multiple electors then said that some fun at an election was expected, a stance which the Returning Officer disagreed with.|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "When I say things, I think people believe me so much that they take it a different way — it's, like, not rap anymore at that point.

[...] "He's gonna be embarrassed, I said some really great things about him and people's perception of him. But it is what it is, he took it that wrong way, and I didn't know I said anything wrong!" ...|$|E
500|$|Like Amir, {{the protagonist}} of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left {{the country as a}} youth, not {{returning}} until 2003. Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book. In response, he said, [...] "When I <b>say</b> <b>some</b> of it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy." [...] Having left the country {{around the time of the}} Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: [...] "Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. A lot of my childhood friends had a very hard time. Some of our cousins died. One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [...] Talk about guilt. He was one of the kids I grew up with flying kites. His father was shot." [...] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional. Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it [...] "should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all".|$|E

2500|$|Following the Millwood trade, the Rangers signed Rich Harden to a 1-year deal. The {{contract}} {{includes a}} mutual 2nd year option. Michael Young told the media his new teammate [...] "…has the best {{stuff in the}} league. I didn't <b>say</b> <b>some</b> of the best stuff. I mean the best stuff I've seen." [...] Harden was not offered arbitration by his former club, the Cubs, so Texas did not lose a draft pick to sign the type A free agent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{amount of}} food that an animal acquires [...] depends not only on food {{availability}} {{but also on the}} animal's ability to compete with others. This is especially true for social animals, where the stronger individuals might steal food from the weaker (this is not to <b>say</b> <b>some</b> non-social animals do not concern themselves with the needs of others or steal food from others). Thus, serotonin is involved not only in the perception of food availability but also in social rank.|$|E

It {{was the first time}} his parents attended one of his fights and he asked for the microphone to <b>say</b> <b>some</b> words to the Dutch audience. Hari couldn't be understood as the audience proceeded to boo him, after which Hari was quoted saying [...] "I thought to myself, I have never witnessed such ungratefulness". From that day Hari decided to represent Morocco and stopped working with Thom Harinck. Mike Passenier became his new coach.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, church {{president}} W. Grant McMurray {{reflected on}} increasing {{questions about the}} Book of Mormon: [...] "The proper use of the Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, {{in part because of}} long-standing questions about its historicity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity." [...] In the introduction he qualified his statements: [...] "I cannot speak for each person within our community, but perhaps I can <b>say</b> <b>some</b> words on behalf of our community." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{reportedly}} [...] "hundreds {{of requests}} for an interview" [...] with the teenager, [...] "with media outlets offering vast sums of money", Kampusch was interviewed by Austrian public broadcaster ORF. The interview was broadcast on 6 September 2006 with her approval ORF did not pay for its interview, and said any proceeds from selling the interview to other channels would be forwarded to Kampusch. The interview was sold to more than 120 countries at a fee of 290 euros per minute. This money—estimates <b>say</b> <b>some</b> hundred thousand euros—will be donated to women in Africa and Mexico by Kampusch. Likewise she plans projects to help these women. Interest was enormous.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first period}} {{occurred}} in the 1950s when Sun Ra's music evolved from big band swing into the outer-space-themed [...] "cosmic jazz" [...] {{for which he was}} best known. Music critics and jazz historians <b>say</b> <b>some</b> of his best work was recorded during this period and it is also some of his most accessible music. Sun Ra's music in this era was often tightly arranged and sometimes reminiscent of Duke Ellington's, Count Basie's, or other important swing music ensembles. However, there was a strong influence from post-swing styles like bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz, and touches of the exotic and hints of the experimentalism that dominated his later music. Notable Sun Ra albums from the 1950s include Sun Ra Visits Planet Earth, Interstellar Low Ways, Super-Sonic Jazz, We Travel the Space Ways, The Nubians of Plutonia and Jazz In Silhouette.|$|E
