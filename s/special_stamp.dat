5|$|In 2001, Kaladze {{became the}} most {{expensive}} Georgian footballer in history when Milan paid €16 million {{to bring him to}} Italy. He cited an injury to Aleksei Gerasimenko as his reason for leaving. At first, Kaladze was tried in different positions and faced competition for places in defense from players such as Jaap Stam and Cafu. In the 2002–03 season, however, he made 46 appearances in all competitions, including 27 Serie A appearances. That year, Milan won the Champions League, where they beat Juventus on penalties in the final (despite Kaladze missing his penalty) and the Coppa Italia, where they beat Roma 6–3 on aggregate in the final. After Kaladze's double success, the Georgian postal service issued a <b>special</b> <b>stamp</b> bearing the player's image. He is the first Georgian player to win a Champions League title.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1862, Northern {{photographic}} studios {{were required}} to purchase an annual license. By August 1864, photographers would have to buy revenue stamps as well. The [...] "Sun Picture" [...] tax on photographs was instituted by the Office of Internal Revenue {{as a means to}} help finance the war. The tax was either 1¢, 2¢, 3¢, or 5¢, depending on the price of the photo (1-10¢, 10-25¢, 25-50¢, 50-$1 respectively). However, there was not a <b>special</b> <b>stamp</b> created for photography, so, US revenue stamps originally intended for Bank Checks, Playing Cards, Certificates, Proprietary, Bills of Lading, [...] were used. Largely due to the lobbying efforts of Alexander Gardner, Mathew Brady, Jeremiah Gurney and Charles D. Fredericks, the tax was repealed in 1866.|$|E

60|$|The busy time of {{the seed}} trade was over, and the quiet weeks that preceded the hay-season had come--setting their <b>special</b> <b>stamp</b> upon Casterbridge by thronging the market with wood rakes, new waggons in yellow, green, and red, {{formidable}} scythes, and pitchforks of prong sufficient to skewer up a small family. Henchard, contrary to his wont, went out one Saturday afternoon towards the market-place from a curious feeling {{that he would like}} to pass a few minutes on the spot of his former triumphs. Farfrae, to whom he was still a comparative stranger, stood a few steps below the Corn Exchange door--a usual position with him at this hour--and he appeared lost in thought about something he was looking at a little way off.|$|E
60|$|She drew a {{deep breath}} when the thing was done, and hurried the scrap {{unsigned}} into an envelope and addressed it to Ludlow. She was in a frenzy till she could get it out of her hands and into the postal-box beyond recall. She pulled a shawl over her head and flew down stairs and out of the door into the street toward the postal-box on the corner. But before she reached it she thought of a special-delivery stamp, which should carry the letter to Ludlow the first thing in the morning, and she pushed on to the druggist's at the corner beyond to get it. She was aware of the man staring at her, as if she had asked for arsenic; and she supposed she must have looked strange. This did not come into her mind till she found herself again at Mrs. Montgomery's door, where she stood in a panic ecstasy at having got rid of the letter, which the <b>special</b> <b>stamp</b> seemed to make still more irrevocable, and tried to fit her night-latch into the lock. The cat, which had been shut out, crept up from the area, and rubbed with a soft insinuation against her skirt. She gave a little shriek of terror, and the door was suddenly pulled open from within.|$|E

Simpler designed stamps, both commemorative and definitive are printed using lithography.|$|R
60|$|Kate came at last {{by the way}} he {{had thought}} least likely, came as if she had started from the Marble Arch; but her advent was {{response}}--that was the great matter; response marked in her face and agreeable to him, even after Aunt Maud's responses, as nothing had been since his return to London. She had not, it was true, answered his wire, and he had begun to fear, as she was late, that with the instinct of what he might be again intending to press upon her she had decided--though not with ease--to deprive him of his chance. He would have of course, she knew, other chances, but she perhaps saw the present as offering her special danger. This, in fact, Densher could himself feel, was exactly why he had so prepared it, and he had rejoiced, even while he waited, in all that the conditions had to say to him of their simpler and better time. The shortest day of the year though it might be, it was, in the same place, by a whim of the weather, almost as much to their purpose as the days of sunny afternoons when they had taken their first trysts. This and that tree, within sight, on the grass, stretched bare boughs over the couple of chairs in which they had sat of old and in which--for they really could sit down again--they might recover the clearness of their prime. It was to all intents however this very reference that showed itself in Kate's face as, with her swift motion, she came toward him. It helped him, her swift motion, when it finally brought her nearer; helped him, for that matter, at first, if only by showing him afresh how terribly well she looked. It had been all along, he certainly remembered, a phenomenon of no rarity that he had felt her, at particular moments, handsomer than ever before; one of these for instance being still present to him as her entrance, under her aunt's eyes, at Lancaster Gate, the day of his dinner there after his return from America; and another her aspect on the same spot two Sundays ago--the light in which she struck the eyes he had brought back from Venice. In the course of a minute or two now he got, as he had got it the other times, his apprehension of the <b>special</b> <b>stamp</b> of the fortune of the moment.|$|E
