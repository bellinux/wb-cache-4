5|$|The {{road through}} Gateshead Fell was turnpiked by the Durham to Tyne Bridge Road Act in 1747. Although it had brought some early {{settlers}} to the area, {{the development of}} industry allowed the formative settlement to grow. In 1740, John Warburton opened a pottery at Carr Hill which is credited with introducing white earthenware to Tyneside. Encouraged by Warburton's success, Paul Jackson established the Sheriff Hill Pottery in 1771 at {{the northern end of}} the turnpike road and by 1775 was advertising his earthenware in the Newcastle Journal. Jackson's pottery, which became a local centre of pottery production, attracted settlers to the area and became a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> to local residents.|$|E
5|$|The studio defined only Blythe and {{the pets}} as characters, so the Cahills sought {{to expand the}} human character's fictional universe, {{designing}} Blythe's friends, Mrs. Twombly, and the Biskit twins. Julie explained {{that she and her}} husband's preference for quirky comedy inspired that of the show. While the show is aimed at a demographic of young girls, Julie said that she and the writers attempt to cater to boys of the same age and parent viewers simultaneously. Original music for the show is accomplished by film and television composers Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews. Ingram wrote that the urban setting of Littlest Pet Shop prompted the use of a modern style of music. The score incorporates pop and other cultural influences for the same reason. Ingram found Hasbro's pushing of the limitations for music in daytime television a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride.</b>|$|E
5|$|The territory's {{contributions}} {{during the}} First World War {{became a major}} entry in many histories of the colony, and a great <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> for the white community, {{as well as for}} some black Rhodesians. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant self-government in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on Armistice Day, 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The Zimbabwean cultural memory has largely forgotten the First World War; the country's war dead today have no official commemoration, either there or overseas.|$|E

30|$|Because {{the nature}} of design {{knowledge}} is highly applicable and practice-driven (Cross 2001), besides the theoretical perspective, it is meaningful to examine how different types <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> were designed for in the concrete cases.

The design-for-pride strategies employed by the collected cases will be identified and analyzed against the theoretical dimensions <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> (Fig.  1).|$|R

Taking the interdisciplinary aspects <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> into account, this article addresses the challenge of how experience design can contribute to pride experience in the workplace.|$|R

30|$|The design {{strategies}} for self-focused short-term pride {{is in line}} with the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> in human-production interaction (Desmet 2012): self-efficacy enhancement is related to “using the tool induces <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> task performance”; self-respect enhancements matches with “owning the tool induces <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> one’s expertise”; and goal achievement promotion fits with “the tool enables results that induces <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> one’s task performance”.
