50|$|Native species need normal {{juvenile}} {{mass and}} bill length {{to recover and}} persist, but for this to happen, food must be restored to former levels. There is support that an introduced bird, such as the Japanese white-eye, {{is responsible for the}} food <b>shortage.</b> <b>Control</b> of the white-eye is therefore essential for the recovery of native Hawaiian birds. The determination of the status of native birds is essential; those found to be endangered could possibly benefit from the designation of critical habitat. In 1980, a program to eradicate the Indian white-eye in California involved mist-netting and shooting the birds, and this proved to be the most successful of the various capture methods explored. Whether eradication is feasible and applicable to other instances of invasive exotic birds is yet to be determined, but could be considered a possibility for the eradication of the Japanese white-eye in the Hawaiian Islands. However, because the white-eye's current ecological role is not fully understood (i.e. seed disperser, pollinator, etc.) further studies are necessary before any drastic measures are taken.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{contained in}} these papers embodies both results from direct archaeological investigation {{and also the}} development of techniques (geophysical, chronological and geoarchaeological) {{in order to understand}} long-term settlements and their associated landscapes in Orkney and Shetland. Central to this research has been the study of soil management strategies of arable plots surrounding settlements from the Neolithic to the Iron Age. It is argued that this arable system provides higher yields in marginal locations. The ability to enhance yield in good years and to store surplus can mitigate against <b>shortage.</b> <b>Control</b> and storage of this surplus is seen as one catalyst for the economic power of elite groups over their underlying or ¿client¿ population. The emergence of a social elite in the Iron Age, building brochs and other substantial roundhouses of near broch proportions, is seen as being linked to the control of resources. Evidence at the site of Old Scatness indicated that there was a continuity of wealth and power from the Middle Iron Age through the Pictish period, before the appearance of the Vikings produced a break in the archaeological record. The Viking period saw a break in building traditions, the introduction of new artefacts and changes in farming and fishing strategies. Each of the papers represents a contribution that builds on these themes...|$|E

Three examples are examined in detail: the 'nursing shortage' literature; Lind's analysis of recent rent control models; and a wide-ranging evaluation of 'is there too little theory in development economics?' by leading development economists.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Fuelwood {{is a basic}} {{need for}} rural {{households}} in Malawi. However, deforestation has reduced the quantity of forest products such as fuelwood available to households. This has negatively affected rural Malawian quality of life, especially {{for women who are}} forced to walk long distances to collect fuelwood, prepare foods with short cooking times, or reduce the number of meals. The Malawi government has encouraged the establishment of household owned woodlots, as a part of reforestation programs, to address the supply side of the forest product scarcity. However, fuelwood supply and use is also a gender-based issue; men plant trees and make decisions over harvesting, while women gather and use fuelwood. Within the household, woodlot products also have multiple and competing uses between men and women. It is critical to examine how gender dynamics affect women's fuelwood procurement and use from the woodlot. This study investigated how gender of the household head and women's access to woodlots affects fuelwood <b>shortage,</b> <b>controlling</b> for number of trees, household size, and use of other fuels. Fifty-one female and sixty-three male-headed households with household owned woodlots were interviewed, using questionnaire and focus group interviews. Results show that one-third of both household types reported experiencing fuelwood shortages in the past year. Logistic regression indicates that gender of household head is an important factor, along with number of trees in the woodlot, in determining fuelwood sufficiency. Female-headed households were less likely to experience fuelwood shortage than male-headed households when the interaction with number of trees was included. Whether a woman in male-headed households must seek permission to harvest fuelwood, number of trees, and cooking with maize stalk were factors that predicted fuelwood shortage. Suggestions for several interventions to address fuelwood supply and access were included. Planting more trees in woodlots and use of fuelwood efficient stoves are two important strategies. It is important to address gender-specific priorities as they relate to woodlot use. This can be done through gender sensitizations that target program planners and male household heads. For successful programs, men and women should participate in both program planning and implementation...|$|R

Since the early 1980 s the county has taken advantage of local warm climate and focused its economic development strategy on commercial vegetable plantations.

There are many actions, based on {{water resources management}} approach, which can help overcome these water-related challenges.

This study investigates using the RIBASIM (RIver BAsin SIMulation) model, the most suitable actions for the future. RIBASIM was used to simulate the current condition and evaluate various scenarios in 2017 based on different actions. Three scenarios were formulated being optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic which represent different implementation rates of the tested actions. RIBASIM results indicated a water shortage of 0. 59, 1, and 1. 85 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) /year, for the simulated scenarios, respectively.

Hydrological impact signals derived from CMIP 3 climate change scenarios, however, are highly uncertain and largely ignore hydrological extremes. This paper provides {{one of the}} first hydrological impact assessments using the most recent CMIP 5 climate change scenarios. Furthermore, we model and analyse changes in river flow regimes and hydrological extremes (i. e. high flow and low flow conditions). Similar to earlier CMIP 3 -based assessments, the hydrological cycle also intensifies in the CMIP 5 climate change scenarios. The scenarios ensemble mean shows increases in both seasonal and annual river discharges (annual change between + 5 and + 16 %, depending on location). Despite the overall increasing trend, the individual scenarios show differences in the magnitude of discharge changes and, to a lesser extent, contrasting directional chages. We further found that extremely high flow events increase in both magnitude and frequency. Extremely low flows, on the other hand, are projected to occur less often under climate change. Higher low flows can help reducing dry season water <b>shortage</b> and <b>controlling</b> salinization in the downstream Mekong Delta. However, higher and more frequent peak discharges will exacerbate flood risk in the basin. The implications of climate change induced hydrological changes are critical and thus require special attention in climate change adaptation and disaster-risk reduction...|$|R

The success of carbon nanotubes as sensors may be attributed to their increased effective surface area, which decreases the electrode impedance and increases current [1 – 4]. The increased surface area also immobilizes more enzymes thereon in biomedical applications [2]. However, there are some disadvantages to fabricating carbon nanotubes.
