Due {{to these}} reasons that present {{frequent}} neighboring class set mining algorithms are unsuitable for extracting any length frequent neighboring class <b>set</b> <b>with</b> constraint class <b>set,</b> this paper proposes an algorithm of synchronous mining frequent neighboring class <b>set</b> <b>with</b> constraint class <b>set,</b> which {{is suitable for}} mining any length frequent neighboring class <b>set</b> <b>with</b> constraint class <b>set</b> in large spatial database. The algorithm creates mining database through digitization method, and then gains candidate frequent neighboring class <b>set</b> <b>with</b> constraint class <b>set</b> via synchronous search strategy, namely, it uses computing (k- 1) -subset of k-non frequent neighboring class <b>set</b> <b>with</b> constraint class <b>set</b> to generate candidate frequent neighboring class set, meanwhile, it also uses connecting (l+ 1) -superset of l-frequent neighboring class sets to generate candidate frequent neighboring class <b>set</b> <b>with</b> constraint class <b>set,</b> it only need scan database once to extract frequent neighboring class <b>set</b> <b>with</b> constraint class <b>set.</b> The result of experiment indicates that the algorithm is faster and more efficient than present algorithms when mining any length frequent neighboring class <b>set</b> <b>with</b> constraint class <b>set...</b>|$|R

40|$|The known {{families}} of difference sets can be subdivided into three classes: difference <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> Singer parameters, cyclotomic difference sets, and difference <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> gcd$(v,n) > 1 $.

In an attempt to attack this problem, we use difference <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> three nontrivial character values as candidates, and get some necessary conditions. Comment: 17 page...|$|R

5|$|Police Squads opening {{sequence}} {{was based}} on the 1950s show M Squad, which starred Lee Marvin, which opened with footage of a police car roving through a dark urban <b>setting</b> <b>with</b> a big band playing a jazz song in the background. The Hank Simms voice-over and the show's organization into acts with an epilogue was homage to Quinn Martin police dramas including The Fugitive, The Streets of San Francisco, Barnaby Jones, The F.B.I., and Cannon. Nielsen portrayed a serious character whose one-liners appeared accidental next to the pratfalls and sight gags that were happening around him. Although the show lasted only six episodes Nielsen received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.|$|E

5|$|Set in 1964 (three {{decades before}} {{the events of}} the {{original}} Metal Gear), the story centers on FOX operative codenamed Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a Russian rocket scientist by the name of Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, sabotage an experimental superweapon, and assassinate his defected former boss. While previous games were set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 1960s Soviet jungle <b>setting,</b> <b>with</b> the high tech, near-future trappings of previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor.

The production moved to New York, where Massine was relieved to find the audiences receptive, a sign, he thought, that New Yorkers were finally beginning to take ballet seriously. The first American-designed production, in 1937, was that of the Modern Dance exponent Lester Horton, whose version replaced the original pagan Russian <b>setting</b> <b>with</b> a Wild West background and the use of Native American dances.|$|E

The video features Barrett (shown with an acoustic guitar for the first time) and the group miming to the song in a more conventional stage <b>setting,</b> <b>with</b> psychedelic projections in the background. The original audio to the promo is lost, and most versions use the BBC recording from late 1967, consequently causing sync issues most evident as Barrett sings the opening verse. The original film was considered to be lost, until it was re-discovered in the Manchester Arts Lab in 1999. Barrett and Waters first watched the promo video during the second week of December 1967.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} {{the exploits of}} Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind. The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border. Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom <b>setting</b> <b>with</b> elements of black humour and surrealism.|$|E

The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E
5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is a {{real-time}} strategy game (RTS). The player {{takes the}} role of either the Human inhabitants of Azeroth, or the invading Orcs.

In multiplayer games, the objective is always to destroy the enemy players' forces. Some scenarios are complicated by the presence of wild monsters, but sometimes these monsters can be used as troops. The game plays in a medieval <b>setting</b> <b>with</b> fantasy elements.

5|$|Among big-budget auteurs, Michael Mann {{has worked}} {{frequently}} in a neo-noir mode, with {{such films as}} Thief (1981) and Heat (1995) and the TV series Miami Vice (1984–89) and Crime Story (1986–88). Mann's output exemplifies a primary strain of neo-noir, in which classic themes and tropes are revisited in a contemporary <b>setting</b> <b>with</b> an up-to-date visual style and rock- or hip hop–based musical soundtrack. Like Chinatown, its more complex predecessor, Curtis Hanson's Oscar-winning L.A. Confidential (1997), based on the James Ellroy novel, demonstrates an opposite tendency—the deliberately retro film noir; its tale of corrupt cops and femmes fatales is seemingly lifted straight from a film of 1953, {{the year in which}} it is set. Director David Fincher followed the immensely successful neo-noir Seven (1995) with a film that developed into a cult favorite after its original, disappointing release: Fight Club (1999) is a sui generis mix of noir aesthetic, perverse comedy, speculative content, and satiric intent.|$|E
