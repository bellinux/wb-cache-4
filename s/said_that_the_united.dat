On March 7, 2009, Raynor {{and his supporters}} held a disaffiliation referendum vote among the members in their affiliate unions in advance of UNITE HERE's first quadrennial convention (set for summer 2009), and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if they were successful they would affiliate with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Wilhelm and his supporters <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>UNITE</b> HERE constitution prevented any such vote without {{the permission of the}} international union's executive board. Also at issue was control over Amalgamated Bank, which UNITE brought with it into the merger and whose ownership (and its substantial net worth) now belonged to UNITE HERE. Wilhelm sued Raynor and the 15 affiliates in February 2009 in U.S. district court, but the court declined to prevent the vote.|$|R

5000|$|I have <b>said</b> earlier <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States is now totally frank {{about putting}} its cards on <b>the</b> table. <b>That</b> is <b>the</b> case.

[...] "Full spectrum dominance" [...] means control of land, sea, air and space and all attendant resources.|$|R
25|$|In addition, the United States has {{indicated}} that it would supply Taiwan's military with ships and planes, but has not provided significant numbers of either for some years though Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States would reduce arms sales to Taiwan if tensions are eased, but {{that this was not}} a change in American policy.|$|E

50|$|He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> after <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{intervention}} some {{of their}} nominal allies worked, under the table, to hurt the new regime and cause chaos.

25|$|U.S. {{chemical}} weapons were brought into Okinawa in 1962 {{based on the}} recommendation of Robert McNamara when he was secretary of defense, according to declassified documents.

25|$|Dozens {{of former}} fighters for the TFG arrived in Mogadishu riding six technicals, three trucks armed with antiaircraft guns and three pickups {{mounting}} machine guns. The fighters cited {{their desire to}} leave was due to Baidoa coming under Ethiopian control. They defected 40 days before (presumably about November 5) and finally reached the capital after moving slowly through the jungle. The ICU claimed over 600 troops have defected since February 2006. The defecting troops were disarmed and ordered to undergo new training. In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State, Jendayi Frazer <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{had no plans to}} commit troops to Somalia, and urged African nations to meet the commitments of the UN resolution for peacekeepers.|$|E
25|$|In August 1953, the Shah {{finally agreed}} to Mossadegh's overthrow, after Roosevelt <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States would proceed with or without him, and {{formally}} dismissed the prime minister in a written decree, an act {{that had been made}} part of the constitution during the Constitution Assembly of 1949, convened under martial law, at which time the power of the monarchy was increased in various ways by the Shah himself. As a precautionary measure, he flew to Baghdad and from there hid safely in Rome. He actually signed two decrees, one dismissing Mosaddegh and the other nominating the CIA's choice, General Fazlollah Zahedi, as Prime Minister. These decrees, called Farmāns, were specifically written as dictated by Donald Wilber, the CIA architect of the plan, and were designed as a major part of Wilber's strategy to give the impression of legitimacy to the secret coup, as can be read in the declassified plan itself, which bears his name.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to political turmoil in Ukraine in early 2014, Paul initially <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States should remain {{mindful of the}} fact that although the Cold War is over, Russia remains a military power with long-range nuclear missiles. He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States should try to maintain a [...] "respectful relationship with Russia" [...] and avoid taking actions that the Russians might view as a provocation, such as seeking to have Ukraine join NATO or otherwise interfering in Russia's relationship with Ukraine. Two weeks later, after the Russian parliament authorized {{the use of military force}} in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military exercises along Russia's border with Ukraine, Paul began taking a different tone. He wrote: [...] "Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a gross violation of that nation's sovereignty and an affront to the international community... Putin must be punished for violating the Budapest Memorandum, and Russia must learn that the U.S. will isolate it if it insists on acting like a rogue nation." [...] He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and European allies could retaliate against Russia's military aggression without any need for military action. He urged that the United States impose economic sanctions on Russia and resume an effort to build ]. He also called for the United States to take steps as a counterweight to Russia's strategic influence on Europe's oil and gas supply, such as lifting restrictions on new exploration and drilling for fossil fuels in the United States along with immediate approval of the controversial Keystone Pipeline, which he said would allow the United States to ship more oil and gas to Europe if Russia attempts to cut off its own supply to Europe.|$|E
50|$|He {{has also}} <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> IOC and <b>United</b> States Olympic Committee (USOC) {{did not make}} {{adequate}} efforts to shut down ticket sellers illegally operating under the IOC's trade names, which {{makes it difficult for}} consumers to determine the difference between legitimate and illegitimate sellers.|$|R

Lafitte also wrote to a member of the Louisiana Legislature, and his letters were well calculated to produce a very good effect in his favor.|$|R

500|$|In 2010, White House counterterrorism {{director}} John O.

[...] Olson said, [...] "In some places, in deference to host-country sensitivities, we are lower in profile. In every place, Special Operations forces activities are coordinated with the U.S. ambassador and are under the operational control of the four-star regional commander." ...|$|E
500|$|York University {{professor}} Natalya Timoshkina, who {{was part}} of two research studies about human trafficking in Canada, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States was combatting human trafficking much more effectively than Canada was. Timoshkina said that Canada's responses to human trafficking have been sporadic and that, even if a national action plan was implemented, Canada needed to begin engaging with other countries on this issue. In February 2011, Shae Invidiata of Free-Thema Canadian organization that raises awareness about human traffickingsaid it was [...] "mind blowing [...] currently {{we do not have a}} national action plan to combat human trafficking in Canada." ...|$|E
