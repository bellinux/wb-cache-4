Sectoral real output is analysed in two sub-periods: 1946 to 1969 and the years 1970 - 2003. The reason for splitting the sample is to investigate whether the commonly held view that a structural transformation from an economy dominated by agriculture to one that is predominantly service-oriented was reflected in the data. One cointegrating relationship is found in both sub-periods. The results suggest that for the earlier period, increases in industrial <b>output</b> (<b>services</b> <b>output)</b> were associated with lower (higher) agricultural GDP over the long run. In the short run, only changes in industrial output promoted growth in agricultural output. In the latter period, an expansion in <b>services</b> <b>output</b> was found to be the only determinant of industrial output in both the short and long run, as agricultural output did not appear to have any statistically significant impact in either timeframe.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} the proper measurement of financial <b>service</b> <b>output</b> {{that is not}} priced explicitly. It shows how to impute nominal <b>service</b> <b>output</b> from financial intermediaries ’ interest income, and how to construct price indices for those financial services. We present an optimizing model with financial intermediaries that provide financial services to resolve asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders. We embed these intermediaries in a dynamic, stochastic, general-equilibrium model where assets are priced competitively according to their systematic risk, as in the standard consumption- capitalasset-pricing model. In this environment, we show that {{it is critical to}} take risk into account in order to measure financial output accurately. We also show that even using a risk-adjusted reference rate does not solve all the problems associated with measuring nominal financial <b>service</b> <b>output.</b> Our model allows us to address important outstanding questions in output and productivity measurement for financial firms, such as: (1) What are the correct “reference rates ” one should use in calculating bank output? (2) If reference rates need to take account of risk, does this mean that they must be ex ante rates of return? (3) What is the right price deflator for the output of financial firms? Is it just the general price index? (4) When—if ever—should we count capital gains of financial firms as part of financial <b>service</b> <b>output...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} for the servitization of European manufacturing – the trend that manufacturing firms increasingly offer services along with their physical products. We employ input-output data as well as data from a company survey to give a comprehensive picture of servitization across countries and industries. The share of services in the output of manufacturing industries increased in {{the large majority of}} European countries between 1995 and 2005 and between 2000 and 2005. <b>Service</b> <b>output</b> of manu-facturing, however, is still small compared to the output of physical products. The highest service shares are found in small countries {{with a high degree of}} openness and R&D intensity. EU- 12 Member States have lower shares of <b>service</b> <b>output</b> compared to the EU- 15. There is a strong link between servitization and technological innovation at different levels. Countries with the highest shares of services on manufacturing output have also the highest R&D intensities at the aggregate level. The <b>service</b> <b>output</b> of these countries consists predominantly of knowledge-intensive services. Highly innovative sectors reveal also the highest share of firms that offer services and the highest turnover generated with services. Examples are electrical and optical equipment, machinery, or the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. At the firm level, we find a U-shaped relationship between firm size and <b>service</b> <b>output,</b> which indicates that small, but also large manufacturing firms have advantages in servitization. Producers of complex, customized products tend to have a higher share of services in output than producers of simple, mass-produced goods. Moreover, firms which have launched products new to the market during the last two years are more likely to realize higher shares of turnover from services compared to companies which launched no products new to the market. ...|$|E

40|$|Payments for {{ecosystem}} <b>service</b> <b>outputs</b> {{have recently}} {{become a popular}} policy prescription {{for a range of}} agri-environmental schemes. The focus of this paper is on the choice of contract instruments to incentivise the provision of ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>outputs</b> from farms. The farmer is better informed than the regulator in terms of hidden information about costs and hidden-actions relating to effort. The results show that with perfect information, the regulator can contract equivalently on inputs or outputs. With hidden information, input-based contracts are more cost effective at reducing the informational rent related to adverse selection than output-based contracts. Mixed contracts are also cost-effective, especially where one input is not observable. Such contracts allow the regulator to target variables that are “costly-to-fake” as opposed to those prone to moral hazard such as effort. Further results are given for fixed price contracts and input-based contracts with moral hazard. The model is extended to include a discussion of repeated contracting and the scope that exists for the regulator to benefit from information revealed by the initial choice of contract. The models are applied to a case study of contracting with farmers to protect high biodiversity native vegetation that also provides socially-valuable ecosystem services. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
