5|$|When Joe Nieuwendyk {{refused to}} report to the Flames prior to the 1995 season, they named Fleury interim captain. The title was made {{permanent}} when Nieuwendyk was traded in December. Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy, but did <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of loyalty to the team and because there was nobody else capable of taking on the role. He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his teammates and coach Pierre Pagé.|$|E
5|$|Je Me Souviens was {{published}} in 1910, after Vivien's death. That same year, Barney published Actes et Entr'actes (Acts and Interludes), {{a collection of short}} plays and poems. One of the plays was Equivoque (Ambiguity), a revisionist version on the legend of Sappho's death: Instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of Phaon the sailor, she does <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman she loves. The play incorporates quotations from Sappho's fragments, with Barney's own footnotes in Greek.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the eastern Languedoc with the Southern Rhône Valley wine region was moved slightly in 2004, {{with the result that}} Costières de Nîmes AOC is now a Rhône appellation rather than a Languedoc one. In that year, INAO moved the responsibility for oversight of this appellation's wine to the regional committee of the Rhône valley. Local producers of Côtes du Rhône-styled wines made from Syrah and Grenache lobbied for this change since the local winemaking traditions did not coincide with administrative borders, and presumably due to the greater prestige of Rhône wines in the marketplace. Such changes of borders between wine regions are very rare, <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of habit, Costières de Nîmes remains listed as a Languedoc wine in many publications.|$|E

5|$|During the 45years {{the award}} has been active, 170authors have had works nominated; 45of these authors have won. In two years, 1976 and 1994, the panel {{selected}} {{none of the}} nominees as a winner, while in 1974, 2002, 2009, and 2012 the panel selected two winners rather than one. Frederik Pohl and Joan Slonczewski have each won twice, the only authors to do <b>so,</b> <b>out</b> of four and two nominations, respectively. Kim Stanley Robinson and Paul J. McAuley have won once out of six nominations, and Jack McDevitt, Adam Roberts, and Robert J. Sawyer have won once out of five nominations, while Nancy Kress, Bruce Sterling, and Robert Charles Wilson have won once out of four nominations. Greg Bear has the most nominations without winning at nine, followed by Sheri S. Tepper at six, James K. Morrow at five, and William Gibson, Ken MacLeod, and Charles Stross at four.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of compassion.|$|E

25|$|The funeral {{procession}} {{is a highly}} elaborate, visible and competitive public spectacle, designed to impress the public with altars, canopies, flowers, paper figurines, burnt offerings and most importantly, with the display of impressive tomb figurines. The competitive nature of {{funeral procession}}s got <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of hand, that the emperor had to issue imperial edicts to regulate the quantity and size of tomb figurines, according to the deceased’s social status. Tomb artefacts were meant to glorify its deceased master and the master’s living family.|$|E

25|$|The Zapatista Army {{went public}} on January 1, 1994, {{the day when}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect. On that day, they issued their First Declaration and Revolutionary Laws from the Lacandon Jungle. The {{declaration}} amounted to a declaration of war on the Mexican government, which they considered <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of touch with {{the will of the people}} as to make it illegitimate. The EZLN stressed that it opted for armed struggle due to the lack of results achieved through peaceful means of protest (such as sit-ins and marches).|$|E
25|$|Whitman-Walker {{encountered}} resistance when {{it began}} to offer services through the Northern Virginia AIDS Project in 1987. Although the Clinic had started its Northern Virginia AIDS Project in 1987, it {{was unable to find}} space for its operations for some time. In one case, the Clinic was denied housing by a landlord who allegedly did <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of fear and/or homophobia. The landlord claimed the Clinic had not met certain leasing and payment requirements, and a judge agreed. Whitman-Walker eventually found other space and opened its Northern Virginia AIDS (NOVAA) Project office in Arlington, offering case management and education services.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there were}} a number of {{objections}} to these proposals, amongst them from Strathclyde Bus Holdings, who it could be argued did <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of fear of their profit margins being affected by such an initiative. This necessitated a public inquiry, which lasted around 10 weeks. The Parliamentary Commissioners appointed to deliberate on the matter met and discussed the conclusions of this inquiry in a matter of hours before finding in favour of the objections raised thus killing off the Strathclyde Tram Project. The reasoning of the Commissioners is unknown as there existed no obligation for them to reveal it.|$|E

25|$|The {{brutality}} was {{aggravated by}} alcohol, particularly at night. Frequent and extreme drunkenness, {{which was a}} common problem within the SA, aggravated the situation at Kemna, as numerous former inmates later testified. Typically, off-duty guards would go out drinking at nearby taverns and hours later, return inebriated, ready {{to take part in}} interrogations. Sometimes, they would begin their own so-called interrogations, unsupervised. Local taverns, normally closed at the hours the guards were ready to drink, were faced with violence and threats if they did not re-open. Veller's drinking was <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of control that he was incapable of showing up for work on a regular basis—and it was no secret.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century a similar {{conflict}} has {{existed in the}} Mexican state of Chiapas, {{in the southern part}} of the country, where indigenous people declared war on the Mexican government. The Mayan Zapatista Army (EZLN) on January 1, 1994, the day when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect, issued their First Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle and their Revolutionary Laws. They effectively declared war on the Mexican government, which they considered <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of touch with the will of the people as to make it illegitimate.

25|$|Leibniz died in Hanover in 1716: at the time, he was <b>so</b> <b>out</b> {{of favor}} that neither George I (who {{happened}} to be near Hanover at that time) nor any fellow courtier other than his personal secretary attended the funeral. Even though Leibniz was a life member of the Royal Society and the Berlin Academy of Sciences, neither organization saw fit to honor his passing. His grave went unmarked for more than 50 years. Leibniz was eulogized by Fontenelle, before the French Academy of Sciences in Paris, which had admitted him as a foreign member in 1700. The eulogy was composed {{at the behest of}} the Duchess of Orleans, a niece of the Electress Sophia.|$|E

25|$|North of Dollywaggon Pike {{the ridge}} narrows and then steps up over High Crag to the plateau top of Nethermost Pike. In the other {{direction}} the high ground curves south-east around Cock Cove before a long slope falls to Grisedale Tarn at around 1,770ft (539 m). This sizeable tarn has a depth of around 110ft (34 m) and holds brown trout, perch and eels. The outflow is to Ullswater to the north east, picking {{up all of the}} rainfall from the eastern face of Dollywaggon Pike. To the west of the tarn is the unnamed col between Dollywaggon Pike and Seat Sandal and immediately to the south is Grisedale Hause, the depression between Seat Sandal and Fairfield. Thus Seat Sandal stands topographically on the ridge between the two higher fells, but <b>so</b> <b>out</b> on a limb that many walkers proceed directly from Dollywaggon Pike to Fairfield.|$|E
25|$|Edward, {{like all}} vampires in the Twilight series, {{possesses}} superhuman stamina, senses, mentality, and agility, {{as well as}} a healing factor and night vision. His superhuman strength allows him to subdue his prey, uproot trees, throw cars, and crush metal. His bodily tissue is stronger than granite, making him much more durable and tougher than humans as well as contributing slightly to his body weight. He is described as being inhumanly beautiful with refined and perfected features. His scent and voice are enormously seductive to Bella, so much so that he occasionally sends her into a pliant daze entirely by accident. In Twilight, Edward explains that like other vampires, he does not need to breathe, though he chooses to do <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of habit and because it is helpful to smell his environment. He cannot digest regular food, and compares its attractiveness for him to the prospect of eating dirt for a regular person. Like other vampires, Edward is not able to sleep.|$|E
25|$|The {{season is}} usually a few races shorter {{than that of the}} Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, and the prize money is {{significantly}} lower. However, over the last several years, a number of Cup Series drivers have run both the Xfinity and Cup Series events each weekend, using the Xfinity race as a warm-up to the Cup event at the same facility. Furthermore, several drivers not only participated in both Cup and Busch/Nationwide events in the same weekend but also began to compete in both series on a full-time basis. Kevin Harvick was the first Cup series driver to compete full-time in the Busch Series and win a title, actually doing so twice; in 2001, he did this for Richard Childress Racing but only did <b>so</b> <b>out</b> of necessity as Dale Earnhardt's death forced him into the Cup series ahead of RCR's intended schedule for him. His win in 2006, where he raced three separate cars for RCR and his own race team, was the first of five consecutive titles in NBS/NNS that were won by Cup series regulars.|$|E
