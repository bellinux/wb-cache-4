40|$|AbstractThis paper {{aimed to}} {{identify}} various aspects <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> Public Sector Employees in Saudi Arabia by proposing {{a policy that}} might help to activate and coordinate the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel in Saudi Arabia. To achieve the objectives of this paper, it has been divided into five parts. The first part is the theoretical framework of the issue in which we address the importance <b>of</b> <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel {{in the public sector}} in Saudi Arabia. Then I will review the concept and importance <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel in general. In the second part we will review several international experiences, while in the third part, we will focus on the current reality <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> regulations applied in Saudi Arabia. In the fourth part, we will analyze the current situation by identifying strengths and weaknesses in the <b>secondment</b> regulation <b>of</b> the personnel in Saudi Arabia. Finally, the study will propose a policy to activate, coordinate and encourage the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel in Saudi Arabia. It is worth mentioning that the paper concluded that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia devoted a regulation for the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel both within and outside Saudi Arabia, through the public sector personnel may be seconded to some government, regional or international bodies. However, within the Kingdom does not allowed to second the public sector personnel except for some government agencies that have special private system and this deprives several government agencies {{to take advantage of the}} unique experiences in some government agencies. In addition, I will suggest new regulations that will allow private sector to second their employees to government agencies. In conclusion there is a need to develop the secondment regulation to allow the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> the government agencies personnel among them, regardless of being a ministry or a public institution, as there is an urgent need to add regulatory articles for the secondment to second Saudi employees working in the private sector to various government agencies through the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> their services for specific periods such as four years as an example along with providing them with financial incentives to encourage their services secondment...|$|R

40|$|Many {{developing}} countries are experiencing rapid expansion in mining with associated water impacts. In most cases mining expansion is outpacing the building of national capacity to ensure that sustainable water management practices are implemented. Since 2011, Australia's International Mining for Development Centre (IM 4 DC) has funded capacity building in such countries including a program of water projects. Five projects in particular (principally covering experiences from Peru, Colombia, Ghana, Zambia, Indonesia, Philippines and Mongolia) have provided insight into water capacity building priorities and opportunities. This paper reviews the challenges faced by water stakeholders, and proposes the associated capacity needs. The paper uses the evidence derived from the IM 4 DC projects to develop a set of specific capacity-building recommendations. Recommendations include: the incorporation of mine water management in engineering and environmental undergraduate courses; <b>secondments</b> <b>of</b> staff to suitable partner organisations; training to allow site staff to effectively monitor water including community impacts; leadership training to support a water stewardship culture; training <b>of</b> <b>officials</b> to support implementation of catchment management approaches; and the empowerment of communities to recognise and negotiate solutions to mine-related risks. New initiatives to fund the transfer of multi-disciplinary knowledge from nations with well-developed water management practices are called for...|$|R

50|$|As {{the murder}} had {{occurred}} in {{the territory of the}} Bethnal Green Division of the Metropolitan Police, it was initially investigated by the local detectives, inspectors John Spratling and Joseph Helson, who had little success. Elements of the press linked the attack on Nichols to two previous murders, those of Emma Elizabeth Smith and Martha Tabram, and suggested the killing might have been perpetrated by a gang, {{as in the case of}} Smith. The Star newspaper instead suggested a single killer was the culprit and other newspapers took up their storyline.
