40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the design and}} implementation of Updates and Event Handlers in a relational database programming language. Update operations are implemented in the nested relational model and Event Handlers transform the database system from passive to active. The update operation allows the user to change values of specified attributes in certain tuples. These attributes can be selected by a "using" clause which uses a relational algebra operation to select tuples from the relation we want to update. We can also use updates to add or delete some tuples to or from the relation. The nested update in nested relations will also be presented. Event handlers are introduced as procedures, invoked by events which are system generated procedure calls. We implement the event handler based on computation [...] -the procedural abstraction facility of the database programming language. An update statement can invoke multiple event handlers. Event handlers may contain update statements which in turn invoke other event handlers. This introduces cascading event handlers. We will present the combination of update and event handler algorithm by which the update; operation is coupled with event handler closely and neatly, and the cascading event handler is handled by the system's recursive execution. In this thesis, we provide the user a uniform syntax to update both flat relations and nested relations. The unification of computation and procedure leads to a simpler language.

40|$|Gerald Dworkin's {{influential}} {{account of}} Personal Autonomy offers {{the following two}} conditions for autonomy: (i) Authenticity - the condition that one identify with one's beliefs, desires and values after a process of critical reflection, and (ii) Procedural Independence - the identification in (i) must not be "influenced in ways which make the process of identification in some way alien to the individual" (Dworkin 1989 : 61). I argue in this thesis that there are cases which fulfil both of Dworkin's conditions, yet are clearly not cases of autonomy. Specifically, I argue that we can best assess the adequacy of Dworkin's account of autonomy through literature, because it provides a unique medium for testing his account on the very terms he sets up for himself - ie. that autonomy apply to, and make sense of, persons leading lives of a certain quality. The examination of two novels - Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day and Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady - shows that Dworkin's explanation of identification and critical reflection is inadequate for capturing their role in autonomy and {{that he does not}} pay enough attention to the role of external factors in preventing or supporting autonomy. As an alternative, I offer the following two conditions for autonomy: (i) critical reflection of a certain kind - radical reflection, and (ii) the ability to translate the results of (i) into action - competence. The novels demonstrate that both conditions are dependent upon considerations of the content of one's beliefs, desires, values etc. Certain of these will prevent or hinder the achievement of autonomy because of their content, so autonomy must be understood in relation to <b>substantial</b> <b>considerations,</b> rather than in purely formal terms, as Dworkin argues...|$|R

40|$|Experimental Typography in Twentieth-Century Poetry, by Daniel Matore, New College, University of Oxford. A thesis {{submitted}} for examination for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy in English Literature in Hilary Term, 2017. This thesis is {{a study of the}} typographical experimentation in the verse of twentieth-century poets writing in English. Typography and poetics, it contends, became indissolubly linked in the last century, and this work traces why this is so. It chiefly deals with poetry written roughly in the period 1908 to 1970, rooted in the work of Ezra Pound, E. E. Cummings, and Charles Olson, but with <b>substantial</b> <b>considerations</b> of poets such as Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, and David Jones. Typographical experiment in European languages, particularly the work of Stéphane Mallarme, Guillaume Apollinaire, and F. T. Marinetti, is recurrently invoked to comprehend the idiosyncrasies of the graphical innovations of British and American poets. At the heart of this thesis is the question of why so many poets throughout the last century employed typography as a signatory part of their style. It hopes to show how authorships and the span of a poetâs career can be read through their typography. Its methodology is eclectic. Archival research into manuscripts, drafts, typescripts, and proofs has provided the empirical groundwork as well as interpretative insights. Essays and periodical articles are drawn upon to trace the intellectual history which informs literary style. Close reading, sometimes within the parameters of established stylistic vocabulary and sometimes at the limits of this, is undertaken to illuminate the expressive possibilities of typographical form. The introduction prefigures the debates and motifs of typographical experiment through the seminal work of Stéphane Mallarmé. It considers whether there was a typographical revolution in poetry in English {{at the start of the}} last century and examines how the advents of free verse and experimental mise-en-page intersected. Chapter 1 traces the foundational importance of Ezra Pound in the genealogy of typographical experiment in English. His graphical innovations are read through lenses such as musicology, psychophysics, and ophthalmology. Chapter 2 considers the audacious and celebrated visuality of E. E. Cummings, focussing on his early unpublished experiments, his debut volume Tulips and Chimneys (1923), and his 1935 collection No Thanks. How sexuality and the material text interrelate is examined, and his typography is interpreted through his theories of reading. Chapter 3 is concerned with the post-war experiments of Charles Olson, especially his magnum opus The Maximus Poems. The respective vocations of the poet and the typographer are examined through his relationships with printers and designers, and the influence of philosophies of space on his poetics is explored. The conclusion situates modernist experiment in relation to the aesthetics of graphic design. The categories of printing reformers and reactionaries are employed to cast into relief the idiosyncrasy of typographical experimentation in poetry. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to describe}} work {{carried out at}} the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Architecture and Software Technology (FhG-FIRST), in particular at the research group for Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA), within the project "Brain-Computer Interface" (BCI). The goal of that project is to design and develop a hardware and software system {{that is capable of}} transforming, in real-time, electroencephalographic (EEG) signals (signals retrieved in a non-invasive way from surface electrodes placed over the user's head) into specific commands such that the user gains reliable control over a computer application or a device. In this dissertation, control over a computer application will be represented with "Brain-Gaming", i. e. simple computer games like Ping-Pong, Pacman or Tetris. To this end, <b>substantial</b> <b>considerations</b> were made on the design and realization of a communication interface and its corresponding protocol. A further important component of every control operation is its strategy and the control alphabet, i. e. the command set. For this purpose, several control strategies were developed, implemented and proved experimentally in different scenarios. The most important aspect of the design and development of these interfaces turned out to be their flexibility. Control over a device could include the steering and moving of a wheel-chair for paralyzed patients or the gaining of control over an arm or foot prosthesis for patients with amputated limbs. The latter was realized here as a computer-based simulation of a virtual limb (e. g. arm), such that it can be tested in future experiments on patients with amputated limbs. In contrast to the "Brain-Gaming" experiments, where the player was equipped with an additional communication channel (one that exists independently of normal communication channels of the human neuromuscular system), the experiments with patients did not require an ultra-fast recognition of the intended movement; i. e. the command signal for a simulated movement can be recognized after the phantom movement is initialized and performed. In experiments with feedback scenarios, which can be resembled as competitive games, several aspects of ultra-fast movement detection could be investigated with reaction tests. This opens new perspectives for the execution of preventive actions in time-critical applications. This dissertation, and {{the development and implementation of}} the prototype, is based on well-founded insights into human neurophysiology; one chapter will deal exclusively with these insights. Moreover, a special chapter of this dissertation will also describe the development and implementation of an online prototype of the BBCI system (Berlin Brain-Computer Interface) from the software engineering viewpoint. A number of bio-feedback modules, for gaming and for rehabilitation purposes, were developed within this work and will be presented in detail.
