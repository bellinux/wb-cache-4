[...] One of the rooms had been fitted up as a ladies toilet, in which the pumps kept “continuous jets of water playing, while the boat is in motion, so that no offensive effluvia taints these sumptuous cabins.” [...] During winter, this area was heated by a <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> covered a marble slab.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a wire-braced mid-winged monoplane with {{conventional landing gear}} and an open cockpit. The aircraft used two large vertically mounted <b>steam</b> <b>radiators</b> on each side. A unique feature for the time was an all-metal ground adjustable four blade propeller installation.|$|R
60|$|The {{apartment}} was but scantily furnished, containing an iron cot, {{a couple of}} stools, a table, and, in one corner, a wash bowl with running water. There was a small <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> in the room, and this the boys lost no time in turning on, for the air was damp and cold.|$|E
60|$|Before {{emerging}} on {{the second}} floor of the gymnasium, they looked around cautiously. At the far end, near a <b>steam</b> <b>radiator,</b> they saw Slugger and Nappy seated on a couple of boxes, while Codfish rested on the top of an old nail keg. The two older boys were puffing away at cigarettes, something that was against the school rules.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't see how {{the boxes}} and barrels caught fire, sir," [...] went on the {{gymnasium}} instructor perplexedly. [...] "We had no light up here, and I don't {{see how the}}y could catch from that little <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> over there. Why, that radiator hardly gets warm!" [...] It may be mentioned here that the radiator had {{been placed on the}} upper floor of the gymnasium because there had once been talk of partitioning this part of the floor from the rest and making of it a meeting room for one of the cadet clubs.|$|E
50|$|On the floor, the oak in a parquet {{pattern is}} original. The house also has rare chandeliers that can support either gas or {{electric}} lights, functional <b>steam</b> <b>radiators</b> and an intact butler's pantry. It {{does not appear}} to have ever had any outbuildings.|$|R

40|$|The {{saprophytic}} bacterium Serratia plymuthica {{was recovered}} from a facial wound (burn) site of a pediatric patient. The clinical significance of the organism was undetermined due to its apparent eradication from this location by therapy with topical 1 % silver sulfadiazine. Seeding of the burn with S. plymuthica may have occurred from contaminated moisture sometimes found on and around <b>steam</b> <b>radiators...</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{encountered}} him afterward in the corridor. I {{had made}} a point of seeking him out, perhaps from some vague determination to prove that our last meeting in the little restaurant at the Capital had left no traces of embarrassment in me: I was, in fact, rather aggressively anxious to reveal myself to him as one who has thriven on the views he condemned, as one in whose unity of mind there is no rift. He was alone, apparently waiting for someone, leaning against a <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> in one of his awkward, angular poses, looking out of the court-house window.|$|E
60|$|In the {{big city}} the twin spirits Romance and Adventure are always abroad seeking worthy wooers. As we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and {{challenge}} us in twenty different guises. Without knowing why, we look up suddenly {{to see in a}} window a face that seems to belong to our gallery of intimate portraits; in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony and fear coming from an empty and shuttered house; instead of at our familiar curb, a cab-driver deposits us before a strange door, which one, with a smile, opens for us and bids us enter; a slip of paper, written upon, flutters down to our feet from the high lattices of Chance; we exchange glances of instantaneous hate, affection and fear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds; a sudden douse of rain--and our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of the Full Moon and first cousin of the Sidereal System; at every corner handkerchiefs drop, fingers beckon, eyes besiege, and the lost, the lonely, the rapturous, the mysterious, the perilous, changing clues of adventure are slipped into our fingers. But few of us are willing to hold and follow them. We are grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs. We pass on; and some day we come, {{at the end of a}} very dull life, to reflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two, a satin rosette kept in a safe-deposit drawer, and a lifelong feud with a <b>steam</b> <b>radiator.</b>|$|E
60|$|Although annual {{efforts have}} been made by various public-spirited {{citizens}} to build a new state-house, economy--with assistance from room Number Seven has triumphed. It is the same state-house from the gallery of which poor William Wetherell witnessed the drama of the Woodchuck Session, although there are more members now, for the population of the State has increased to five hundred thousand. It is well for General Doby, with his two hundred and fifty pounds, that he is in the Speaker's chair; five hundred seats are a good many for that hall, and painful in a long session. The Honourable Brush Bascom can stretch his legs, because he is fortunate enough to have a front seat. Upon inquiry, it turns out that Mr. Bascom has had a front seat for the last twenty years--he has been uniformly lucky in drawing. The Honourable Jacob Botcher (ten years' service) is equally fortunate; the Honourable Jake is a man of large presence, and a voice that sounds as if it came, oracularly, from the caverns of the earth. He is easily heard by the members on the back seats, while Mr. Bascom is not. Mr. Ridout, the capital lawyer, is in the House this year, and singularly enough has a front seat likewise. It was Mr. Crewe's misfortune to draw number 415, in the extreme corner of the room, and next the <b>steam</b> <b>radiator.</b> But he was not of the metal to accept tamely such a ticketing from the hat of destiny (via the Clerk of the House). He complained, as any man of spirit would, and Mr. Utter, the polite clerk, is profoundly sorry,--and says it maybe managed. Curiously enough, the Honourable Brush Bascom and the Honourable Jacob Botcher join Mr. Crewe in his complaint, and reiterate that it is an outrage that a man of such ability and deserving prominence should be among the submerged four hundred and seventy. It is managed in a mysterious manner we don't pretend to fathom, and behold Mr. Crewe {{in the front of the}} Forum, in the seats of the mighty, where he can easily be pointed out from the gallery at the head of the five hundred, between those shining leaders and parliamentarians, the Honourables Brush Bascom and Jake Botcher.|$|E
25|$|As World War II began, Desormeaux {{strengthened}} the Majestic's {{ties to the}} community through charitable actions such as offering free passes to old age pensioners and donating a day's box office receipts to the USO. In 1942, he helped manage the local collection of scrap metal for the war effort, contributing several <b>steam</b> <b>radiators</b> from the theater. He also opened the theater early mornings to accommodate third-shift defense workers.|$|R
50|$|In October 1991, the {{property}} was purchased by the Victor Hotel Limited Liability Company. Marjoe D. Bandimere of Arvada, Colorado supervised the renovation {{with the intention of}} preserving the historic integrity of the building and providing modern conveniences. Some of the historic elements included the bird cage elevator, bank vault, original woodwork, and the <b>steam</b> <b>radiators,</b> which were outfitted with individual thermostat controls. In August 1992, the renovation was completed.|$|R
5000|$|Syracuse Faucet and Valve Company were {{manufacturers}} {{of the famous}} Syracuse Packless Radiator Valve by December 1913. The company also produced Globe Angle Y and Check Valves. The company advertised the valves [...] "do not leak" [...] and they were designed for hot water or <b>steam</b> <b>radiators</b> and [...] "built for hard usage, will last indefinitely." [...] The company was located at 107 North Franklin Street in Syracuse and 220-224 West 42nd Street in New York City.|$|R
60|$|The {{house was}} quiet, the {{children}} having gone to bed, and he groped {{his way through}} the dark parlour to his den, turning on the electric switch, sinking into an armchair, and lighting a cigar. He liked this room of his, which still retained something of that flavour of a refuge and sanctuary it had so eminently possessed in the now forgotten days of matrimonial conflict. One of the few elements of agreement he had held in common with the late Mrs. Ditmar was a similarity of taste in household decoration, and they had gone together to a great emporium in Boston to choose the furniture and fittings. The lamp in the centre of the table was a bronze column supporting a hemisphere of heavy red and emerald glass, the colours woven into an intricate and bizarre design, after the manner of the art nouveau--so the zealous salesman had informed them. Cora Ditmar, when exhibiting this lamp to admiring visitors, had remembered the phrase, though her pronunciation of it, according to the standard of the Sorbonne, left something to be desired. The table and chairs, of heavy, shiny oak marvellously and precisely carved by machines, matched the big panels of the wainscot. The windows were high in the wall, thus preventing any intrusion from the clothes-yard on which they looked. The bookcases, protected by leaded panes, held countless volumes of the fiction from which Cora Ditmar had derived her knowledge of the great world outside of Hampton, together with certain sets she had bought, not only as ornaments, but with a praiseworthy view to future culture,--such as Whitmarsh's Library of the Best Literature. These volumes, alas, were still uncut; but some of the pages of the novels--if one cared to open them--were stained with chocolate. The <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> was a decoration in itself, the fireplace set in the red and yellow tiles that made the hearth. Above the oak mantel, in a gold frame, was a large coloured print of a Magdalen, doubled up in grief, with a glory of loose, Titian hair, chosen by Ditmar himself as expressing the nearest possible artistic representation of his ideal of the female form. Cora Ditmar's objections on the score of voluptuousness and of insufficient clothing had been vain. She had recognized no immorality of sentimentality in the art itself; what she felt, and with some justice, was that this particular Magdalen was unrepentant, and that Ditmar knew it. And the picture remained an offence to her as long as she lived. Formerly he had enjoyed the contemplation of this figure, reminding him, as it did, of mellowed moments in conquests of the past; suggesting also possibilities of the future. For he had been quick to discount the attitude of bowed despair, the sop flung by a sensuous artist to Christian orthodoxy. He had been sceptical about despair--feminine despair, which could always be cured by gifts and baubles. But to-night, as he raised his eyes, he felt a queer sensation marring the ecstatic perfection of his mood. That quality in the picture which so long had satisfied and entranced him had now become repellent, an ugly significant reflection of something--something in himself he was suddenly eager to repudiate and deny. It was with a certain amazement that he found himself on his feet with the picture in his hand, gazing at the empty space where it had hung. For he had had no apparent intention of obeying that impulse. What should he do with it? Light the fire and burn it--frame and all? The frame {{was an integral part of}} it. What would his housekeeper say? But now that he had actually removed it from the wall he could not replace it, so he opened the closet door and thrust it into a corner among relics which had found refuge there. He had put his past in the closet; yet the relief he felt was mingled with the peculiar qualm that follows the discovery of symptoms never before remarked. Why should this woman have this extraordinary effect of making him dissatisfied with himself? He sat down again and tried to review the affair from that first day when he had surprised in her eyes the flame dwelling in her. She had completely upset his life, increasingly distracted his mind until now he could imagine no peace unless he possessed her. Hitherto he had recognized in his feeling for her nothing but that same desire he had had for other women, intensified to a degree never before experienced. But this sudden access of morality--he did not actually define it as such--was disquieting. And in the feverish, semi-objective survey he was now making of his emotional tract he was discovering the presence of other disturbing symptoms such as an unwonted tenderness, a consideration almost amounting to pity which at times he had vaguely sensed yet never sought imaginatively to grasp. It bewildered him by hampering a ruthlessness hitherto absolute. The fierceness of her inflamed his passion, yet he recognized dimly behind this fierceness an instinct of self-protection--and he thought of her in this moment as a struggling bird that fluttered out of his hands when they were ready to close over her. So it had been to-night. He might have kept her, prevented her from taking the car. Yet he had let her go! There came again, utterly to blot this out, the memory of her lips.|$|E
50|$|The {{northeast}} room {{is slightly}} larger than the other two. It has the upper level of the freight lift, and a beaded-front cabinet below the window on the east wall. On the north wall is a <b>steam</b> <b>radiator.</b> The plaster has been removed on {{the south and east}} walls near the chimney, exposing the lath beneath. The chimney itself is in the northwest corner. In the south room the original blackboards remain {{on either side of the}} door on the north wall. Plaster has been stripped from that wall as well. Another <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> is along the south wall.|$|E
50|$|The Chateau is {{in almost}} {{original}} condition. The rooms remain almost exactly {{as they were}} in 1934. There are no phones or televisions, and <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> heating remains. The Chateau is open to guests spring through fall, dates vary.|$|E
50|$|The factory was heated using <b>steam</b> <b>radiators,</b> {{with the}} <b>steam</b> being {{produced}} by coal-fired steel boilers {{installed in a}} brick boiler house attached to the wooden factory as the crossbar of the E.When the fourth floor was added, the original boiler {{was replaced by a}} larger one and the old boiler, 17 ft long and six feet in diameter, was left in place as a backup. Since the new boiler could generally meet the factory's demands on its own, the old one was seldom used; and when used, was used reluctantly. Grover's chief engineer David Rockwell, who had a first-class engineer's license and twelve years experience, did not trust it.|$|R
50|$|Opening a hot {{radiator}} {{drops the}} system pressure, which may {{cause it to}} boil and eject dangerously hot liquid and <b>steam.</b> Therefore, <b>radiator</b> caps often contain a mechanism that attempts to relieve the internal pressure before the cap can be fully opened.|$|R
5000|$|The hotel proper is papered in Victorian {{gold and}} {{burgundy}} medallion wallpaper, has velvet draperies and pressed tin on its 12 foot high ceilings. [...] The main floor has a [...] "Eating House," [...] the formal [...] "Owen Wister Dining Room," [...] and the [...] "Shiloh Saloon," [...] which still has bullet holes riddled throughout to remind guests of some past shootout. The rooms have antique brass beds, tulip-shape lights are still heated by <b>steam</b> <b>radiators.</b> Only the suites have private baths, replete with claw foot bathtubs. The other rooms {{have access to}} separate bath facilities located in the halls. [...] True to its time, the rooms in the original hotel do not have modern amenities such as telephones or televisions.|$|R
50|$|Despite its name, a {{radiator}} {{does not}} primarily heat a room by radiation. If positioned correctly a radiator will create an air convection current in the room, which {{will provide the}} main heat transfer mechanism. It is generally agreed that for the best results a <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> should {{be no more than}} one to two inches from a wall.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{records of}} Lynch's death {{said it was}} caused by an electrical accident. The incident supposedly happened when Lynch reached over to shut off a reading lamp attached to his metal headboard and accidentally touched a <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> at the same time. Winona County coroner P.A. Mattison determined that the lamp {{was the source of}} the current that sent the fatal surge of electricity coursing through Father Lynch's body.|$|E
50|$|The {{pilothouse}} has an elliptical forward {{face and}} a flat rear. A <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> provides heat, and a ladder provides access to the pilothouse roof. The large wheel dominates the house, its size dictated by the entirely manual steering gear, an anachronistic feature for the time. Voice pipes run to the engine room and saloon. Bells provide additional communication to the engine room. Whistles are fitted for signals to ships and shore.|$|E
5000|$|While now {{somewhat}} archaic, EDR {{is still}} computed {{and used for}} sizing <b>steam</b> boilers and <b>radiators,</b> and for modifying and troubleshooting older heating systems using steam or hot water.|$|R
60|$|The {{reader who}} knows Italy {{only from the}} past should clear his mind of his old {{impressions}} of the hotels. There is no longer that rivalry between the coming guest and the manager to see how few or many candles can be lighted in his room and charged in the bill; there are no longer candles, but only electricity. There {{is no longer an}} extortion for hearth-fires which send all the heat up the chimney; there are <b>steam</b> <b>radiators</b> in every room. There is no longer a tedious bargaining for rooms; the price is fixed and cannot be abated except for a sojourn of weeks or months. But the price is much greater than it used to be--twice as great almost; for the taxes are heavy and provisions are dear, and coal and electricity are costly, and you must share the expense with the landlord. He is not there for his health, and, if for your comfort, you are not his invited guest. As I have intimated, an apartment of four rooms with a bath will cost almost as much, with board, as the same quarters in New York, but you will get far more for your money in Rome. If you take a single room, even to the south, in many first-class Roman hotels it will cost you for room and board only two dollars or two and a half a day, which is what you pay for a far meaner and smaller room alone in New York; and the Roman board is such, as you can get at none but our most expensive houses for twice the money. Generally you cannot get a single room and bath, but at present a very exclusive hotel is going up in a good quarter which promises, with huge English signs, a bath with every room and every room full south. One does not see just how the universal sunny exposure is to be managed, but there can be no question of the baths; and, with the <b>steam</b> <b>radiators</b> everywhere, the northernmost room might well imagine itself full south.|$|R
60|$|Although {{she had to}} {{overcome}} the distaste of its antecedents, the house, or rather the furniture, {{was too much of}} a find in Salomon City to be resisted. It had but six rooms, and was of wood, and painted grey, like its twin beside it. But Mrs. Waterford had removed the stained-glass window-lights in the front door, deftly hidden the highly ornamental <b>steam</b> <b>radiators,</b> and made other eliminations and improvements, including the white bookshelves that still contained the lady's winter reading fifty or more yellow-and-green-backed French novels and plays. Honora's first care, after taking possession, was to order her maid to remove these from her sight: but it is to be feared that they found their way, directly, to Mathilde's room. Honora would have liked to fumigate the house; and yet, at the same time, she thanked her stars for it. Mr. Beekwith obligingly found her a cook, and on Thursday evening she sat down to supper in her tiny dining room. She had found a temporary haven, at last.|$|R

50|$|Temperature on {{different}} parts of the body can be adjusted by shielding from the <b>steam</b> <b>radiator</b> with a towel. Shielding the face with a towel has been found to reduce the perception of heat. It may be advisable to put an additional towel or special cap on the hair to avoid dryness. Few people can sit {{directly in front of the}} heater without feeling too hot from radiant heat, but their overall body temperature may be insufficient. As the person’s body is often the coolest object in a sauna room, steam will condense into water on the skin; this can be confused with perspiration.|$|E
5000|$|A {{scheduled}} refit postponed to 1981 {{resulted in}} Algonquins exclusion in any national or NATO exercises. Algonquin presented the ASW Proficiency Shield and the 20 Knot Trophy. On 26 January, a fire, rated as [...] "A" [...] class, {{occurred in the}} forward decontamination compartment. The fire was {{believed to have been}} caused by toilet paper, stored temporarily in the space, coming into contact with a <b>steam</b> <b>radiator.</b> In November, the ship participated in ASW exercises, torpedo firings and pro-submarine exercises with the submarine [...] The postponed refit occurred from January-July 1981, noted to have been completed on time, as scheduled. Additions included Surface and Air Weapon Information System (SAWIS) performance monitoring equipment for the Gun/Missile Fire Control System and 84 tons of ballast in the aft section of the ship. The ship worked-up in August and September, and in November participated in the naval exercise MARCOT 2/81.|$|E
50|$|In two-pipe steam systems, {{there is}} a return path for the {{condensate}} and it may involve pumps as well as gravity-induced flow. The flow of <b>steam</b> to individual <b>radiators</b> can be modulated using manual or automatic valves.|$|R
50|$|Single-pipe {{systems are}} limited in both their ability to deliver high volumes of steam (that is, heat) {{and the ability to}} control the flow of <b>steam</b> to {{individual}} <b>radiators</b> (because closing off the steam supply traps condensate in the radiators).
