During the exhibition, 827,280 visitors each paid one penny to use them. It is often suggested that the euphemism [...] "spending a penny" [...] originated at the Exhibition but the phrase {{is more likely to}} date from the 1890s when public lavatories, fitted with penny coin-operated locks, were first established by British local authorities.|$|E

We shall realise that all this talk of the organisation of sociology, as though presently the sociologist would be going about the world with the authority of a <b>sanitary</b> <b>engineer,</b> is and will remain nonsense.|$|E

60|$|He talked chiefly of {{the strangeness}} of this confounded war. It was exactly like a <b>sanitary</b> <b>engineer</b> {{speaking}} of the unexpected difficulties of some particularly nasty inundation. He made little stiff horizontal gestures with his hands. First one had to build a dam and stop the rush of it, so; then one had to organise the push that would send it back. He explained the organisation of the push. They had got an organisation now that was working out most satisfactorily. Had I seen a sector? I had seen the sector of Soissons. Yes, {{but that was not}} now an offensive sector. I must see an offensive sector; see the whole method. Lieutenant de Tessin must see that that was arranged....|$|E
60|$|Dan {{had gone}} in for {{building}} model boats; but after he had filled the schoolroom with chips, which he expected Una to clear away, they turned him out of doors and he took all his tools {{up the hill to}} Mr Springett's yard, where he knew he could make as much mess as he chose. Old Mr Springett was a builder, contractor, and <b>sanitary</b> <b>engineer,</b> and his yard, which opened off the village street, was always full of interesting things. At one end of it was a long loft, reached by a ladder, where he kept his iron-bound scaffold-planks, tins of paints, pulleys, and odds and ends he had found in old houses. He would sit here by the hour watching his carts as they loaded or unloaded in the yard below, while Dan gouged and grunted at the carpenter's bench near the loft window. Mr Springett and Dan had always been particular friends, for Mr Springett was so old he could remember when railways were being made in the southern counties of England, and people were allowed to drive dogs in carts.|$|E
6000|$|There are, for example, the unorganized myriads {{that one}} can cover by the phrase [...] "mechanics and engineers," [...] if one uses it in its widest {{possible}} sense. At present it would be almost impossible to describe {{such a thing as}} a typical engineer, to predicate any universally applicable characteristic of the engineer and mechanic. The black-faced, oily man one figures emerging from the engine-room serves well enough, until one recalls the <b>sanitary</b> <b>engineer</b> with his additions of crockery and plumbing, the electrical engineer with his little tests and wires, the mining engineer, the railway maker, the motor builder, and the irrigation expert. Even if we take some specific branch of all this huge mass of new employment the coming of mechanism has brought with it, we still find an undigested miscellany. Consider the rude levy that is engaged in supplying and repairing the world's new need of bicycles! Wheelwrights, watchmakers, blacksmiths, music-dealers, drapers, sewing-machine repairers, smart errand boys, ironmongers, individuals from all the older aspects of engineering, have been caught up by the new development, are all now, with a more or less inadequate knowledge and training, working in the new service. But is it likely that this will remain a rude levy? From all these varied people the world requires certain things, and a failure to obtain them involves, sooner or later, in this competitive creation, an individual replacement and a push towards the abyss. The very lowest of them must understand the machine they contribute to make and repair, and not only is it a fairly complex machine in itself, but it is found in several types and patterns, and so far it has altered, and promises still to alter, steadily, by improvements in this part and that. No limited stock-in-trade of knowledge, such as suffices for a joiner or an ostler, will serve. They must keep on mastering new points, new aspects, they must be intelligent and adaptable, they must get a grasp of that permanent something that lies behind the changing immediate practice. In other words, they will have to be educated rather than trained after the fashion of the old craftsman. Just now this body of irregulars is threatened by the coming of the motors. The motors promise new difficulties, new rewards, and new competition. It is an ill look-out for the cycle mechanic who is not prepared to tackle the new problems that will arise. For all this next century this particular body of mechanics will be picking up new recruits and eliminating the incompetent and the rule-of-thumb sage. Can it fail, as the years pass, to develop certain general characters, to become so far homogeneous as to be generally conscious of the need of a scientific education, at any rate in mechanical and chemical matters, and to possess, down to its very lowest ranks and orders, a common fund of intellectual training? ...|$|E

50|$|The Academy {{began in}} 1952, {{when a group}} of <b>sanitary</b> <b>engineers</b> working in the public health and defense {{communities}} expressed concern about the requirements for professional practice.

Later, the Joint Committee for the Advancement of Sanitary Engineering was formed, composed of the ASCE, the American Public Health Association, the American Society for Engineering Education, the American Water Works Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation. With the sponsorship and support of these five organizations, the American Sanitary Engineering Intersociety Board was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 21, 1955. Certified <b>sanitary</b> <b>engineers</b> were identified as Diplomates (now also known as Board Certified Environmental Engineers) of the American Academy of <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Engineers,</b> and were listed on a roster with the names of each member and their specialties as recognized by the Board.
