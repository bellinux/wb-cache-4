5|$|The UK Albums Chart is {{a weekly}} record chart based on album sales from Sunday to <b>Saturday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom; during the 1990s, {{a total of}} 216 albums reached number one. Until 1 February 1994, the chart was {{compiled}} each week by Gallup– after this date, it was managed by Millward Brown, who expanded the number of sales figures sampled, and extended the use of electronic point of sale machines. From July 1998 onwards, compilation of the chart was overseen by the Chart Information Network, jointly operated by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the British Association of Record Dealers. Throughout the decade, the chart was based solely on physical album sales, and each week's number one was first announced on Sunday evenings on The Radio 1 Chart Show.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal and South India, Shashthi is worshipped on {{the sixth}} day after {{childbirth}} and on Aranya-Shashthi (also called Jamai-Shashthi), the sixth day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Jyeshtha. Her worship can be performed in the house, where she is symbolised as an earthenware pitcher; she may also be worshipped outdoors in a natural, open space consecrated to her, termed a shashthitala. In honour of Shashthi, women tie a stone in a small rag to the branch of a tree in the shasthitala: a mother does this to ask for long life for her child, while a barren woman does so to entreat the goddess to aid her in conceiving. The vrata (ritual) performed {{on the day of}} Jamai-Shashthi is also prescribed to be performed by pregnant women at least once on any Monday, Tuesday, Friday or <b>Saturday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> month of Jyestha. Dough images of Shashthi and her black cat are prepared and worshipped, along with a water pitcher with a banyan tree branch near it. Betel nuts and leaves, fruits, sweets and kheer are offered to her in units of six. In North India, Shashthi is worshipped {{in the form of the}} banyan tree, which is sacred to her.|$|E

The match itself was watched by 6.3 million viewers (52% viewing share) and coverage of the final averaged at 4.1 million (44.4%). By comparison ITV's coverage of the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final averaged 6.8 million viewers, though with a lower viewing share (33.3%). The cup final ratings, a record low, were defended by the FA spokesman Paul Newman: [...] "We are very pleased because the final peaked at 7.4m which is pretty good for a hot <b>Saturday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a bank holiday weekend." [...] A list compiled by the London Evening Standard showed the 2002 final came bottom in the season's top 10 viewed football matches.|$|E
500|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the [...] season, two 90-minute practice sessions were held on Friday and another 60-minute session was held before qualifying on <b>Saturday.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first ever session {{on the new}} track on Friday morning, Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time at 1:46.435. He was followed by his Mercedes teammate Rosberg almost four-tenths of a second back, with Valtteri Bottas third for Williams, also within one second of Hamilton. Fernando Alonso was an encouraging fourth for McLaren. Both Bottas and Alonso set their fastest times on the soft rather than the supersoft tyre compound used by the Mercedes drivers. Several drivers got caught out on the new track, the first being Esteban Gutiérrez, who was forced into the run-off area at turn 15. Hamilton also had an incident, touching the barrier at turn 3 and flat-spotting his tyres later on the lap. The biggest incident occurred when Daniel Ricciardo crashed his Red Bull RB12 at the exit of turn 15, losing one of his rear wheels and causing an eleven-minute red flag period.|$|E

500|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the [...] season, two ninety-minute practice sessions were held on Friday and another one-hour session was held before qualifying on <b>Saturday.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first session on Friday morning, Nico Rosberg was fastest for Mercedes {{with a time}} of 1:38.127, more than seven-tenths of a second ahead of his teammate Lewis Hamilton. Both set their fastest times on the super-soft tyre compound, while Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen at Ferrari opted for the harder soft compound, slotting in third and fourth fastest respectively. Several drivers had problems with spinning or running wide, either in turn two or between turns 15 and 16. Among the drivers caught out were Hamilton, Vettel, Jolyon Palmer and Jenson Button. Two reserve drivers made an appearance during the first free practice session. Sergey Sirotkin drove for Renault, taking the place of Kevin Magnussen, making his second appearance in a Formula One car, after driving for Sauber during free practice at the 2014 Russian Grand Prix. Alfonso Celis Jr. replaced Nico Hülkenberg at Force India during the first practice session. Sirotkin ended the session ahead of his teammate Palmer, while Celis finished last, more than three seconds behind teammate Sergio Pérez.|$|E
500|$|In the English Civil War, {{the town}} changed hands several times, and in 1645 {{the bridge was}} seized by Royalist {{soldiers}} from Raglan in a failed attempt to retake the town from the Parliamentarian forces under Colonel Kyrle. Kissack describes the engagement as [...] "the most resolute Royalist attack made (on) Monmouth", which saw eight of Kyrle's opponents killed and five captured. By 1705, the bridge and gatehouse required maintenance: the original battlements were replaced with solid walls, and the building was refitted to form a two-storey dwelling house with timber and lath extensions projecting over the river. The house was then leased to a resident gatekeeper, responsible for repairing and maintaining the building. Part of the gatehouse remained in use as a lock-up. Such multiple uses were not uncommon; the archaeologist C. J. Bond recorded that [...] "gates often included chambers {{which could be used}} for lock-ups, chapels or meeting rooms". Both the bridge and the gatehouse were again repaired between 1771 and 1775. The bill for repairs included the cost of 100 gallons of ale for the workmen employed. Trade continued to be central to the importance of the bridge. The Monmouthshire writer and artist Fred Hando records that, on a single <b>Saturday</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 18th century, [...] "500 horses each carrying five bushels of corn entered by way of the Monnow gate".|$|E
500|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the [...] season, two 90-minute practice sessions were held on Friday and another 60-minute session was held before qualifying on <b>Saturday.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first session on Friday morning, Nico Rosberg set the fastest time at 1:07.373. The projected fast lap times were confirmed as Rosberg's time was {{faster than the}} previous fastest time set on the track by Michael Schumacher in 2003. Rosberg finished more than three-tenths of a second clear of teammate Lewis Hamilton, with Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen third and fourth respectively, the only other drivers within a second of Rosberg. There were several minor incidents during the session, including Hamilton spinning at turn 3, causing Romain Grosjean {{to go into a}} spin behind him when trying to avoid hitting him. Rosberg also went off the track at the same corner later in the session. Daniel Ricciardo posted the fifth-fastest time, but was lucky to escape a situation in which Marcus Ericsson got sideways while {{trying to get into the}} pitlane entry at turn 8. The revised kerbs of the track caught several drivers out, among them Max Verstappen who lost parts of his front wing when leaving the track at turn 8. Later on, he made contact with the kerbs again in turn 6, damaging his suspension, causing him to end the session early.|$|E
