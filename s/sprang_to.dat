The program allows users to automatically vote for the American Idol contestants of their choice using their PC's phone modem. The program then reports back to the main website, which keeps track of the results based on the percentage of calls for each contestant that result in a busy signal. Based on the data received, the website then predicts which contestants may be eliminated or may be in danger of being eliminated. As of May 25, 2006, its predictions for season five were 87% accurate.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of his training, {{he made his}} return to the ring to engage in yet another contest at the 205-pound limit, this time against fellow shoot wrestler Ken Shamrock. Three minutes into the bout, Sakuraba struck through Shamrock's guard with a left hand. Shamrock staggered back and ultimately fell into the ropes, his head hanging out of the ring and his back turned to Sakuraba. Sakuraba rushed in to follow up but before any meaningful offense could be launched, the fight was halted by referee Yuji Shimada. Shamrock <b>sprang</b> <b>to</b> his feet immediately following the KO and protested vigorously. Opinions have been mixed regarding the KO's legitimacy; Ken's adopted brother and rival, Frank, has stated he believes the stoppage was justified, while others have come down on the opposing side.|$|E

25|$|The Chronicon Lethrense inserts {{the common}} folktale {{of the dog}} king after Helgi's death. In this account King Hākun of Sweden sent a small dog to the Danes to take as their king but warned that whoever told him {{of the death of}} the dog would lose his life. One day, when larger dogs are fighting, the small dog <b>sprang</b> <b>to</b> the floor among them and was torn to death. Then Lǣ, the giant of Lǣsø̄ (Læsø), gave some advice on the matter to his {{herdsman}} Snow. (Lǣ is a Danish form of Hlér, a common name for Ægir who is Snow's great-granduncle in the Norse tradition). Snow went to Hākun's court and by riddling talk eventually got the king himself to say that the dog was dead. Snow was then appointed king of Denmark in place of the dog. Snow was a vicious, oppressive, and dishonest king. Snow sent his servant named Roth 'Red', whom he disliked, to the giant Lǣ to ask about how Snow will die, intending that Lǣ would kill Roth who would be unable to pass his tests. Roth passed and Lǣ gave Roth two gloves to take to Snow in answer. Snow put them on in an assembly and lice suddenly attacked him and ate him to death. Thereupon Helgi's son Hrólf was made king.|$|E

500|$|Rutter {{inserted}} {{an anonymous}} English poem from the 15th century, Of a Rose, a lovely Rose, {{as the second}} movement. Marked [...] "Tranquil and flowing", it imitates chant singing, with flexible times and in doric mode. The poet imagines Jesus as a rose springing from Mary, comparable to [...] "". She {{is seen as a}} rose bush with five branches: the Annunciation, the Star of Behlehem, the three Kings, the fall of the devil's power, and heaven. The last stanza asks Mary to “shield us from the fiendes bond”. The eight stanzas, in four lines of which three rhyme, are set as variations of an old tune. The short refrain is first sung by the soprano alone, immediately repeated by soprano, alto and tenor, the voices in unison but for triads on [...] "lovely". It is repeated after the first stanza by soprano and tenor in unison. After the fourth stanza, it appears again, now in three different parts, and a last time before the final prayer, again slightly different. The first stanza ("... this rose began to spring ...") is sung by the bass, the second ("... out of her bosom ...") by the alto, the third ("... an angel from heaven's tower ...") by two sopranos and alto, the fourth ("... star shone over Bethlehem ...") by tenor and bass, the fifth ("... three kinges ...") by the bass, the sixth ("... <b>sprang</b> <b>to</b> hell ...") by four parts SATB, the seventh ("... <b>sprang</b> <b>to</b> heaven ...") by soprano and alto, the final prayer ("Pray we to her ...") by four parts again but mostly in unison.|$|E
500|$|The novel soon {{attracted}} {{the criticism of}} the liberal and radical critics. G.Z. Yeliseyev <b>sprang</b> <b>to</b> {{the defense of the}} Russian student corporations, and wondered, [...] "Has there ever been a case of a student committing murder for the sake of robbery?" [...] Pisarev, aware of the novel's artistic value attempted in 1867 another approach: he argued that Raskolnikov was a product of his environment, and explained that the main theme of the work was poverty and its results. He measured the novel's excellence by the accuracy and understanding with which Dostoyevsky portrayed the contemporary social reality, and focused on what he regarded as inconsistencies in the novel's plot. Strakhov rejected Pisarev's contention that the theme of environmental determinism was essential to the novel, and pointed out that Dostoyevsky's attitude towards his hero was sympathetic: [...] "This is not mockery of the younger generation, neither a reproach nor an accusation—it is a lament over it."* McDuff, xi–xii ...|$|E

[...] These changes appealed to Chagall who had been experimenting with Cubism and wanted a way to enliven his images.

2500|$|Once, in the {{audience}} at a Soviet Russian Theatre show in Paris, Bunin found himself sitting next to a young Red Army colonel.

[...] the writer <b>sprang</b> <b>to</b> his feet: [...] "I have the even higher honour of sitting next to {{an officer of the}} great Red Army!" [...] he passionately retorted. On 19 June 1945, Bunin held a literary show in Paris where he read some of the Dark Avenue stories. In the autumn of 1945, on the wave of the great patriotic boom, Bunin's 75th birthday was widely celebrated in the Parisian Russian community. Bunin started to communicate closely with the Soviet connoisseurs, journalist Yuri Zhukov and literary agent Boris Mikhailov, the latter receiving from the writer several new stories for proposed publishing in the USSR. Rumours started circulating that the Soviet version of The Complete Bunin was already in the works.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} why Gavriilidis made such a point of announcing that Akropolis was [...] "continuing {{the work of the}} Queen". [...] Possibly he hoped to share the {{immunity}} from criticism that she had apparently been enjoying since February. [...] If so, he took a great risk in associating himself with the Queen and her supposedly Pan-Slavist family connections; it seems that many took — or pretended to take — his introductory editorial as a declaration of intent to [...] "continue the Queen's work" [...] of Pan-Slavic subversion. [...] All the old opponents of the Queen's translation immediately <b>sprang</b> <b>to</b> the attack again with redoubled energy, since Pallis and Gavriilidis had struck the same nerve as the Queen: the gap between the spoken and written languages. [...] The format of the Queen's book had only implied that some of the least educated might need a little help with written Ancient Greek; now Gavriilidis had announced on a front page {{that a majority of the}} population could not understand it at all. [...] The fact that this was true did nothing to diminish the reawakened fury of the conservative nationalists.|$|E
