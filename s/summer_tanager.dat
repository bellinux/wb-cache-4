It is one of four subspecies of Bell's vireo, which disappeared from California's Central Valley by the 1960s, and has been federally listed as endangered since 1986. The US Fish and Wildlife Service's 5-year review of least Bell's vireo, dated September 2006, attributes the primary cause of population declines to loss of riparian habitat in California.

2500|$|The tanagers (singular [...] ) {{comprise}} the bird family Thraupidae, {{in the order}} Passeriformes. The family has an American distribution. The Thraupidae are the second-largest family of birds and represent about 4% of all avian species and 12% of the Neotropical birds. Traditionally, about 240 species of tanagers have been described, but the taxonomic treatment of this family's members is currently {{in a state of}} flux. As more of these birds are studied using modern molecular techniques, some genera are expected to be relocated elsewhere. Already, species in the genera Euphonia and Chlorophonia, which were once considered part of the tanager family, are now treated as members of Fringillidae, in their own subfamily (Euphoniinae). Likewise, the genera Piranga (which includes the scarlet tanager, <b>summer</b> <b>tanager,</b> and western tanager), Chlorothraupis, and Habia appear to be members of the cardinal family, and have been reassigned to that family by the American Ornithologists' Union.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} often out of sight, {{foraging}} high in trees, sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects, especially bees and wasps, and berries. Fruit of Cymbopetalum mayanum (Annonaceae) are an especially well-liked food in their winter quarters and birds will forage in human-altered habitat. Consequently, these trees can be planted to entice them to residential areas, {{and they may}} well be attracted to bird feeders. <b>Summer</b> <b>tanagers</b> build a cup nest on a horizontal tree branch.|$|R
25|$|Although P. gibbosus {{feeds on}} insects, {{they are also}} prey for certain insects as well. Predatory insects for P. gibbosus include praying mantis, robber flies, and dragonflies. Sometimes, smaller P. gibbosus {{individuals}} will be preyed on by larger wasps. Some birds will even regularly consume wasps. A few examples of birds that prey on P. gibbosus include sparrows, wrens, and <b>summer</b> <b>tanagers.</b> In general, these birds normally exclusively hunt solitary wasps, making P. gibbosus an ideal target. Moreover, the birds avoid disturbing P. gibbosus near their nests.|$|R

40|$|As this {{is being}} written (July 2001), the new book Birds of Nebraska (Sharpe, Silcock, Jorgensen; University of Nebraska Press) has just been released. From now on {{everyone}} can check early and late dates and high counts as well as distribution within the state and {{have a much better}} feel for which sightings are significant. Probably the most outstanding ornithological events this spring were a few record early arrivals (Western and Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebes, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, Indigo Bunting) and a large number of 2 ̆ 2 rather early 2 ̆ 2 arrivals; 2 ̆ 2 rather early 2 ̆ 2 means not record early but right up there.

It was a quiet spring for listers and rarity-chasers; best were 3 rd state record Tricolored Heron, 4 th Dusky Flycatcher (1 st for spring), and 9 th Red Phalarope (1 st for spring). A first documented spring record for Red-necked Grebe was also reported. Other observations of interest included Gray Partridges in Sioux Co, Eurasian Collared-Doves everywhere in the Panhandle, 3 rd nesting year in a row for Pileated Woodpecker, reduced numbers of Carolina Wrens, and increasing populations of <b>Summer</b> <b>Tanagers</b> at Fontenelle Forest and Indian Cave State Park.

5000|$|Their {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} large stretches of deciduous forest, especially with oaks, across eastern North America. They can occur, {{with varying degrees}} of success, in young successional woodlands and occasionally in extensive plantings of shade trees in suburban areas, parks, and cemeteries. For a viable breeding population, at least 10 to 12 hectares of forest are required. In winter, scarlet tanagers occur in the montane forest of the Andean foothills. Scarlet tanagers migrate to northwestern South America, passing through Central America around April, and again around October. They begin arriving in the breeding grounds in numbers by about May and already start to move south again in mid-summer; by early October they are all on their way south. The bird is an extremely rare vagrant to western Europe.Scarlet tanagers are often out of sight, foraging high in trees, sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight and then returning to the same general perch, in a hunting style known as [...] "sallying". Sometimes, however, they will also capture their prey on the forest floor. They eat mainly insects, and will opportunistically consume fruit when plentiful. Any flying variety of insect will readily be taken when common, such as bees, wasps, hornets, ants, and sawflies; moths and butterflies; beetles; flies; cicadas, leafhoppers, spittlebugs, treehoppers, plant lice, and scale insects; termites; grasshoppers and locusts; dragonflies; and dobsonflies. Scarlet tanagers also takes snails, earthworms and spiders. While <b>summer</b> <b>tanagers</b> are famous for this feeding method, when capturing bees, wasps and hornets, scarlet tanagers also rake the prey against a branch in order to remove their stingers before consumption. Plant components of their diet consists {{of a wide variety of}} fruits that eaten mainly when insects are at population lows including: blackberries (Rubus allegheniensis), raspberries (R. ideaus), huckleberries (Gaylussacia sp.), juneberries and serviceberries (Amelanchier spp.), mulberries (Morus rubra), strawberries (Fragaria virginiana), and chokeberries (Aronia melanocarpa).|$|R

50|$|The <b>summer</b> <b>tanager</b> has an American robin-like song, similar {{enough that}} novices {{sometimes}} mistake this bird for that species.

The Northeast has a very abundant bird population. Common game birds found in the region are turkey, ruffed grouse, bobwhite, and mourning dove. Other non-game birds found in abundance include the cardinal, Carolina wren, wood thrush, <b>summer</b> <b>tanager,</b> red-eyed vireo, blue-gray gnatcatcher, and tufted titmouse.

50|$|The scarlet tanager, a mid-sized passerine, is {{marginally}} {{the smallest}} of the four species of Piranga that breed north of the Mexican border. It can weigh from 23.5 to 38 g, with an average of 25 g during breeding and an average of 35 g at the beginning of migration. Scarlet tanagers can range in length from 16 to 19 cm in length and from 25 to 30 cm in wingspan. Adults of both sexes have pale horn-colored, fairly stout and smooth-textured bills. Adult males are crimson-red with black wings and tail. The male's coloration is intense and deeply red, similar but deeper in shade than the males of two occasionally co-existing relatives, the northern cardinal and the <b>summer</b> <b>tanager,</b> both which lack black wings. Females are yellowish on the underparts and olive on top, with yellow-olive-toned wings and tail. The adult male's winter plumage is similar to the female's, but the wings and tail remain darker.
