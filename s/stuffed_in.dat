This included vegetable and meat stews cooked in pots, which had combinations such as beef and rice stew, dog meat and celery stew, and even deer, fish, and bamboo shoot stew. Seasonings mentioned in the recipes include sugar, honey, soy sauce, and salt. Recipes in the Han usually called for meat <b>stuffed</b> <b>in</b> cereals, cakes, and other wrappings.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{with the}} rise of {{interest}} in the bell, the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room (also known as the Declaration Chamber) on the first floor, where the Declaration and United States Constitution had been debated and signed. The city constructed an ornate pedestal for the bell. The Liberty Bell was displayed on that pedestal for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later <b>stuffed).</b> <b>In</b> 1853, President Franklin Pierce visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty in the same building in which federal judges were holding hearings under the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E

5|$|Located on the {{property}} of Ambler's Texaco Gas Station, {{just north of the}} station, is a 24-foot (7.3 m) by 16 foot (4.9m) wood clad, wooden frame building that once housed a commercial icehouse. Though its exact dates of operation are unknown, it is believed the icehouse was established by a member of Jack Schore's family during the 1930s. While the icehouse was in business, there was a small pond located about 200feet (61m) east of {{the property}}. Operators cut ice from the pond and stored it in the building until sale. After the icehouse ceased operation, a date that is also unknown, the building was used as a storage shed for the gas station. The building features a double wall with sawdust <b>stuffed</b> <b>in</b> between the walls to provide insulation. The wooden roof has asphalt shingles. Ambler's Texaco Station listing on the National Register lists the icehouse building as a contributing property.|$|E

25|$|At 6:30a.m. on April 16, {{the body}} of a 13-year-old schoolgirl named Dawn Louise Basom was found {{discarded}} beside a desolate road in Ypsilanti.

In September 2003, the City of London Police reopened their investigation as a murder inquiry. More evidence arose, revealing Calvi stayed in a flat in Chelsea Cloisters just prior to his death. Three months later, Sergio Vaccari, a small-time drug dealer who had stayed in the very same flat as Calvi, was found dead in possession of masonic papers displaying member names of P2. The murders of both Vaccari and Calvi involved bricks <b>stuffed</b> <b>in</b> clothing, correlating the two deaths and confirming the connection of Calvi to the lodge.|$|E

25|$|The Cadereyta Jiménez {{massacre}} {{occurred on}} the Mexican Federal Highway 40 on 13 May 2012. Mexican officials stated that 49 people were decapitated and mutilated by members of Los Zetas drug cartel and dumped by a roadside {{near the city of}} Monterrey in northern Mexico. The Blog del Narco, a blog that documents events and people of the Mexican Drug War anonymously, reported that the actual (unofficial) death toll may be more than 68 people. The bodies were found in the town of San Juan in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León at about 4a.m. on a non-toll highway leading to Reynosa, Tamaulipas. The forty-three men and six women killed had their heads, feet, and hands cut off, making their identification difficult. Those killed also bore signs of torture and were <b>stuffed</b> <b>in</b> plastic bags. The arrested suspects have indicated that the victims were Gulf Cartel members, but the Mexican authorities have not ruled out the possibility that they were U.S.-bound migrants. Four days before this incident, 18 people were found decapitated and dismembered near Mexico's second largest city, Guadalajara.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 September 2007, a brand-new gym bag was left {{in front of a}} shop lot in PJS 1/48, Petaling Jaya, {{discovered}} by the shop owner.

A cucumber and a brinjal was found stuffed inside her genitals and had caused her rectum to rupture. It was determined that bacterial infection had contributed to her death. At the time, Nurin Jazlin's parents were not able to identify the body as their daughter's due to the changes in her physical features; it was even suggested that the child might be a foreigner, as she lacked a scar which would be caused by the mandatory BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. Her parents initially maintained hope that their daughter might be alive and were the victims of several prank calls from people claiming that Nurin was under their care. Later DNA tests conducted confirmed the body as Nurin Jazlin's.|$|E
