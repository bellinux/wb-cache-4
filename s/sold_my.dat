From there, Pryce went on to compete in the Daily Express Crusader Championship, a series run by Motor Racing Stables for racing school pupils using Lotus 51 Formula Ford cars.

500|$|If we {{stick to}} the Faust story – if I had been in that story – and I had <b>sold</b> <b>my</b> soul [...] for fame and fortune, and had the arrogance of [...] to not want {{to pay back the}} deal, it's taken a few years for me to {{acknowledge}} to myself that I was hearing: 'Manson , the hell hounds are on your trail.' And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] If you believe in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what I set out to do,' even though I tried to convince myself that I was. I'm not regretting the last few records that I've made, but since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), I've not made something with [...] sheer utter fearlessness and anger and force.|$|E

[...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, they were great experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I <b>sold</b> <b>my</b> soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E

2500|$|LaBelle {{was born}} Patricia Louise Holte on May 24, 1944 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{the third of}} four girls to Henry and Bertha Holte. Her father was a {{railroad}} worker and {{her mother was a}} domestic. Despite enjoying her childhood, LaBelle would later write in her memoirs, Don't Block the Blessings, that her parents' marriage was abusive. When Patti was seven, she was sexually molested by a family friend. At twelve, her parents' marriage came to an end, though Patti remained close to her father. Patti joined a local church choir at the Beulah Baptist Church at ten and performed her first solo two years later. While she was growing up, she listened to secular music styles such as R and jazz music as well. When she was fifteen, she won a talent competition at her high school. This success led to Patti forming her first singing group, the Ordettes, in 1960, with schoolmates Jean Brown, Yvonne Hogen and Johnnie Dawson. The group, with Patti as front woman, became a local attraction until two of its members left to marry. In 1962, the Ordettes included three new members, Cindy Birdsong, Sarah Dash and Nona Hendryx, the latter two girls having sung for another now defunct vocal group. That year, they auditioned for local record label owner Harold Robinson. Robinson agreed to work with the group after Patti began singing the song [...] "I <b>Sold</b> <b>My</b> Heart to the Junkman". Initially Robinson was dismissive of Patti due to him feeling Patti was [...] "too dark and too plain".|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after signing}} them, {{he had them}} record as the Blue Belles and they were {{selected}} to promote the recording of [...] "I <b>Sold</b> <b>My</b> Heart to the Junkman", which had been recorded by The Starlets, but was assigned as a Blue Belles single due to label conflict. The Starlets' manager sued Harold Robinson after the Blue Belles were seen performing a lip-synching version of the song on American Bandstand. After settling out of court, Robinson altered the group's name to [...] "Patti LaBelle and The Blue Belles". Initially, a Billboard ad cited the group as [...] "Patti Bell and the Blue Bells". In 1963, the group scored their first hit single with the ballad [...] "Down the Aisle (The Wedding Song)" [...] which became a crossover top 40 hit on the Billboard pop and R charts after King Records issued it. Later in the year, they recorded their rendition of the [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone"; the single was later re-released on Cameo-Parkway Records where the group scored a second hit on the pop charts with the song in 1964. Another charted single, [...] "Danny Boy", was released that same year. In 1965, after Cameo-Parkway folded, the group moved to New York and signed with Atlantic Records where they recorded twelve singles for the label, including the mildly charted singles [...] "All or Nothing" [...] and [...] "Take Me for a Little While". The group's Atlantic tenure included their rendition of [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] and {{a version of the}} song [...] "Groovy Kind of Love". In 1967, Birdsong left the group to join The Supremes and by 1970 the group had been dropped from Atlantic Records as well as by their longtime manager Bernard Montague.|$|E
