60|$|And {{here is one}} of a {{delicate}} yellow-green, whose tail is furnished with three broad paddle-blades. These, I believe, are gills again. The larva is probably that of the Yellow Sally--Chrysoperla viridis-- a famous fly on hot days in May and June. Among the pebbles there, below the fall, we should have found, a month since, a similar but much larger grub, with two paddles at his tail. He is the 'creeper' of the northern streams, and changes to the great crawling <b>stone</b> <b>fly</b> (May-fly of Tweed), Perla bicaudata, an ugly creature, which runs on stones and posts, and kills right well on stormy days, when he is beaten into the stream.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} known for its trout fishing and canoeing, and is revered by fly {{fishermen}} for its prolific mayfly and <b>stone</b> <b>fly</b> hatches. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has a fish hatchery and a ranger station that operates the state forest and nearby campgrounds.|$|E
50|$|After spawning, most passing fish die, {{and those}} that remain alive (preferentially dwarf males) {{participate}} in spawning the next year, too. Emerging from the nest, the young do not roll into the sea, but remain in spawning areas, in {{the upper reaches of}} rivers, and on shallows with weak currents. The young move to pools and rolls of the river core to feed on chironomid, <b>stone</b> <b>fly,</b> and may fly larvae, and on airborne insects. The masu salmon rolls into the sea in its second, or occasionally even third year of life.|$|E

5000|$|Shredders are {{organisms that}} feed off of coarse {{particulate}} organic material (CPOM) such as small sections of leaves. They ingest the organic matter along with volunteer organisms (fungi, microorganisms) {{attached to the}} source. The preferred size of the CPOM is about one millimeter, therefore shredders must break it up into a finer particulate. In the process of shredding, much of the now finer organic matter is left in the system, making its way further downstream. [...] Some common shredders of North American waters include the Mayfly (Ephemeroptera), Odonata (damselflies) and <b>stone</b> <b>fly</b> (Plecoptera) larvae, whereas decapods (particularly Atyid shrimp) fulfill the same role in tropical environments.|$|E
50|$|A {{quantitative}} diet {{analysis has}} not yet been performed on the saddled madtom. However, using diet information of other species that are closely related to, even so closely related that they are known to interbreed with each other, suggest that they are invertivores, feeding mostly on insects, such as cattus, may, and <b>stone</b> <b>fly</b> larva. Feeding on these insects can present competition with other species, such as salamanders and trout species. The saddled madtom is a small species, which allows it to be prey to larger species such as: rock, small mouth, and largemouth bass. Other species that may prey on this species would be larger, percivorous fish, brown trout being a good example. Madtoms in general, have a distinct adaptation that allows them to secrete venom through delivery glands located on the dorsal and pectoral spines. This venom is intended to injure predators and keep them safe from predation. Another strategy that allows for less predation on the saddled madtom is that it lives in riffles under gravel and rubble.|$|E

It is known primarily from a few streams near Troy, Idaho in Latah County, including Little Boulder Creek. This species ’ limited habitat may be threatened with degradation from extensive recreational use in the region from which it is known. Global climate change could also threaten this species ’ habitat in the long-term. Research should focus on determining the true distribution of this species, the status and size of existing populations, and the potential presence of additional populations at suitable habitat in the region. Assessment and strengthening of current management practices for known habitat would also be beneficial...|$|E

40|$|Water {{quality of}} 			natural {{rivers and streams}} are {{becoming}} worst due to highly 			contaminated effluent in developing countries. In Pakistan, natural 			streams are presenting dramatic scenario along with deadly 			environmental conditions. Considering the water pollution issues and 			increasing demand of water, it is truly required to manage all these 			things on priority basis. In case of developing countries like 			Pakistan where there are severe financial constraints, it is 			necessary to formulate such tactics for water quality management 			which would maintain acceptable stream water standards. Considering 			the negative impacts on the environment due to dispose of untreated 			effluent, it is seriously required to plan environmental management 			for all natural rivers and streams. Environmental impacts of 			untreated effluent on Ravi River water quality have been taken up 			for investigation. Untreated effluents {{from the city of}} Lahore and 			it suburbs are seriously polluting &Ravi River. The river section 			between &# 8220;Ravi Syphon&# 8221; and &# 8220;Balloki&# 8221; is presenting the most horrible 			scene, where industrial effluents from &# 8220;Hudira and &# 8220;Deg Nallah are 			also joining the river. In this segment the river water is being 			used for irrigation and livestock purposes. Considering the 			pollution scenario, more expansive effluent treatment systems will 			be required to maintain environmental standards of this river. It is 			concluded that due to high rate untreated effluent &# 8220;Ravi River&# 8221; is 			acting as a wastewater carrier. 			The study propagates different reasons for the surface water quality 			degradation in Pakistan. Mixing of untreated effluent in large 			quantity to &# 8220;Ravi River&# 8221; is a serious threat to the environment and 			public health. Surface water quality parameters like, Biological 			Oxygen Demand (BOD), Dissolve Oxygen (DO), Chemical Oxygen Demand 			(COD), Suspended Solids, Phosphorus, Chloride, Sodium, Total 			Kjeldahls, Nitrogen (TKN), Nitrate, Nitrites, Oil & Grease and Total 			Coli forms were measured on selected sampling stations for the period 			of three years. Laboratory results of collected samples are not 			satisfactory. To investigate the impacts of untreated effluent on 			microbial activities a biological survey was also carried out. 			Species of fish, oligochaetes, algae, <b>stone</b> <b>fly,</b> midge, and cadesfly 			were identified and discussed. It was investigated that during 			winter the river seems to be quite polluted. However conditions 			become better during summer months due to the increase in the flow 			rate. High concentration of wastewater microbes clearly explains 			that water quality of &# 8220;Ravi River&# 8221; is not satisfactory. 			Modeling of wastewater treatment process has gained much attention 			and a lot of research has been focused toward this area. Basic 			Activated Sludge Models (ASM) developed by International Water 			Association (IWA) task group are contributing considerably in 			wastewater treatment modeling. Different factors related to the 			model performance like model selection, model functions and model 			calibration are discussed in detail to support the effluent 			treatment process in Pakistan. The applications of ASM 1, ASM 2, 			ASM 2 d, ASM 3, ASM 3 _ 2 N, ASM 3 bio-P model etc. are also studied. The 			whitebox modeling techniques in this area are more significant. The 			importance of black-box models under special conditions where 			white-box models are not able to predict accurate results are also 			investigated. It was also found that use of hybrid, linearization 			and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in wastewater treatment 			modeling can be more useful for process optimization and control. 			White-box modeling techniques in wastewater treatment modeling are 			most reliable for better understanding of the whole mechanism. Model 			purpose definition plays a vital role in model selection, data 			collection and calibration. Black-box modeling techniques can also 			be encouraged in this area to avoid wrong predicted results from 			white-box models under harsh environmental conditions like heavy 			rainfall or shock loading. It was also concluded during the 			investigation that hybrid modeling methodologies can be more 			supportive for process optimization and supervisory control. 			Low flow conditions in river along with high rate of contaminants 			are also damaging the ground water quality in the study area. During 			the study collected data from different departments, field sampling 			and field visits clearly narrate that hygienic conditions of Ravi 			River are becoming worst day by day. These conditions can only be 			improved by proper wastewater treatment plans, environmental 			management and powerful environmental legislation...|$|E
