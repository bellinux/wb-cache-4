Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>in</b> the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas.

25|$|The {{language}} of the Amidah most likely comes from the mishnaic period, {{both before and after}} the destruction of the Temple (70 CE) as the probable time of its composition and compilation. In the time of the Mishnah, it was considered unnecessary to prescribe its text and content. This may have been simply because the language was well known to the Mishnah's authors. The Mishnah may also not have recorded a specific text because of an aversion to making prayer a matter of rigor and fixed formula, an aversion that continued at least to some extent throughout the Talmudic period, as evidenced by the opinions of R. Eliezer (Talmud Ber. 29b) and R. Simeon ben Yohai (Ab. ii. 13). R. Jose held that one should include <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>in</b> one's prayer every day (Talmud Yerushalmi Ber. 8b), a principle said to have been carried into practice by R. Eleazar and R. Abbahu (ib.). Prayer was not to be read as one would read a letter (ib.).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s AMT {{released}} brand new kits with new tooling {{for some of}} their old favorites, such as the 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air, 1966 Ford Fairlane GT, 1958 Edsel Pacer, 1960 Ford Starliner and 1957 Chrysler 300. These kits sold fairly well and can still be found on auction sites such as eBay at reasonable prices. The details in these kits far exceeded any from the 1960s. In the late 1990s AMT did <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>in</b> releasing pre-assembled and painted versions of these kits. These assembled models were sold as the Masterpiece Series and were nicely packaged in foam, similar to heavier diecast metal Franklin Mint or Danbury Mint models. Each had a Certificate of Authenticity enclosed. These models were beautifully finished and featured whitewall tires along with very detailed and authentically painted engines, suspensions and interiors, much more detailed than any promotional ever was, although these seem to be oriented to the adult collector and not the possible customer. Selections included a 1957 Chrysler 300C, 1960 Ford Starliner, 1962 Chevrolet Impala SS convertible, 1962 Pontiac Catalina SD421, 1966 Buick Riviera {{and a few others}} (Doty 2002b, p87). These ultra detailed models can still be had for less than $30.00 today on eBay and are one of the best bargains around. As assembled kits they were factory-glued together, but the glue used appears to be of high quality and when cared for properly they can be kept in good condition for years.|$|E

500|$|Designed by Tetsuya Nomura, Tifa was {{not present}} in early {{versions}} of Final Fantasy VII, as initially, the game was to have only three playable characters; the protagonist Cloud Strife, Aerith Gainsborough and Barret Wallace. However, during {{a phone call to}} project director Yoshinori Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura later joked that this was his idea, so as to enable him to introduce Tifa into the game. Regardless, the notion of having two concurrent heroines, and having the hero waver between them, was something Kitase liked, describing it as <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>in</b> the Final Fantasy series. Nomura describes Tifa's character in Advent Children as having several dimensions, calling her [...] "like a mother, a sweetheart, and a close ally in battle" [...] and [...] "remarkably strong, not only emotionally, but physically as well." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} in 1993, Folkvord said his most important commitment if he gained a seat in parliament was giving the National trade union centers more power {{so that they could}} better defend the working class. When asked if it was exhausting to promote socialist reforms Folkvord said, [...] "It is. But I think in some ways easier than before [...] fake socialist regimes have collapsed". Another opinion of his was that [...] "capitalism destroys the natural environment around us making the bourgeois society planners understand that there must be <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>in</b> the future. This provides inspiration to win support for socialist beliefs in Norway". Folkvord's first contact with anti-capitalist beliefs came when he joined the Workers' Communist Party. The party told him about [...] "capitalist barbarism" [...] and how the wealthy controlled everything. Folkvord said he believed that [...] " [...] can't be the end of human development", and that he believes humans are destined to create another more-just system.|$|E
500|$|In The Creation of Spider-Man, {{comic book}} writer-editor and {{historian}} Paul Kupperberg calls the character's superpowers [...] "nothing too original"; what was original was that outside his secret identity, {{he was a}} [...] "nerdy high school student". Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included [...] "heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama". Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>in</b> the world of comics: [...] "the flawed superhero with everyday problems". This idea spawned a [...] "comics revolution". The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel's early 1960s comic books such as The Amazing Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, and X-Men ushered in {{a new type of}} superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public's perception of them.

[...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song, saying: [...] "While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an opportunity to try <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>in</b> some way or another, 'Start Over' just kind of sits there at {{the middle of the}} disc not doing much of anything."

500|$|Whitney Balliett {{stated that}} Flanagan {{was the most}} {{consistent}} of the pianists influenced by Wilson, Tatum and Cole, and invariably created <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>in</b> his playing: he [...] "often states the melody with dissonant, levering chords played offbeat or staccato. Never decorative, they [...] reveal both a respect for the melody and an intense desire to alter it"; during his main improvising, he used [...] "interval-filled descending figures [...] charging rhythmic phrases whose accented first notes make the succeeding notes snap, double-time phrases that race ahead to clear the way, and legato phrases that form sauntering rear guards." [...] In a review of a 1989 concert, Feather commented that Flanagan used [...] "subtle dynamic shadings", while [...] "bursts of upsweeping chords sometimes lent an element of surprise, with a nimble left hand offering graceful filigree fills" [...] and occasional musical quotes that added humor. Other techniques he employed were, in Stanley Crouch's description, [...] "crooning effects achieved by manipulating the pedals, holding down keys long enough to sustain notes in decisively different ways, and working out inflections that evoke the voice – sighs, moans, swells, purrs". Critic John S. Wilson described Flanagan's solo piano style on ballads in 1978: [...] "He drifts through ballads with a dreamy langourous flow, {{but it is not}} a soft or flabby style. There is, beneath the surface, a vitality that gives it a lean, swinging character".|$|E
500|$|The initial {{concepts}} for The Last Story came to Hironobu Sakaguchi {{after his}} departure from Square (now Square Enix) in 2003. After a period working on games {{at his new}} studio Mistwalker, Sakaguchi realized that his style of game were not in tune with current gaming trends. Later, he elaborated that The Last Story was primarily born from reflecting on the design mistakes he made during the development of Blue Dragon (2006) and Lost Odyssey (2007): while they tried to innovate with the story, they kept the gameplay very traditional. Sakaguchi drew up a design document for the game, and around that time met up with Takuya Matsumoto, a designer from AQ Interactive {{who had worked with}} Sakaguchi on Blue Dragon. They both realized that they held the same views on what was holding their games back in the current market, and decided to collaborate on the game with the goal of creating <b>something</b> <b>new.</b> <b>In</b> an interview with IGN, Sakaguchi said that development took three years: the first year was devoted to a trial-and-error development process devoted to the battle system. A longer development time of four years was reported by Matsumoto in a different interview with Gamasutra. According to Matsumoto, the team leads went to the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) each year and were assured that their game was in-step with current gameplay trends. Production of The Last Story was a collaboration between Mistwalker, AQ Interactive and Nintendo, and was Sakaguchi's first work as a director since Final Fantasy V (1992). The game was going through its final development stages by April 2010, and according to Sakaguchi was [...] "complete" [...] by December that year.|$|E
