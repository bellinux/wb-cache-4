5|$|Though Disney gave Nomura {{freedom in}} the {{characters}} and worlds used for the games, {{he and his staff}} tried to <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds. Nomura has stated that though many of the Disney characters are not normally dark and serious, there were not many challenges making them so for the story, and despite this, their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics. He also felt managing and keeping multiple worlds was problematic. When deciding which worlds to include in the game, the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting and made an effort to minimize any overlap in the overall look and feel of each world.|$|E

5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished to <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, {{and so there was}} enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing to <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels {{through a combination of}} techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} debuted at number 97 on the Billboard 200 chart {{for the week}} ending February 16, 1974, and by February 26, had already sold 500,000 copies and was {{certified}} Gold. The following week it rose to number 39, and on March 16 of the same year, it reached the top position. It became Streisand's second number one and seventh top five album, with the other number-one being People (1964). The Way We Were spent two weeks at the highest position before falling to number four on March 30. It continued dropping on the charts but managed to <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> top 10 of the list {{for a total of}} six weeks. The Recording Industry Association of America changed its certification status to Platinum for shipments upwards of 1,000,000 sales, and again on September 23, 1998, The Way We Were was certified for selling over 2,000,000 copies. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number 49 in May 1974, and was certified Silver for shifting 60,000 physical copies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of May 18, 1833, Duyệt's {{supporters}} {{took control of the}} citadel, executing Nguyên and his subordinates. They then held a torch-lit ceremony at Duyệt's tomb, during which his adopted son Khôi formally rejected the imperial authority of Minh Mang and declared his support for An Hoa, the son of Prince Cảnh. On the same evening, Khoi's men assassinated Nguyen Van Que, the newly appointed Governor-General who was overseeing the integration of the south into the central administration. All of the centrally appointed officials were killed or fled the citadel. Surprise attacks caught the imperial garrisons off guard and within three days, all six southern provinces were in the hands of Khoi's forces. Khoi convinced a French priest named Joseph Marchand to come and <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> citadel, hoping that his presence would win over support from the local Catholics. Khoi's support of An Hoa was also calculated to gain Catholic support, because Canh had converted to Catholicism. He further called on Catholics to congregate in the citadel under his protection. Vietnamese priests went on to lead Catholic armies in fighting off imperial forces as well providing messengers to communicate with the world outside their besieged citadel.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{the text}} {{can give a}} basic outline that {{correlates}} to the four-movement scheme of a symphony. For instance, the four-part structure of Edgar Allan Poe's The Bells, a progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of a symphony to Sergei Rachmaninoff, which he followed in his choral symphony of the same name. The text can encourage a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his Roméo et Juliette, yet <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form. It can also influence the musical content in parts {{where there is no}} singing, as in Roméo et Juliette. There, Berlioz allows the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and saves words for expository and narrative sections of the work.|$|E

Sale el Sol was Shakira's second consecutive album to peak atop the Italian albums chart, after She Wolf topped the chart in 2009. Its stay inside the top 20 lasted for 19 weeks. The Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana (FIMI) certified the album platinum for sales of 60,000 units. Sale el Sol debuted atop the Portuguese Albums Chart — Shakira's first album to accomplish the feat in the country — and spent two weeks at number one. It was able to <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> top 10 for 23 consecutive weeks. It was certified platinum by the Associação Fonográfica Portuguesa (AFP) for selling 15,000 units in Portugal. Sale el Sol was Shakira's first studio album since Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005) to peak at {{number one on the}} Spanish Albums chart after it debuted at the top position. It spent a total of 63 weeks on the chart and was certified double-platinum by the Producers of Spanish Music (PROMUSICAE) for shipments of 80,000 units. Sale el Sol entered and peaked at number two on the Swiss Albums Chart and was kept from attaining the top position by American rock band Kings of Leon's album Come Around Sundown, which debuted at number one. It charted for 49 weeks in total. In Switzerland, it was certified double-platinum by IFPI for selling 40,000 units.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine was published, the editors of the {{magazine}} have hosted reader participation games whose outcome is directly influenced by the people who read the magazine. Strawberry Panic!s origin was in the October 2003 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine where it was announced after the ending of Sakurako Kimino's previous work Sister Princess that a new reader participation project would start the following month. In the November 2003 issue, the first batch of characters from St. Miator were introduced (Nagisa, Shizuma, Tamao, and Chiyo) and it was revealed how readers could participate in the project. The initial system had the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna (given without surnames) who were sisters {{and at the same time}} younger sisters of the readers of the magazine, effectively putting the reader in the position of the elder brother. Each girl entered her respective school and became the main character of that school. It was explained that the coupling of the main characters could be to an upperclassman, a classmate, or an underclassman, but had to <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> school they attended. For example, Nagisa, who attended Miator could not be coupled with another character from either Spica or Lulim at first. Playing the role of the elder brother, the reader gave advice to the younger sisters who were bewildered by their new lives at each of the schools. Thus, the readers had the ability to influence the coupling formations which would later be written by Kimino as short stories serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female herds, consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor herds, consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large herds often get divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, the older ones form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression {{on the part of the}} males. These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E

5|$|The {{reform plan}} adopted in 2005 envisaged the {{formation}} of eighteen integrated brigades through the brassage process as its first of three stages. The process consists firstly of regroupment, where fighters are disarmed. Then they are sent to orientation centres, run by CONADER, where fighters take the choice of either returning to civilian society or remaining in the armed forces. Combatants who choose demobilisation receive an initial cash payment of US $110. Those who choose to <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> FARDC are then transferred to one of six integration centres for a 45-day training course, which aims to build integrated formations out of factional fighters previously heavily divided along ethnic, political and regional lines. The centres are spread out around the country at Kitona, Kamina, Kisangani, Rumangabo and Nyaleke (within the Virunga National Park) in Nord-Kivu, and Luberizi (on the border with Burundi) in South Kivu. The process has suffered severe difficulties due to construction delays, administration errors, {{and the amount of}} travel former combatants have to do, as the three stages' centres are widely separated. Following the first 18 integrated brigades, the second goal is {{the formation of}} a ready reaction force of two to three brigades, and finally, by 2010 when MONUC is anticipated to have withdrawn, the creation of a Main Defence Force of three divisions.|$|E
5|$|With {{relation}} to the human characters, David was conceptualized as not only a surrogate son for Peter Weyland, but {{as a replacement for}} Weyland's estranged daughter, Meredith Vickers. The actress who portrayed Vickers, Charlize Theron, detailed that Ridley Scott perceived Weyland's family and his company, the Weyland Corporation, as being male-dominated, with Vickers' shared DNA being the only attachment. This runs counter to David, who is a synthetic male created to supplant Vickers and uphold the family's patriarchy. Throughout the eight-month rewrite process leading directly into principal photography, Damon Lindelof focused on enhancing David's bondage to Weyland and the Prometheus- despite David being designed to be a surrogate son, he would actually be a proverbial captive to the master and his ship. With Weyland's death {{at the hands of the}} awakened Engineer, David's programming has run its course and every action he takes from thereon out is by his own volition, essentially freeing him. A philosophical element Scott raised about the David 8 model is that he exemplifies the dangers of making an android sentient- with him having the capacity for free will and the ability to create, he crosses a moral boundary that other androids <b>stay</b> <b>within.</b> <b>The</b> contrast between David and the others androids was developed further in , with the creation of the physically identical character Walter, who was made more robotic and unable to create on his own.|$|E
