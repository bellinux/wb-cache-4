Within each act, the player collects Chao creatures; finding 10 in all 3 acts in one zone grants the player access to a special stage, where a Chaos Emerald can be found. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds, which can be done after completion of the main campaign, allows the player to fight an extra final boss for the game's true ending.|$|R

50|$|The Reliance mines {{were opened}} in 1906-1907 to meet {{increasing}} demand for coal. The Reliance mines were among {{many in the}} area that exploited four mining districts in Sweetwater County; Rock Springs, Superior, Point of Rocks and Black Butte. The Reliance Mines were part of the Rock <b>Springs</b> district. <b>Rail</b> spurs were built to central points in each district to collect and ship coal. Production increased to the end of World War I then declined, picking up only in the mid-1930s. The second tipple was built at Reliance in 1936, primarily for Mine no. 7 as well as 1 and 4. During World War II production peaked at 1.4 million tons per year. Activity declined after that, and the Reliance mines closed for good in 1955.|$|R

50|$|With the May 20, 1887, {{sale of the}} Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad to the California Central Railway, a {{subsidiary}} railroad of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, the two lines were connected together at Mud <b>Springs,</b> completing the <b>rail</b> line from Chicago to Los Angeles through the San Gabriel Valley. The Santa Fe line served the San Gabriel Valley until 1994, when the 1994 Northridge earthquake weakened the bridge in Arcadia.|$|R
50|$|In <b>spring</b> 1945 <b>rail</b> {{traffic was}} {{interrupted}} {{as a result}} of one of the bridges over the Tettau being blown up. When Soviet troops occupied Thuringia on 3 July 1945 the old state border became the new Inner German Border and, because the line crossed it several times it remained closed. This had a serious impact on industrial production in the Tettauer Winkel. Not until 16 October 1946 after the Tettau bridge had been repaired could goods traffic resume again. Three goods trains worked the line each week. On 14 April 1947 passenger services started up again with two pairs of trains daily. The passengers in the so-called corridor trains had to keep the doors and windows closed when travelling through the Soviet Zone. In Heinersdorf Soviet soldiers carried out passenger checks.|$|R

25|$|The Spring District is {{centered}} around the <b>Spring</b> District/120th light <b>rail</b> station, located {{in the northern part}} of the planned neighborhood. Architecture firm NBBJ, inspired by the Pearl District in Portland, Oregon, designed the neighborhood with small blocks and a grid of interconnected streets integrated with the station and amenities, including parks, open space and mid-block pedestrian passages. The buildings will be staggered and oriented for views of Downtown Bellevue to the southwest and the Cascade Range to the east. NE 16th Street will be renamed to Spring Boulevard, which begins in the new district and continues east towards Overlake Village station.|$|R
