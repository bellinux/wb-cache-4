25|$|The common {{mountain}} or {{forest pasture}} used for transhumance in summer is called <b>seter</b> or bod / bua. The same term {{is used for}} a related mountain cabin, which {{was used as a}} summer residence. In summer (usually late June), livestock is moved to a mountain farm, often quite distant from a home farm, in order to preserve meadows in valleys for producing hay. Livestock were typically tended for summer by girls and younger women, who also milked and made cheese. Bulls usually remained at the home farm. As autumn approached and grazing became in short supply, livestock are returned to a home farm.|$|E

50|$|John Van <b>Seters</b> argues that, {{according}} to traditional interpretation, {{a show of}} hands by Moses was regarded as a sign of prayer; this is significant because the text does not directly mention prayer. Van <b>Seters</b> believed that Moses' gesture, like Joshua's - elevating the javelin (Joshua 8,18-26) - should be understood as the practice of magic, and secondarily as religious. Hans-Christoph Schmitt disputes this view, pointing out that such restrictions would be unlikely. In his opinion, parallels should be sought in 1 Samuel 7,2-13, where Israel is victorious thanks to the constant prayer of Samuel.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} Van <b>Seters</b> {{published}} [...] "Abraham in History and Tradition" [...] the dominant scholarly theory regarding {{the composition of}} the Pentateuch was the Documentary Hypothesis. This held that the books of the Torah, including the Genesis accounts of Abraham and the Patriarchs, were based on four independent sources. Each of these was originally a complete document in itself, dating from between the 10th and 7th centuries BC and combined into the final work by a Redactor (editor) in the Persian period, c.450 BC. Van <b>Seters</b> retained the idea of source documents but dropped the idea of a redactor, which meant dropping the documentary model itself. In its place he adopted a supplemental model, [...] "a successive supplementation of one source or author by another," [...] in which a Yahwist (not identical with Wellhausen's Yahwist) working in the period of the Babylonian exile was the major but not the final author of Genesis. Van <b>Seter's</b> schema is as follows: ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Seter</b> {{learned to}} play the piano from the age of seven in Russia, and {{continued}} with his lessons and studies in Tel Aviv. In 1932, he went to Paris, France, where he studied composition at the Ecole Normale de Musique with Paul Dukas and Nadia Boulanger. He also had some lessons with Stravinsky. With Boulanger, <b>Seter</b> mastered Renaissance polyphony and contemporary French style, but in 1937, frustrated by the extent of her devotion to Stravinskian neoclassicism, he returned to Palestine. There, he pursued a musical language founded on his own unique synthesis of the latter, and other, European influences with more local ones.|$|E

5000|$|Whereas the {{documentary}} hypothesis {{proposed that the}} four Pentateuch sources were complete and independent accounts, Van <b>Seters</b> writes that the supplementary hypothesis “does not view the later sources J and P as independent documents but as direct additions to the earlier corpus.” The hypothesis proposed that the Deuteronomist is the only independent source and that the Yahwist (J) is a reply to the Deuteronomic explanation of the Exile and a “confessional reformulation” as a theological corrective. Further, the hypothesis views the Priestly (P) source as non-independent as well. Because many P texts, Van <b>Seters</b> argues, “do not make sense without the larger J context,” the Priestly writer {{is viewed as a}} redactor of J. A major consequence of this view that the later two sources are not independent is the removal of the need for redactors to explain the cohesion of the Penteteuch. Van <b>Seters</b> writes, “Since there are no separate sources after the first one, {{there is no need for}} redactors. The elaborate system of multiple redactors used by current documentarians is unnecessary.” ...|$|R
