Biosecurity Borderlands {{seeks to investigate}} the practices, understandings and pressures created as biosecurity is extended into the British food system and landscape. The economic and social costs associated with communicable animal diseases, particularly after recent foot and mouth, avian influenza and bluetongue outbreaks in the UK, have made biosecurity both a key policy goal and a widely used if poorly understood term. The term biosecurity {{is often used to}} suggest a sanitised landscape and a clinical approach to food and agriculture, with little patience for the untidiness of food and landscape practices that need to contend with a range of other concerns. The project explores the interfaces between biosecurity and other concerns, including workers’ health and safety, eating cultures and food security, and wildlife conservation practices. This exploration will be undertaken through ethnographic work on farms, in food <b>safety</b> <b>settings</b> and on wildlife reserves, as well as through focus groups with lay publics.

40|$|Abstract—Self-organizing multi-radio mesh {{networks}} {{can be used}} {{to establish}} metropolitan ad hoc telephony networks in disaster recovery situations and public <b>safety</b> <b>settings</b> such as after a flood or a terrorist attack. These networks can be employed to enable forces to extend the remaining circuit-switched communication infrastructure. This paper introduces a system architecture, a self-organized topology construction and channel allocation algorithm and its implementation in a distributed protocol. The architecture relies on commercially available IEEE 802. 16 - 2004 (WiMAX) equipment that can be employed to build routers and gateways to a wired network. The topology construction and maintenance are based on a modified Dijkstra shortest path algorithm that maximizes a combined metric of path qualities and gateway load. Path qualities are derived from link qualities determined by SINR measurements. The channel allocation greedily allocates the locally least-interfered channel. The protocol includes four sub-protocols: a join protocol, a hello protocol, a leave protocol, and a conflict resolution protocol to resolve inconsistencies in topology data across the network. The proposed architecture, algorithms, and protocol have been assessed via extensive simulations and implemented on hardware. Both, simulation results and field tests confirm their applicability/usability. ...|$|E

Therefore, bisphosphonates, which are strong inhibitors of bone resorption, are widely used to prevent pathological fractures, pain and tumour-induced hypercalcaemia. Intravenous infusion of bisphosphonate is associated with dose- and infusion rate-dependent adverse renal effects. Objective The present study investigated the effect of hydration on bisphosphonate efficacy and <b>safety.</b> <b>Settings</b> The 600 -bed CHOV Hospital (Neufchâteau, France) and the Université de Lorraine (Nancy, France). Methods Patients who received pamidronate or zoledronic acid treatments were identified: 50 patients [16 of whom were hydrated and 34 of whom were non-hydrated]. Data on serum calcium levels, creatinine clearance and clinical tolerance were collected. Main outcome measure The impact of hydration on these parameters was analysed between day 1 and day 7. Results Bisphosphonate normalized calcaemia and hydration did not induce further reduction of calcium levels. Patient kidneys were significantly preserved by hydration in both groups (median clearance: + 6. 2 %), whereas dehydrated patients had lower creatinine clearance (median clearance: − 1. 1 %). Hydration did not influence other clinical or biological parameters tested.

40|$|Standardised {{patients}} (SPs) are {{a powerful}} form of simulation {{that has now}} become commonplace in training and assessment in medical education throughout the world. Standardised patients are individuals, with or without actual disease, who {{have been trained to}} portray a medical case in a consistent manner. They are now the gold standard for measuring the competence of physicians and other health professionals, and the quality of their practice. A common way in which SPs are used in performance assessment has been as part of an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).

Health care professionals (HCPs) could {{play an important role in}} encouraging patient involvement in safety-relevant behaviours. However, to date factors that determine HCPs' attitudes towards patient participation in this area remain largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE To investigate predictors of HCPs' attitudes towards patient involvement in safety-relevant behaviours. DESIGN A 22 -item cross-sectional fractional factorial survey that assessed HCPs' attitudes towards patient involvement in relation to two error scenarios relating to hand hygiene and medication <b>safety.</b> <b>SETTING</b> Four hospitals in London PARTICIPANTS   Two hundred sixteen HCPs (116 doctors; 100 nurses) aged between 21 and 60 years (mean: 32) : 129 female. OUTCOME MEASURES Approval of patient's behaviour, HCP response to the patient, anticipated effects on the patient-HCP relationship, support for being asked as a HCP, affective rating response to the vignettes. RESULTS HCPs elicited more favourable attitudes towards patients intervening about a medication error than about hand sanitation. Across vignettes and error scenarios, the strongest predictors of attitudes were how the patient intervened and how the HCP responded to the patient's behaviour. With regard to HCP characteristics, doctors viewed patients intervening less favourably than nurses. CONCLUSIONS HCPs perceive patients intervening about a potential error less favourably if the patient's behaviour is confrontational in nature or if the HCP responds to the patient intervening in a discouraging manner. In particular, if a HCP responds negatively to the patient (irrespective of whether an error actually occurred), this is perceived as having negative effects on the HCP-patient relationship...|$|R

Aim: To evaluate and analyze the blood donor deferral pattern and its causes among blood donors in a tertiary care hospital blood bank and to review its influence on blood <b>safety.</b> <b>Settings</b> and Design: Hospital based blood bank, retrospective analysis. Subjects and Methods: The data available as donor deferral record {{over a period of}} 13 years from 2001 to 2013 was analyzed. Results: The blood donor deferral rate was 11. 5 %, the deferral rate in various categories was 4. 8 %, 4. 7 %, 1. 6 %, and 0. 3 % in Category 1, Category 2, Category 3, and Category 4, respectively. The majority of deferrals were temporary deferrals (62. 8 %) of young donors. The maximum number of donors deferred (28. 2 %) due to a history of jaundice (permanent) followed by 19. 4 % due to low hemoglobin (temporary). History of malaria, intake of medicines, infections, underweight, last blood donation within 3 months (temporary deferral), and history of heart and lung diseases, diabetes, and with suspicious identity (permanent deferral) were other major causes identified. Conclusion: The pattern of donor deferral identified is an important tool for blood safety and also provides key areas to focus on a region or policy formulation nationally for donor selection as well ensure donor safety. The value of determining donor deferral pattern by the categories described is in calling back donors deferred due to temporary reasons and can help retain pool of motivated blood donors...|$|E

Aims: The aim of our {{study was to determine}} pain management strategies employed after major abdominal surgeries at our institute and their efficacy and <b>safety.</b> <b>Settings</b> and Design: Prospective observational study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: Patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgeries were included. Post-operative analgesic strategy, co-analgesics used, pain and sedation scores, motor block, nausea and vomiting were recorded and patient satisfaction was determined. Results: Data was collected on 100 patients. Epidural analgesia was used in 61, patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) in 25 and opioid infusion in 14 patients. Multimodal analgesia was employed in 98 patients. The level of epidural was between L 1 -L 3 in 31, T 10 -L 1 in 20 and T 8 -T 10 in 10 patients. Pethidine was used in 80 % of patients receiving PCIA. Patients with epidurals at T 8 -T 10 had lower pain scores. Fifteen patients had motor block, 73 % of which were with epidural at L 1 -L 3. Fourteen patients complained of nausea. Ninety nine out of 100 patients were satisfied with their analgesia. Conclusion: Epidural, PCIA and opioid infusions are used for pain relief after major abdominal surgeries at our hospital.

40|$|Despite being often {{ambivalent}} {{regarding the}} potential benefits and risks of digital media, parents begin thinking about, and finding ways to manage, the digital media use of their children when they are very young. Partly, they act out of already-established styles of parenting and family values, extending these to ICT uses at {{home as soon as}} these begin. Partly, they are already mediating the activities of their older children, and they adjust their approach to include their younger children. Partly, they are led to intervene when they see their young children respond to digital devices in ways that worry them (spending too long on one activity, staring at the screen, behaving badly when the device is taken away, etc.). However, their good intentions are often hindered by a host of everyday life practicalities. Families of different socio-economic background and education differed in their parenting styles, supporting Clark’s distinction between poorer/less educated families endorsing an ‘ethic of respectful connectedness’ and wealthier/more educated families endorsing an ‘ethic of expressive empowerment’. This was found to translate loosely – with many exceptions – into restrictive and active strategies of ICT mediation. The relationship between parenting style and parental regulation of digital devices is however mediated by parents’ own familiarity with ICT. Across all the family types, when parents had particular expertise in ICT, because of work or interests, they were more confident of managing their children’s ICT activities and more engaged in them. For all parents, but especially those who lack confidence, experience or expertise in relation to ICTs, the study revealed a need for policy and practitioner support in relation to: 	The benefits of internet use (e. g. recommended imaginative or educational sites and apps). 	The risks of internet use (e. g. commercial risks or non-appropriate age content). 	The use of technical tools to manage children’s internet use (e. g. <b>safety</b> <b>settings,</b> passwords, privacy protection and content filters). 	Communication strategies to facilitate shared activities using digital devices and parent-child discussions about preferred values and practices and how to address problems.

40|$|Introduction: With the {{constant}} increase in air travel {{every year and}} the downfalls of the World’s economy, airline managers face the need to optimize resources {{with the goal of}} reaching profit and reliability targets. This leads to higher utilization rates in commercial aircrews, with more hours of work and the consequence of less sleep and off time. As such, pilots and cabin crew face an increasing number of sleep disturbances, with the consequent alertness impairments and reduced performance. The concept of fatigue resumes these issues and has recently been addressed by several studies and documents, which prove its hazards and identifies them as risks to a flight’s safety. The main goal of this study is the methodic identification of fatigue in a regional aircraft operator that, although not suffering from night circadian disruption has a major rostering structure of multi-flight operations with flights {{in the early hours of}} the day. Methodology: The universe and the sample size of this study are equal and correspond to 52 airline pilots, 27 Captains and 25 First Officers, all males and an average age of 39. 2 years old. The methodology used in this research consists of two interconnected principles: objective fatigue measurement, using bio-mathematical modeling through the SAFE model and subjective fatigue measurement through a 3 week daily survey applied to real operations, allowing the measurement of individual fatigue in the beginning of work and at top of descend on the last flight of the day. The survey was complemented by an adapted version of NASA’s TLX workload measurement scale, allowing a more complete analysis of an additional fatigue cause that has impact in multi-segment operations. A questionnaire was also distributed in order to identify any variability factors that could influence the measurements and limit pilot’s capabilities and performance. Results: Results were determined by setting a methodic approach to schedule analysis, with 365 days of planned pilot rosters processed. Areas of high risk were identified, in particular on the early hours of the morning and the evening and on days with more than 4 sectors. With the surveys and when comparing both measurements, SAFE model predictions stay short of 5 in the Samn-Perelli Scale (Moderately tired. Let down.) whilst pilot reported fatigue values represent a 6 on the same scale (Extremely tired. Very difficult to concentrate.). A high relation was also found between the increase of fatigue, the number of sectors and time of day, revealing that workload might be caused by multi-segment operations and a hazard to what can be considered an acceptable level of safety to risk management in flight operations. Conclusion: A new approach to workload in the fatigue and <b>safety</b> <b>settings</b> should be considered, and further research should strive to look at the impact of workload in multi-segment operations. This should all lead to new hazard identification and risk mitigation practices to be in place, joining flight safety and rostering departments in better and more robust schedules, with of course increased safety levels and better overhaul performance.

40|$|Over {{the last}} six years there has been a major {{increase}} in online activity by children up to eight years old, a leading international internet survey has found.  The trend has prompted growing concern for children’s safety – and especially the risks they may be exposed to through videos, apps and touch-screens, says the EU Kids Online Report, to which Australia contributes through the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation (CCI). This report critically reviews recent research to understand the internet use, and emerging policy priorities, regarding children from birth to eight years old. Executive summaryEU Kids Online has spent seven years investigating 9 - 16 year olds’ engagement with the internet, focusing on the benefits and risks of children’s internet use. While this meant examining the experiences of much younger children than had been researched before EU Kids Online began its work in 2006, there is now a critical need for information about the internet-related behaviours of 0 - 8 year olds. EU Kids Online’s research shows that children are now going online at a younger and younger age, and that young children’s “lack of technical, critical and social skills may pose [a greater] risk”. Key findingsThis report critically reviews recent research to understand the internet use, and emerging policy priorities, regarding children from birth to eight years old. Key findings are as follows:Over the last five to six years there has been a substantial increase in internet usage by children under nine years old. This increase is not uniform across countries but seems to follow usage patterns among older age cohorts – in countries where more children overall use the internet, they also go online younger. The substantial increase in usage by very young children has not yet been matched by research exploring the benefits and risks of their online engagement, so there are many gaps in our knowledge. Children under nine years old enjoy a variety of online activities, including watching videos, playing games, searching for information, doing their homework and socialising within children’s virtual worlds. The range of activities increases with age. It has not been established that children under nine years old have the capacity to engage with the internet in a safe and beneficial manner in all circumstances, {{especially when it comes to}} this age group socialising online, either within ageappropriate virtual worlds or as underaged participants in sites intended for teenagers and adults (Facebook, You Tube etc.). Video sharing sites are popular with children in this age group and are one of the first sites very young children visit. As such, the ease with which children can access inappropriate video content is of concern. There is an emerging trend for very young children (toddlers and pre-schoolers) to use internet connected devices, especially touchscreen tablets and smartphones. This is likely to result in an increasing number of very young children having access to the internet, along with a probable increase in exposure to risks associated with such internet use. The variety of internet connected devices and apps available today risks compromising the privacy and safety of young children. Different operating environments complicate the use of security and <b>safety</b> <b>settings</b> on individual devices, and the numerous applications (apps) available for children tend not to disclose the company’s data collection and sharing practices. Nor do they usually provide easy-to-use opt-out options for parents or children. Children’s digital footprints are now taking shape from very young ages. Some parents are writing blogs, and parents and grandparents regularly post photographs and videos of babies and children. These digital footprints are created for children who are too young to understand or consent (or who may not even be born, if their parents post ultrasound scans). Children’s future ability to find, reclaim or delete material posted by others is uncertain...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Antipsychotic use {{is common}} in US nursing homes, despite {{evidence}} of increased risk of morbidity and mortality, and limited efficacy in older adults with dementia. Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding antipsychotic use among nursing home staff are unclear. The study aim was to describe nursing home leadership and direct care staff members 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of antipsychotic risks, beliefs and attitudes {{about the effectiveness of}} antipsychotics and nonpharmacologic management of dementia-related behaviors, and perceived need for evidence-based training about antipsychotic medication <b>safety.</b> DESIGN, <b>SETTING,</b> PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: Survey of leadership and direct care staff of nursing homes in Connecticut was conducted in June 2011. Questionnaire domains included knowledge of antipsychotic risks, attitudes about caring for residents with dementia, satisfaction with current behavior management training, beliefs about antipsychotic effectiveness, and need for staff training about antipsychotics and behavior management. RESULTS: A total of 138 nursing home leaders and 779 direct care staff provided useable questionnaires. Only 24...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{change has}} led to the proceduralisation of flight deck work. Yet {{accidents}} attributable to pilot error still occur. CSCW studies of work suggest work as prescribed does not always reflect work as practised. While one might expect this to be less true of <b>safety</b> critical <b>settings</b> like the flight deck, the case studies we present provide support for this distinction. We present two re-framings which better capture the status of procedures on the flight deck. One case study illustrates what else is required in order to make procedures work. The second illustrates how procedures are customised. Instead of seeing them as prescriptions of work we view them as resources for action and boundary objects. We discuss design implications of this re-framing KEYWORDS Pilot error, CSCW, procedures, practices, resources for action, boundary object, due process. INTRODUCTION There have been many technological advances in the commercial aviation industry. A modern aircraft is now capabl [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{primary goal}} of {{intervention}} with sex offenders {{is to protect the}} community from further sexual aggression. As the availability ofjail beds decreases. it is imperative that professionals discriminate between those offendm who must be incarcerated to protect the public and those offenders who can be supervised with reasonable <b>safety</b> in community <b>settings.</b> This article will review the research on variables related to sex offender recidivism which is a critical factor to consider in making these decisions. In addition. criteriafor determining an offender's amenability to treatment will be examined and guidelinesfor formulating disposition plans will be outlined...|$|R
40|$|Attached is {{a request}} for changes to the Technical Specifications of the Operating License for the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant. The {{proposed}} changes would: " Revise the reference point for reactor vessel level instrumentation specifications to use instrument "zero " instead of "top of active fuel (TAF). " Use of TAF {{is no longer an}} unambiguous reference point because of variations in the length of active fuel in modern fuel element designs. " * Simplify the Safety Limits and Limiting <b>Safety</b> System <b>Settings</b> to eliminate specifications that are unnecessary, outdated, or redundant to portions of Section 3 of the Technical Specifications. " * Change the reactor coolant system pressure Safety Limit from 1335 psig to 1332 psig to correct a minor error in the calculation of this limit. " * Change the Bases for the upper limit on reactor coolant system safety/relief valve self actuation setpoint to correct the description of this specification. These changes have been combined and included in one submittal because they affect many of the same Technical Specification pages. USNRC Nuclear Management Compan...|$|R
