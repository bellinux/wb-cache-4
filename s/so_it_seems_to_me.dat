500|$|Conversely, {{astronomer}} Robert Cumming of the Stockholm Observatory notes that, [...] "The name 'minor planet' [...] {{been more}} or less synonymous with 'asteroid' {{for a very long}} time. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> pretty insane to complain about any ambiguity or risk for confusion with the introduction of 'dwarf planet'." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the judges}} {{explained}} that the court had jurisdiction because the case brought up a legal issue, that of statutory interpretation (whether the 1911 Act {{could be used to}} enact the 1949 Act), rather than being examination of parliamentary proceedings. Lord Bingham noted that the bill was not enacted by both Houses of Parliament, as it was in Pickin, and that [...] "the appellants have raised a question of law which cannot, as such, be resolved by Parliament ... <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> necessary that the courts should resolve it, and that to do so involves no breach of constitutional propriety". Lord Nicholls distinguished Jackson from Pickin as a case examining the correct interpretation of the 1911 Act, an evaluation for the courts rather than Parliament; Lord Hope concurred, noting that there was no absolute prohibition on courts evaluating the validity of Acts of Parliament; and Lord Carswell agreed that the case raised [...] "a question of law which falls within the scope of courts of law carrying out their regular function". All nine judges accepted that the court had jurisdiction to consider whether the 1949 Act was valid.|$|E
2500|$|There {{seems to}} be a certain logic in female homosexuality. For if it is true, broadly speaking, we acquire our first sexual proclivities in infancy, girl {{children}} who are petted and fondled by their mothers, nurses and female relatives acquire what might be said to be a [...] "normal" [...] sexual affection for their own sex. But this is not true of male children, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that there is a very fundamental difference between male and female homosexuality.|$|E
60|$|At least, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, {{the first}} day that I went, awe struck, into the High Woods; and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, the last day that I came, even more awe-struck, out of them.|$|R

6000|$|... "Glenn, you {{distress}} me {{when you}} talk like this," [...] replied Carley, soberly. [...] "You did not use to talk <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> you are bitter against women." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had come}} into a {{condition}} of vast perplexities. For {{the first time in}} my life, at least <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now in this retrospect, I looked at my existence as a whole.|$|E
60|$|At {{the first}} {{mention of his}} name the girl's face {{distinctly}} darkened and her answers became curiously studied, almost evasive--or <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> Serviss.|$|R
60|$|As it was, however, we {{had come}} a long {{distance}} from our friends, and already sacrificed a life uselessly, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me then in my bitterness of spirit.|$|R
60|$|He sulked {{after that}} most of the way to the Rue du Hasard, or <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> Andre-Louis. At least he sat silent, gloomily {{thoughtful}} to judge by his expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you find}} it <b>so?</b> <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> there's a great difference. I can imagine {{that at the end}} of ten years we might have a very {{pleasant}} correspondence. I shall have matured my epistolary style." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] said Captain Eli. [...] "If she can't {{afford to}} keep the little gal, she can't afford to give no Christmas trees nor stockin's, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> cap'n, that that little gal would {{be a pretty good}} child to help us keep Christmas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet," [...] {{rejoined the}} Baital impudently, [...] "if Tribikram had not {{preserved}} her bones {{how could she}} have been restored to life? And if Madhusadan had not learned the science of restoring the dead to life {{how could she have}} been revivified? At least, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But perhaps your royal wisdom may explain." ...|$|E
60|$|Before I {{could make}} reply {{the old man}} was striding off in the {{direction}} of the village, walking as spritely, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, as I myself might have done.|$|R
60|$|Every few minutes, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, {{though in}} reality the {{intervals}} may perhaps have been longer, a ghostly face would appear at the carriage-window, and ask to see our tickets.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{little too}} much <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me that her {{mistress}} allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you did it, anyway. And I have a {{right to}} feel hurt, and I do feel hurt, to have you treat me <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that when a person goads, and crowds, and in a manner forces another person to talk, it is neither very fair nor very good-mannered to call what he says clack." ...|$|E
60|$|Now I {{seemed to}} have had enough of this eerie conversation. Of course {{it is easy to}} laugh at natives and their superstitions, but, after a long life of experience, I am bound to admit that they are not always devoid of truth. The native has some kind of sixth sense which the civilised man has lost, or <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It iss of no use," [...] said Fergus, {{when this}} became evident, [...] "for {{us to keep}} up a stern-chase after them. They have got {{too much of a}} start, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> boys, we could not do better than follow up the tracks of Daniel Davidson an' make sure that he has got clear away from them." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{sickness}} of {{fear was}} stealing over me. My voice, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, disappointed at the effect it had produced, had retired, sulky, into my boots, whence {{it refused to}} emerge.|$|R
50|$|Facial droop: Have {{the person}} smile or show {{his or her}} teeth. If one side doesn't move {{as well as the}} other <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> droop, that could be sign of a stroke.|$|R
25|$|Finally, it supposes {{that there}} is some {{physical}} distinction between a conscious observer and a non-conscious measuring device, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> require eliminating the strong Church–Turing hypothesis or postulating a physical model for consciousness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! my daughter, be plain, I pray of you, for I cannot {{understand}} your counsels. Were it not better {{to give to}} these people the red stones which they desire, and send them secretly from the land, saying that they had vanished into the earth again, for <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> we should be rid of much shame and trouble?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you despair like this, {{then are}} we lost indeed," [...] he said mildly. [...] "Remember that I know nothing {{whatever}} of such work. Go on as before, using your {{best efforts to}} lead us to the river. Then we should aim to meet the volunteers, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> forgetting poor Kenton because of the many others who need {{to know exactly what}} has happened here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'se {{ready to}} go wid you whereber you like, Miss Lucy; but I do tink dat, in times like dis, dat a young gal is best wid her own folk. It may be hard work getting across, but as to danger dar can't be much more danger than dar has been in {{stopping}} along here, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> best to do as dis young officer says." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{as she did}} <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{her that}} someone passing breathed upon her lips a little kiss: {{and for a while}} she did not move. Then, {{treading}} softly, she looked into the room.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} {{relative}} terms, {{seen in the}} fourth category somehow disposed in relation to something is more obvious than {{the need for the}} third category somehow disposed and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have arisen first.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no knowing to what depth utter ruin {{may reduce}} {{a man who}} has been born to better things. He falls into idleness, and then comforts himself with drink. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. I hope {{he is not}} quarrelsome. But there, it is of no use my hoping that, Keith; {{for your}} Scotchman is a quarrelsome {{creature}} by nature, at least <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Of the duels that, {{in spite of my}} orders, take place--I know you all try to hide them from me, Keith--I hear of a good many between these hot-headed countrymen of yours and my Prussian officers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What quarrel have I {{with the}} King or the gentry? They have quarrel enough with {{me it is}} true, but, nathless, I {{do not know why}} I should have hated them so before I was old enough to know how rotten they really are. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I am but the {{instrument}} of an old man's spite, not even knowing the grievance to the avenging of which my life has been dedicated by another.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That--that presence, that shadow. I don't mean, of course, it's a real shadow. It comes, doesn't it, from--from within?

6000|$|His dumb {{sacrifice}} passing their comprehension, {{had been}} rejected--or <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> him He {{could not understand}} that they had spared him. Why! He {{was as good as}} they! His pride was hurt. No! They should not get him now! ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Sellars' languishing {{eyes were}} fixed upon me; Miss Sellars' red lips pouted and twitched; Miss Sellars' white bosom rose and fell. Never, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me, had <b>so</b> large an amount of beauty been {{concentrated}} in one being.|$|R
60|$|I owed it <b>to</b> myself--at least <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me--not {{to let it}} be {{supposed}} that I, too, had meanly deserted her. Dreadful as the prospect was, I felt that I must see her once more, {{and for the last}} time.|$|R
