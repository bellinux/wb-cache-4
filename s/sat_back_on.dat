2500|$|She said, [...] "Indeed, {{he never}} used to pray or fast more {{than the rest of}} you, but I never saw a servant of God who feared Him more than Umar. He devoted his body and his soul to the people. All day he would sit tending to their affairs, and when night came he would sit up while {{business}} remained. One evening when he had finished everything, he called for his lamp - from which he used to buy the oil from his own money - and prayed two prostrations. Then he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his folded legs, with his chin in his hands, and the tears ran down from his cheeks, and this didn't stop until dawn, when he rose for a day of fasting.|$|E

6000|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and drummed <b>on</b> {{the table}} with his fingers. [...] "Well, I’ll risk it," [...] he said, at length; [...] "you’ll find him at 17, Beaufort Street, Bow." ...|$|R
25|$|A simple rounded hood of {{the early}} years of the century evolved into the French hood, popular in both France and England; its arched shape <b>sat</b> further <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the head and {{displayed}} the front hair which was parted in the center and pinned up in braids or twists under the veil.|$|R
2500|$|At one {{critical}} meeting between T.I. and British Aluminium {{late on a}} Friday, Portal stood up and declared, [...] "My bankers will take over from here". Stedeford shot back, [...] "If you leave Lord Portal, I leave!" [...] Portal <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> down. <b>On</b> another occasion, while rebuffing the T.I. bid, Portal bizarrely referred to [...] "people unaware of the mysteries of negotiations between great companies..." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently, I remember, she <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{her heels}} {{and looked up}} into my face. [...] "We've done wrong--and parting's paying. It's time to pay. We needn't have paid, if we'd kept to the track.... You and I, Master, we've got to be men." ...|$|E
60|$|Then the Elephant's Child <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{his little}} haunches, and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And the Crocodile floundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his tail, and he pulled, and pulled, and pulled.|$|E
6000|$|This {{brought us}} all, except Jones, {{out of the}} cabin, to see the object of Frank's anxiety tied to a nearby oak. At first I failed to {{recognize}} Old Baldy. Vanished was the slow, sleepy, apathetic manner that had characterized him; his ears lay back on his head; fire flashed from his eyes. When Frank threw down a kit-bag, which emitted a metallic clanking, Old Baldy <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his haunches, planted his forefeet deep {{in the ground and}} plainly as a horse could speak, said [...] "No!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{returned}} with the box {{and placed it on}} the divan near her. She <b>sat</b> cross-legged, leaning <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her arms, in the blue shimmer of her embroidered robe and with the tawny halo of her unruly hair about her face which she raised to mine with an air of resignation.|$|R
6000|$|It was at {{this instant}} that I heard Mr. Pike's [...] "Plug him!" [...] and pulled the trigger; and of all ungodly things the bullet missed and caught the Faun, who {{staggered}} <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> the hatch, and began to cough. And even as he coughed he still strained with pain-eloquent eyes to try to understand.|$|R
50|$|The meeting {{began in}} a hectic fashion, only 15 minutes into the match both FCK's Göcke and FCM's Zapf had had to be treated for injuries, but both could continue. At first, karl-Marx-Stadt, full of enthusiasm, created a number of {{opportunities}}. Göcke went close in the 12th, and in the 27th Zapf had to scratch the ball off the goalline. Magdeburg <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> relying <b>on</b> their safe defense, and waited for opportunities to counter-attack. These came up just a minute after Zapf's save: Stöcker started a run down the left, going past Göcke and outplayed Peter Müller. His cross reached Ohm who scored with a header. From this moment Magdeburg were {{in control of the}} match, sending their forwards to attack the very moment they won the ball. Ohm, Seguin and Abraham dominated in midifield and Karl-Marx-Stadt's play was reduced to individual efforts, their forwards reduced to ineffectiveness.|$|R
6000|$|Anne [...] "shooed," [...] but the cat {{would not}} [...] "shoo." [...] As {{long as she}} stood he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his {{haunches}} and gazed at her reproachfully out of his one good eye; when she resumed her walk he followed. Anne resigned herself to his company until she reached the gate of Patty's Place, which she coldly shut in his face, fondly supposing {{she had seen the}} last of him. But when, fifteen minutes later, Phil opened the door, there sat the rusty-brown cat on the step. More, he promptly darted in and sprang upon Anne's lap with a half-pleading, half-triumphant [...] "miaow." ...|$|E
60|$|Rikki-tikki {{felt his}} eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose's eyes grow red, he is angry), and he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his tail and hind legs {{like a little}} kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But Nag and Nagaina had {{disappeared}} into the grass. When a snake misses its stroke, it never says anything or gives any sign {{of what it means}} to do next. Rikki-tikki did not care to follow them, for he did not feel sure that he could manage two snakes at once. So he trotted off to the gravel path near the house, and sat down to think. It was a serious matter for him.|$|E
60|$|She {{liked him}} on Sundays. Then {{he wore a}} dark suit that showed the lithe {{movement}} of his body. There was a clean, clear-cut look about him. He went on with his thinking to her. Suddenly he reached for a Bible. Miriam liked the way he reached up--so sharp, straight to the mark. He turned the pages quickly, and read her a chapter of St. John. As {{he sat in the}} armchair reading, intent, his voice only thinking, she {{felt as if he were}} using her unconsciously as a man uses his tools at some work he is bent on. She loved it. And the wistfulness of his voice was like a reaching to something, and it was as if she were what he reached with. She <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the sofa away from him, and yet feeling herself the very instrument his hand grasped. It gave her great pleasure.|$|E
60|$|Hitherto, while {{gathering}} up {{the discourse of}} Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation. To this end, I had <b>sat</b> well <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate {{in such a manner}} as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came.|$|R
2500|$|In 1851 Warfield parish {{changed for}} the first time on record to create a Parish of Bracknell with its own church, Holy Trinity. In 1860 William Cocks wrote an account of Warfield church. [...] He {{describes}} box pews, whitewashed ceiling, and a gallery across the back with a barrel organ given by Lady Jane Walsh. There was a two-deck pulpit, and the farm workers <b>sat</b> at the <b>back</b> <b>on</b> benches. The west gallery later to be known as the [...] "Ormathwaite gallery" [...] was entered by a stairway from inside the church, where his Lordship sat with his servant.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{early the}} next morning, Forester and Marco got into a wagon to go up the river to Bath, {{which is the first}} town of any {{considerable}} consequence which you meet in ascending the Kennebec river. Marco and Forester sat on the seat of the wagon, and a boy, who was going with them for the purpose of bringing the wagon <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> behind, <b>on</b> a box, which had been put in to make a seat for him.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the {{bed with}} a bitter laugh, and {{finished}} taking off his shoes. He was a fool; he had been made drunken by a woman's face and by a woman's soft, white hands. And then, suddenly, before his eyes, on the foul plaster-wall appeared a vision. He {{stood in front of}} a gloomy tenement house. It was night-time, in the East End of London, and before him stood Margey, a little factory girl of fifteen. He had seen her home after the bean-feast. She lived in that gloomy tenement, a place not fit for swine. His hand was going out to hers as he said good night. She had put her lips up to be kissed, but he wasn't going to kiss her. Somehow he was afraid of her. And then her hand closed on his and pressed feverishly. He felt her callouses grind and grate on his, and a great wave of pity welled over him. He saw her yearning, hungry eyes, and her ill-fed female form which had been rushed from childhood into a frightened and ferocious maturity; then he put his arms about her in large tolerance and stooped and kissed her on the lips. Her glad little cry rang in his ears, and he felt her clinging to him like a cat. Poor little starveling! He continued to stare at the vision of what had happened in the long ago. His flesh was crawling as it had crawled that night when she clung to him, and his heart was warm with pity. It was a gray scene, greasy gray, and the rain drizzled greasily on the pavement stones. And then a radiant glory shone on the wall, and up through the other vision, displacing it, glimmered Her pale face under its crown of golden hair, remote and inaccessible as a star.|$|E
60|$|He then {{knew more}} or less how he had been affected--he but half knew at the time. There had been plenty to affect him even after, as has been said, they had shaken down; for his consciousness, though muffled, had its sharpest moments during this passage, a marked drop into {{innocent}} friendly Bohemia. They then had put their elbows on the table, deploring the premature end of their two or three dishes; which they had tried to make up with another bottle while Chad joked a little spasmodically, perhaps even a little irrelevantly, with the hostess. What it all came to had been that fiction and fable WERE, inevitably, in the air, {{and not as a}} simple term of comparison, but as a result of things said; also that they were blinking it, all round, and that they yet needn't, so much as that, have blinked it--though indeed if they hadn't Strether didn't quite see what else they could have done. Strether didn't quite see THAT even at an hour or two past midnight, even when he had, at his hotel, for a long time, without a light and without undressing, <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his bedroom sofa and stared straight before him. He was, at that point of vantage, in full possession, to make of it all what he could. He kept making of it that there had been simply a LIE in the charming affair--a lie on which one could now, detached and deliberate, perfectly put one's finger. It was with the lie that they had eaten and drunk and talked and laughed, that they had waited for their carriole rather impatiently, and had then got into the vehicle and, sensibly subsiding, driven their three or four miles through the darkening summer night. The eating and drinking, which had been a resource, had had the effect of having served its turn; the talk and laughter had done as much; and it was during their somewhat tedious progress to the station, during the waits there, the further delays, their submission to fatigue, their silences in the dim compartment of the much-stopping train, that he prepared himself for reflexions to come. It had been a performance, Madame de Vionnet's manner, and though it had to that degree faltered toward the end, as through her ceasing to believe in it, as if she had asked herself, or Chad had found a moment surreptitiously to ask her, what after all was the use, a performance it had none the less quite handsomely remained, with the final fact about it that it was on the whole easier to keep up than to abandon.|$|E
50|$|After the {{embarrassing}} first half, Saskatchewan head coach Danny Barrett opted to leave Crandell in {{to start the}} third quarter, Crandell finally began to get over his struggles as the Alouettes <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> their big lead, and threw a touchdown pass to Jamel Richardson early {{in the third quarter}} to give Roughriders fans some marginal hope. But another touchdown pass to Jason French in the fourth quarter was the only other scoring the Roughriders could produce, and Duval hit two more field goals and send Montreal to Toronto for the East Final.|$|E
6000|$|After {{dinner that}} evening Lady Surrey sent Gladys off to Miss Martindale's room on some small pretext, {{and then put}} Harry {{down on the sofa}} beside her to help in {{arranging}} those interminable ferns of hers. Evening dress suited the countess best, and she knew it. She was looking even more beautiful than before, with her hair prettily dressed, and the little simple turquoise necklet setting off her white neck; and she talked a great deal to Harry, and was really very charming. No more fascinating widow, he thought, to be found anywhere within a hundred miles. At last she stopped, leaning over the ferns, and <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> a little <b>on</b> the sofa, half fronting him. [...] "Mr. Vardon," [...] she said suddenly, [...] "there is something I wish to speak to you about, privately." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lettie went on {{with the}} paring and coring of her apples—then she took the raisins. Meanwhile, Emily was making the house ring as she chopped the suet in a wooden bowl. The {{children}} were ready for bed. They kissed us all [...] "Good-night"—save George. At last they were gone, accompanied by their mother. Emily put down her chopper, and sighed that her arm was aching, so I relieved her. The chopping {{went on for a}} long time, while the father read, Lettie worked, and George <b>sat</b> tilted <b>back</b> looking <b>on.</b> When at length the mincemeat was finished we were all out of work. Lettie helped to clear away—sat down—talked a little with effort—jumped up and said: ...|$|R
60|$|They {{worked on}} steadily, without speaking, losing no time. Each did {{whatever}} was needed, without thought of leaving {{to the other}} the least task that presented itself to hand. Thus, Kama saw when more ice was needed and went and got it, while a snowshoe, pushed over by the lunge of a dog, was stuck on end again by Daylight. While coffee was boiling, bacon frying, and flapjacks were being mixed, Daylight found time {{to put on a}} big pot of beans. Kama came <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> the edge of the spruce boughs, and in the interval of waiting, mended harness.|$|R

5000|$|The album {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics. Simon Jones of fRoots gave a positive review of the album, saying [...] "there can be no one direct approach taken to describe the constantly evolving music of the Peatbog Faeries, its very nature is polyglot and that disparate collection of philosophies makes them the perfect band for 2007. In {{a time when we}} have to move beyond silly categories and vague labels, which by very definition can no longer apply - unless you’re stuck in a time warp - fusion is the only term that makes real sense. If anything, What Men Deserve to Lose (a quote from writer Derek Cooper) moves out further into the big, blue beyond, still latching on to island roots yet in a mood of glorious experiment". Chris Nickson of Allmusic was also positive, saying, after noting the many instruments used on the album, [...] "the result is that they combine ancient and modern in very effective proportions, and aren't afraid of heavy touches of electricity, like Tom Salter's raucous guitar work on [...] "The Invergarry Blues." [...] They've gradually conjured up their own space". Dave Beeby of The Living Tradition was favourable, saying [...] "this is dance music at its best, driving rhythms and all that, whilst being a really good listen. They haven’t <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the success of their previous CD, but have strengthened even more." ...|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} examples of horses being ridden in warfare were horse-mounted archers or spear-throwers, dating to the reigns of the Assyrian rulers Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III. However, these riders <b>sat</b> far <b>back</b> <b>on</b> their horses, a precarious position for moving quickly, and the horses were held by a handler on the ground, keeping the archer free to use the bow. Thus, these archers were more a type of mounted infantry than true cavalry. The Assyrians developed cavalry in response to invasions by nomadic people from the north, such as the Cimmerians, who entered Asia Minor in the 8th century BC and took over parts of Urartu {{during the reign of}} Sargon II, approximately 721 BC. Mounted warriors such as the Scythians also had an influence on the region in the 7th century BC. By the reign of Ashurbanipal in 669 BC, the Assyrians had learned to sit forward on their horses in the classic riding position still seen today and could be said to be true light cavalry. The ancient Greeks used both light horse scouts and heavy cavalry, although not extensively, possibly due to the cost of keeping horses.|$|R

60|$|Aunty, meanwhile, was distributing her {{substantial}} weight evenly {{between the}} feet of the Irish gentleman and those of his daughter, as she leaned out of the window to converse with a lady friend in a straw hat and hair curlers, accompanied by three dirty and frivolous boys. It was, she stated, lucky that she had caught the train. I could not agree with her. The girl with the brown hair and the eyes that were neither blue or grey was bearing the infliction, I noticed, with angelic calm. She even smiled. This was when the train suddenly moved off with a jerk, and Aunty, staggering <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> the bag of food which Albert had placed on the seat beside him.|$|R
