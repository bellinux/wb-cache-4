40|$|A {{new process}} for {{material}} texturing, instantaneous controlled pressure drop (DIC), consists in heating wet materials in an autoclave, {{followed by a}} fast expansion (ΔP/Δt > 2. 105 Pa/s) into a pressure lower than the atmospheric one (5 kPa). The vapour, which evolves due to the rapid pressure drop, mechanically strains the material. This stress creates porous structures, breaks the cells and destroys micro-organisms. The temperature of the material before the expansion is usually higher than 100 °C and the pressure in the autoclave corresponds to the saturated <b>steam</b> pressure. <b>Manifold</b> applications of this process are presented on {{the example of the}} extraction of essential oil from dried ylang-ylang flowers. The essential oil is separated from the condensate. The treated flowers are also analysed. The results are compared with the classical steam distillation...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{experience}} of occasional cracks appearing near the spring brackets, {{had one or}} more further batches of Class 7 Standard Pacifics been built to complete the intended 91 engines, the chassis would have been rearranged {{to be similar to}} that used on the solitary BR Standard Class 8 Duke of Gloucester and that drawn up by Derby Drawing Office for the 2nd batch of Class 6 Standard Pacifics. This would have resulted in the locomotive riding on cast steel [...] "sub-frames" [...] carrying the spring brackets.Unlike the smaller BR Standards the exhaust <b>steam</b> <b>manifold</b> within the smokebox saddle (along with the BR Standard Class 6 engines) was an intricate steel casting.|$|E
