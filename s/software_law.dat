40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} video {{games as a}} {{problematic}} part of <b>software</b> <b>law</b> that is constantly growing in importance. It focuses on legal difficulties that were a byproduct of their growing economic potential. It further explains relevant aspects of copyright law in this matter and, to a limited degree, also related problematic from different branches of law, namely criminal law, administrative law and civil law. During the writing, I was focusing on distinctive aspects of video games as specific kind of software, and their distinctions from different kinds of works, especially from "classic" computer programs. An introduction to the problematics, an establishment of aims of this work and a brief summary of video games from the forties to the present times {{can be found in}} the first chapter. Basic terminology that is used in this work is in chapter two. The thesis further continues with legal concepts such as author, work and computer program. It proceeds with thoughts on a possible subsumption of video game under a certain kind of work as it is defined in the copyright act and considers establishing an individual category for video games. Chapter five defines content of copyrights, their division on personal and property law with a focus on the specification of different kinds of property law [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{target of}} this thesis is to outline the issues {{connected}} with software piracy to the reader. To clarify this issue some legal background connected with software {{needs to be}} explained. First {{it is necessary to}} define what software is and clarify its connection with a computer program. Next step is to define a computer program, which parts of it are protected and which parts are not. In order to define what is software piracy the thesis defines a rightful use of a computer program. After {{that it is possible to}} define software piracy and take a closer look at it. Also in the conclusion there are some current issues in this area that have a significant impact on the perception of software piracy by the public. This thesis is divided into ten chapters. The introduction outlines the issues of <b>software</b> <b>law</b> and software piracy and attempts to clarify the origin of this issue considering a new borderless area - the internet. The second chapter deals with the terms software and computer program, their relation and the differences and also with other terms which are used in this thesis including the legal source of a computer program with an overview of the current case law of the European Union Court of Justice. The third chapter is focused on a computer program as an object of law together with [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{software}} {{industry is a}} significant economic driver of innovation for many sectors in both the US and EU. Small software firms make important contributions to innovations that advance the progress of technology. Using the competitive principles of fostering innovation, ensuring economic efficiency and promoting consumer welfare, this paper examines how intellectual property laws and competition policy in both the US and the EU are undermining the future success of the {{software industry}}. In software sectors, the small software firm is faced with insurmountable challenges due to the improper use of existing copyright and patent laws to protect the unique characteristics of software. Although the argument for sui generis legislation is not new, evidence is mounting which suggests that small software firms will become increasingly non-competitive without substantial legal reform. The divide between large and small firm participation in the intellectual property system continues to grow. The characteristics that make the software industry important to consumers - network effects, interoperability and standardization - are also the characteristics which will ultimately harm consumer welfare by the reduction of innovative products and services. While large firms are able to overcome major obstacles present in the industry through patent portfolios and cross-licensing arrangements, small firms are precluded from activities that ensure their ability {{to compete in the}} global industry. A sui generis <b>software</b> <b>law</b> is not a real possibility today, but a second tier patent approach to solving this market failure deserves further research and consideration. Competition law provides limited potential to support the small software firm, but a major shift in policy will be required for it to become an effective regulatory tool. The EU is far better positioned to be the leader in including small firms in the competitive analysis of dynamic industries such as software...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho investiga as rela????es de m??tua influ??ncia entre organiza????es e institui????es, com especial aten????o a processos de mudan??a institucional. Tomando como objeto emp??rico a ind??stria de {{software}} e servi??os do Brasil, analisa-se a participa????o de empresas e associa????es empresariais setoriais em dois epis??dios de mudan??a institucional com efeito sobre esse setor industrial. Toma-se como principal referencial te??rico a literatura sobre empreendedorismo institucional, vinculada ao institucionalismo organizacional, mas busca-se suporte tamb??m na economia institucional e na abordagem coevolucion??ria. Os dois epis??dios estudados s??o a mudan??a de legisla????o relativa ?? propriedade intelectual do software, materializada na Lei do Software de 1998, e a desonera????o da folha de pagamento de empresas de software e servi??os, que entrou em vigor em 2011. Para buscar informa????es que permitissem compreender como empresas e associa????es empresariais participaram desses movimentos de mudan??a institucional, realizaram-se entrevistas com empres??rios, dirigentes e ex-dirigentes de associa????es empresariais setoriais, integrantes da Secretaria de Pol??tica de Inform??tica e um integrante do Poder Legislativo. Al??m disso, foram selecionados e analisados centenas de documentos com dados sobre as trajet??rias de mudan??a institucional, de diversas fontes, como sites de not??cias especializados na cobertura de temas da ind??stria de inform??tica, registros de sess??es do Congresso Nacional e estudos elaborados ou encomendados por associa????es empresariais. A an??lise das entrevistas e documentos revelou que as associa????es empresariais s??o usadas pelas empresas para influenciarem os Poderes Executivo e Legislativo, bem como outros atores do campo organizacional, visando ?? promo????o de mudan??as institucionais formais que atendam a seus interesses. Trata-se de processo eminentemente coletivo, seja pelo protagonismo de associa????es empresariais, seja pela necessidade de constru????o de alian??as com outros atores. A pesquisa revelou que o empreendedorismo institucional, nos dois casos estudados, ?? protagonizado por atores que contam com mais recursos e se encontram no centro de seu campo organizacional, buscando produzir um cen??rio de homogeneidade institucional, seja pela implanta????o de um projeto de harmoniza????o institucional com alcance global, seja por uma iniciativa de mimetismo institucional. Dessa forma, este estudo contribui para o entendimento do papel de coletivos, como associa????es empresariais, em movimentos de mudan??a institucional. O trabalho se encerra com a exposi????o de algumas sugest??es de pesquisas futuras, como a compara????o da evolu????o da regula????o sobre propriedade intelectual de software em diferentes pa??ses e o acompanhamento da evolu????o da forma da tributa????o de empresas de software no Brasil ap??s o t??rmino do per??odo de vig??ncia da legisla????o em vigor. This study {{investigates the}} mutual influence between organizations and institutions, with {{special attention to}} episodes of institutional change. Taking the software and services industry in Brazil as an empirical object, we analyse the participation of companies and sectorial business associations in two processes of institutional change with effect on this industry. The main theoretical framework {{of this research is}} the literature on institutional entrepreneurship, a theoretical perspective associated with the organizational institutionalism, but we also seek support in the institutional economics and co-evolutionary approach. The two processes studied are the change of legislation on intellectual property of software, embodied in the <b>Software</b> <b>Law</b> of 1998, and the payroll tax reduction on software and services industry, which took effect in 2011. To understand how companies and business associations participated in these processes of institutional change, we carried out interviews with managers, leaders and former leaders of sectorial business associations, members of the Department of Information Technology Policy (Sepin) and a congressman. Moreover, we selected and analysed hundreds of documents with data about the processes of institutional change, from various sources, such as specialized news sites covering topics of the computer industry, records of sessions of Congress and studies prepared or commissioned by business associations. The analysis of interviews and documents revealed that business associations are used by companies to influence the Executive and Legislative Powers, as well as other actors in the organizational field, aiming to promote formal institutional changes that meet their interests. We reached the conclusion that the two institutional changes are eminently collective processes, considering the role of business associations and the need to build alliances with other actors. The research revealed that institutional entrepreneurship, in both studied cases, is starred by actors who have more resources and are at the centre of the organizational field, seeking to produce a setting of institutional homogeneity, through the implementation of a project of institutional harmonization with global reach or an initiative of institutional mimetism. Thus, this study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} role of collectives, such as business associations, in processes of institutional change. Finally, we present some suggestions for future research, such as comparing the evolution of regulation on intellectual property of software in different countries and monitoring the evolution of the form of taxation of software companies in Brazil after the validity period of the current legislation...|$|E
