5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will <b>specialize</b> when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably <b>specialize</b> on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals <b>specialize</b> on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually <b>specialize</b> on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} <b>specialized</b> elections. A <b>specialized</b> election randomly assigns each voter to one election, freeing her {{of voting}} responsibilities in other elections.

A shortcoming of <b>specialized</b> elections is {{the increase in}} outcome variance resulting from the sampling effect. Whether or not <b>specialized</b> elections improve democratic outcomes hinges upon the tradeoff between more informed voters and greater outcome variance. Sufficient conditions are derived for the increase in information to generate an outcome nearer to that which would be chosen by a fully informed electorate. ...|$|R
