25|$|STD may refer only to {{infections that}} are causing diseases, {{or it may}} be used more loosely as a synonym for STI. Most of the time, people do not know that they are {{infected}} with an STI until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease. Moreover, the term <b>sexually</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>disease</b> is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission. For instance, meningitis is transmissible by means of sexual contact but is not labeled an STI because sexual contact is not the primary vector for the pathogens that cause meningitis. This discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means other than sexual contact. In general, an STI is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than sexual contact, but has a realistic means of transmission by sexual contact (more sophisticated means—blood transfusion, sharing of hypodermic needles—are not taken into account). Thus, one may presume that, if a person is infected with an STI, e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, HPV it was transmitted to him/her by means of sexual contact.|$|E

Methods. Study population – patients with dermatological and <b>sexually</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases.</b> Randomly selected patients were interviewed in 2004 September-October. Totally 157 patients from state and 62 from private institution were investigated. MS Office Exel and EpiInfo 6. 0 packages were used in the statistical analysis. Results. Mean age of the investigated was 42. 5 ± 1. 1 yrs. One quarter of the investigated chose health care institution, recommended by familiar or friend, only 24 % applied to specialized departments with referrals. The majority of respondents (85. 5 %) of the private institution “Medidermas” were accepted after few days of registration, 38. 2 % (p< 0. 001) of the dermatological and <b>sexually</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital were accepted after one or two weeks. 45. 2 % of the investigated in the private service were registered in the interval of 10 minutes, 43. 5 % - 15 minutes. In the state institution only 17. 8 % (p 0. 001) were registered during 10 minutes and half – 15 minutes. The respondents of “Medidermas” had a longer waiting time before acceptance to a medical doctor as compared to the state health care service (in 10 minutes 41. 9 % and 17. 3 %, p< 0. 001, respectively). 4 / 5 of the respondents of “Medidermas” had a visit to the doctor lasting 10 - 30 minutes, while 2 / 5 of patients of the state institution the visit to the doctor lasted only 10 - 15 minutes. 	The respondents in the private health care service institution were more satisfied with the interior order and keeping privacy as compared to the state health care institution. Female respondents of “Medidermas” were more satisfied with the competency of medical doctor, while male respondents were more satisfied in the state institution.

The dramatic and cynical choice for these sex workers seems to be between extreme poverty and perilous sexual encounters, both leading to high risks of premature death and low quality of life. It is an open question whether any such penalty exists in Western prostitution markets. This paper explores and tests the existence, mechanisms and location of the wage penalty for condom use on the population of streetwalking and window prostitutes in the Low Countries (Belgium and the Netherlands). The analyses are based on a dataset of sexual encounters with a prostitute reported by clients. After establishing the existence and the magnitude of unsafe sexual practices in the paid sex market, the hypothesis of a wage penalty is tested. Additionally the characteristics of sex workers and of encounters with unsafe practices are documented.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} risk factors for delayed {{diagnosis}} of uterine cervical lesions. Materials and Methods: This is a case-control study that recruited 178 women at 2 Brazilian hospitals. The cases (n = 74) were composed of women with a late diagnosis of a lesion in the uterine cervix (invasive carcinoma in any stage). The controls (n = 104) were composed of women with cervical lesions diagnosed early on (low-or high-grade intraepithelial lesions). The analysis was performed by means of logistic regression model using a hierarchical model. The socioeconomic and demographic variables were included at level I (distal). Level II (intermediate) included the personal and family antecedents and knowledge about the Papanicolaou test and human papillomavirus. Level III (proximal) encompassed the variables relating to individuals' care for their own health, gynecologic symptoms, and variables relating to access {{to the health care}} system. Results: The risk factors for late diagnosis of uterine cervical lesions were age older than 40 years (odds ratio [OR] = 10. 4; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 3 - 48. 4), not knowing the difference between the Papanicolaou test and gynecological pelvic examinations (OR, = 2. 5; 95 % CI, 1. 3 - 4. 9), not thinking that the Papanicolaou test was important (odds ratio [OR], 4. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 3 - 13. 4), and abnormal vaginal bleeding (OR, 15. 0; 95 % CI, 6. 5 - 35. 0).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the prevalence and {{risk factors for}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in a cohort of homosexually active men, with particular reference to assessing sexual transmission. DESIGN: Prevalence based on cross-sectional testing for HCV (c 100 protein) antibody in a cohort using sera stored between 1984 and 1989, and assessment of risk factors using a case-control analysis based on questionnaire data from HCV positive and negative subjects. SUBJECTS/SETTING: 1038 homosexually active men who were participating in a prospective study established to identify risk factors for AIDS. They had been recruited through private and public primary care and <b>sexually</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>disease</b> (STD) services in central Sydney. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of HCV antibody and its association with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection and other STDs, number of sexual partners, sexual practices and recreational drug use. RESULTS: Overall, 7. 6 % of subjects tested were seropositive for HCV antibody. In univariate analysis, HCV infection {{was significantly associated with}} injecting drug use (IDU) (OR = 8. 18, p < 0. 0001) and HIV infection (OR = 3. 14, p < 0. 0001) and with self reported history of syphilis (OR = 1. 88, p = 0. 016), anogenital herpes (OR = 1. 93, p = 0. 017), gonorrhoea (OR = 2. 43, p = 0. 009) and hepatitis B (OR = 1. 92, p = 0. 010). In case control analysis, similar sexual behaviours (partner numbers and practices) were reported by HCV positive and HCV negative subjects except that HCV negative subjects more frequently reported engaging than HCV positive subject in unprotected receptive anal intercourse without ejaculation (OR = 0. 61, p = 0. 034), unprotected insertive (OR = 0. 59, p = 0. 039) and receptive (OR = 0. 56, p = 0. 016) oro-anal intercourse (rimming) and insertive fisting (OR = 0. 48, p = 0. 034). In multiple logistic regression analyses, only HIV- 1 infection (OR = 3. 18, p < 0. 0001) and IDU in the previous six months (OR = 7. 24, p < 0. 0001) remained significantly associated with the presence of HCV antibody.

40|$|OBJECTIVES The overall aim of {{the project}} were to conduct {{a survey of the}} {{physical}} and mental health status of prisoners in New South Wales (NSW). A more specific aim, which is addressed in this PhD, was to analyse in detail a number of key health areas which have particular relevance to prisoner populations namely: tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, herpes simplex type 2 virus, childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and drug and alcohol use. METHODS A cross-sectional, random sample of prisoners, stratified by sex, age and Aboriginality was chosen from 27 correctional centres (24 male and 3 female) in NSW in 1996. Screening was conducted by nurses from within the correctional health system. A detailed face-to-face interview was used to collect self-reported information on a range of physical and mental health characteristics, and behavioural issues. The physical health component covered chronic illness, recent symptoms, health services utilisation, medications, and self assessed health status. Mental health issues which were covered included: suicide attempts, self-harm, prior mental illness and psychiatric medication. Standardised screening instruments were used to test for depression, hopelessness and suicidal intent. Behavioural factors sought were drug and alcohol use, gambling, and sexual abuse. Blood samples were taken to screen for a range of infectious diseases and health indicators. These included HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex type- 2 virus, rubella, chlamydia, and hepatitis (B, C, and G). A Mantoux skin test was performed to screen for tuberculosis infection. Hearing was assessed using otoacoustic emissions. RESULTS A total of 789 inmates (657 males and 132 females), including 235 Aboriginal people were screened, representing approximately 11 % of males and 40 % of females in full-time incarceration. For the key areas examined in the chapters we found: Overall health status ¡¤	Overall health status was poor compared with the NSW general population in regard to self-reported chronic illness, recent health complaints, and well-being. Hospitalisation was less frequent in male prisoners than general community males but higher in female prisoners for mental health problems compared with community females. Tuberculosis ¡¤	No previously undetected cases of tuberculosis were found; however, Mantoux positivity was higher in Aboriginal and overseas born prisoners. Viral hepatitis ¡¤	Markers for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis G were significantly more common in the NSW prisoner population than in the general community. Significant disparities were found between prisoners¡¯ self-report of past exposure to hepatitis (B and C) and their serostatus. Thirty five percent of inmates who were hepatitis C antibody positive believed that they were negative, and for hepatitis B, 72 % of positives reported they were negative. Multivariate analysis identified Aboriginality, long-term injecting, and injecting while in prison as risk factors for HBV. Risk factors for exposure to HCV were female sex, non-Aboriginality, history of childhood institutionalisation, and injecting-related behaviours. For HGV, female sex, and previous imprisonment were significant risk factors but injecting was not; being aged 25 - 39 years was associated with a decreased risk for HGV as compared to younger and older inmates. Herpes simplex virus type 2 ¡¤	The prevalence of HSV- 2 antibodies in this prisoner population was similar to that observed in NSW STD clinic attendees, and was higher in females than males. Exposure was related to: increasing age and Aboriginality for men, and higher reported number of lifetime sexual partners and the presence of hepatitis C antibodies for women. Few prisoners (1 %) reported a previous diagnosis of genital herpes. Childhood sexual abuse ¡¤	The prevalence of self-reported childhood sexual abuse was higher in females than males, and similar to that observed in clinical populations. There was an association between CSA and mental health outcomes, including a history of psychiatric treatment and suicide attempts. Male survivors of CSA {{were more likely to report}} self-harm, depression, and involvement in violent relationships. Both men and women with a history of CSA were more likely to report having a <b>sexually</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>disease</b> (STD). Females exposed to CSA were more likely to report subsequent abusive adult relationships involving physical assault, sexual assault, and verbal abuse. Drug use ¡¤	Overall, 64 % of prisoners had used illicit drugs at some time in the past with cannabis (males 56 %, females 63 %) and heroin (males 29 %, females 49 %) being the most common. Forty four percent of prisoners had a history of injecting drug use, with injecting prevalence significantly higher in females than males (64 % vs. 40 %). Half of male and female injectors had done so while in prison. Harmful or hazardous use of alcohol was associated with imprisonment for violent crimes, whereas opiate and methadone use were associated with non-violent crimes. Sixty two percent of property offenders had an injecting history. Alcohol intoxication at the time of offending was associated with imprisonment for homicides and assaults. Males were more likely than females to seek treatment in prison for drug problems. IMPLICATIONS Prisoners in NSW have a number of special health needs which are evidenced in the high levels of infectious diseases (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis G, and herpes simplex virus type 2) and exposure to factors (childhood sexual abuse and alcohol and drug use) with a clear relationship to adverse health outcomes. Prisons represent an opportunity for public health interventions to address some of the health problems identified in this study. Potentially valuable programmes include education to prevent the spread of blood borne communicable diseases and STDs, immunisation for vaccine preventable diseases such as hepatitis B, and treatment to alleviate the effects of drug use and childhood sexual abuse. In the case of prison drug use the prison environment itself presents a threat to health in that sterile injecting equipment is not available to prisoners despite evidence that injecting in prison is widespread. The challenge for prison health planners is twofold: to make maximum use of the window of opportunity to improve the health status of this group, and to provide a continuum of care between the community and prison...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} was carried out regarding sexually related factors, <b>sexually</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> (STD 2 ̆ 7 s) and infections with prostate cancer (PC) development risk. The {{review of literature}}, {{in conjunction with the}} tabulation of studies, suggested that ejaculation and circumcision may play a protective {{role in the development of}} PC and that multiple sex partners and an active sex life may play a causal role in the development of PC which may negate and counteract the protective effects of ejaculation and circumcision. HIV infection may plausibly play a function in deteriorating and compromising immune controls on carcinogenesis. Because of the coexistence of a highly active sexual lifestyle and sexual promiscuity with the growing occurence of STD 2 ̆ 7 s, their maybe a correlation with the high incidence of prostate cancer in the United States. Potential multi-institutional studies are warranted to confirm the high incidence of this neoplasm with the increasing cases of STD 2 ̆ 7 s and if in fact there is a proportional association to further elucidate the factors responsible for its high incidence. ...|$|R
40|$|Juvenescence {{constitutes}} {{period between}} infantile sexuality and sexuality of young man. Adolescence is time of discovering sexual identity, initiating new sexual behaviors and involving into intimate relationships. During this period, {{the forms of}} sexual activity are developing from less {{to more and more}} mature – from masturbation, through petting to sexual initiation. Decision of a first sexual intercourse is an important act for every person. Nevertheless, sexual initiation which is precocious, in a stage of unformed identity, can disturb psychosexual functioning of an individual causing unplanned pregnancies, leading to <b>sexually</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> and initiating risky sexual behaviors. The causes of starting precocious sexual activity are associated with improper models of upbringing (strictness or lack of interference) as well as with distancing of youth from pedagogical or educational influences of school or church. These traditional socializing agendas are replaced with media influences and behavior patterns providing by peers. It seems that only complex acts from pedagogical and socializing backgrounds can contribute starting responsible behaviors of youth in sexual field. 117118710 Kultura-Społeczeństwo-Edukacj...|$|R
40|$|Aim: <b>Sexually</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> such as Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes or induces incurable often fatal infections {{have been}} {{transmitted}} through Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART). This {{study is to}} determine the seroprevalence of HBV among infertile women recruited for intrauterine insemination (I. U. I). Methodology and Results: A 5 mL of blood was collected and serum aspirated. The detection of HBV was carried out using global one-step rapid test kit relative sensitivity of 99 % and specific of 97 %. Age range of infertile women was 20 – 49 years. Approximately 30 (5. 9 %) out of the 512 recruited women were seropositive for HBV with increase in prevalence rate among age group of (25 – 29 years) and (30 – 34 years). The rate of infection of HBV was found to be insignificant in this study using chi-square statistical analysis (p > 0. 0001). Conclusion, Significance and Impact of Study: Though the rate of the virus infection were statistically insignificant but the screening should be a continuous exercise and be carried out by all fertility center...|$|R
40|$|An acute {{hepatitis}} C infection was diagnosed in three HIV-positive gay men, aged 43, 48 and 30 years, respectively. In all three, unprotected sexual intercourse and fisting was a universal {{risk factor for}} the infection. They all denied having used drugs intravenously, {{which is the most}} common risk factor. The third man had a documented proctitis (lymphogranuloma venereum) at the time when the HCV transmission must have taken place. No serious complications occurred during the acute HCV infection. Because the infection did not resolve spontaneously after a few months, all three men were treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Recently, the number of cases of acute HCV infection has been seen to increase in The Netherlands. This may be due primarily to an increase in unprotected sexual intercourse and fisting. This hypothesis is supported by a documented increased prevalence of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> among gay men in The Netherlands. As acute infections may turn into chronic infections, treatment of an acute infection should be considered in order to prevent the chronic diseas...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} {{to a better understanding of}} the forms of acquisition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Brazil, with special emphasis on sexual transmission, we determined the presence of HCV infection in regular partners and in non-sexual home communicants of blood donors seen at Fundação Pró-Sangue Hemocentro de São Paulo from January 1992 to July 1996. Of 154 blood donors with HCV infection (index cases), 111 had had regular partners for at least 6 months. Sixty-eight of 111 partners were evaluated for HCV infection. Of these, 8 (11. 76 %) were considered to have current or previous HCV infection; a history of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> and index cases with a positive HCV-RNA test were more prevalent among partners with HCV infection. Of the 68 index cases whose partners were studied, 56 had non-sexual home communicants. Of the total of 81 home communicants, 66 accepted to be evaluated for HCV infection. None of them was HCV-positive, suggesting that the high prevalence of HCV infection among partners may be attributed at least partially to sexual transmission...|$|R
