Use coated fabric for more effective cake release {{and have a}} longer-lasting cloth media due to solid binding filter cloth. Both the discharge roll speed and drum speed must be the same. Adjust the <b>scraper</b> <b>knife</b> to leave a significant heal on discharge roll to produce a continuous cake transfer.|$|E
5000|$|Chisels, <b>scrapers,</b> <b>knives,</b> awls, and {{sandstones}} to {{keep the}} tools sharp were important additional components of a woodcarver's tool chest.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{rooms are}} {{partially}} destroyed; ceilings still preserved the original wooden structure, inside were found some stone {{tools such as}} <b>scrapers,</b> <b>knives,</b> grindstones, fragments of pottery and other objects {{which could not be}} identified. There were many olotes found, evidence of corn consumptions and storage.|$|R
50|$|More complex {{forms of}} {{reduction}} include {{the production of}} highly standardized blades, which can then be fashioned {{into a variety of}} tools such as <b>scrapers,</b> <b>knives,</b> sickles and microliths. In general terms, chipped stone tools are nearly ubiquitous in all pre-metal-using societies because they are easily manufactured, the tool stone is usually plentiful, and they are easy to transport and sharpen.|$|R
50|$|Tradesman work areas, campfire {{pits and}} other fragmentary {{evidence}} {{of life in}} these groups {{have been found in}} the Turrialba valley and in various spots around Guanacaste. The manufacturing of specialized tools for various activities continued, and artifacts from this era such as <b>scrapers,</b> <b>knives</b> and spear tips display differences in form and size relative to those of the mega-fauna hunters.|$|R
50|$|The Southern Pomo and Southern Wappo peoples {{inhabited}} {{these lands}} in prehistoric times. No full-scale villages {{have been discovered}} within the park boundaries. This site was valuable to the Native American tribes {{as a source of}} obsidian, which they used to make <b>scrapers,</b> <b>knives,</b> arrowheads, and spearheads. Archaeological evidence suggests they used the area as a quarry at least as far back as 3000 years. Human use and settlement of this area changed markedly in the late 18th century when the Spanish came to this region. Cattle ranching and farming gradually replaced the prehistoric tribal hunting and gathering.|$|R
5|$|Flint <b>scrapers,</b> <b>knives</b> {{and other}} {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated {{that there may have been}} a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|R
50|$|Associated faunal {{studies suggest}} that the people making the Aterian {{exploited}} coastal resources as well as engaging in hunting. It has so far been difficult to estimate whether Aterian populations further inland were exploiting freshwater resources as well. Studies have suggested that hafting was widespread, perhaps to maintain flexibility in the face of strongly seasonal environment with a pronounced dry season. <b>Scrapers,</b> <b>knives</b> and points all seem to have been hafted, suggesting a wide range of activities were facilitated by technological advances. It is probably that plant resources were also exploited. Although there is no direct evidence from the Aterian yet, plant processing is evidenced in North Africa from as much as 182,000 years ago.|$|R
50|$|The pottery is thick-walled, egg-shaped, both round- and pointed-bottomed. It {{is heavily}} ornamented with comb stamp designs, {{vertical}} and horizontal zigzags, sloping rows, braids, triangles, banded comb meshes. The instruments for work include <b>scrapers,</b> sharpeners, <b>knives,</b> leaf-shaped and semi-rhombic arrowheads, chisels and adzes, weights.|$|R
50|$|The site {{is said to}} be circa 7500-8500 years old. The site's {{main feature}} is the large floor of {{limestone}} slabs on top of a shell midden (rubbish dump). The floor is unique for this period and is also the earliest known structural evidence in England for the extensive use of Portland Jurassic limestone on a living site. Other features on the site include the remains of a low wall, four hearths, a cooking pit. A ritual feature incorporated into the floor consisted of a sub-triangular stone with a large beach cobble next to it. Vast quantities of stone tools and the debris created during their production have been found on the site. The most common tools are microliths, <b>scrapers,</b> <b>knives,</b> chopping tools, pounders and picks. Pierced shell beads have also been found.|$|R
5000|$|The lithical {{artefacts}} unconvered {{are very}} similar in character to those found at El Abra and Tequendama and consist of tools mainly made of chert from the Guadalupe Group. The tools comprise various kinds of <b>scrapers,</b> <b>knives,</b> perforating tools, burins, spokeshaves, maceheads and round mortars and flat milling stones. Most of the artefacts originate from the nearby chert, with some tools made from shales of the Villeta Formation and more allochtonous basalt tools, coming from farther west, around the Magdalena River, provenance of the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. Apart from tools, Aguazuque is characterised by {{a large percentage of}} flakes resulting from the lithic reduction; the process of elaboration of the tools; in total 3868 samples, between 60 and 70 % of the lithic fragments found were of this type.|$|R
50|$|The area {{surrounding}} Hovenweep supplied {{a number}} of materials to support the Hovenweep people's lifestyle. Trees were used for building materials and fires. Baskets were sealed with piñon sap. Clothing and sandals were made from juniper bark. Tools, such as projectile points for hunting, <b>scrapers</b> and <b>knives</b> were made from quartz stones.|$|R
50|$|This tool {{is known}} {{by a variety}} of names, {{including}} dough scraper, dough cutter, dough knife, pastry cutter, bench scraper, board <b>scraper,</b> and bench <b>knife.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{excavation}} of Fell’s cave in 1936 yielded 511 artefacts. These included hafted implements, <b>knives,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> bolas, {{a couple of}} circular rubbing stones, and bone tools.|$|R
50|$|The Checua {{site has}} been divided into nine stratigraphical units of sands and clays. More than 1750 lithic tools {{have been found}} in the units, with a highest {{frequency}} in units 4 and 5b. They mostly consist of <b>scrapers</b> and <b>knives.</b> Furthermore, 2820 stone flakes, interpreted as materials to build tools have been discovered, with a highest frequency in unit 8.|$|R
50|$|Krotov culture, {{along with}} Elunin, Loginov and similar {{cultures}} constituted {{one component of}} the Seima-Turbino Phenomenon. The tribes of the Krotov circle cultures were located in the Altai area steppes, forest-steppes and foothills; they were metallurgists and pastoral animal breeders. They developed entirely new designs of socketed weapons, and art images that included horses, oxen, sheep, camels, and more. The other component was located {{in the area of}} the Sayan highlands, where lived populations of the southern zone of East Siberian taiga hunters and fishermen. They belonged to the Glazkov, Shiver, and other cultures around the Baikal and Angara River basin, who mastered bronze casting and the manufacture of flint, jade and bone implements, and produced twin blade <b>knives,</b> <b>scraper</b> <b>knives,</b> and saws; their imagery had snakes, elk, bear, and more. The organic fusion of the Altai and Sayan components into a single culture is thought to have occurred in the steppe foothills between the Ob and Irtysh rivers.|$|R
50|$|Main {{activity}} - {{hunting and}} fishing. Dwellings - columnar construction - ground, oval shape. The arrowheads, <b>knives,</b> <b>scrapers</b> from flint and quartzite. Flat-bottomed pottery modeled {{with a mixture}} of wood and seashells.|$|R
50|$|Taltheilei {{economy was}} based on barren-ground caribou. For hunting, Taltheilei made very {{distinctive}} spear and arrow points, some of which changed over time. Their tools included awls, adze bits, <b>knives,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> stone drills, whetstones.|$|R
50|$|This method {{provides}} {{much greater}} control over {{the size and shape}} of the final flake which would then be employed as a <b>scraper</b> or <b>knife</b> although the technique could also be adapted to produce projectile points known as Levallois points. Scientists consider the Levallois complex to be a Mode3 technology, as a result of its diachronic variability. This is one level superior to the Acheulean complex of the Lower Paleolithic.|$|R
5000|$|The {{promontory}} of Pachino {{was formed}} during the Cretaceous more than 70 million years ago. It {{seems that the}} Promontorium Pachyni was inhabited from the earliest Prehistoric Times, although these attendances are not many testimonials: about 10,000 years ago the cave was inhabited Corruggi, in which were discovered numerous archaeological finds, are largely preserved at the Regional Archaeological Museum of Paolo Orsi in Syracuse. These <b>scrapers,</b> <b>knives,</b> spears, awls, needles and other objects of everyday use. From the caves of Corruggi and Fico, during the Neolithic Period, (between 8000 and 1500 BC), a man went {{to live in the}} caves (one of the best known of this area is the Grotte Calafarina). Later, in the Iron, copper and bronze, until the arrival of the Sicilians, the cliff dwellings were moved to the nearby area called [...] "Cugni of Calafarina". Hence arose the village and the cemetery, a dolmen for the deceased and an underground oven for metalworking, whose remains were brought to light by Paolo Orsi, are still well preserved and quite visible today.|$|R
50|$|In 1969 {{there was}} a second dig {{organized}} at Cueva Fell but it was focused in a slightly different location of the cave. During this excavation 415 artifacts were found; various points, <b>knives,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> cores, bolas, and bone tools.|$|R
50|$|Population density further {{increased}} {{during the}} Middle Archaic period (4500-2000 BC). Ground and polished stone tools and ornaments, {{and a variety}} of specialized chipped-stone notched points and <b>knives,</b> <b>scrapers</b> and drills were found on sites at Cuyahoga, Rocky River, Chippewa Creek, Tinker's, and Griswold Creek.|$|R
50|$|Stone-age {{tools of}} flint, {{in the shape}} of blades, arrows and axes have been found in the area. The {{excavations}} made in 1890 revealed weapons of worked stones were found near the village, including carved polished flint stones, each shaped <b>knife,</b> <b>scraper</b> and other axe-shaped.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to projectile points, other stone tools found at Apishapa sites include <b>knives,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> gravers, choppers, axes and drills. [...] Manos and metates {{were used for}} food preparation. Bones artifacts, such as awls, yucca and rabbit fur cordage and woven matting were also found.|$|R
6000|$|Scientific {{men have}} named him Eoanthropus, the Dawn Man. He stands {{apart from his}} kindred; a very {{different}} being either from the Heidelberg creature or from any living ape. No other vestige like him is known. But the gravels and deposits of from one hundred thousand years onward are increasingly rich in implements of flint and similar stone. And these implements are no longer rude [...] "Eoliths." [...] The archæologists are presently able to distinguish <b>scrapers,</b> borers, <b>knives,</b> darts, throwing stones and hand axes ....|$|R
50|$|In 1973 {{more than}} 200 Indian {{artifacts}} were discovered on the base. Arrowheads, flint <b>knives,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> and other ancient tools {{estimated to be}} more than 8,000 years old were unearthed by archaeologists. Their presence suggests that the area may have been a trading or supply post for Native Americans.|$|R
2500|$|The Dalton zone, {{shown as}} Zone D in the {{photograph}} of the stratigraphic zones, represents a transitional Paleo-Indian culture of Alabama with specimens dated to approximately 7000 BCE based on radiocarbon dating. The artifacts found in this complex are typical of mobile hunter-gatherers. [...] The Dalton occupation was remarkable in its intensity with over 150 projectile points, in addition to Paleo-Indian uniface tools such as <b>scrapers</b> and <b>knives,</b> found during the 1961 survey season. The projectile points include both Paleo-Indian (lanceolate Dalton points) and Archaic (side-notched Big Sandy points) specimens.|$|R
50|$|From about 1700 to the 1870s, Comanche, Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, Kickapoo and Kiowa {{roamed the}} county. These tribes settled in rockshelters {{in the river}} and creek valleys, leaving behind {{artifacts}} and caches of seeds, implements, burial sites, and petroglyphs, river shells, turkey and deer bones, flint <b>knives,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> and points.|$|R
50|$|Another {{improvement}} is applied at the regeneration stage when the residual filter cake is removed by back-flushing the clean plant water {{to wash the}} internal ceramic filter. Filter cake dewatering of ceramic filters produces low final cake moistures at minimum operation and maintenance costs. The residuals moisture are removed from the filter cake due to capillary action within the ceramic elements, which rotate above the slurry level. This process gives maximum filtration, and the final cake can be maintained at the lowest moisture content due to the effective cleaning of both ceramic sectors. In addition, performance can be optimized by using an ultrasonic cleaning system to achieve efficient operation conditions for regeneration of plates. The use of filtrate in looped water cycle in the design operation can reduce the water consumption up to 30-50%. High filtrate purity can be obtained, as there is only 0.001-0.005 g/l solids in the filtrate produced from this process. This eventually results in the reduction of polymer flocculant consumption in thickeners.Ceramic <b>scraper</b> <b>knives</b> have been introduced to this design as {{they are able to}} shave through the mass formed in filter cake dewatering. The remaining layer of solid residue on the filter provides protection from mechanical abrasion. Therefore, the maintenance costs can be reduced while the service life of the ceramic filter increases.|$|R
5000|$|... ==It is a quarry== Chivateros was {{initially}} {{defined as a}} gigantic lithic workshop of the Paleolithic. They identified these lithic pieces, made of quartzite, like <b>knives,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> arrowheads and hand axes. Moreover, they established a factual differentiation between what they called Chivateros I and Chivateros II, establishing equivalents in other points of America.|$|R
50|$|Current {{estimates}} put {{the beginning}} of the San Luis Rey Complex at around AD 500-1000. The primary traits that distinguish this complex from the locally preceding San Dieguito, La Jolla, and Pauma complexes are the presence of small projectile points (indicative of use of the bow and arrow), pottery, and the practice of cremation. Other San Luis Rey Complex lithic tools include mortars and metates (both bedrock and portable), pestles and manos, flaked edge tools (<b>scrapers</b> and <b>knives),</b> hammers, drills, steatite arrow straighteners, pendants, beads, and quartz crystals. Shell ornaments and bone tools are also present. Red and black geometrical pictographs were painted.|$|R
