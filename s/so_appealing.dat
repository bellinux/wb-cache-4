5|$|Several journalists {{hypothesized}} that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was <b>so</b> <b>appealing</b> because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks and whites. The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won {{a whole generation of}} new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|Just {{what is it}} {{that makes}} today's homes so different, <b>so</b> <b>appealing?</b> was created in 1956 for the {{catalogue}} of the This Is Tomorrow exhibition in London, England in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit. Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1969 when Biba {{moved to}} its first upscale store {{on the north side}} of Kensington High Street, across from where they would later open up their {{department}} store, there was a radical change in that the clothes became more expensive and the Biba styles then appeared to be designed for more sophisticated and richer young women in their 20s. The Kensington High Street store also lost the cozy boudoir look of its predecessor, which had been <b>so</b> <b>appealing</b> to its teenage customers, and took on the more sophisticated look of the upscale Kensington/Knightsbridge designer stores.|$|E
25|$|In other words, by {{appealing}} to the Platonic distinction between the material and the ideal, Paul showed how the spirit of Christ could provide all people a way to worship God — the God who had previously been worshipped only by Jews, although Jews claimed {{that he was the}} one and only God of all. Boyarin roots Paul's work in Hellenistic Judaism and insists that Paul was thoroughly Jewish. But, Boyarin argues, Pauline theology made his version of Christianity <b>so</b> <b>appealing</b> to Gentiles. Nevertheless, Boyarin also sees this Platonic reworking of both Jesus's teachings and Pharisaic Judaism as essential to the emergence of Christianity as a distinct religion, because it justified a Judaism without Jewish law (see also New Covenant).|$|E

25|$|The two eland {{species are}} now semi-domesticated as their docile dispositions, large {{quantities}} of meat, and resilience in Africa's harsh environments has made them ideal alternatives to cattle in some parts in Africa. In a 2014 comparison between the quality of meat from common eland and cattle, {{it was found that}} the meat from male elands was low-fat and more beneficial for human nutritional health but it lacks the sensory texture and flavor that makes cattle meat <b>so</b> <b>appealing</b> to consumers. In addition to being on farm as exotic lifestock, eland as well as the other species of spiral-horned antelope have also been brought to private game reserves across the planet (in particular parts in North America and Africa) for recreational hunting. Unlike eland however, most of the other species are not as docile or tolerant of humans as they avoid any contact as possible.|$|E

500|$|Cooney's study, titled [...] "Television for Preschool Education", {{spelled out}} how {{television}} {{could be used}} to help young children, especially from low-income families, prepare for school.

500|$|Other orchestral works include Overture, Elegy and Rondo (1927) – a {{lightweight}} piece, according to Grove.

500|$|Another major {{characteristic}} of Winesburg, Ohio that separates its style from Anderson's contemporaries, {{as well as}} his previous novels, is the minimal role of plot. According to critic David Stouk's article [...] "Anderson's Expressionist Art", [...] "As an expressionist drama, there is little development of a story line in the Winesburg tales in term of cause and effect." [...] Indeed, it is this de-emphasis of traditional story elements in lieu of experimentation with language that provides both a link and a rift between Winesburg, Ohio and the novels of the following decades; whereas the simple, stripped-down vernacular that Gertrude Stein found <b>so</b> <b>appealing</b> in Anderson's writing of the time became an exemplar of quintessential American style most famously associated with Ernest Hemingway, the expressionistic portrayal of emotional states in Winesburg, Ohio was later, by some critics, considered [...] "undisciplined" [...] and [...] "vague".|$|E
500|$|Once {{illustrations}} {{were approved}} for the book, Tolkien proposed colour plates as well. The publisher would not relent on this, so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition {{to be published}} about six months later.

500|$|... “The Princess and the Pea” spurred on {{positive}} criticism, as well. In fact, critic Paul Hazard {{pointed out}} the realistic aspects of the fairy tale that make it easily relatable to all people. He believed that [...] "the world Andersen witnessed—which encompassed sorrow, death, evil, and man's follies—is reflected in his tales," [...] and most evidently in [...] "The Princess and the Pea." [...] Another scholar, Niels Kofoed, noticed that “since they involve everyday-life themes of love, death, nature, injustice, suffering, and poverty, they appeal to all races, ideologies, classes, and genders.” Moreover, Celia Catlett Anderson realized {{that one of the}} things that makes this story <b>so</b> <b>appealing</b> and relatable is that optimism prevails over pessimism, especially for the main character of the princess.

500|$|Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Phillip Stead {{thought that}} Fleming [...] "continues uninhibitedly to deploy his story-telling talents {{within the limits}} of the Commander Bond formula." [...] Stead saw that the {{hijacking}} of the two bombs [...] "gives Bond some anxiety but, needless to say, does not prevent him from having a good deal of fun in luxury surroundings", whilst [...] "the usual beatings-up, modern style, are ingeniously administered to lady and gentleman like". As to why the novels were <b>so</b> <b>appealing,</b> Stead considered that [...] "Mr. Fleming's special magic lies in his power to impart sophistication to his mighty nonsense; his fantasies connect with up-to-date and lively knowledge of places and of the general sphere of crime and espionage." [...] Overall, in Stead's opinion, with Thunderball [...] "the mixture, exotic as ever, generates an extravagant and exhilarating tale and Bond connoisseurs will be glad to have it." [...] The critic for The Times wrote that Thunderball [...] "relies for its kicks far less than did Dr. No or Goldfinger on sadism and a slightly condescending sophistication." [...] The upshot, in the critic's opinion, was that [...] "the mixture—of good living, sex and violent action—is as before, but this is a highly polished performance, with an ingenious plot well documented and plenty of excitement." ...|$|E
