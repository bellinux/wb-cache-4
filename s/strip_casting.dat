40|$|While {{magnesium}} alloys {{are routinely}} used in engineering {{applications in the}} form of net shape castings, applications for sheet product have been limited due to the poor cold formability of magnesium combined with the perceived expense of sheet. The issues associated with poor cold formability could largely be overcome if magnesium alloys were to be superplastically formed. Superplasticity in magnesium is well established with research papers on the subject dating back to the late 1960 s. In recent years, interest in this area has grown to the point where a number of companies have successfully superplastically formed prototype automotive panels from magnesium alloy sheet. Concurrent to this the scientific community have demonstrated superplasticity {{in a wide range of}} magnesium alloys using processing techniques ranging from the exotic (severe plastic deformation) to the mundane (traditional warm rolling). Work by the current authors has shown, rather surprisingly, that superplasticity can be achieved in magnesium alloys in the as-cast condition. This has led to some initial exploratory work involving twin roll casting. The concept being that affordable superplastic magnesium sheet could be produced via twin roll casting with only limited rolling reduction to final gauge. This paper describes the superplastic behaviour (in uniaxial tension) and microstructure of sheet processed from <b>strip</b> <b>cast</b> AZ 31 and AZ 91. The experimental material has included <b>strip</b> <b>cast</b> AZ 91 subjected to large shear strains immediately prior to casting. The material was tested in the as-cast condition and after warm rolling to a number of gauges. Industrially useful superplastic capability was demonstrated in the <b>strip</b> <b>cast</b> alloys. Furthermore, good superplastic capability was also demonstrated in sheet subsequently rolled from the cast metal and rolling strain did not significantly influence the ductilities obtained. The mechanism for achieving superplasticity in as-cast magnesium alloys will be considered and the contrasting deformation characteristics of AZ 31 and AZ 91 will be discussed in terms of m value analysis and microstructural characterisation...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{propensity}} to dynamically recrystallise, superplastic behaviour {{can be obtained}} from magnesium alloys considerably more easily than from comparable aluminium alloys. In some cases even as cast magnesium alloys can exhibit reasonable superplasticity and there appears no need for the special alloying additions or complex thermomechanical treatments required by aluminium alloys such as AA 2004 or AA 7475. The paper describes the superplastic behaviour (in uniaxial tension) and microstructure of sheet processed from <b>strip</b> <b>cast</b> magnesium alloys.

Results are also included on the superplastic behaviour of die cast AZ 31 and AZ 91 in both as-cast and cast and rolled conditions. Despite both alloys demonstrating superplastic behaviour there were significant differences in their deformation characteristics as defined by their respective strain rate sensitivities.

The effect of Nb microalloying was significant, and this is attributable to the promotion of finer, tougher austenite transformation products such as bainite and acicular ferrite at the expense of large polygonal ferrite grains. A fine dispersion of Nb solute clusters was observed in all Nb-containing steels following hot rolling, and it is suggested that this also contributes to the observed strengthening...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigated}} the dendrite structures and the as-cast textures of low-carbon steel <b>strips</b> <b>cast</b> at different cooling rates {{in order to}} relate the δ-ferrite dendrite structure with the ferrite phase texture. Observations revealed that the orientation intensity of the texture component { 111 } was stronger than the texture component { 001 } in the as-cast steel strips obtained at different solidification cooling rates. These two texture components show a roof-shaped variation with the gradual decrease of the solidification cooling rate, reaching a maximum intensity at a cooling rate of about 2. 0 K/s. This suggests that the solidification rate strongly influences the as-cast texture of low-carbon steel strips through changing the δ-ferrite dendrite structure. 1...|$|R
