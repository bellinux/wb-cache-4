50|$|A <b>scleroscope</b> is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} rebound hardness. It {{consists}} of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height. The device was invented in the early 1900s. As an improvement on this rough method, the Leeb Rebound Hardness Test, invented in the 1970s, uses the ratio of impact and rebound velocities (as measured by a magnetic inducer) to determine hardness.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the dynamic}} Leeb principle, {{hardness}} value {{is derived from}} the energy loss of a defined impact body after impacting on a metal sample, similar to the Shore <b>scleroscope.</b> The Leeb quotient (vi,vr) is taken as a measure of the energy loss by plastic deformation: the impact body rebounds faster from harder test samples than it does from softer ones, resulting in a greater value 1000×vr/vi. A magnetic impact body permits the velocity to be deduced from the voltage induced by the body as it moves through the measuring coil. The quotient 1000×vr/vi is quoted in the Leeb rebound hardness unit HL.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we use fuzzy linear {{regression}} analysis and fuzzy similarity to investigate the relation of various hardness scales to tensile strength of materials. We examine {{the relation of the}} Vickers, Brinell, Rockwell C and Shore <b>Scleroscope</b> hardness scales with tensile strength in a common measurement range. The fuzzy regression models that result show the existence of a linear relation. Further analysis of the resulting models with fuzzy similarity results indicates strong similarities between models of different hardness scales. The results indicate that this similarity of the fuzzy regression reflects the underling similarity of the physical quantities of materials that are measured on the different hardness scales. A comparison with conventional linear regression analysis shows that the ambiguities of the model are better reflected in the case of fuzzy regression models...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{hardness}} of coal was estimated using a Shore <b>Scleroscope</b> Rebound Hardness (SSRH) tester. SSRH {{can be related}} to fracture toughness and strength, and was trialled as a quick field test to illustrate variability in these properties for coal seam gas reservoirs. Therefore, samples were selected to include different coal ranks and lithotypes from a suite of boreholes that intersect Permian coal seams within the Bowen Basin in Queensland, Australia. The tests were conducted unconfined on slabbed coal core and confined on epoxy encased coal blocks used for coal petrographic examination. The test results of the unconfined samples show that the hardness varies with lithotype. It increases with decreasing amount of bright bands, moreso than coal rank or thermal maturity. The test results of the confined samples show little variation with lithotype, but show a parabolic correlation of hardness with rank, similar to the behaviour found with Hardgrove Grindability tests. The resulting fractures of the SSRH test were analysed under the microscope to understand the fracture pattern, which can be scaled up to understand fracture propagation in natural systems and when induced in gas reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{prediction}} {{models for}} partial face mechanical excavators, when developed in laboratory conditions, depend on relating {{the results of}} a set of rock property tests and indices to specific cutting energy (SE) for various rock types. There exist some studies in the literature aiming to correlate the geotechnical properties of intact rocks with the SE, especially for massive and widely jointed rock environments. However, those including direct and/or indirect measures of rock fracture parameters such as rock brittleness and fracture toughness, along with the other rock parameters expressing different aspects of rock behavior under drag tools (picks), are rather limited. With this study, it was aimed to investigate the relationships between the indirect measures of rock brittleness and fracture toughness and the SE depending on {{the results of a}} new and two previous linear rock cutting programmes. Relationships between the SE, rock strength parameters, and the rock index tests have also been investigated in this study. Sandstone samples taken from the different fields around Ankara, Turkey were used in the new testing programme. Detailed mineralogical analyses, petrographic studies, and rock mechanics and rock cutting tests were performed on these selected sandstone specimens. The assessment of rock cuttability was based on the SE. Three different brittleness indices (B 1, B 2, and B 4) were calculated for sandstones samples, whereas a toughness index (T-i), being developed by Atkinson et al. (1), was employed to represent the indirect rock fracture toughness. The relationships between the SE and the large amounts of new data obtained from the mineralogical analyses, petrographic studies, rock mechanics, and linear rock cutting tests were evaluated by using bivariate correlation and curve fitting techniques, variance analysis, and Student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test. Rock cutting and rock property testing data that came from well-known studies of McFeat-Smith and Fowell(2) and Roxborough and Philips(3) have also been employed in statistical analyses together with the new data. Laboratory tests and subsequent analyses revealed that there were close correlations between the SE and B 4 whereas no statistically significant correlation has been found between the SE and T-i. Uniaxial compressive and Brazilian tensile strengths and Shore <b>scleroscope</b> hardness of sandstones also exhibited strong relationships with the SE. NCB cone indenter test had the greatest influence on the SE among the other engineering properties of rocks, confirming the previous studies in rock cutting and mechanical excavation. Therefore, it was recommended to employ easy-to-use index tests of NCB cone indenter and Shore <b>scleroscope</b> in the estimation of laboratory SE of sandstones ranging from very low to high strengths {{in the absence of a}} rock cutting rig to measure it until the easy-to-use universal measures of the rock brittleness and especially the rock fracture toughness, being an intrinsic rock property, are developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of rock material properties i a critical element in any site investigation for {{the planning and}} construction of a tunnel through rock strata. This is irrespective {{of the number of}} rock strata involved and crucial to the determination f ground reference conditions as detailed in CIRIA Report No. 79 (1978). An extensive suite of laboratory tests is combined with a comprehensive literature search in order to investigate the inter-relationships between some commonly cited rock parameters. The suite includes Shore <b>Scleroscope</b> Rebound Values and results from a modified form of the Cerchar Abrasivity Test. In addition, the benefits from mineralogical analyses of rock samples are considered. Rock material strength and hardness, with regard to common tunnel excavation techniques i found to be a combination of shear and tensile strength and can respectively be designated as cutting strength and abrasivity. An overall classification system is proposed which incorporates these parameters into an unambiguous notation in order to clarify test data and facilitate interpretation. By an appraisal of each testing technique in respect of relative costs and applicability to rock failure under machine xcavation forces an incremental pproach for rock testing programme is censtructed {{in the form of a}} flow chart. The model proposes how the efficiency of current test programmes can be improved thus enabling more confident predictions of materia ",zroperties in single or multi-strata ground along a proposed tunnel route...|$|E
