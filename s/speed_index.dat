In addition to the year end awards, there are three lifetime awards - Race Register of Merit, Superior Race Horse and Supreme Race Horse. A Register of Merit is awarded when a horse attains a <b>speed</b> <b>index</b> of 80 or above. A Superior Race Horse is achieved when the horse earns 200 racing points. A Supreme Race Horse award requires the horse to satisfy the following three criteria - 1) win over $500,000.00 in earnings, 2) win two Grade 1 stakes races and 3) win a total of ten races.|$|E

For example, it is now recognized that individual power and peak frequency attributes of alpha band rhythms predict performance on a working memory task. Additionally, investigators using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a safe and non-invasive means of stimulating the awake and alert human brain, have shown TMS can mimic long-term potentiation (LTP), widely considered the neurophysiologic substrate of memory. Based on this earlier work, we designed a combined TMS-EEG study of the effects of 10 Hz rTMS on psychomotor processing <b>speed,</b> an <b>index</b> of neural efficiency, on a well validated short-term verbal recognition memory task, the Sternberg.
