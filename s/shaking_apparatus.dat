40|$|The {{frequencies}} {{for free}} rings {{have been studied}} by many authors. But there appear few literatures which deal with the vibrations of rings considering any stiffened conditions. Present report developed experimentally the natural frequencies of circular rings subjected to radial load sets. Forty-six steel rings were investigated; whose rim cross sections were rectangular; ratio of rim thickness to radius of curvature of center line of rim h/r 0. 029 ∿ 0. 128; width of rim b 8. 1 ∿ 100. 0 mm. These samples were stressed in tension subjected to radial two or three loads and were vibrated by <b>shaking</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Then their natural frequencies of rings were measured. Increasing tension loads, the natural frequencies of rings were larger and larger. So the relationship between tension loads and the natural frequencies of rings were expressed by one experimental equation...|$|E
40|$|Centrifuge {{model test}} {{is one of}} the most {{remarkable}} topics in recentgeotechnical engineering. The same stress field can be achieved in the modelground under centrifugal condition as that in real ground or soil structure athomologous points. Therefore, the performance of model test in centrifuge has greatadvantage because the deformation or failure characteristics of soil much depends onthe confining pressure. In the field of soil dynamics, it is also becoming popular tomake use of centrifuge to investigate the dynamic property of soil or response ofground and structures during earthquake. In this paper, first of all, the similarity law of centrifuge model test based onthe theory of continuum for 2 -phase mixture is reviewed, secondly, the schematicaldescription about the medium size of centrifuge (radius of 2. 5 m, max centrifugalacceleration of 200 g, capacity of 24 g-ton) and <b>shaking</b> test <b>apparatus</b> are presented. From the dynamic test with the laminar box, it is found that the electro-hydraulic actuator makes it possible to produce well-controlled sinusoidal motionwith maximum shaking acceleration more than 10 g, under centrifugal acceleration of 50 g...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Earthquake induced {{liquefaction}} in saturated granular soils is {{an important}} phenomenon causing severe damages. In order to minimize the ill-effects due to liquefaction, various lab tests, field tests are being used which assess the liquefaction potential. In the present study the shake table test {{has been used for}} assessing soil liquefaction of loose saturated cohesionless sand by simulating earthquake conditions in the laboratory. The tests are conducted on <b>shake</b> table <b>apparatus,</b> with the varying range of relative density and maximum acceleration. This paper deals with the experimental investigations carried out to establish an unique criterion for initiation of liquefaction for shake table test, which best delineate with the initialization of liquefaction in clean uniform sand. It is observed that for the clean sand tested in shake table test liquefaction is observed to trigger at pore pressure ratios even {{less than or equal to}} one for loose and medium state of soil up to maximum shaking of 0. 32 g. For higher magnitude of shaking and for denser soils initiation of liquefaction is observed to take place for pore pressure ratios greater than one. Few tests are based on the field data where actual field parameters are used to prepare laboratory soil model and is observed that the criterion of the occurrence of liquefaction in the laboratory shake table model is in close agreement with actual field data...|$|R
40|$|The {{broad range}} of {{complexities}} in bioleaching includes the use of mixed microbial communities with diversity of species and strains with different windows of operating conditions. Empirical approaches to characterise these currently use cumbersome experimental systems; hence {{the need to develop}} a high throughput research tool, analogous to the techniques used in high throughput pharmaceutical research. In this study, a microwell research tool was evaluated as a growth and measurement tool for mixed autotrophic bioleaching cultures. The tool was assessed by comparing its performance to conventional <b>shake</b> flask <b>apparatus.</b> Mixed mesophilic cultures of predominantly Leptospirillum ferriphilum and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans were used. Growth and ferrous iron oxidation kinetics were quantified and assessed. Microwell plates performed similarly to conventional shake flasks with respect to growth and iron oxidation kinetics. The microwell plate apparatus was also used as a measurement system in combination with a microwell plate reader (measuring absorbance change at 428 nm over time). Progressive colour change of growth experiments correlated to ferrous iron oxidation within a defined operating window. We conclude that, using this measurement as a proxy for trends iron oxidation, the microwell research tool is well-suited for high throughput scoping studies to map operating windows for different cultures, in both an unadapted and adapted context. This was confirmed through an activity test utilising fluoride as an inhibitor. Where absorbance measurements at 428 nm are used to track oxidation progress, the research tool has limitations with respect to pH (< 2. 0) and total iron concentration (< 8. 0 g l− 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The terms "abusive head injury" and "shaken baby syndrome" {{refer to}} a unique pattern of non-accidental {{traumatic}} injury occurring in children that many clinicians and researchers {{have good reason to}} believe is caused by violent shaking. Typical injuries include subdural haemorrhage, retinal haemorrhage as well as tears to cortical bridging veins. A major paradox is that the injuries induced by a shaking event are much more severe than those caused by even violent single - impact head trauma, despite the relatively low accelerations in shaking. Infants younger than 6 months are significantly more vulnerable to the shaken baby syndrome than older infants and children, and one possible explanation is given that the softness of the infant brain and compliant skull structure allows violent motions to be set up (Cheng et al. 2005). These new mechanisms, could have an important role in explaining the basic mechanics of shaken baby syndrome. Several models of infant head have been created with the optimized anatomical detail and accurate constitutive material properties from literature. The driving input to these models is derived from data generated in our research programme at the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) (Brudenell 2000) with the theory of kinematics rigid body reconstruction. Numerical simulations are applied by using the finite element system LS-DYNA, and the consequences have been correlated with clinically observed damage in infant victims, and the brain skull boundary condition is investigated via the fluid structure interaction (FSI) method. A <b>shaking</b> testing <b>apparatus</b> has been custom designed with computer aided design methodology (CAD), and is manufactured and assembled in the workshop. The driving of the rig is able to apply stable, repetitive linear motion within the range of accuracy and magnitude of human shaking. An experimental model has been constructed and mounted on the rig with important structures consisting of brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skull and infantile membrane. The system validates the computational modelling by demonstrating the relative motion of the continuum system within the transparent skull replica. The research, as a first exploration in this area, contributes {{to the study of the}} infant abusive head injury, and is able to draw the data together in a discussion of the implications for the mechanics of the shaken baby syndrome...|$|R
