40|$|The {{influence}} of certain equilibrium flows on {{the stability of}} tearing modes in the reversed-field pinch is investigated. By solving the linearized magnetohydrodynamic equations in cylindrical geometry, the tearing mode stability factor ′ is calculated {{for a variety of}} axial flow profiles which have nonzero <b>shear</b> <b>away</b> from the rational surface, including flows localized entirely in the external, ideal region of the tearing mode. It is found that both m = 1 and m = 0 modes are destabilized by an axial flow localized {{near the edge of the}} plasma. This is the kind of flow that might be generated by any physical process creating an edge-localized radial electric field. A global flow profile with shear over the middle region of the plasma, simulating the differential rotation of core and edge modes observed in some reversed-field pinch discharges, is found to have a destabilizing effect on the m = 1 mode, while leaving the stability parameter of the m = 0 mode practically unchanged.

40|$|Microfluidic flow based {{multiplexed}} {{devices have}} gained significant promise in detecting biomarkers in complex biological samples. However, to fully exploit {{their use in}} bioanalysis, issues such as (i) low sensitivity and (ii) high levels of nonspecific adsorption of non-target species have to be overcome. Herein, we describe a new multiplexed device for the sensitive detection of multiple protein biomarkers in serum by using an alternating current (ac) electrohydrodynamics (ac-EHD) induced surface shear forces based phenomenon referred to as nanoshearing. The tunable nature (via manipulation of ac field) of these nanoshearing forces can alter the capture performance of the device (e. g., improved fluid transport enhances number of sensor-target collisions). This can also selectively displace weakly (nonspecifically) bound molecules from the electrode surface (i. e., fluid shear forces can be tuned to <b>shear</b> <b>away</b> nonspecific species present in biological samples). Using this approach, we achieved sensitive (100 fg mL- 1) naked eye detection of multiple protein targets spiked in human serum and a 1000 -fold enhancement in comparison to hydrodynamic flow based devices for biomarker detection. We believe that this approach could potentially represent a clinical diagnostic tool that can be integrated into resource-limited settings for sensitive detection of target biomarkers using naked eye...|$|E

40|$|Many hematologic {{diseases}} {{may have}} interactions with proteins and endothelium within small microvascular environments {{that are currently}} hard to understand. These effects are hard to produce in vitro, and relevant studies performed in vivo are difficult to image and evaluate at high resolutions. In order to better understand these phenomena, in vitro models with optically clear material should be developed that act as platforms for higher power imaging and analysis. Microfluidic devices made out of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) bonded to glass provide this platform and are capable of generating channels of long length (> 2. 5 cm from inlet to outlet) and of microvascular size (One goal of this thesis {{is to develop a}} new and reproducible method of seeding endothelial cells into microfluidic devices of many branching networks and small channel dimensions. To examine conditions that lead to optimal seeding, we fabricated a microfluidic device that contains five sets of binary diverging junctions; starting from an inlet of 1000 x 30 micron dimensions, the flow path splits into a total of 32 small channels of 20 x 30 micron dimensions. The total distance from inlet to outlet is 3 cm and each channel length is 0. 4 cm. We found that traditional flow-in seeding methods are not very effective for long channel networks in which the smallest size is 20 x 30 microns or less, with poor cell attachment and clogging at junctions being among the biggest hindrances to successful seeding. Taking all of these factors into account, we developed a reproducible seeding method by dynamically adjusting flow-rates during infusion and using high cell concentrations. This enabled successfully seeding and the formation of confluent layers of endothelial cells lining the inner surfaces of the channels. By utilizing high cell concentrations (3. 5 - 7. 5 million cells/mL) of young endothelial cells, we were able to reduce flow rates to allow for attachment and increase flow rates to <b>shear</b> <b>away</b> clogs at junctions and within the smallest channels. After sufficient initial coverage was generated throughout the device, the device was incubated for thirty minutes to allow for secure cell attachment and any excess aggregates within the device were then sheared away at high flow rates. This process was repeated again after a couple days to clear out any remaining aggregates. Development of the device for 3 - 4 days in an incubator with constant media flow after seeding helped the endothelial cells to grow into a confluent monolayer within the channel walls of the device. A second goal is to perform initial studies of flow of sickle cells within endothelialized channels. To test the function of the endothelium in the microfluidic device, samples of recessive HBSS sickle cell blood were allowed to flow into the channels. The flow paths taken by the cells were heavily influenced by the shape, size, and height of endothelial protrusions from the channel walls. In some of the wider channels, the effects of endothelial protrusions were so great that multiple small, enclosed flow paths formed within individual channels, resulting in the creation of flow networks within these individual channels. Finally, after extended flow periods, aggregations formed in a scattered fashion across the endothelium of larger channels that served as high-resistance buildups for further flow into the device.
