40|$|Abstract. <b>Single-electron</b> <b>transistors</b> (SET's) {{are often}} {{discussed}} as elements of nanometer scale electronic circuits {{because they can}} be made very small and they can detect the motion of individual electrons. However, SET's have low voltage gain, high output impedances, and are sensitive to random background charges. This makes it unlikely that <b>single-electron</b> <b>transistors</b> would ever replace field-effect transistors (FET's) in applications where large voltage gain or low output impedance is necessary. The most promising applications for SET's are charge-sensing applications such as the readout of few electron memories, the readout of charge-coupled devices, and precision charge measurements in metrology. 1...|$|R

The charge excess is then detected using a <b>single-electron</b> <b>transistor.</b> This method has two major difficulties.

5000|$|In quantum computing, {{a charge}} qubit is a qubit whose basis states are charge states (e.g. states which {{represent}} {{the presence or}} absence of excess Cooper pairs in the island). In superconducting quantum computing, a charge qubit is formed by a tiny superconducting island (also known as a Cooper-pair box) coupled by a Josephson junction to a superconducting reservoir (see figure). The state of the qubit is determined by the number of Cooper pairs which have tunneled across the junction. In contrast with the charge state of an atomic or molecular ion, the charge states of such an [...] "island" [...] involve a macroscopic number of conduction electrons of the island. The quantum superposition of charge states can be achieved by tuning the gate voltage U that controls the chemical potential of the island. The charge qubit is typically read-out by electrostatically coupling the island to an extremely sensitive electrometer such as the radio-frequency <b>single-electron</b> <b>transistor.</b>|$|E
