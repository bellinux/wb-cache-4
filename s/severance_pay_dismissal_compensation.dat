40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a model of {{individual}} dismissals based on the workers' right to file a suit against their employer arguing that the dismissal is unjustified or unfair. The model is a standard pre-trial bargaining game between a firm and a worker. We study two cases: when the law states the <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> for unfair <b>dismissal</b> (the European case), and when judges can decide freely on the compensation {{to be paid to}} the worker (the American case). The model provides some guidelines for Labour Law reforms. In the European case, a decrease in the <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> for unfair <b>dismissals</b> fixed by law will decrease the <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> offered by the firm, and only under some assumptions will decrease the expected firing cost and will increase the settlement probability. In addition, the transition from the European to the American case is likely to increase the probability of settlement (and to decrease it in the opposite case) with ambiguous effects on agreed <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> and expected firing costs. <b>dismissal,</b> individual <b>dismissal,</b> <b>severance</b> <b>pay,</b> firing costs, Labour Law...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} strict {{employment}} protection legislation (EPL) on unemployment is still uncertain. However, evidence in literature {{points to the}} hiring and firing provisions of EPL being the source {{of some of the}} labour market rigidity in South Africa. Hiring and firing provisions comprise a number of elements such as <b>severance</b> <b>pay,</b> <b>dismissal</b> procedures, probationary employment and temporary work arrangements. This research investigates the impact of these measures on the hiring and firing decision through a survey questionnaire distributed to approximately 20 000 small business respondents, who were also tested on the impact of EPL on small business in creating new jobs. The purpose of the research was therefore to contribute to the literature on the role which EPL plays in the hiring and firing decision, and ultimately on unemployment. The results of the research point to a still strong perception that EPL in South Africa is strict despite evidence to the contrary, and that small business respondents believe procedural elements {{play a significant role in}} their hiring and firing decision, but some uncertainty with regard to the role of <b>severance</b> <b>pay.</b> The strongest indication was the perception of the regulatory burden of EPL faced by small businesses.

30|$|For those {{unfamiliar}} with the Spanish contract regulation, until 1984, almost all labor market contracts were indefinite and entailed high <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> at <b>dismissal.</b> To introduce flexibility and hence enhance job creation, the Spanish Government introduced in 1984 the possibility to hire under temporary basis for any activity and for short periods. At expiry, the contract may be renewed (up to 3  years). The <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> of temporary contracts is very low, and this encouraged most firms to hire under temporary basis to a larger extent to avoid high <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> {{in case of a}} dismissal. This has created a dual labor market, with some workers (those with indefinite contracts) highly protected against dismissal, whereas others—those with temporary contracts—being hired under very unstable contracts. For the last three decades, the share of temporary contracts has amounted to 30  % of the salaried workforce, and hiring and firing temporary workers has been the mechanism that firms have used to adapt their workforce to economic activity. Although some labor market reforms have been implemented to try to decrease the share of temporary workers, none of them have succeeded. For more information on this contract regulation and its impacts, see Bentolila et al. (2012).|$|R

40|$|It {{has often}} been assumed {{that there is a}} {{tradeoff}} between labor market flexibility and labor protection. Following the promulgation of the Labor Contract Law in 2008, employment protection in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) changed from less restrictive than the OECD average to more restrictive than any OECD economies with respect to indicators for <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> and <b>dismissals.</b> However this change and its impact are not well recognized. Overall, labor market flexibility consists of two components. On the demand side, labor market flexibility affects employers’ decisions to hire workers. On the supply side, contrary to the common belief, improved workers’ protection could in fact also improve labor market flexibility through the labor supply. This is also rarely discussed, but could help the PRC reduce labor market rigidity. Based on a review of international experiences and the labor market situation in the PRC, this policy note provides policy recommendations on increasing macroeconomic efficiency through improving labor market flexibility without necessarily sacrificing protection for workers. In addition to strengthening job creation, supply-side government policies, such as those to help workers moderate income fluctuations (both cyclical and structural) and improve workers mobility, could help restore labor market flexibility in the PRC...|$|R

30|$|The {{underlying}} {{theory for}} our analysis is the dynamic labor demand theory. While the static labor demand theory focuses on firms’ optimal employment level, the dynamic counterpart analyzes firms’ adjustment toward the optimum {{and the time}} it takes to reach the optimal employment level which is not possible within the static theory (see Cahuc and Zylberberg, 2004, p.  212). Adjustment costs are an essential component of dynamic labor demand theory because they play an important role in firms’ adjustment behavior. These costs are the reason that a plant does not dismiss all employees before the weekend and re-hire them on Monday (see Franz, 2013, p.  146; Nickell, 1986, p.  473). Labor is not a completely variable production factor because adjustment costs form a fixed component of total labor costs. Therefore Oi (1962) calls labor a ‘quasi-fix’ factor. Adjustment costs arise from an employment change and consist of hiring costs (e.g., search, selection, first training, administrative expenses of the Human Resources Department) and costs of <b>dismissals</b> (e.g., <b>severance</b> <b>pay,</b> consideration of <b>dismissal</b> protection, administrative expenses of the Human Resources Department). Ehrenberg and Smith (2012, p.  145) consider hiring costs as investments and so they point out the ‘sunk’ character of these costs.|$|R

Compliance appears to be low, as only one-third of workers entitled to <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> report receiving it, and on average workers only collect 40 percent of the payment due to them. Eligible female and low-wage workers are least likely to report receiving payments. Widespread non-compliance is consistent with trends in employment rigidity, which remained essentially unchanged following the large increases in severance mandated by the 2003 law.

30|$|<b>Severance</b> <b>pay</b> {{is often}} {{considered}} one of the least appropriate options of income support for the unemployed, because it offers inadequate income protection and imposes large efficiency costs. On the income protection front, <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> suffers from three main weaknesses. First, the system suffers from the so-called nonperformance problem (the fact that despite legal entitlement, many workers fail to obtain benefits). 3 Second, <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> benefits are inefficient, as the same amount is paid regardless of the duration of the unemployment spell. And third, <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> reduces the access of vulnerable groups, including youth, to jobs (Blanchard 2000). On the efficiency front, there is ample evidence that <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> reduces labor market flows and thus acts as a source of “labor market sclerosis.” It therefore reduces productivity via hindering technological change (see Autor et al. 2007 for the study on the US and Bassanini et al. 2009 for OECD countries), as well as, particularly {{in the context of the}} overall stringent employment protection legislation, reduces employment levels (see Holzmann and Vodopivec 2012 for a recent review of theoretical and empirical findings).|$|R
