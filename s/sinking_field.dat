40|$|A {{suggested}} {{application of}} a thermoelectric generator is to exploit the natural temperature difference between {{the air and the}} soil to generate small amounts of electrical energy. Since the conversion efficiency of even the best thermoelectric generators available is very low, the performance of the heat sinks providing the heat flow is critical. By providing a constant heat input to various heat <b>sinks,</b> <b>field</b> tests of their thermal conductances in soil and in air were performed. A prototype device without a thermoelectric generator was constructed, buried, and monitored to experimentally measure the heat flow achievable in such a system. Theoretical considerations for design and selection of improved heat sinks are also presented.

The source/sink field (taken to be constant over a 10 -day assimilation window) and initial tracer field are analysed together by assimilating imperfect tracer observations over the window. Experiments show that useful information about the source/sink field may be determined from relatively few observations when the initial tracer field is known very accurately a-priori, even when a-priori source/sink information is biased (the source/sink a-priori is set to zero). In this case each observation provides information about the source/sink field at positions upstream and the assimilation of many observations together can reasonably determine the location and strength of a test source...|$|R

The governing boundary layer equations for fluid flow and energy are reduced into ordinary differential equations by means of a similarity transformations. Closed form exact solutions of the reduced energy equation have been obtained for both prescribed power-law surface temperature (PST) and  power-law wall heat flux (PHF) boundary conditions and these solutions are valid for all M > 1, where M is the  magnetic interaction parameter.   It is found that the temperature within the fluid is reduced significantly with the increasing values of radiation parameter, Prandtl number, heat <b>sink</b> and magnetic <b>field</b> parameters for both PST and PHF cases.

40|$|A {{model of}} mantle {{convection}} which generates plate tectonics requires strain rate- or stress-dependent rheology {{in order to}} produce strong platelike flows with weak margins as well as strike-slip deformation and plate spin (i. e., toroidal motion). Here, we employ a simple model of source-sink driven surface flow to determine the form of such a rheology that is appropriate for Earth's present-day plate motions. In this model, lithospheric motion is treated as shallow layer flow driven by sources and sinks which correspond to spreading centers and subduction zones, respectively. Two plate motion models are used to derive the source <b>sink</b> <b>field.</b> As originally implied in the simpler Cartesian version of this model, the classical power law rheologies do not generate platelike flows as well as the hypothetical Whitehead-Gans stick-slip rheology (which incorporates a simple self-lubrication mechanism). None of the fluid rheologies examined, however, produce more than approximately 60 % of the original maximum shear. For either plate model, the viscosity fields produced by the power law rheologies are diffuse, and the viscosity lows over strike-slip shear zones or pseudo-margins are not as small as over the prescribed convergent-divergent margins. In contrast, the stick-slip rheology generates very platelike viscosity fields, with sharp gradients at the plate boundaries, and margins with almost uniformly low viscosity. Power law rheologies with high viscosity contrasts, however, lead to almost equally favorable comparisons, though these also yield the least platelike viscosity fields. This implies that the magnitude of toroidal flow and platelike strength distributions are not necessarily related and thus may present independent constraints on the determination of a self-consistent plate-mantle rheology...|$|R

In order to better quantify the possible climate feedback, present era CH 4 emissions should be understood better {{as well as their}} interannual variability. As the data obtained with ground based atmospheric CH 4 observations are sparse, it is important to test utility of the observations by satellites, such as GOSAT, AIRS, TES and others. Monthly CH 4 fluxes for 43 regions in 2009 - 2010 are estimated by an inverse model using the GOSAT SWIR Level 2 XCH 4 data and ground-based CH 4 observations archived at WDCGG. The flux estimates and global distribution of methane concentrations in the atmosphere are prepared for a distribution as the GOSAT Level 4 research product. We used interannually varying CH 4 emissions by the GFED and VISIT ecosystem model (Ito and Inatomi, 2012) and interannually repeating the EDGAR CH 4 emissions and chemical <b>sink</b> <b>fields</b> prepared by the TransComCH 4 project in a forward simulation by the NIES transport model. Monthly scale adjustments were applied to 4 categories of fluxes independently for each region (as in Kim et al., 2011). The inverse problem of optimizing the fluxes was solved with a fixed-lag Kalman smoother (Saeki et al., 2013). We compared the inversion results using the two different datasets to assess the utility of GOSAT XCH 4 data in flux estimates and found good fit to the data. Mean residual misfit between simulations and GOSAT data is 5 ppb, which is smaller than difference with TCCON and GOSAT observations. The inversion using groundbased data only estimated larger uncertainty of fluxes over tropical regions, South America and Temperate Asia where the data are sparse. Adding large number of the GOSAT data to the inversion leads to decreasing the uncertainty in Temperate Asia (by 41 %), northern South America (26 %), Tropical Asia (24 %), Europe (23 %) and other regions. Monthly mean XCH 4 simulated with fluxes estimated using the ground-based data is close to the GOSAT observations in the north of 40 °N, but lower than GOSAT in southern hemisphere, and the difference can be attributed to possible biases in XCH 4 observations and the transport model. Figure 1 shows annual maximum regional monthly flux uncertainty reduction. It is shown that the GOSAT observations are adding extra information on fluxes in the high latitudes in summer, and can be useful for constraining the surface fluxes. 第 4 回極域科学シンポジウム個別セッション：[OM] 気水圏 11 月 14 日（木） 統計数理研究所 ３階セミナー室１（D 305...|$|R

Congestion effects the performance metrics, namely throughput and per-packet energy consumption, network lifetime and packet delivery ratio. Reducing congestion allows better utilization of the network resources and thus enhances the Quality of Service metrics of the network. Traffic Aware Dynamic Routing to Alleviate Congestion in Wireless Sensor Networks reduces congestion by considering one hop neighbor routing in the network. This paper proposed an algorithm for Quality of Service Based Traffic-Aware Data forwarding for congestion control in wireless sensor networks based on two hop neighbor information. On detection of congestion, the algorithm forwards data packets around the congestion areas by spreading the excessive packets through multiple paths. The path with light load or under loaded nodes is efficiently utilized whenever congestion occurs. The main aspect of the algorithm is to build path to the destination using two independent potential fields depth and queue length. Queue length field solves the traffic-aware problem.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 70 - 75). x, 75 leaves, bound 29 cmA {{review of}} several cultural management strategies for managing of aphids, whiteflies, and their associated diseases and phytototoxemias was conducted. The use of reflective mulches {{has been extensively}} studied and is being successfully used to help manage aphids, whiteflies and other insect pests. Manipulation of planting date or crop sanitation alone did not consistently reduce insect pest populations. However, cultural tactics such as alteration of soil fertility, conservation tillage and crop diversification often reduced aphid and whitefly densities on the cash crop. Cultural management tactics applied singly often suppressed insect pest densities but did less often improved plant health and yield. The feasibility of integrating one or more cultural control tactics to suppress insect pest densities as well as improve plant health is being discussed. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of several companion plants on population densities of the whitefly, Bemisia argentifolli Bellow and Perring and the incidence of squash silverleaf disorder in zucchini, Cucurbita pepo L. on Oahu, Hawaii. Two cover crops, buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum Moench and white clover Trifolium repens L. or sunn hemp, Crotolaria juncea L. and an intercropped vegetable, okra Abelmonchus esculentus (L.), were evaluated as companion plants during 2005 and 2006, respectively. Population densities of whiteflies varied during the two field studies. Zucchini intercropped with okra had lower numbers of adult whiteflies and resulted in significantly lower severity of silverleaf symptoms than the cover crop habitats in 2005. During 2006, zucchini grown with sunn hemp had significantly lower numbers of all whitefly stages (egg, immature and adult) and less silverleaf severity symptoms than buckwheat. The potential of barrier plants to reduce the density of aphid and incidence of aphid transmitted non-persistent virus (ATNPV) in zucchini, Cucurbita pepo L. was evaluated during 2005 and 2006 on Oahu, Hawaii. Two cover crops, buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum Moench and white clover Trifolium repens L., or sunn hemp, Crotolaria juncea L. and an intercropped vegetable, okra Abelmonchus esculentus (L.), were evaluated as barrier plants during the studies. Results of the field experiments showed that densities of alatae aphids in water pan traps {{did not differ significantly}} among treatment habitats during both study years. However, foliar counts of aphids were significantly less in dicu 1 ture than monoculture habitats during 2006.

A ten-fold improvement in precision was attained over traditional systems, which was critical for quantifying the whole ecosystem flux from small H 2 concentration gradients abov...|$|R
