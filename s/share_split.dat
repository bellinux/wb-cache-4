50|$|A <b>split</b> <b>share</b> {{corporation}} is a corporation that exists for a defined {{period of time}} to transform the risk and investment return (capital gains, dividends, and possibly also profits from the writing of covered options) of a basket of shares of conventional dividend-paying corporations into the risk and return of the two or more classes of publicly traded <b>shares</b> in the <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporation. Most commonly a <b>split</b> <b>share</b> {{corporation is}}sues equal numbers of shares from a class of preferred shares and a class of capital or class A shares.

It is said that 60 members of staff face redundancies between THQ's US Rainbow studio and the UK Juice Game's studio. In August 2010, THQ unveiled the uDraw GameTablet, a $70 accessory for Nintendo's Wii console that lets gamers draw and play on their television screens. The white, 9-by-7-inch peripheral houses a Wii Remote on the left, with a doodle pad and tethered stylus on the right. THQ said more software for the uDraw would launch every couple of months. In January 2011, THQ sold off its Wireless division to a Swedish mobile company called 24MAS. On January 12, 2011, THQ unveiled its new logo. In March 2011, THQ, after its game Homefront was released, suffered a 26% stock drop.

On July 27, 2011, THQ announced it was dropping the long running Red Faction franchise. This was believed to be due to the poor reception over the latest game in the franchise, Red Faction: Armageddon. In the same year on August 9, 2011, THQ announced it would shift its development focus away from licensed kids and movie-based titles by closing down THQ Studio Australia and Blue Tongue in order to focus on [...] "high-quality owned IP."

40|$|The {{states of}} the 2 -bit {{counters}} used in many branch prediction schemes {{can be divided into}} "strong" and "weak" states. Instead of the typical saturating counter encoding of the states, the 2 -bit counter can be encoded such that the least significant bit directly represents whether the current state is strong or weak. This extra bit provides hysteresis to prevent the counters from switching directions too quickly. Past studies have exploited the strong bias of the direction bit to construct better branch predictors. We show that counters exhibit a strong bias in the hysteresis bit as well, suggesting that an entire bit dedicated to hysteresis is overkill. Using data-compression techniques, we empirically demonstrate that the information theoretic entropy of the hysteresis bit conveys less than 0. 18 bits per prediction of information for a gshare branch predictor. We explain how to construct fractional-bit <b>shared</b> <b>split</b> counters (SSC) by sharing a single hysteresis bit between multiple counters.

These splits were screened to ensure that no contemporaneous events were present which may have influenced the results. Five study periods were then defined around each split...|$|E
40|$|Research PaperA two-stage, distributionally {{neutral and}} {{efficient}} rationalization policy design—one that preserves the ex ante wealth distribution—is developed by blending {{elements of a}} cooperative and a partnership. It is formally proven {{that there is no}} impediment to win-win rationalization using only IFQs allocated only to harvesters. The design creates a bilateral monopoly by allocating ITQs only to harvesters who, in Stage 1, join a “dissolution fishery association” (DFA) with the processor(s) through which their landed catch history arose. IFQ is allocated pursuant to a private contract that stipulates dissolution terms, much like a prenuptial. Harvesters that do not join a DFA with their traditional processor(s) must remain in open access. Bilateral negotiations focus on partitioning the total quasi rents of the DFA between a single processor and its traditional harvesters. The negotiated rent <b>share</b> <b>split</b> defines the terms of dissolution, i. e., the share of IFQs that must be left with the processor, if either party leaves the DFA for a preferred opportunity. The rent <b>share</b> <b>split</b> also defines a formula price contract for a functioning DFA. Stage 2 involves consolidation and realignment to maximize overall efficiency.

40|$|Purpose: Since the {{initiation}} of the <b>share</b> <b>split</b> reform by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) in 2005, the private placement has become {{the major source of}} raising equity after IPO. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate why listed firms in China prefer private placements compared to other options of raising capital. Design/methodology/approach: The ordinary least squares regression, the piecewise regression and the cross-sectional regression analysis were undertaken to investigate the determinants and characteristics of the seasoned-equity offerings announcement effects. Probit regression analysis was taken to estimate the probability of a firm choosing private placements. Findings: The authors find positive significant announcement abnormal returns for private placement. The findings also indicate that operating performance deteriorates immediately after announcement and poor operating performance is more likely to be contributed by large size portfolios, which suggests size effect. Research limitations/implications: The paper's evidence contributes to an understanding of the wider implication of the <b>share</b> <b>split</b> reform undertaken by the CSRC. Practical implications: The paper provides insights for policy makers in China and around the world who have and wish to adopt similar practices within their jurisdictions. Similar research can be conducted in other emerging markets to enable better understanding and implications of seasoned equity offerings on firm financial performance. Originality/value: The paper is novel in regard to the data and the wider research paradigm used...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{share price}} {{movements}} are examined around {{the announcement of}} certain capitalisation changes. Previous Australian evidence in this area by Ball, Brown and Finn (1977) suggests that the equity market is efficient in both its timing (assessed using monthly data) and in its pricing of <b>share</b> <b>splits,</b> bonus and rights issues. That is, share prices adjust rapidly to reflect changes in expected future cash flows as modelled by changes in effective aggregate dividends paid to equity holders. This study extends Ball Brown and Finn (1977) by using daily data to examine not only <b>share</b> <b>splits,</b> bonus and rights issues but consolidations (reverse splits) as well. The two major findings are as follows: 1. the Australian equity market reacts quickly (normally within one trading day of the announcement) to incorporate unanticipated information regarding future cash flows conveyed by the abovementioned capitalisation announcements; and 2. that (assuming an efficient market) a signalling model based on year ahead changes in dividend policy alone does not capture all information priced by investors at the announcement date. This is so {{particularly in the case}} of equity issues (bonus and rights) where it is conjectured that Australian Stock Exchange Listing Rule requirements cause confounding, simultaneous firm-specific information to be released which is priced by investors...|$|R

The income from the preferred shares is usually declared as dividend income, which in some jurisdictions (e.g. Canada) has favorable tax rates compared to the tax rates that apply to the interest income that is produced by bonds or commercial paper.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} state control and ownership structure on the leverage decision of firms listed in the Chinese stock market. Our results show that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have higher leverage ratios than non-SOEs, and SOEs in regions with a poorer institutional environment have higher leverage ratios than SOEs in better regions. We also show that the largest shareholding (the percentage of shares held by the largest shareholder) in the SOEs has a negative relationship with the leverage ratio, while the largest shareholding in non-SOEs has a non-linear relationship with the short-term and long-term debt ratios. Finally, this study also shows that the <b>share</b> <b>split</b> reform and the improvement of institutional environment both weaken the negative relationship and strengthen the positive relationship between largest shareholding and leverage of SOEs and non-SOEs to some extent.
