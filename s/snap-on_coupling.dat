50|$|They {{feature a}} <b>snap-on</b> <b>coupling</b> and are {{available}} in either 50 Ω or 75 Ω impedance. They offer excellent electrical performance from DC to 4 GHz.|$|E
50|$|The Mini-QMA is a quick-locking SMA (QMA) {{replacement}} {{that was}} designed with panel mount and printed circuit board (PCB) applications specifically in mind; {{the length of the}} Mini-QMA being the shortest of any QMA connector on the market to date. This miniaturization, in addition to its <b>snap-on</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism and electronic performance equivalent to SMA up to 18 GHz, make the Mini-QMA an excellent choice for applications in which space is limited but performance is required.|$|E
