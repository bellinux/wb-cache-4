5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's <b>sine</b> <b>curve</b> is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E

The methodology and conceptualization of macro programming in elliptical parts programming are analyzed in this paper. In professional skill competitions about CNC lathes, we can often see that practical parts exams include non-circular arc curves, such as ellipses, hyperbolas, <b>sine</b> <b>curves</b> and parabolas, etc. Without CAD/CAM automatic programming software, manual programming will become the exclusive programming method. While in manual programming, these non-circular arc curves, such as ellipses, hyperbolas, <b>sine</b> <b>curves</b> and parabolas require macro programs. Among them, ellipses are the most typical. According {{to the situation in}} practical work, in present study, FANUC 0 i System was used to write elliptical programs for CKA 6136 CNC Lathes. Figure 1 The elliptical process of CNC lathes is conducted with equal-step linear fitting. The intersection point or tangent point in fitting segments is called a node. Numerous node coordinates must be represented with mathematical equations and tools must be controlled to feed successively from beginning to end and approach an elliptical curve, with variables, arithmetical operations, logics, program loop, short linear interpolation and other functions. 1.
