25|$|The boom saw the {{increasing}} popularity of electronic appliances like computers, cell phones, music players and video games. Credit cards were {{a symbol of}} the boom. The Reagan tax cuts seemed to work and Americans were able to <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> the crash of 1987 by the beginning of 1988. The growth ended by 1990 after seven years of stock market growth and prosperity for the upper and middle class. The federal debt spawned by his policies tripled (from $930billion in 1981 to $2.6trillion in 1988), reaching record levels.|$|E
500|$|The site is now {{considered}} to be of such significance that Nick Card, director of excavations, was prompted to say in 2012; [...] "We need to turn the map of Britain upside down {{when we consider the}} Neolithic and <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> our south-centric attitudes...London may be the cultural hub of Britain today, but 5,000 years ago, Orkney was the centre for innovation for the British isles. Ideas spread from this place. The first grooved pottery, which is so distinctive of the era, was made here, for example, and the first henges – stone rings with ditches round them – were erected on Orkney. Then the ideas spread {{to the rest of the}} Neolithic Britain. This was the font for new thinking at the time.|$|E
500|$|Out of {{the major}} Finnish {{political}} parties, the National Coalition Party and Swedish People's Party of Finland support NATO membership. In 2016, the party conference of the National Coalition Party agreed that Finland should apply {{for membership in the}} [...] "following years". In the vision of the Swedish People's Party of Finland, Finland will be a NATO member in 2025. Many individual politicians have advocated for NATO as well, including the current President Sauli Niinistö and former Prime Minister Alexander Stubb, as well as former President Martti Ahtisaari, who has argued that Finland should join all the organizations supported by other Western democracies in order [...] "to <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> once and for all the burden of Finlandization." [...] Two other former presidents from the Social Democratic Party, Tarja Halonen and Mauno Koivisto, have publicly opposed the idea, arguing that NATO membership would deteriorate Finland's relations with Russia.|$|E

500|$|During the 1938–39 offseason, Pearson {{became a}} {{contract}} holdout after {{he rejected the}} Yankees' initial offer. [...] Reportedly the same amount he had earned the season before ($10,000), he described the contract offer as [...] "not up to [...] expectations." [...] The two sides eventually agreed to a contract worth $13,500. [...] He kept up his good pitching, garnering the seventh-highest winning percentage (.706) in the AL that year, though his ERA ballooned to 4.49. [...] Throughout the season, problems in his pitching arm flared up again, restricting him to just [...] innings pitched and 20 games started. [...] As a result, his inclusion on the postseason roster was not guaranteed; in late September, McCarthy appeared resigned {{to the fact that}} Pearson would not [...] "be able to help [...] in this series." [...] However, he managed to <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> his injury woes and was penciled into the starting rotation for Game 2 of the 1939 World Series. [...] Facing the Cincinnati Reds, he held them hitless through [...] innings pitched—eventually giving up just two singles—while striking out eight and walking one in a complete game, 4–0 victory. [...] Pearson's sublime pitching performance {{is considered one of the}} greatest in World Series history; with a game score of 90, it is one of only eight Fall Classic starts to record a game score of 90 or above. [...] The Yankees proceeded to sweep the Reds two games later, resulting in their fourth consecutive championship and giving Pearson the distinction of winning a World Series ring in every season of his Yankees tenure.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{has used}} humor {{to try to}} <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> the scandals.

I don't {{know how it works}} digitally at all." [...] In September 2015, Clinton was asked in an interview with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show about the content of the emails. She laughed it off, saying there was nothing interesting and joking that she was offended people found her emails 'boring'.|$|E
2500|$|In Finnish politics, Ahtisaari has {{stressed}} {{how important}} it is for Finland to join NATO. Ahtisaari has argued that Finland should be a full member of NATO and the EU in order [...] "to <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> once and for all the burden of Finlandization". He believes politicians should file application and make Finland a member. He says that the way Finnish politicians avoid expressing their opinion is disturbing. He has noted that the so-called [...] "NATO option" [...] (acquiring membership when Finland is threatened) is an illusion, making an analogy to trying to obtain fire insurance when the fire has already started.|$|E

2500|$|Legge and Brooman {{argue that}} the success of the Bill lay in the {{personality}} of [...] "Humanity Dick", who was able to <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> the ridicule from the House of Commons, and whose sense of humour managed to capture the House's attention. It was Martin himself who brought the first prosecution under the Act, when he had Bill Burns, a costermonger—a street seller of fruit—arrested for beating a donkey, and paraded the animal's injuries before a reportedly astonished court. Burns was fined, and newspapers and music halls were full of jokes about how Martin had relied on the testimony of a donkey.|$|E
2500|$|Berthe de Villers' {{remarkable}} {{victory at}} Gia Cuc, coupled with Rivière's simultaneous Capture of Nam Dinh, demoralised the Vietnamese, appreciably raised French prestige in Tonkin, and emboldened French policymakers to <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> the growing prospects of direct Chinese intervention in Tonkin. [...] Meanwhile, {{the failure of}} cooperation between Prince Hoang and Liu Yongfu alarmed the Chinese. [...] The senior Chinese civil mandarin Tang Jingsong (Tang Ching-sung) reconciled {{the two men in}} April 1883, and persuaded Liu Yongfu to take the field against the French with the Black Flag Army. [...] The result, in May 1883, was the disastrous French defeat at the Battle of Paper Bridge, in which both Rivière and Berthe de Villers were killed.|$|E
2500|$|A bogey {{competition}} is a scoring format sometimes seen in at informal tournaments. Its scoring {{is similar to}} match play, except each player compares their hole score to the hole's par rating instead of the score of another player. The player [...] "wins" [...] the hole if they score a birdie or better, they [...] "lose" [...] the hole if they score a bogey or worse, and they [...] "halve" [...] the hole by scoring par. By recording only this simple win-loss-halve score on the sheet, a player can <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> a very poorly-played hole with a simple [...] "-" [...] mark and move on. As used in competitions, the player or pair with the best win-loss [...] "differential" [...] wins the competition.|$|E

[...] Video replays did show several Longhorns were on the field along with Jessee, despite an earlier bench warning {{that was given to}} Texas. [...] For his role in inadvertently penalizing his team, Jessee has been compared to Steve Bartman, the man who may have inadvertently hurt the World Series prospects of the Chicago Cubs by interfering with a ball still in play. [...] Unlike Bartman, Jessee’s goof did not result in a loss for his team; the Longhorns were able to <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> the setback. [...] Commentators also joked that Jessee might star in the Southwest Airlines advertising campaign called wanna get away? which includes people in difficult or uncomfortable positions longing to leave town.|$|E
2500|$|Damage in M {{is handled}} {{differently}} as well. M {{does not use}} Hit Points. Instead, characters have a fourth Saving Throw called the Toughness Save ("Damage Save" [...] in the previous edition) {{which is based on}} their Constitution scores (just like Fortitude). Weapons and powers that do lethal and subdual damage do not roll any dice to determine damage. Instead, damaging attacks are ranked based upon their overall power. For example, a fairly fit but normal human may throw a punch that inflicts +1N (non-lethal) damage, while the irradiated simian mastermind with enhanced strength and razor-sharp claws throws out +12L (lethal) damage. When a character is struck by an attack, he or she rolls a Toughness Save against a target number equal to the rank of the attack plus 15. Success allows the character to <b>shrug</b> <b>off</b> the attack with minimal effect, while failure results in injury according to the degree of failure and the type of damage. Accumulated damage applies a penalty to further saves, increasing the chances of any given attack taking the character down.|$|E
