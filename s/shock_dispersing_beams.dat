40|$|Nonlinear {{acoustic}} wave propagation through a stratified atmosphere is considered. The initial signal {{is taken to}} be an isolated N-wave, which is the disturbance that is generated some distance away from a supersonic body in horizontal flight. The effect of cylindrical spreading and exponential density stratification on the propagation of the disturbance is considered, with the shock structure controlled by molecular relaxation mechanisms and by thermoviscous diffusion. An augmented Burgers equation is obtained and asymptotic solutions are derived based on the limit of small dissipation and dispersion. For a single relaxation mode, the solution depends on whether relaxation alone can support the shock or whether a sub-shock arises controlled by other mechanisms. The resulting shock structures are known as fully dispersed and partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shocks,</b> respectively. In this paper, the spatial location of the transition between fully dispersed and partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shocks</b> is identified for shocks propagating {{above and below the}} horizontal. This phenomenon is important in understanding the character of sonic booms since the transition to a partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shock</b> structure leads to the appearance of a shorter scale in the shock rise-time, associated with the embedded sub-shock. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.

40|$|In this paper, the {{two-dimensional}} particle-laden flow {{developments are}} studied with bronze particle {{cloud in the}} accelerated flow behind a running shock. The forty thousands particle clouds are arranged initially in a rectangular, triangular and circular shape. The flows are computed with a recently developed high-order Eulerian-Lagrangian method, that approximates the Euler equations governing the gas dynamics with the improved high order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO-Z) scheme, while individual particles are traced in the Lagrangian frame using high-order time integration schemes. A high-order ENO interpolation determines the carrier phase properties at the particle location. A high-order central weighing deposits the particle influence on the carrier phase. Reflected shocks form ahead of all the cloud shapes. The detached shock {{in front of the}} triangular cloud is weakest. At later times the wake behind the cloud becomes unstable and a two-dimensional vortex-dominated wake forms. Separated shear layers {{at the edges of the}} clouds pulls particles initially out of the clouds that are consequently transported along the shear layers. Since flows separated trivially at sharp corners, particles are mostly transported out of the cloud into the flow at the sharp front corner of the rectangular cloud, and the trailing corner of the triangular cloud. Particles are transported smoothly out of the circular cloud, since it lacks sharp corners. At late times, the accelerated flow behind the running <b>shock</b> <b>disperses</b> the particles in cross-stream direction the most for the circular cloud, followed by the rectangular cloud and the triangular cloud.

40|$|The {{increase}} of angular dispersion and slit resolution limit of grating spectrometers {{by means of}} variation of grating parameters is limited by its period and allowable order of diffraction. The special solutions (echelle, holographic, immersion gratings) are acceptable in a limited parameter range and are technologically complex in fabrication, thus hardly applicable to instruments of mass production. We propose to decrease slit resolution limit by one-dimensional beam widening in dispersion plane by means of passing it through oblique prism before incidence onto diffraction grating. The {{increase of}} angular dispersion {{can be achieved by}} narrowing of <b>dispersed</b> <b>beams</b> after grating while passing through other oblique prism. We prove that slit resolution limit in such a system changes approximately as multiplied by angular magnification of the first prism (that is less than 1 times). Also angular dispersion changed approximately as multiplied by angular magnification of the second prism. The Fresnel reflection from the faces of prisms is analyzed. Accounting for that factor gives the increase of resolution about 1, 4 – 1, 6 times without loss of light (and can be 2 and more times while using anti-reflective coating). The proposed method is different from the similar ones first of all by its simplicity because it uses simple optical elements – plane reflective grating and thin prisms. It can be applied to amend the analytical characteristics of dispersive spectrometers, first of all the small-sized ones.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Shock {{capturing}} algorithms {{are widely}} used for simulations of compressible fluid flow. Though these algorithms resolve a shock wave {{within a couple of}} grid points, the artificial length scale from the numerical shock profile can have side effects. The side effects are similar to physical effects that occur when a relaxation process gives rise to fully or partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shock</b> waves. Two anomalies due to a non-zero shock width are discussed: (1) in one-dimension, a non-decaying entropy spike results from a transient when a shock profile is formed or changed; (2) in multi-dimensions, front curvature affects the propagation of a shock wave. The authors show that both the entropy anomaly and the curvature effect are a natural consequence of the conservation laws. The same analysis applies both to the continuum equations and to their finite difference approximations in conservation form. Consequently, the artificial length scale inherent in a shock capturing algorithm can mimic real physical effects that are associated with partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shock</b> waves...|$|R
