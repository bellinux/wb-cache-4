25|$|After the {{outbreak}} the player character is {{led to the}} Prepper's bunker, where he receives weapons, a bug-out bag and the Prepper Pad, a device with a built-in scanner and radar. The Prepper, a Raven of Dee, left the organization due to a difference in interpreting Dee's prophecy. According to the scientist, Black Angels would save the world; the Ravens thought that Dee was referring to their organization, but the Prepper believed that {{he was talking about}} <b>something</b> <b>worse.</b>|$|E
500|$|North's low {{academic}} {{results have}} led to criticism. In February 2007 Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels suggested burning North down. [...] "My children will not darken {{the door of a}} Minneapolis public school in this city at this time under these conditions. I've said burn North High School down! I can't be paying as a taxpayer for the education of my neighbors and 72 percent of them are failing—meaning black boys. <b>Something</b> <b>worse</b> than vouchers could come along. If it works, if it sacrifices the entire school system, fine! Get rid of the damn thing! It hasn't worked!" [...] His suggestion caused uproar in the community, and his remarks were heavily criticized. Samuels later apologized for the [...] "extreme language" [...] but stated that he did not regret making the comments.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in Slate Magazine, Judith Shulevitz {{reported}} {{that not only}} does Fish openly proclaim himself [...] "unprincipled" [...] but also rejects wholesale the concepts of [...] "fairness, impartiality, reasonableness." [...] To Fish, [...] "ideas have no consequences." [...] For taking this stance, Shulevitz characterizes Fish as [...] "not the unprincipled relativist he's accused of being. He's <b>something</b> <b>worse.</b> He's a fatalist." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gallifrey is the {{umbrella}} {{title of a}} series of audio plays by Big Finish Productions, set on Gallifrey during Romana's tenure as President. In , the final chapter of the third series, the Time Lord Irving Braxiatel speaks of [...] "rumours out there in the big wide universe—more than rumours, in fact—that something's coming to Gallifrey, <b>something</b> <b>worse</b> than you could possibly imagine." [...] Because of these rumours, Braxiatel engineers the removal of the Time Lord biodata archive from Gallifrey, in order that the Time Lords might someday be restored after their planet meets its doom. Former Big Finish producer Gary Russell indicated in a forum posting on Outpost Gallifrey that this was a reference to the television series' Time War.|$|E
2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That {{is the one thing}} we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or <b>something</b> <b>worse.</b> You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing {{nonsense}} about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear it from you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to <b>something</b> <b>worse</b> than these things, he will not have told you the whole story." ...|$|E

60|$|Dora and Nellie {{heard the}} loud talking after the {{crashing}} of the launch into the houseboat and also heard {{part of what}} followed. Both wanted to cry out for assistance, but did not dare, fearing that <b>something</b> still <b>worse</b> might happen to them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes,' {{came the}} rather {{dissatisfied}} reply. 'I do agree; perfectly.

60|$|Half-starved, {{suffering}} oftentimes the keenest {{pangs of}} thirst, and believing {{that all this}} torture was the preface to <b>something</b> yet <b>worse,</b> it can well be imagined that we were indeed a sorry party.
