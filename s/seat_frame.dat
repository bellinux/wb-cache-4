Because of this, the vehicle was never sold {{in the state of}} Victoria, which requires all new vehicles sold after 1 January 2011 to come with ESC. This requirement became Australia-wide as from the 1st of November, 2013, effectively banning the car along with some others. Also, it does not have side airbags. With these shortfalls, the Chery J1 scored a three star result in Australian ANCAP tests, {{making it one of the}} equal least-safe vehicles sold in the country. Indeed, ANCAP states that it [...] "does not recommend purchasing vehicles with less than 4 stars". A defect in the <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> necessitated a safety recall in August 2011.|$|E
50|$|Xcelerator's trains use {{hydraulically}} operated T-Bar lapbar restraints. These restraints appeared on Intamin's earlier accelerator coasters, but over-the-shoulder restraints {{are now the}} normal type used on any new accelerator coaster due to safety concerns. Xcelerator also had special meters installed on its restraints. The meter must show all green {{in order for a}} guest to ride. If the meter shows red, the guest cannot ride the attraction. Eventually, the meter system was removed and the park now uses black lines etched on the side of each restraint. The black line must pass a certain part of the <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> in order for the guest to ride. The attraction also has seatbelts, which must be buckled before an operator pulls down on the lapbar. Failure to do so slows the load time of the attraction considerably. Another contributing factor to a guest not being able to ride, involving the seat belts, is that at least one inch of slack must be able to be pulled out from buckle. If no slack of the belt shows, the guest is too large to ride, even though the seat belt may be completely buckled.|$|E
5000|$|A bergère is an {{enclosed}} upholstered French armchair (fauteuil) with an upholstered back and armrests on upholstered frames. The <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> is over-upholstered, {{but the rest}} of the wooden framing is exposed: it may be moulded or carved, and of beech, painted or gilded, or of fruitwood, walnut or mahogany with a waxed finish. Padded elbowrests may stand upon the armrests. A bergère is fitted with a loose, but tailored, seat cushion. It is designed for lounging in comfort, with a deeper, wider seat than that of a regular fauteuil, though the bergères by Bellangé in the White House (one illustrated) are more formal. A bergère in the eighteenth century was essentially a meuble courant, designed to be moved about to suit convenience, rather than being ranged permanently formally along the walls as part of the decor. [...] The fanciful name, [...] "shepherdess chair", was coined in mid-eighteenth century Paris, where the model developed without a notable break from the late-seventeenth century chaise de commodité, a version of the wing chair, whose upholstered [...] "wings" [...] shielding the face from fireplace heat or from draughts were retained in the bergère à oreilles ("with ears"), or, fancifully, bergère confessionale, as if the occupant were hidden from view, as in a confessional. A bergère may have a flat, raked back, in which case it is à la reine, or, more usually in Louis XV furnishings, it has a coved back, en cabriolet. A bergère with a low coved back that sweeps without a break into the armrests is a marquise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{lightweight}} automotive seat back frame structure using CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic). The shape of CFRP seat back frame was determined so that its manufacturing could be performed in a single process without additional fastening. Three different kinds of analyses were performed to confirm that CFRP <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> could satisfy FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safely Standards) requirements. The results of finite element analyses showed that its maximum stresses were 51. 1 to 95. 5 % of those of steel <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> structure. Its mass was 56. 2 % of that of steel seat back frame. CFRP <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> can provide better fuel economy as well as improved safety...|$|E
40|$|Investigation of the {{behavior}} of an automobile seat subjected to an impact load is important to improve safety. The following three subjects on the design of the <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> are described. First, {{in order to understand the}} fundamental impact behavior of a <b>seat</b> <b>frame,</b> the characteristics of impact behavior were studied through experiments carried out under various impact conditions. Second, using an explicit finite element method, a structural analysis method for the simulation of impact behavior was investigated. This analysis method was shown to be useful by comparing its results with the experimental results. Finally, the influence of design parameters of the <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> on impact behavior was investigated. There has been a growing demand that the structure of the seat should be designed rationally by evaluating correctly the influence of design parameters upon such characteristics as strengh and flexibility. The authors proposed a statistical optimization method that consists of two steps : effectivity analysis and mathematical programming. In this paper, the effectivity analysis was applied to the <b>seat</b> <b>frame,</b> and the applicability of the effectivity analysis was confirmed by comparing with the experimental results. 本論文では，自動車用シートのフレームが車両衝突時に示す挙動のシミュレーション法を検討すると共に，提案している影響度の解析手法を適用する事により，フレーム構成部材の衝突挙動に対する影響度を明らかにした...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{optimization}} {{of consumer}} products {{through the use}} of numerical simulations has become a key factor to a continuously increasing requirement for time and cost efficiency, for quality improvement and materials saving, in many manufacturing areas such as automotive, aerospace, building, packaging and electronic industries. Environmental protection, fuel economy and safety specifications are today major concerns in automotive industry. Part of the overall strategy is a lower car weight which means increased performance, reduction of fuel consumption achieving a lower vehicle exhaust emissions to the environment. At the same time, the occupant safety must be continuously improved, as the safety specifications are more demanding. To meet these requirements, a call for new lightweight concepts and crash structures was raised, using lighter and/or stronger materials. In the last decade we have assisted to a development and application of high-strength steels and aluminum alloys in the manufacture of automotive structures. This paper presents a structural design problem of a car <b>seat</b> <b>frame,</b> aiming the desired weight reduction while satisfying a set of performance constraints. The numerical model of the <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> has been developed and the numerical results were validated against experimental data obtained during static loading tests. Using the developed computational model, an optimized topology of the linear elastic structure has been determined, reaching a significant weight reduction...|$|E

40|$|Vehicle seat {{suspension}} {{is one of}} very important components to provide ride comfort, in particular, commercial vehicles, to reduce driver fatigue due to long hours driving. This paper presents a study on active control of {{seat suspension}} to reduce vertical vibration transmitted from uneven road profile to driver body. The control problem will be firstly studied by proposing an integrated seat suspension model which includes vehicle chassis suspension, seat suspension, and driver body model. This is a new concept {{in the field of}} study because most of the current active and semi-active seat suspension studies only consider seat suspension or seat suspension with human body model, and road disturbance is generally assumed to be applied to the cabin floor directly. Controller design based an integrated model will enable the seat suspension to perform in a scenario where vibration caused by road disturbance is transmitted from wheel to <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> and ride comfort performance is evaluated in terms of human body instead of <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> acceleration. A static output feedback controller is then designed for the seat suspension with using measurement available signals. Driver mass variation and actuator saturation are also considered in the controller design process. The conditions for designing such a controller are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, numerical simulations are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. It is shown from the driver body acceleration responses under both bump and random road disturbances that the newly designed seat suspension can improve vehicle ride comfort regardless of driver body mass variation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Whole-body shocks and {{vibrations}} experienced dur-ing manual wheelchair use can decrease an individual’s comfort, {{increase the}} rate of fatigue, result in injury, and consequently limit mobility and community participation. We used a wheelchair-vibration simulator to examine whether the seat reaction forces experienced by wheelchair users were differentially influenced by wheelchair suspension, trunk-muscle innervations, and ground speed. We used wheelchairs instrumented with load cells and accelerometers to determine the forces transmitted from the <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> and the head accelerations experienced by riders. We deter-mined that self-selected speed, seat force, and head accelerations differed between subjects with and without trunk-muscle innerva-tions and between rigid and suspension wheelchairs. Seat force and head accelerations were greatest in the rigid-frame wheel-chair and lowest in the spring-type suspension-frame wheel...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the methodology and {{results of a}} program conducted to develop two underseat energy absorber (E/A) concepts for application to nonadjustable crashworthy passenger seats for general aviation aircraft. One concept utilizes an inflated air bag, and the other, a convoluted sheet metal bellows. Prototypes of both were designed, built, and tested. Both concepts demonstrated the necessary features of an energy absorber (load-limiter); however, the air bag concept is particularly encouraging because of its light weight. Several <b>seat</b> <b>frame</b> concepts also were investigated {{as a means of}} resisting longitudinal and lateral loads and of guiding the primary vertical stroke of the underseat energy absorber. Further development of a seat system design using the underseat energy absorbers is recommended because they provide greatly enhanced crash survivability as compared with existing general aviation aircraft seats...|$|E
