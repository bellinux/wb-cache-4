The wives, <b>sons,</b> <b>daughters</b> and daughters-in-law of Knights Companion are also assigned precedence. Relatives of Ladies Companion are not, however, assigned any special positions. (Generally, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives.) The Chancellor is also assigned precedence, but except for the period between 1553 and 1671 when the office was held by a layman who was not necessarily a member of the Order, this precedence has been purely theoretical. As a member of the Order, the Chancellor has a higher precedence than that attached to the office, and when the office was filled by a diocesan bishop of the Church of England, the holder again had a higher precedence by virtue of that office than any that the chancellorship could bestow.|$|E

A person who has wrongfully caused the death of another shall also be bound to make compensation for the injury to any person incurring the medical expenses, increasing the need in living, or incurring the funeral expenses. If the deceased was statutorily bound to furnish maintenance to a third party, the tortfeasor shall also make compensation to such third party for any injury arising therefrom. In case of death caused by a wrongful act, the father, mother, <b>sons,</b> <b>daughters</b> and spouse of the deceased may claim for a reasonable compensation in money even if such injury is not a purely pecuniary loss.|$|E

2500|$|The Colt family incest case, dubbed {{by media}} as the Colt incest clan, is an Australian family {{discovered}} in 2012 {{to have been}} engaging in four generations of incest beginning with [...] "Tim and June Colt," [...] a brother and sister who emigrated from New Zealand in the 1970s. The family grew to nearly 40 members ranging from grandparents to mothers, fathers, <b>sons,</b> <b>daughters,</b> aunts, uncles, nephews, brothers and sisters all engaging in various forms of incest. Many of the children suffered from deformities and medical problems. The case {{has been described by}} lead investigator Peter Yeomans as, [...] "like nothing I’ve ever seen," [...] and was {{considered by many to be}} so shocking that in a rare move the Australian family court allowed full details to be made public, albeit with all names changed to pseudonyms for the children's protection, including the family name of [...] "Colt." ...|$|E
2500|$|The majordomo {{referred}} to in the surviving fuero may have been [...] "a local estate manager rather than the count's household official". This person was also in charge of organising the annual boon work of the settlers and was responsible for supplying them with food and drink during that period. This boon work consisted in three operationes, as they are called in the surviving charter: two for sowing and one for either threshing or ploughing in Ponce's fields. The tenants also owed Ponce tribute or rent in the form of one cahiz each of wheat and barley per field and portions of the produce of their vineyards and orchards. They also owed yantar (hospitality). The fuero of Azaña contains one of the best surviving descriptions of this practice from the twelfth century, and it also indicates Ponce's expectation of continued itinerancy between his various properties and tenancies. The settlers were required each year to prepare a feast for him or his wife and their retinues, although their <b>sons,</b> <b>daughters,</b> or grandchildren could be sent in their place. The amount of produce to be used for these feasts is specified: three rams, one pig, twelve hens, 160 loaves of bread, and large quantities of barley and wine. If none of Ponce's kin attended in a given year, the settlers were exempted from the tribute, which is what the meal was taken to be. Ponce has been described as an [...] "absentee landlord with a vengeance", although no different from his fellow twelfth-century European aristocrats.|$|E

A slim dark woman, with part of her back and one black shoulder bared, and with a thin gold ring in her nose, suddenly began to talk in a high-pitched, shrewish tone. The man with me instinctively looked up at her. We were then just through the door, passing behind Jim's burly back.|$|E
60|$|When he had {{accepted}} the minor Professorship which gave him a footing {{in the world of}} responsible scientific men, she had taken a house in a quiet street in Chelsea which necessitated a daily walk to his laboratory. It was a little old Georgian house with worn and graceful rooms, a dignified front door and a fine gateway of Sussex ironwork much painted and eaten away. She arranged it with great care; she had kept most of her furniture, and his study had his father's bureau, and the selfsame agate paper-weight that had pressed the unfinished paper he left when he died. She was a woman of persistent friendships, and there came to her, old connections of those early times trailing fresher and younger people in their wake, <b>sons,</b> <b>daughters,</b> nephews, disciples; her son brought home all sorts of interesting men, and it was remarkable to her that amidst the talk and discussion at her table, she discovered aspects of her son and often quite intimate aspects she would never have seen with him alone.|$|E

Blanche's wit seldom failed to have the mastery in these encounters, and the keen barbs of her arrows drove her adversary discomfited away. [...] "I am an old fellow," [...] the Major said; [...] "I have nothing to do in life. I have my eyes open. I keep good counsel.
