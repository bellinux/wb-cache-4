50|$|The new {{generation}} pan-European bank concept {{is based on}} the single banking licence rule (<b>single</b> EU <b>passport),</b> which authorizes a credit institution to offer services in other EU member states. The full expansion plan envisaged launching mBank in eight countries in two years {{on the basis of the}} <b>single</b> EU <b>passport.</b> In the following months after the launch, mBank grew quicker in the Czech Republic than it had ever done in Poland. The new bank was recognized by experts and customers alike who awarded it the highest distinctions of Zlata Koruna in the Czech Republic and Zlata Minca in Slovakia in recognition of the mKonto (personal account). In the years to come, mBank was regarded as the most dynamically growing bank in those countries. mBank now is Top5 bank in both countries in terms of number of customers.|$|R

50|$|Few {{countries}} required passports {{before the}} First World War, {{and they were}} not then usually required for overseas travel. By 1900 there were occasional requests for New Zealand passports, which were personally signed by the Governor. In 1905 MP George Fowlds decided to return to Scotland for his father’s 100th birthday. He decided he needed a passport when his ship was about to leave; an inconvenience both for the department and the Governor who had to sign it. A <b>single</b> <b>passport</b> covered a man and his wife and children, but did not include a photo or any personal details like age, height or eye colour.|$|E

40|$|In {{the year}} 2000, the Israeli Securities Authority (ISA) {{initiated}} a new {{amendment to the}} Securities Law aimed at promoting dual listing of Israeli companies, already traded in the US, and not in Israel, by exempting them from the burden of additional reporting to the ISA. According to this amendment, the ISA agreed to rely solely on the reporting requirements of the US SEC. Since then, more than 30 Israeli companies, traded on Nasdaq decided to list their shares on the TASE as well. This event allows us to examine the effect dual listing had on share prices and liquidity in a unique setup that annuls the costs of dual listing registration. The main findings are as follows: 1) trade volume of the dual listed companies has grown by about 123 % on; 2) about 42 % of the total volume is on the TASE without adversely affect the trading volume on the Nasdaq; 3) as a result, share prices went up by about 9. One possible policy implication of these findings is the positive influence harmonized supervision may have over international capital markets such as the <b>Single</b> <b>Passport</b> in Europe...|$|E
40|$|On {{the first}} of January 1993, the Second Banking Directive (1989) of the European Union {{and a number of}} the other EU Directives (1) related to the {{financial}} service industry were implemented. This heralded a new episode of deregulation, standardised minimum capital requirements and changes in supervision rules and deposit-guarantee schemes. The <b>single</b> <b>passport</b> and mutual recognition have cleared the road for cross-border banking, while the introduction of the single currency on {{the first of}} January 1999 took away one of the last obstacles for a competitive and integrated banking market. The general belief among bankers and academics is that competition has significantly increased in this changing European banking environment. Indeed, the numerous cases of recent mergers and acquisitions in the financial world would indicate that bankers and insurers are trying to reshape their businesses into more profitable and lean (cost efficient) institutions in order to face national and global competitive pressures. Traditional income streams such as interest margins have dried up, whereas new sources of revenues such as brokerage services, investment banking products, risk management and portfolio management have become more and more important. Besides major changes in the regulatory environment, the banking industry will be further modernised by the implementation of new computer technologies...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is part of}} a {{framework}} to design and implement a language laboratory for speech reading/lip reading for multiple languages. It is based on the interdisciplinary project LIPPS at Technical University of Berlin, Germany, which aims to develop a training-aid for speech reading by employing a text-driven facial animation from a <b>single</b> <b>passport</b> photo with the help of 2 D image morphing. The LIPPS system may be particularly helpful for patients with a sudden profound hearing-loss, enabling them to start learning speech reading already in the hospital after operation or during subsequent rehabilitation. The present project uses dynamic models for the changes of important visual features. We apply the ideas of i) specific ‘characteristic ’ images being related to the sounds or phonemes of an utterance and ii) visemes being related to the phonemes and represented by the dynamics of linear secondorder models. We aim to extend the idea that visemes are related to single characteristic images or poses of the face towards temporally varying units, as it is the case for the correlating auditory units, the phonemes. We analyzed video clips with moving faces and modeled the prediction of certain visual features at locations of the characteristic images (the characteristic instances) as well as of transitional changes of the feature sets between neighboring characteristic instances. Contextual modulations of the visual features are described {{with the help of a}} dominance model. High dominance is given to visemes with indispensable features as, for instance, complete or partial lip closure (e. g., bilabial or fricative visemes), whereas low dominance is given to practically invisible visemes (e. g., guttural visemes), when the lips mainly prepare the transition towards later dominant phonemes. The described method may also be applied to other types of facial animation systems as to the control parameters of anatomical face models...|$|E

[...] His proposal for a Union of African States project, a project originally conceived by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana in the 1960s, was rejected at the Assembly of Heads of States and Government (AHSG) summit in Lusaka (2001) by African leaders who thought it was [...] "unrealistic" [...] and [...] "utopian." [...] In June 2005, Libya joined the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and in August 2008 Gaddafi was proclaimed [...] "King of Kings" [...] by a committee of traditional African leaders. They crowned him in February 2009, in a ceremony held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; this coincided with Gaddafi's election as AU chairman for a year.|$|R
40|$|MTPL {{insurance}} {{represents a}} complex issue regulating in particular {{protection of the}} third party in a claim settlement. This area is regulated on the EU law level by Council Regulations and Motor Insurance Directives as well by the green cards system and Hague Convention on the Law applicable to traffic accidents on the international level. To provide MTPL insurance in the European Union is possible under the <b>single</b> European <b>passport</b> {{but there are still}} persisting the differences in the extent of insurance cover and liability in the particular Member States including the national regulation requirements. The primary condition for MTPL insurance providing in the EU/EEA is the obligatory membership of the insurer in the national Insurers' Bureau and the Guarantee Fund. The Court of Justice of the European Union relevant decisions has contributed to the interpretation of Motor Insurance Directives provisions and to determination of their correlation to national legislations. From the future perspective is of the importance the legislation process of the PEICL draft. The Czech legislation is fully in compliance with the EU law.

The right of establishment of an insurer can be done either by setting up principally by transfer of the principal activity in another Member State, either by setting up a secondary establishment. To talk about carrying out insurance business by the free provision of services, the risk must be located in another member state than that in which the establishment to which the insurance contract was concluded. These companies {{should be subject to}} a system of prior approval and financial control of the single Member State of origin (home country control). Court of Justice has issued decisions which ruled not to apply or correct application by Member-States the provisions of European Directives into national law. In Romania, Chapter III ¹ of Law 32 / 2000, regarding insurers right of establishment and freedom to provide service and the Order of the Insurance Supervisory Commission nr. 14 / 2009 to implement the rules on business insurance/reinsurance in Romania in the right of establishment and freedom to provide services, transpose the European law provisions in the field and determine the conditions relating to notification to the competent authority for the activity within the host Member State and the conditions of exercise activity.

40|$|As {{stated in}} the introduction, a {{prospectus}} aims to ensure investors that they are provided with reliable information about the securities which they are invited to purchase. Two mechanisms exist to enforce the publication of reliable information in the prospectus: the public enforcement mechanism and civil liability claims. The liability of issuers and its directors for the prospectus {{is an example of}} the latter. Given the international nature of the securities market, the question has to be answered which law is applicable to a prospectus liability claim? The Rome II Regulation provides from 11 January 2009 the rules to decide which law applies to claims arising from non-contractual obligations. From the above analysis it is clear that the Rome II Regulation is applicable to prospectus liability claims against the issuing company and its directors or officers, which are brought before a Member State court by investors. Consequently the law applicable to this prospectus liability claim is the law of the country in which the damage occurs: the lex loci damni. The country in which the damage occurs has to be determined in accordance with the respective case-law of the ECJ on the Brussels I Regulation on jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and its predecessor. The damage arising from false or incomplete information in the prospectus is a pure financial loss. According to the ECJ in Kronhoferthe place where the investor holds his investment account is the place where the direct financial loss is sustained by the investor. Given the universal scope of application of the Rome II Regulation as laid down in Article 3, investors holding an investment account outside the European Union may bring proceedings against the issuer and its directors before a court in a Member State and have their domestic prospectus liability laws applied. Since the securities market has internationalised, issuers and its directors may be confronted with many laws applicable to liability claims arising from the issue of securities through the publication of a prospectus. In my opinion this outcome is not desirable and impedes the objective of the PD 2003 to achieve an internal market for capital by granting a <b>single</b> <b>passport</b> to issuers. I have therefore recommended that the European Commission should either use its power to lay down a proposal to amend the Rome II Regulation, or adopt a Directive which harmonises the national laws with respect to the civil responsibility of the issuing company and its directors. With respect to the adaptation of the Rome II Regulation, I propose a new provision which stipulates that the law applicable to liability claims against the issuer and/or its directors based on the provision of false and/or incomplete information by the issuer and its directors to investors should be the law of the Member State in which the securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market where the actual transaction took place. When securities are not admitted to trading the law applicable to liability claims against the issuer and/or its directors based on the provision of false information by the issuer and its directors to investors should be the law of the Member State in which the prospectus is published (the place where the event giving rise to liability in tort occurred). If the Rome II Regulation is amended so as to achieve the aforementioned result, I could adhere to the proverb: ‘all roads lead to Rome’...|$|E
