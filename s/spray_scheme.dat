40|$|Abstract—Mobile nodes in some {{challenging}} network scenarios {{suffer from}} intermittent connectivity and frequent partitions e. g. battlefield and disaster recovery scenarios. Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) technologies {{are designed to}} enable nodes in such environments to communicate with one another. Several DTN routing schemes have been proposed. However, not much {{work has been done}} on providing information access in such challenging network scenarios. Existing client/server paradigm for information access will not be feasible in such scenarios since end-to-end path does not exist. Thus, in this paper, we explore how a content-based information retrieval system can be designed for DTNs. There are three important design issues, namely (a) how should data be replicated and stored at multiple nodes, (b) how should a query be disseminated in sparsely connected networks, (c) how should a query response be routed back to the querying node. We first describe two data caching schemes: (a) K-copy random caching, (b) K-copy intelligent caching. Then, we describe an L-hop Neighborhood <b>Spraying</b> (LNS) <b>scheme</b> for query dissemination. For message routing, we either use Prophet routing scheme or Highest Encounter First Routing (HEFR) scheme. We conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate different combinations of these algorithms. Our results reveal that the scheme that performs the best is the one that uses the Kcopy intelligent caching combined with the LNS query dissemination and HEFR scheme.

40|$|Abstract — Intermittently {{connected}} mobile {{networks are}} wireless networks {{where most of}} the time there does not exist a complete path from a source to a destination. Researchers have proposed flooding based schemes for routing in such networks. While flooding based schemes are robust and have a high probability of delivery, they suffer from a huge overhead in terms of bandwidth, buffer space and energy dissipation due to large number of transmissions per packet. So flooding based schemes are impractical for resource constrained networks. Controlled replication or spraying methods can reduce this overhead by distributing a small, fixed number of copies to only a few relays, which then independently route each copy towards the destination. These schemes demonstrate a good delay performance without using a lot of resources. There are three important questions {{in the context of the}} design of these spraying based schemes: (i) How many copies per packet should be distributed? (ii) How to distribute these copies amongst the potential relays? (iii) How are each of these copies routed towards the destination? The first and the third questions have been studied in detail by different researchers. But, there has been no study which looks at the second question. This paper fills this void. Specifically, we propose a methodology to derive the optimal spraying policy. As a case study, we find the optimal spraying policy for two different <b>spraying</b> based <b>schemes.</b> Finally, we study the optimal policies to infer simple heuristics which achieve expected delays very close to the optimal.

40|$|With the {{development}} of mobile Internet, wireless communication via mobile devices has become a hot research topic, which is typically {{in the form of}} Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). One critical issue in {{the development}} of DTNs is routing. Although there is a lot research work addressing routing issues in DTNs, they cannot produce an advanced solution to the comprehensive challenges since only one or two aspects (nodes’ movements, clustering, centricity and so on) are considered when the routing problem is handled. In view of these defects in the existing works, we propose a novel solution to address the routing issue in social DTNs. By this solution, mobile nodes are divided into different clusters. The <b>scheme,</b> <b>Spray</b> and Wait, is used for the intra-cluster communication while a new forwarding mechanism is designed for the inter-cluster version. In our solution, the characteristics of nodes and the relation between nodes are fully considered. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the performance of the routing scheme in social DTNs...|$|R
40|$|Studies on epigeal and {{arboreal}} and predatory arthropods in two mango orchards in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea Predatory arthropods {{were studied}} by the beating method and pitfall trapping in two mango orchards in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Both orchards were not sprayed with synthetic insecticides during or before the study period. Formicidae {{were the most}} numerous group within the epigeal and the arboreal arthropods (2772 and 2269 ind., respectively). The weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, was the most abundant species within the arboreal arthropods. Pheidole spp. was most frequent in pitfall traps. Spiders were the second most numerous group (524 and 619 ind., respectively). Lycosidae were predominant in pitfall traps and Salticidae in net catches with the beating method on the trees. In the barber traps, Carabidae and Staphylinidae were only present in low numbers (47 ind.). Coccinellidae were the most numerous family within the arboreal predatory beetles (89 ind.). Telsimia sp. accounted for 63 % of the ladybird beetles. Crickets were frequently collected in pitfall traps (187 ind.). A survey on the occurrence and importance of mango pests in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea A survey was conducted at four sites in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea to determine the abundance and importance of nine insect pests in mango. The pests, except fruit flies which were monitored by fallen fruits, were monitored three times during 2002 according to their occurrence within the mango season. Out of these pests, the white mango scale Aulacaspis tubercularis, (Homopt., Diaspididae), the mango leafminer Acrocerops spp. (Lep., Gracillariidae), the leafhoppers,Idioscopus clypealis and,I. niveosparsus (Homopt., Cicadellidae), the soft scales Saissetia sp. and Parasaissetia sp. (Homopt., Coccidae) and the fruit fly Bactrocera frauenfeldi (Dip., Tephritidae) proved to be serious pests. Appropriate control measures, in particular biological and cultural methods, are proposed. Infestation levels with fruit piercing moths Othreis fullonia, O. materna, Eudocima salaminia (Lep., Noctuidae), aphids Toxoptera odinae (Homopt., Aphididae), blossom feeders Cosmostola sp., Gymnoscelis sp., Nanaguna breviuscula (Lepidoptera) and planthoppers Colgaroides acuminata, Colgar sp., Scolypopa sp. (Homopt., Flatidae, Ricaniidae) were lower. Appropriate control measures are recommended but not immediately required. On the biological control of Ceroplastes rubens (Homopt., Coccidae) with the introduced parasitoid Anicetus beneficus (Hym., Encyrtidae) A {{study was conducted in}} three provinces of Papua New Guinea to determine damage by the pink wax scale Ceroplastes rubens and to identify endemic parasitoids and parasitization levels in order to evaluate the necessity and possibility of a classical biological control with an introduced parasitoid. Infestation levels with the pink wax scale variied 3. 82 % and 6. 40 %. The parasitization levels variied between 1. 19 % and 3. 05 %. Out of the nine endemic parasitoids identified, Aprostocetus sp. (Hym., Eulophidae) was the most frequent one. The pink wax scale parasitoid Anicetus beneficus (Hym., Encyrtidae) was imported from Australia and released at four sites in the Central Province in March/April 2002. The establishment was controlled at two sites six resp. twelve months after release. Parasitization levels increased significantly (from 3. 05 % to 5. 45 % at Laloki and from 2. 04 % to 22. 15 % at Tahira). At both sites, A. beneficus was the most frequent parasitoid. The parasitization process at the Laloki site was disturbed by the ant Tapinoma sp. Studies on the biology of Deanolis sublimbalis (Lep., Pyralidae) and its natural enemies A study was conducted at four sites in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea to determine infestation levels and biological behaviour of the red banded mango caterpillar Deanolis sublimbalis (RBMC). Eggs and larvae were collected to identify natural enemies and to develop potential control strategies. Infestation levels of mango fruits variied between 3. 36 % and 23. 18 %. The eggs are mainly found at the peduncle covered with dried sepals. Pupation takes place inside the bark of the mango tree. No other plants than Mangifera spp. were confirmed as hosts in laboratory and field studies. The pest goes into diapause during mango off-season. No egg or larval parasitoids were recorded. Control measures like sticky bands are an appropriate method to prevent pupation in the bark. A <b>spraying</b> <b>scheme</b> needs to be developed for commercial producers. It is further recommended to search for potential natural enemies in the centre of origin of M. indica...|$|R
40|$|Backpressure {{scheduling}} and routing, in which packets are preferentially transmitted over links with high queue differentials, offers {{the promise of}} throughput-optimal operation {{for a wide range}} of communication networks. However, when the traffic load is low, due to the corresponding low queue occupancy, backpressure scheduling/routing experiences long delays. This is particularly of concern in intermittent encounter-based mobile networks which are already delay-limited due to the sparse and highly dynamic network connectivity. While state of the art mechanisms for such networks have proposed the use of redundant transmissions to improve delay, they do not work well when the traffic load is high. We propose in this paper a novel hybrid approach that we refer to as backpressure with adaptive redundancy (BWAR), which provides the best of both worlds. This approach is highly robust and distributed and does not require any prior knowledge of network load conditions. We evaluate BWAR through both mathematical analysis and simulations based on cell-partitioned model. We prove theoretically that BWAR does not perform worse than traditional backpressure in terms of the maximum throughput, while yielding a better delay bound. The simulations confirm that BWAR outperforms traditional backpressure at low load, while outperforming a state of the art encounter-routing <b>scheme</b> (<b>Spray</b> and Wait) at high load.

The South Pare area is the south-east sector of the Taveta-Pare Malaria Scheme, which in all covers about 3, 500 square miles with a total population of 100, 000, of whom about one-half lived in malarious places.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{elaborate}} how to implement Search-assisted Search (SAS) scheme on the ONE simulator and analyze whether it has better performance compared with other protocols (such as, Spray and Wait Routing Protocol). SAS is a search scheme that is designed for Delay- tolerant networks (DTN). The main characteristic of DTN is intermittent connectivity. There are two popular routing protocols, called Epidemic Routing Protocol and Spray and Wait Routing Protocol. Epidemic Routing Protocol {{is the one that}} floods an unlimited number of messages towards the desired destination. On the other hand, Spray and Wait Routing Protocol sprays a limited number of messages and delivers them to several nodes. When those nodes with a copy of the message encounter the desired destination, they will inform the one which initializes the search that the destination has been found. To improve search performance, SAS has several new properties: improvement of the number of contents' carriers and community. SAS contains the benefit of <b>Spray</b> and Wait <b>scheme,</b> which <b>sprays</b> a limited number of messages to the encountered nodes. This method accelerates the searching node to locate the content. However, only depending on spraying a number of messages is not enough. SAS increases the number of nodes carrying contents. Theoretically, this design improves the probability of locating the desired content. For making implementation of SAS on the ONE simulator easier, I involve a concept of geo-community. Geo-community represents the nodes having the similar interest are gathered together within geographical community...|$|R
40|$|Leek {{is one of}} the {{important}} outdoor crops in Europe in autumn and winter. White tip disease (Phytophthora porri) causes yearly yield and quality losses in leek during periods with abundant rainfall in autumn and winter. Papery white spots appear several days after the initial infection. When disease symptoms appear it is already too late to treat. Therefore leek growers tend to use calendar treatments which guarantee a disease-free crop. To {{meet the needs of the}} society which demands to reduce chemical control, it is essential to develop a prediction model for P. porri in leek. A prediction model requires knowledge about the pathogen, the host plant, the epidemiology of this pathogen on the host plant and the environmental factors influencing the epidemiology. In a first part of this dissertation a lot of research has been done on the pathogen itself. During two consecutive years, samples of diseased plants were collected at various locations in Flanders and P. porri was isolated from the infected tissue. The collected isolates of P. porri and isolates obtained from the CBS (Centraal Schimmelbureau, Utrecht, The Netherlands) were phylogenetically studied. Intraspecific variety among the isolates of P. porri and the interspecific genetic relationship with related Phytophthora species such as P. brassicae, P. primulae and P. syringae was elaborated using AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) analysis and sequencing of the ITS region. This revealed that the P. porri strains of leek clearly differ from P. brassicae, P. primulae and P. syringae. All isolates of P. porri from leek formed a homogeneous group and were hardly different from the strains of the CBS collection which were collected more than 20 years ago. This indicates that there has not been much pressure on P. porri to alter its genetic constitution. In a second part of this doctoral thesis, the epidemiology of P. porri in leek has been elucidated. The oospores in the soil are probably the only structures of P. porri surviving the crop free-period and consist the primary inoculum. When temperature is lower than 24 °C and free water is available, oospores germinate and form a germ-tube with one or more sporangia. The sporangia burst open resulting in large amounts of zoospores in free water and puddles in leek fields. During heavy rainfall the zoospores are splashed onto the leek plants where they attach to the leaf surface and encyst. In less than 12 hours a germ-tube is formed which directly penetrates the leaf by initiating an appressorium or indirectly by penetrating through the stomata. Once inside the leaf the hyphae grow intercellularly between the epidermal cells and ramify within the leaf leading to the typical disease symptoms of P. porri. Six days after initial infection oospores were recovered in the leaf pieces of the sensitive cultivar Apollo. It cannot be excluded that a secondary infection cycle occurs in periods with a lot of rainfall and high relative humidity. Periods without rainfall and low relative humidity lead to oospore formation in the leaves. These oospores return to the soil when the leaves die. Enviromental conditions will definitely influence the disease cycle of P. porri on leek. The amount of rainfall was the key factor determining the disease cycle of P. porri. Rainfall is indispensable to disperse the zoospores onto the leek plants. Relative humidity and leaf wetness, which are directly derived from the amount of rainfall, were optimal to initiate disease symptoms when there was a period with a lot of rainfall. All information of the previous parts was combined to develop an integrated disease management strategy for P. porri. Technical and cultural management such as crop rotation and good drainage of the soil form the basis of integrated control of P. porri in leek. Crop rotation is an often overlooked, but easy strategy to avoid P. porri. It is self-evident that a pathogen such as P. porri which relies on the availability of free water is suppressed when the field is well-drained. Unfortunately the cultivated farmland in Belgium is scarce making a crop rotation of 1 leek crop in 5 years become practically unfeasible. In addition to technical and cultural management, the use of resistant or tolerant cultivars constitute a serious option to avoid P. porri, but leek growers often choose their cultivar based on yield. Because biological control is not available in leek, chemical control with fungicides remains an indispensable tool to control P. porri in leek. The tested fungicides all inhibited mycelial growth and killed the zoospores of P. porri. When zoospores are abundant in the field, it is the optimal time-point to treat with fungicides. On one side the treatment will kill the zoospores which are abundant in the puddles and on the other side it protects leek plants against future infections. A lot of different models were tested on the vegetable research stations in Flanders during two consecutive years. These trials revealed that a simple decision rule, treat after 7. 5 l/m² rain on one day, can predict the presence of inoculum the field and subsequently justify a fungicide spray. During three weeks after this spray, the leek crop is protected and requires no additional fungicide treatments. In conclusion, this thesis elucidated the complete disease cycle of P. porri on leek. The mode of action of different fungicides on the mycelial growth and on the zoospores was verified. Insights in the disease cycle of P. porri and the mode of action of the different fungicides have resulted in an easy-to-use, but practically feasible, decision rule for treatments with fungicides against P. porri. Treating based on this simple decision rule of 7. 5 l/m² rainfall in one day, resulted in an equal amount of diseased plants as when sprayed with a tri-weekly <b>spraying</b> <b>scheme</b> with fewer fungicide treatments. This is an enormous step forward in the integrated control of P. porri on leek...|$|R
