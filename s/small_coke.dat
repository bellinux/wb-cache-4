40|$|AbstractThe {{simultaneous}} {{injection of}} pulverized coal and charcoal {{in the blast}} furnace has recently received remarkable attention due to its potential to decrease the coke consumption and increase productivity. This paper is focused on modeling the simultaneous injection of pulverized coal and charcoal into the blast furnace through the tuyeres with oxygen enrichment. This model treats the blast furnace as a multi-phase reactor and six phases are considered simultaneously, namely: gas, lump solids (lump iron ore, sinter, pellets, coke and <b>small</b> <b>coke),</b> hot metal, molten slag, pulverized coal and charcoal. Conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy and chemical species are solved simultaneously based on the finite volume method. The model is validated with a base case of actual operation using 215 kg/thm of pulverized coal injection and afterwards mixed injection of coal and charcoal are simulated for injection rate of 250 kg/thm. Model {{results indicated that the}} productivity of the blast furnace could be increased up to 25 % with simultaneous injection combined with oxygen enrichment...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} simulation procedure for analyzing hydrogen, oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} gases injections mixed with pulverized coals within the tuyeres of blast furnaces. Effective use of H 2 rich gas is highly attractive into the steelmaking blast furnace, considering the possibility of increasing the productivity and decreasing the specific {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} becoming the process less intensive in carbon utilization. However, the mixed gas and coal injection is a complex technology since significant changes on the inner temperature and gas flow patterns are expected, beyond to their effects on the chemical reactions and heat exchanges. Focusing on the evaluation of inner furnace status under such complex operation a comprehensive mathematical model has been developed using the multi interaction multiple phase theory. The BF, considered as a multiphase reactor, treats the lump solids (sinter, <b>small</b> <b>coke,</b> pellets, granular coke and iron ores), gas, liquids metal and slag and pulverized coal phases. The governing conservation equations are formulated for momentum, mass, chemical species and energy and simultaneously discretized using the numerical method of finite volumes. We verified the model with a reference operational condition using pulverized coal of 215  kg per ton of hot metal (kg thm− 1). Thus, combined injections of varying concentrations of gaseous fuels with H 2, O 2 and CO 2 are simulated with 220  kg thm− 1 and 250  kg thm− 1 coals injection.

40|$|Coke {{formation}} {{during the}} methanol-to-olefin (MTO) conversion {{has been studied}} at the single-particle level with in situ UV/Vis and confocal fluorescence microscopy. For this purpose, large H-ZSM- 5 crystals differing in their Si/Al molar ratio have been investigated. During MTO, performed at 623 and 773  K, three major UV/Vis bands assigned to different carbonaceous deposits and their precursors are observed. The absorption at 420  nm, assigned to methyl-substituted aromatic compounds, initiates the buildup of the optically active coke species. With time-on-stream, these carbonaceous compounds expand in size, resulting in the gradual development of a second absorption band at around 500  nm. An additional broad absorption band in the 600  nm region indicates the enhanced formation of extended carbonaceous compounds that form as the reaction temperature is raised. Overall, the rate of coke formation decreases with decreasing aluminum content. Analysis of the reaction kinetics indicates that an increased Brønsted acid site density facilitates the formation of larger coke species and enhances their formation rate. The use of multiple excitation wavelengths in confocal fluorescence microscopy enables the localization of coke compounds with different molecular dimensions in an individual H-ZSM- 5 crystal. It demonstrates that <b>small</b> <b>coke</b> species evenly spread throughout the entire H-ZSM- 5 crystal, whereas extended coke deposits primarily form near the crystal edges and surfaces. Polarization-dependent UV/Vis spectroscopy measurements illustrate that extended coke species are predominantly formed in the straight channels of H-ZSM- 5.

40|$|The {{hexagonal}} {{structure of the}} mesostructured silica nanoparticles (MSN) based solid acid catalyst was synthesized using 1, 2 -propanediol as a co-solvent by sol–gel method, followed by aluminum grafting and protonation. The activity of the catalysts was tested for cumene conversion in a pulse microcatalytic reactor at 323 – 573 K. XRD, TEM and N 2 physisorption results confirmed the hexagonal ordered structure with a pore diameter of 3. 4 – 4. 0 nm, a particle size of 70 – 120 nm and a surface area of 588 – 995 m 2 /g. Solid state NMR and IR results confirmed that the aluminum grafting and protonation form framework and extra-framework aluminums which led to generating strong Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. High activity in the cumene conversion was only observed on HAlMSN producing propylene, benzene, toluene via a cracking on protonic acid sites and producing a main product of α-methylstyrene via a dehydrogenation on Lewis acidic sites at high reaction temperature. While only α-methylstyrene and higher hydrocarbon (⩾C 10) were produced at low reaction temperature showing the permanent Brønsted acid sites did not involve in the cumene conversion.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study of the surface reactions that accompany the isomerization of butenes on a ferrierite (H-FER) catalyst by means of a packed-bed configured oscillating balance reactor (OBR). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and continuous mass spectrometric monitoring of the OBR product were used to discriminate between oligomerization and true coke formation. ^ Both 1 -butene and isobutene were contacted with the H-FER catalysts. For the n-butene-to-isobutene case, the modeling of the surface deposition process of high molecular weight species indicates that H-FER undergoes site blockage, followed by a pore blockage phase that sets in after c. a. 70 % the total uptake is achieved. Before reaching saturation uptake, a significant fraction of selective sites for isobutene formation are lost suggesting that such sites are unlikely to exist exclusively at the pore mouths of H-FER, as proposed earlier by other research groups. ^ For the isobutene adsorption/reaction case, the zeolite surface becomes covered with oligomeric hydrocarbons within the first few minutes on stream. There are a number of differences between the isobutene isomerization reaction and the n-butenes-to-isobutene transformation. The kinetically controlled regimes of these two reactions are roughly 70 K apart and the difference in apparent activation energies suggests that the two reactions are likely to proceed via different kinetic pathways. ^ DRIFTS and mass spectrometric results revealed that the production of octenes and/or higher oligomers goes through a maximum at short times on stream (i. e., before the zeolite pores reach saturation uptakes). This is consistent with the idea that bimolecular processes dominate the catalysis of fresh H-FER. A higher degree of branching in the oligomeric species formed by acid-catalyzed polymerization of isobutene, relative to those from 1 -butene, causes a <b>smaller</b> <b>coke</b> precursors critical uptake required to effect the site to pore blockage transition. The aging of such branched chains is slower than those resulting from a 1 -butene feed. ^ The impact of intrazeolitic oligomeric hydrocarbons on both its own formation rate and the skeletal isomerization process is also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Metallurgical coke for blast furnace and foundry use, and for some domestic boiler cokes are produced by carbonising coals in slot-type ovens. The coal is heated by heat transferred from the hot oven walls (usually 1250 °C) so that a temperature gradient is set up within the oven charge. A layer of plastic coal is formed (350 - 500 °C) which moves progressively towards the oven centre as carbonisation proceeds. Immediately after re-solidification, and again near 700 °C, the semi-coke suffers shrinkage as the carbon structure reorganises The post re-solidification shrinkage is the more severe and results in large, horizontal and vertical primary fissures being formed which allow breakage of the charge into lumps as it is pushed from the oven. A large central fissure, formed when the two plastic layers meet, divides the charge into two. Further breakage occurs at primary fissures on handling the coke after pushing. Smaller secondary fissures present in the resultant coke lump {{are believed to be}} a result of the shrinkage near 700 °C. Coke has three roles in the blast furnace: as a source of heat, a source of reducing agents and as a support for the burden. The latter function is particularly important {{at the bottom of the}} stack when coke is the only solid material present. The blast furnace output is dependent on the quantity of air that can be pushed up the stack. This depends on the permeability of the coke bed in the lower reaches of the stack. To maintain permeability, the coke should not suffer size degradation as it progresses down the stack; a mixture of large and <b>small</b> <b>coke</b> particles is disastrous. Thus coke quality tends to be assessed in terms of resistance to size degradation in a drum test. Size degradation occurs as a result of volumetric breakage at fissures and abrasion of surfaces. Brittle fracture theory suggests that volumetric breakage should occur as a result of the propagation of secondary fissures in coke lumps [...] ...|$|E

40|$|During {{iron ore}} sintering, {{material}} coalescence {{in the bed}} determines the physical properties of the agglomerated product. Sinter density and structural quantification by 2 D image analysis were used to elucidate the degree of coalescence and densification achieved during sintering. In the first program, samples - representing increasing temperatures - were obtained from three locations down a sintered bed. Sinter density, determined by liquid pycnometry, {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on green granulated bed bulk density. Image analysis results indicated a strong dependence between sinter density and porosity. Results also show that more coalescence occurs for blends containing porous ores at increasing sintering temperatures. When sinter basicity and/or coke rate is low the effect of temperature on coalescence is less pronounced for all blends. The second program compared coalescence using 19 to 21 mm sinter from eight different pot tests and blends containing significant porous ores. For the same ore blend sintered under different conditions, measured trends in sinter density and porosity were in line with expectations but the changes were not large because the material in sinter has a high specific gravity of over four and changes in porosity were less than 5 %.

In zeolite Y an exponential decay in conversion was observed with {{the rate of}} deactivation being slower at supercritical conditions at 235 °C and 40 bar than subcritical conditions at 235 °C and 10 bar.

In order to meet the weight and field of view requirements a highly innovative optical and detector assembly was developed. The optical assembly through the CCD has a volume <b>smaller</b> than a <b>coke</b> can and weighs less than a pound. The associated electronics, including an embedded R 3000 processor, occupies two 8 x 10 inch boards. The system was originally designed to provide three axis accuracy of. 05 °. Subsequent evaluations indicated that a. 02 ° accuracy can be obtained. In 1993 the optical system has been modified to be more compatible with typical satellite real estate priorities. The field of view has been extended to provide a clear 30 ° area in the center in addition to the original annular field. These modifications will make it easier to integrate ERADS with satellites and will also improve performance. The resulting sensor package now has a configuration more closely approximated by a tuna can. A processor design incorporating high density interconnect technology is being developed which will greatly reduce the weight and dimensions. The resulting package should fit within the tuna can envelope. As the system has evolved, it has become clear that better accuracy can be obtained by relying more heavily on stars for attitude determination, and using the earth limb data primarily for navigation purposes. The combination of earth and star sensing in a single small package should serve to further reduce the burdens of attitude determination for smallsats. The processor section of ERADS is scheduled for a flight test in 1994. The entire system is under consideration for an experiment on another 1994 flight...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of hydrocarbons over zeolites {{has been applied}} in large scale petroleum-refining processes. However, there is always formation and retention of heavy by-products, called coke, which causes catalyst deactivation. This deactivation {{is due to the}} poisoning of the acid sites and/or pore blockage. The formation of coke on hydrocarbon processing catalysts is of considerable technological and economic importance {{and a great deal of}} work has been carried out to this study. The main aim of this work is to understand the deactivation of zeolite catalysts as a result of coke deposition. The deactivation by coke of USHY zeolite was investigated during {{catalytic conversion}} of hydrocarbons – 1 -pentene, n-heptane and ethylbenzene – as representatives of olefins, paraffins and aromatics respectively, at different reaction temperatures, time-on-streams and composition. Three novel techniques, coke classification, thermogravimetric method for characterising coke precursors and indirect temperature programmed desorption (TPD) for catalyst acid sites characterisation were developed to further study catalyst deactivation mechanism. Product distribution, coke formation, characterisation of coke precursors, as well as the role of strong acid sites on hydrocarbon reactions are presented and discussed. During catalytic reactions of 1 -pentene over USHY zeolite, cracking and hydride transfer were the predominant reactions in initial stage which deactivated rapidly allowing isomerisation to become the main reaction afterwards. Deactivation studies showed that coke formation was very strong initially which is in good correlation with the initial rapid deactivation. The hydrogen freed during this initial time from the formation of high C/H ratio coke components contributed to the formation of hydride transfer products. The amount of coke precursors decrease with increasing reaction temperature due to the higher desorption of coke precursors into gas phase while hard coke amount increased with temperature as expected from an activated process. The coke amount formed was not proportional to the reactant feed composition, because of a strong pseudo-zeroth- order initial coking on strong acidic sites. The thermogravimetric method provides insight into the chemical character of coke precursor components in terms of the mode of their removal and allows further classification of <b>coke</b> precursors into <b>small</b> and large <b>coke</b> precursors. The concentration and strength of acid sites of coked catalysts were studied by the TPD methodology. Besides, characterisation of coke precursors was also revealed. The initial deactivation preferentially on strong acid sites is very fast. The concentration of free acid sites is inversely correlated well with the total concentration of coke rather than individual coke groups. Coke precursors tend to be more stable at higher reaction temperatures. Furthermore, by selectively poisoning strong acid sites of USHY zeolite, it shows conclusively that strong acid sites are responsible for cracking and hydride transfer reactions as well as strong coke formation while weak acid sites can only catalyse double bond isomerisation. ...|$|R
40|$|International @ RAFFINAGE+EBL:PDE:CLO:JMI:SLOInternational audienceIntroduction Acrylic acid (AA) is a {{platform}} molecule produced at 4 Mt/year by selective oxidation of propene, whose price is growing quickly because of increasing demand and rarefaction of petroleum. An alternative route to produce acrylic acid consists in dehydration of lactic acid (LA) {{that can be}} yielded by dehydrogenation of glycerol [1] or direct fermentation of sugars 2. However, AA is rarely obtained selectively from LA because of easy decarbonylation leading to acetaldehyde (A) and CO. High yields to AA were obtained using modified zeolites [3], hydroxyapatites (HAP) [4] for LA conversion and calcium phosphates {{in the case of}} methyl lactate conversion [5]. In the present work, alkaline-earth pyrophosphates (PP), orthophosphates (OP) and HAP were prepared and evaluated for gas phase dehydration of LA and ethyl lactate (EL). From characterization of structural and acid-base properties, relationships with the catalytic efficiency have been established. Experimental Catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation method. As residual Na was detected for some catalysts prepared using Na containing precursors, Na was added in their labeling. Catalytic testing was carried out in gas phase at several temperatures (300 - 390 °C) and contact times (0. 1 - 10 s). They were characterized by XRD, FTIR spectroscopy, BET measurements and ICP analysis. The surface characterization was obtained by both XPS and 1 H- 31 P CP-MAS NMR. Acid-Base proprieties were measured by NH 3 /CO 2 -TPD respectively and pyridine adsorption followed by FTIR. Results and Discussion Good performances were obtained for LA conversion for different OP and PP catalysts with selectivity to AA reaching 50 % near complete conversion. The main by-product was A (30 %) limiting enhancement of LA dehydration. Catalysts were stable for at least 24 hours and only <b>small</b> amounts of <b>coke</b> were evidenced after reaction. The optimized temperature of 380 °C was shown to favor AA desorption without thermal degradation. Close performances were obtained with different structures which can be explained by kinetic limitations or similar surface species. Surface characterization revealed the presence of a hydrogenated phosphate phase different from the bulk. Conversion of EL strongly inhibited the decarbonylation pathway (A selectivity of 4 - 10 %) enhancing the dehydration pathway (AA+EA selectivity of 87 %) although lower activities were observed. Decreasing contact time enhanced the AA selectivity without affecting the EA one indicating that two pathways took place on two different active sites: direct dehydration and simultaneous hydrolysis-dehydration of EL. HAP were less selective for LA dehydration but, in the case of EL dehydration, they showed to be promising systems since higher yields to valuable products such as AA and EA were achieved. AL and EL conversions showed that different active sites had to be considered, probably because in LA conversion, the vapor partial pressure of the feed was high (66 %) contrarily to EL conversion (0 %). The NH 3 and CO 2 TPD profiles were similar with only weak and moderated strength sites. It suggested that high proportion of acid-base pairs were present at the surface as confirmed by the low acid to base balances (0. 9 - 2. 1). For AL conversion, correlation between the AA selectivity and this balance was established, while for EL conversion, the catalysts with the weakest acid and base strengths exhibit the best performances without excluding that the nature of sites (Lewis and Brřnsted) might also influence the catalytic performances...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the speciation of PM 10 sources of airborne Pb, Zn, and Cd metals (PM 10 is an aerosol standard of aerodynamic diameter less than 10 m.) in the atmosphere of a 3 km zone surrounding lead/zinc facilities in operation for a century. Many powdered samples were collected in stacks of working units (grilling, furnace, and refinery), outdoor storages (ores, recycled materials), surrounding waste slag (4 Mt), and polluted topsoils (3 km). PM 10 samples were generated from the raw powders by using artificial resuspension and collection devices. The bulk PM 10 multielemental analyses were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The proportions in mass of Pb (50 %), Zn (40 %), and Cd (1 %) contents and associated metals (traces) reach the proportions of corresponding raw powdered samples of ores, recycled materials, and fume-size emissions of plants without specific enrichment. In contrast, Pb (8 %) and Zn (15 %) contents of PM 10 of slag deposit were found to be markedly higher than those of raw dust, Pb (4 %), and Zn (9 %), respectively. In the same way, Pb (0. 18 %), Zn (0. 20 %), and Cd (0. 004 %) were enriched by 1. 7, 2. 1, and 2. 3 times, respectively, in PM 10 as compared with raw top-soil corresponding values. X-ray wavelength dispersive electron-microprobe (EM-WDS) microanalysis did not indicate well-defined phases or simple stoichiometries of all the PM 10 samples at the level of the spatial resolution (1 m 3). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that minor elements such as Cd, Hg, and C are more concentrated on the particle surface than in the bulk of PM 10 generated by the smelting processes. (XPS) provided also the average speciation of the surface of PM 10; Pb is mainly represented as PbSO 4, Zn as ZnS, and Cd as CdS or CdSO 4, and <b>small</b> amounts of <b>coke</b> were also detected. The speciation of bulk PM 10 crystallized compounds was deduced from XRD diffractograms with a raw estimation of the relative quantities. PbS and ZnS were found to be the major phases in PM 10 generated by the smelting facilities with PbSO 4, PbSO 4 ·PbO, PbSO 4 · 4 PbO, Pb metal, and ZnO as minor phases. The slag waste PM 10 was found to contain some amounts of PbCO 3, PbSO 4 ·PbO, and ZnFe 2 O 4 phases. The large heterogeneity at the level of the individual particle generates severe overlap of chemical information even at the m scale using electron microprobe (WDS) and Raman microprobe techniques. Fortunately, scanning Raman microspectrometry combined with SIMPle-to-use Interactive Self-modeling Mixture Analysis (SIMPLISMA) performed the PM 10 speciation at the level of individual particles. The speciation of major Pb, Zn, and Cd compounds of PM 10 stack emissions and wind blown dust of ores and recycled materials were found to be PbSO 4, PbSO 4 ·PbO, PbSO 4 · 4 PbO, PbO, metallic Pb, ZnS, ZnO, and CdS. The PM 10 dust of slag waste was found to contain PbCO 3, Pb(OH) 2 · 2 PbCO 3, PbSO 4 ·PbO, and ZnS, while PM 10 -bound Pb, Zn of the top-soils contain Pb 5 (PO 4) 3 Cl, ZnFe 2 O 4 as well as Pb(II) and Zn(II) compounds adsorbed on Fe(III) oxides and in association with clays...|$|R
40|$|The energy demands by the {{industrial}} world are continuing to rise, while the rate of new oil discoveries is falling. Within the next 30 years, available petroleum supplies are likely to fail to meet the demand, and oil {{will no longer be}} able to serve as the world’s major energy source. Coal, being relatively abundant worldwide and potentially adaptable for use in existing plants that have been engineered for petroleum use, can serve as an inexpensive substitute for, or successor to, the more expensive oil fuels in use today. Graphitisable carbon is one of the high-value products from petroleum as its value lies partly in the nuclear industry. Making graphitisable isotropic carbon from well-purified coal is therefore a primary motivation for this study. However, its purity is far too low. Substantial purification is obtained by dissolving the organic part of coal in dimethylformamide with the addition of a little alkali. Results indicated that more than 90 % of the organic part of a 10 % ash flotation product dissolved in N, N dimethylformamide on addition of 10 % NaOH. The bulk of the impurities are removed by centrifugation and the dissolved organic material is recovered by water precipitation. Subsequently, the ash level is lowered from 10 % in the coal to high S- 2 coal extracts derived at high temperature (GSF- 25 HT) and no S- 2 coal extracts derived at room temperature (GSF- 0 RT) > no S- 2 coal extracts derived at high temperature (GSF- 0 HT), corresponding to 79 > 75 % and 67 > 25 % respectively. The interlayer spacing (d 002 -value) of the graphites follows the order GSF- 25 RT (3. 37 Å) 61 > 62 %, corresponding to 0. 44 > 0. 88 > 1. 60 acetylene black. With the addition of carbon black, the decreasing order of graphitisation was 57. 7 > 56. 5 > 51. 5 %, corresponding to 0. 44 > 0. 88 > 1. 60 wt % respectively. The interlayer spacing d 002, increased in the same order, suggesting a shift towards a turbostratic and formation of a poorly graphitised, and turbostratic carbon. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the intensity ratio R of the g to the d peak decreased with increasing dosage of the carbon additive. Cokes produced from the coal extracts prepared at 25 oC but without S- 2 showed also a remarkable degree of flow texture. Its crystalline domain units were relatively <b>small.</b> The resin-mounted <b>coke</b> samples observed under an optical microscope (objective x 25) showed reduced flow texture with the addition of carbon black. The graphitisability of the resultant cokes also decreased on addition of carbon black. The optimum dosage observed for reducing the flow texture without reducing the crystallinity was found to be < 0. 22 %. Improved degree of graphitisation of the carbon was studied on addition of iron (lll) compounds. Iron (lll) compounds showed a promising improvement in the graphitisability of the carbon when added in small amounts. The intracellular hard carbon is converted to soft carbon, thereby improving the degree of graphitisation. The overall effect was a more isotropic graphitic carbon but the degree of graphitisation obtained was far too low: on addition of 1 % and 3 % (by wt) of iron (lll), the compounds were 21 % and 27 % respectively. Oxygen intrusion into the precursor’s coal material prior to heat treatment is thought to have inhibited the degree of graphitisation. Increasing the amounts of the iron (lll) compound and prohibiting the intrusion of oxygen during mixing could improve the graphitisability of carbon. However, the optimum amount to be used remains an important subject to be explored in future. Thesis (PhD (Chemistry)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Chemistryunrestricte...|$|R
