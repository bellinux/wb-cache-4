40|$|Over {{the last}} decades the amount of weeds in our fields have noticeably decreased. The easily annihilated and {{susceptible}} species were almost eradicated by means of herbicides and agrotechnical operations. Their place was taken by more resistant species, which are a huge problem for the farmers. For this purpose I decided to make an experiment under the working circumstances. I observed the occurrence of the weeds in certain localities. Especially I concentrated on the <b>silky</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti), on its occurrence, regulation, extension and susceptibility or resistance to certain herbicides. The effect of the tested herbicide combinations was statistically significant for <b>silky</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> {{as well as for}} the other weeds (P 0. 05). The coach grass was the only exception, where the effect of these preparations was not proved, as well as Vicia cracca, Lamium purpurem, Galium aparine, Geranium pusillum (P > 0. 05). However the coach grass appeared among these inconclusively responsive weeds more frequently. (P > 0. 05). As the results of experiment showed, the most effective combinations for elimination of the <b>silky</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti) were Sumimax + Glean, Cugar Forte + Glean + Dural a Cugar Forte + Logran. All these combinations were proved to be 100 % effective against the <b>silky</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti). The other combinations were not 100 % effective. These comprised Rapsan + Command+ Grounded with 89 % effectivity, Sumimax + Logran 91 % effectivity a Butisan+ Clomate+ Grounded 67 % effectivity. The results show that the <b>silky</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti) is more susceptible to some herbicide combinations and in the fields it can be successfully reduced. On the contrary the <b>silky</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti) is resilient to some other agents. From this point of view the right choice of the herbicides is crucial in next year...|$|E
40|$|Three {{populations of}} <b>silky</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti L.) were tested – {{one that is}} {{susceptible}} and two that are resistant to sulfonylureas. This study assessed the efficacy of control by different herbicides in a pot experiment and estimated the molecular status of resistance to sulfonylureas in analysed populations {{and its effect on}} the efficacy of different chemical treatments. The three most effective herbicide rotation schemes were: 1) chlorsulfuron + isoproturon, ethametsulfuron + metazachlor + quinmerac, chlorsulfuron + isoproturon; 2) prosulfocarb + diflufenican, ethametsulfuron + quizalofop-p-ethyl, prosulfocarb + diflufenican; 3) diflufenican + flufenacet, quizalofop-p-ethyl, diflufenican + flufenacet. In most cases it was more difficult to destroy 100 % of the resistant population from Modgarby where the majority of plants had no mutation in the als gene. In the resistant population from Babin there were significantly more individuals with mutation in the als gene, therefore exhibiting target-site resistance...|$|E
40|$|<b>Silky</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti (L.) P. Beauv.) is {{a common}} weed of cereal crops widely spread in Northern and Easthern Europe (Germany, Czech Republic, [...] .), Northern Asia, Sibera and Canada. Up to now, no {{resistant}} case has been detected in Belgium but some chemical weeding failures have been observed in Wallonia fields. During summer 2011, 37 seed samples of Apera spica-venti were collected in Wallonia and submitted to resistance tests in controlled conditions. Three modes of action were tested: acetyl coenzyme-A carboxylase inhibitors (pinoxaden and cycloxydim), acetolactate synthase inhibitores (mesosulfuron+iodosulfuron, pytroxsulam and sulfometuron) and photosynthesis inhibitors (isoproturon).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Bachelor´s {{work was}} to extend the {{findings}} from the classical aspect as well as the minimalizing method of soil tillage and suggest the possibilities of successful regulation of weeds on arable land for growing winter wheat. On the experimental field where the soil was processed by classical tillage appear less dangerous weeds, which were destroyed by application of herbicide and their number was minimal. There were mainly dangerous weeds on the experimental field cultivated by minimalizing, like <b>Silky</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> and Cleavers. Even if the herbicide applications significantly reduced them, there were a few individuals in the experimental plots. In the economic comparison was found that there is not big difference in cost in both variants of tillage, but the conventional method of processing in this case is cheaper. At the soil endangered by erosion would be better to choose the minimalizing method as an appropriate variant of tillage. But it is needed on all soils cultivated by this method choose different depth of tillage, including the use of deep processing undermining or classical plowing...|$|E
40|$|Ploughless {{cropping}} systems {{are becoming increasingly}} important in organic farming. The crop rotation trial in Güterfelde, Brandenburg, shows the long-term effects they have on weed infestation. Ploughless farming was practiced on a crop rotation system comprising of seven fields {{for a period of}} 16 years, with disc harrows and chisel cultivators being used instead. The assessment in spring before silage maize showed that, in comparison with farming systems using ploughs, long-term no-till farming increased the level of monocotyledonous weeds by a factor of 5. 9 and the level of dicotyledonous weeds by a factor of 1. 6. The total weed coverage ratio increased by a factor of 4. 7. Weed cover also increased by a factor of 5 in the non-competitive lupin population following long-term ploughless farming. The problem grass weed is Apera spica-venti. The number of <b>silky</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> panicles has increased in relation to the competitive ability of crop plant: For example by the factor of 1. 9 in winter rye and 12, 4 in winter triticale. Apera spica-venti dominated the blue lupin population due to ploughless farming. Organic farms need to counteract the significantly higher degree of weed infestation following long-term ploughless farming by using situable multiannual rotation systems combined with more intensive weed control. There is still a problem in managing the strong infestation by Apera spica-venti with ploughless farming for a long time...|$|E

Nutritional factors in vitro were more complex for the isolates from fescue than for the isolate from <b>bent</b> <b>grass.</b> These studies suggested that E. typhina includes biotypes that might be involved in the toxicity syndrome. The fescue biotypes grew poorly on media, and yields were inadequate for toxicity studies.

5000|$|The {{grass of}} the putting green (more {{commonly}} just [...] "green") is cut very short {{so that a}} ball can roll for a long distance. The most common types of greens for cold winter, but warmer summer regions (i.e., not extremely warm, as in the Southern and Southwestern United States) are <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> greens. A green may consist of a thin carpet so that bad weather {{is not allowed to}} become a serious factor in maintaining the course. These are considered the best greens because they may be cut to an extremely low height, and because they may be grown from seed. <b>Bent</b> <b>grass</b> does not have grain, which makes it superior as a putting surface. However, <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> may become infested with poa annua, a costly and time-consuming weed. Augusta National is one of many golf courses to use this type of green. The original design of Augusta National did not include <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> greens, but in the 1980s the controversial decision was made to convert the greens from Bermuda to <b>bent</b> <b>grass.</b> This has affected the speed and playing of Augusta National. [...] Many other golf courses subsequently made the decision to change from Bermuda to <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> when they observed increased business at courses that had already changed over. Another type of grass common for greens is TifDwarf Hybrid Bermuda (other variants exist, but TifDwarf {{is one of the most}} common), or simply Bermuda grass. Bermuda is more common in regions that have very warm summers and mild winters, such as the Southern and Southwestern United States. Red Bridge Golf Course was the first course in North Carolina to utilize a special Bermuda called Mini Verde. A green is generally established from sod which has had the soil washed off of it (to avoid soil compatibility problems) and which is then laid tightly over the green, then rolled and topdressed with fine sand. Another common and more economical approach for establishing a putting green is to introduce hybrid Bermuda spriggs (the stolon of the grass which are raked out at the sod farm), which are laid out on the green. The best greens are always established vegetatively and never from seed.|$|R
