5000|$|Other Minds is a San Francisco based private 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit organization, {{founded in}} 1992 by Charles Amirkhanian (who serves as Executive and Artistic Director) and Jim Newman (President Emeritus). According to their mission statement: Other Minds, Inc., is {{dedicated}} to the encouragement and propagation of contemporary music in all its forms through concerts, workshops and conferences that bring together artists and audiences of diverse traditions, generations and cultural backgrounds. By fostering cross-cultural exchange and creative dialogue and by encouraging exploration of areas in new music <b>seldom</b> <b>touched</b> <b>upon</b> by mainstream music institutions, Other Minds is committed to expanding and reshaping the definition of what constitutes [...] "serious music.". [...] The name [...] "Other Minds" [...] has been attributed by Jim Newman to an anonymous obituary that ran in the New Yorker in 1992 which stated that John Cage [...] "...composed music in other people's minds." [...] Other Minds has achieved wide recognition and acclaim including the ASCAP award in 2009 for adventurous programming and the American Music Center's 2005 letter of distinction for service to American composers.|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point of my paper is the observation that the methodological foundation for reading the Book of Psalms as a book is still somewhat wanting. This {{is not to say}} that it should not be read as a book, rather that there exists some confusion as to how the (supposedly intentional) ‘final’ message is conveyed. Synchronic readings, focusing the theology of the entire book, are not always kept distinct from diachronic considerations, questions of how individual psalms relate to the whole collection is not always made clear, and the (perhaps most important) question regarding how intention or purpose is to be detected is <b>seldom</b> <b>touched</b> <b>upon.</b> Divergence in approaches to these issues are often great, seen in particular as one e. g. compares the work of Gerald H Wilson to the work of Erich Zenger, and consequently, this needs some further consideration. So, after a brief presentation of commonalities, but foremost differences, between some main contributors to the understanding of the ‘shape’ of the Book of Psalms (e. g. the works of W Brueggemann, J Creach, N L deClaissé-Walford, P W Flint, S Gillingham, F-L Hossfeld, D M Howard, J L Mays, J C McCann Jr, D C Mitchell, G T Sheppard, G H Wilson, E Zenger, and others), I intend to tackle the question of ‘seamingly’ important psalms (the misspelling being intentional). Dealing with this fundamental question of which psalms (or parts of psalms) that ought to be considered in a discussion on the final ‘shape’ of the collec- tion, or, in other words, the question of what actually constitutes a ‘seam’, will prove vital to any discussion of the ‘purpose’ of the collection, as well as to my own doctoral project, since it very much affects the selection of psalms to be studied...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ideas of cure {{within the}} psychoanalytical {{movement}} have mainly focused on 'insight' or 'interpersonal relationship'. Patients' ideas of curative factors {{during and after}} therapy have been studied previously, {{as well as their}} expectancies and preferences prior to treatment. Aims: This project aimed at studying psychoanalytic psychotherapy with young adults from the viewpoints of ideas of cure among patients, and outcome, and how these two aspects are related to each other. Method: Patients (n= 134) between 18 and 25 years were included. The mean time in therapy was 15 months. The therapists were highly trained and had long professional experience. Two included studies concern a subgroup of 46 patients in individual psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Ideas of cure were explored using the Private Theories Interview (PTI). Therapeutic alliance was assessed using the Revised Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAQ-II). Outcome was measured using the Symptom Checklist - 90 (SCL 90 -R), Self-Rated Health (SRH), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP), Structural Analysis of Social Behavior Intrex Questionnaire (SASB), and Differentiation-Relatedness Scale (DRS). Patients were typologised based on their ideas of cure using 'ideal type analysis'. Results: Twenty separate categories of ideas of cure were found. The typologisation of individuals resulted in seven types, conceptualized as being positioned along the dimension 'approaching-distancing'. The patients showed improvement on all outcome measures in terms of pre- versus post-therapy effect sizes. Patients who terminated therapy prematurely were significantly closer to the 'distancing' pole regarding ideas of cure, while the therapy completers were more often found near the,approaching' pole. No associations were found between ideas of cure and early alliance or outcome at termination. An explorative study of four cases showed that the therapists in the more successful cases early in therapy made interpretative interventions directed at obstacles to the therapeutic work. Conclusions: A majority of the patients had ideas of cure that were in line with psychoanalytic psychotherapy. However, these ideas emphasized the 'insight' aspect of psychotherapy and <b>seldom</b> <b>touched</b> <b>upon</b> the 'interpersonal relationship' aspect. The patients' improvements during therapy were larger than would have been expected from spontaneous remission. The introductory sessions seem to be of vital importance in helping patients to engage in a potentially beneficial therapy. Hypotheses were generated that it is beneficial with a therapist listening to the patient's ideas and making interpretative interventions focusing on obstacles to the therapeutic work...|$|E
30|$|Since Kellogg et al. (see [1]) and Smale (see [2]) {{proposed}} the notable homotopy method, this method {{has become a}} powerful tool in dealing with various nonlinear problems, for example, zeros or fixed points of maps (see [3 – 5], etc. and the references therein). However, the homotopy method has <b>seldom</b> been <b>touched</b> <b>upon</b> in constrained optimization until 1988, Megiddo (see [6]) and Kojima et al. (see [7]) discovered the Karmarkar interior point method for linear programming {{was a kind of}} path-following method. From then on, the central path-following methods for mathematical programming have become an active research subject. Furthermore, it was extended to convex nonlinear programming problems recently (see [8 – 11], etc.). But all their convergence results were obtained under the assumptions that the logarithmic barrier function is strictly convex and the solution set is nonempty and bounded.|$|R
60|$|The rain pattered {{upon the}} roof and the sky gloomed through the dusty garret-windows while I burrowed among these venerable books in search of any living thought which should burn like a coal of fire or glow like an inextinguishable gem beneath the dead trumpery that had long hidden it. But I found no such treasure; all was dead alike; and I could not but muse deeply and wonderingly upon the humiliating fact that the works of man's intellect decay like those of his hands. Thought grows mouldy. What was good and nourishing food for the spirits of one {{generation}} affords no sustenance for the next. Books of religion, however, cannot be considered a fair test of the enduring and vivacious properties of human thought, because such books so <b>seldom</b> really <b>touch</b> <b>upon</b> their ostensible subject, and have, therefore, so little business to be written at all. So long as an unlettered soul can attain to saving grace there {{would seem to be}} no deadly error in holding theological libraries to be accumulations of, for the most part, stupendous impertinence.|$|R
60|$|During {{the first}} part of our {{confinement}} we felt a cold chill at our hearts every time we heard a footfall near the cave, dreading lest it should prove to be that of our executioner. But as time dragged heavily on we ceased to feel this alarm, and began to experience such a deep, irrepressible longing for freedom that we chafed and fretted in our confinement like tigers. Then a feeling of despair came over us, and we actually longed for the time when the savages would take us forth to die. But these changes took place very gradually, and were mingled sometimes with brighter thoughts; for there were times when we sat, in that dark cavern on our ledge of rock, and conversed almost pleasantly about the past until we well-nigh forgot the dreary present. But we <b>seldom</b> ventured to <b>touch</b> <b>upon</b> the future.|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} deepen our {{understanding}} of Chinese travellers’ travel experience and the meanings they derived from their holiday in the UK by critically analysing the largest online travel community in China, namely www. go 2 eu. com. This is an online community created by travellers themselves, hence the traveller-generated content are rich. Despite the growing importance of Chinese outbound travel market, a qualitative {{understanding of what it}} is like to be a Chinese traveller in the UK is still an under-researched area. In addition, with the advancement of Internet technology and the emergence of online communities, our social world has been increasingly influenced by online communities. Using the literature on experiential theory, tourism studies and online cultures, this study offers a qualitative understanding of this phenomenon. This study adopts ethnography to research Chinese travellers’ travel experience in the UK. The main data collection is based on a non-participant netnography in a chosen website www. go 2 eu. com. It is found that their travel experiences are very diverse. They prefer independent and immersive travel experience. They are interested in knowing about the UK culture, history and how the locals live their lives. They are experience-seekers whose experiences are dotted with moments of imaginative states, emotional responses and culturally rooted meanings. In total, the findings of the study identified five main themes, namely language and self-identity, experience of holiday time, experience of holiday space, bodily feelings and emotions. A key contribution to new knowledge is the offering of rich qualitative insights and a theoretical framework for understanding Chinese travellers’ travel experience in the UK, which can be generalised in future studies. Such qualitative insights can not only be of great value to those designing marketing communication and memorable experiences and precipitates effective tourism management but also useful for academic studies seeking to understand the differences between the behaviour and experiences of travellers from different cultures. As well as their experience of travelling in local tour groups, this study especially offers rich insights about {{what it is like to}} be a non-all-inclusive package tourist travelling from developing countries to developed countries. Moreover, this study adds understanding about the experience of holiday time, which is a relatively under-discussed area in the literature. The experience of poetic space and the active aesthetic experience of highest absorption also add new lights to existing tourism literature. Further, this study address the influence of online community plays on Chinese travellers’ self-identities and language, experience of holiday time, holiday space and bodily emotions, which is <b>seldom</b> <b>touched</b> <b>upon.</b> On top of that, the methodology of this study also enriches the newly emerged literature on online qualitative methods...|$|E
40|$|After the {{comparison}} and contrast {{of the four}} schools, it is propounded that in the establishment and developing process of a professional learning community, its core, teachers' collaborative culture, also displays a developmental process from individualism and comfortable collaboration to organizationally induced collegiality and interdependent collegiality. A supportive system is the guarantee of the teachers' collaborative culture; {{and the key to}} facilitate the birth of this culture as well as the building of a professional learning community lies on the principals' leadership style which put attention both on the management strategies and the leading strategies. Based on the result revealed from the questionnaire survey and data of the case studies, it is found that professional learning community, as an introduced concept from the west, has its local significance in primary schools in the three cities of mainland China, supporting the theoretical structure built by the following four professional learning community dimensions [...] -Shared decision making; Shared sense of purpose and focus on student learning; collaborative activity and deprivatized practice; Staff support and cooperation. The features of the abovementioned dimensions also possess their local flavor: degree of the shared decision making is relatively low and the teachers rarely participate in the financial and personnel decision-making, but own more authority within their professional field; secondly, students' exam scores are more emphasized in the aspect of the focus on student learning, but this varies from the schools according to its realization of professional learning community; thirdly, as for collaborative activity and deprivatized practice, collaboration among teaching practice are bolstered by the traditional "teaching research system", nevertheless there is a gap between the system and the actual outcome of the activities; lastly, the uniform teaching research system, to some extent, provides teachers' cooperation with much support, but is overweighed by the collaborative culture among teachers. Mixed methods are adopted in this research, in which the questionnaires are delivered in three cities (including Shanghai) of mainland China in order to know the features and the realization of professional learning community in primary schools in Shanghai. It is then followed a purposeful sampling {{on the basis of the}} data analysis from the questionnaires, and four schools will be chosen out as the cases to probe into the relationship between professional learning community and teacher development. The major methods for the data collection include questionnaire survey, in-depth interview, participant observation and document collection. The professional learning community being the one side, the teachers' development is interactively on the other, and the key platform for their interaction is teacher development activities. The contents of teacher development activities vary in different schools of different realization of professional learning community, and also diverse in the interaction between professional learning community and teachers' teacher development. Meanwhile, the second round curriculum reform in Shanghai being the common backdrop, it on one hand offers three platforms to the interaction between professional learning community and teacher development, and on the other hand is itself affected by this interaction. Especially under the pressure of "moderate empowerment and high responsibility" in the second round curriculum reform, teachers are supported by professional learning community in terms of empowerment and responsibility, and are also aided to seek for their professional identities, which leads to the achievement of teachers' real proactive professional development. With the advent of a transitional era, the field of education is likewise undergoing a global reform. However, in retrospect of the educational reforms launched by various countries in the past thirty years, the aspect of class teaching is <b>seldom</b> <b>touched</b> <b>upon.</b> The academia therefore gives increasing emphasis on teachers as well as teachers' communities, and the concept of professional learning community thus comes into being. In the recent years, the studies on professional learning community have been proliferated in the west, and are gradually introduced into our country, but the related empirical studies in China still remain a virgin land. 宋萑.
