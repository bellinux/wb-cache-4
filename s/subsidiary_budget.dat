50|$|Hollywood was {{producing}} three different classes of feature films {{by means of}} three different types of producers. The superior products were the large, budget blockbusters and high-cost star vehicles marketed by the six major studio producer-distributors. Budgets on the major studios’ pictures averaged $100 million, with approximately one-third of it spent on marketing {{because of the large}} release campaigns. Another class of Hollywood feature film included art films, specialty films, and other niche-market fare controlled by the conglomerates’ indie <b>subsidiaries.</b> <b>Budgets</b> on these indie films averaged $40 million per release in the early 2000s, with $10 million to $15 million spent on marketing (MPA, 2006:12). The final class of film consisted of genre and specialty films administered by independent producer-distributors with only a few dozen or possibly a few hundred-release campaigns screens in select urban markets. Films like these usually cost less than $10 million, but frequently less than $5 million, with small marketing budgets that escalate if and when a particular film performs.|$|R

5000|$|As {{mainstream}} pop vocals {{in the hit}} market {{began to}} give way to rock n' roll hits, Hit Parader type versions of these began to sound considerably more quaint and old-fashioned compared to the originals.

Grand Award continued, but at this point Waldorf Music Hall became dormant, having served its short-lived purpose.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recent {{developments}} in identifying {{economic and social}} phenomena within the theory and laws of physics do not provide a sufficient basis of information for economists. In this article, an interdisciplinary analysis in microeconomics, is proposed to overcome this limit by establishing a new economic theory {{in the way of}} better analyzing economic problems from the methodological perspectives of physics. This new theoretical approach is tested on a model using individual time use values that identifies how life satisfaction may be defined through economic utility so as to better investigate the income-happiness paradox as pointed out by Easterlin. The theoretical analysis point out that an increase in happiness would depend on the ability to replace subsidiaries with conspicuous consumption so long as they have common characteristics that satisfy the same needs. This consumption pattern implies that consumers would draw more satisfaction from less usage of conspicuous goods than from higher usage of <b>subsidiaries,</b> under given <b>budget</b> and time constraints...|$|R
50|$|The 2008 Parliamentary {{elections}} were especially controversial, with the MPRP {{being accused of}} vote rigging. Protests against the results turned violent on 1 July, and a riot ensued. Not enough measures to stop the riot or extinguish the resulting fires were taken by authorities. The scene of the riots was the MPRP headquarters, which was burnt out. Following the riots, a five-day state of emergency was declared by President Nambaryn Enkhbayar, {{the first time in}} Mongolia's history. Five people, all of them civilians, were killed during the state of emergency: four were shot, and one allegedly died from carbon monoxide poisoning. The Mongolian Minister of Justice estimated 220 civilians and 108 service members were injured. With the situation tense, the MPRP decided to admit the Democratic Party into government, forming a coalition. With its headquarters burnt, the MPRP tore down the building and built a new much taller and bigger modern headquarters in its place (named the Independence Palace, Тусгаар тогтнолын ордон) with <b>subsidiary</b> from the <b>budget</b> of the government run by the Mongolian People's Party (former MPRP) and donations from its party members and the building began to fully operate on 26 November 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Religious {{leaders were}} {{selected}} by and acted as proxies for {{the communist party}} and the process was violent with Sunni Muslim leaders imprisoned and killed while the Bektashi head suffered a similar fate and by 1947 the communist regime had imprisoned 44 Muslim clergy. Unlike their Christians counterparts in Albanian jails, the Muslim clergy imprisoned by the communist regime received little to no attention internationally regarding their plight apart from diaspora Albanian organisations. The Sunni Albanian community by 1949 under grand mufti Hafiz Musa Ali attempted to attain some measures and conditions from Enver Hoxha. Some of those included financial assistance, the exemption of future Muslim clergy doing army service which was supported while a translation of the Quran into Albanian was rejected. In 1950, the communist government implemented Act 743 that outlined measures for negotiating {{the status of the}} four religions in Albania. The Sunni Community at this time was run by the Main Council and its finances came from <b>budget</b> <b>subsidiaries</b> and property donations. As the Bektashi order of Albania was the worldwide headquarters of Bektashism, contact with outside communities linked to them were allowed by the communists though denied for other religions in Albania. In 1955 Hafiz Suleyman Myrto became grand mufti of the Muslim community and from May 1966 to February 1967 Hafiz Esad Myftia was the last grand mufti of Albania of the communist era. After 1945, material wealth, institutional properties and land such as a Muslim vakëf (wakf) of the religious communities in Albania were confiscated by the state to limit the ability of the religious communities to be economically self-reliant. The madrasa at Tiranë was closed down in 1965. While mosques had until 1965 undergone a state of dilapidation due to meagre finances for repair.|$|R
