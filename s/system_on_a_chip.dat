25|$|In February 2015, a {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} chip, designated U16, of the Raspberry Pi2 ModelB version1.1 (the initially released version) {{was found to be}} vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at {{the other side of the}} Raspberry Pi2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>chip</b> (main processor) and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape, lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.|$|E

An official explained, [...] "While the base design and setup was completed in the 370T to meet a certain price point and option list, the efforts required to get that design to $199 meant going {{back to the drawing board}} and starting over on just about every aspect of the unit."

2500|$|Released on January 11, 2005 {{during the}} Macworld expo, the first-generation iPod Shuffle weighed , and was {{designed}} to be easily loaded with a selection of songs and to play them in random order.

It relied on the use of an [...] "autofill" [...] feature in iTunes, which selected songs at random from a user's music library (or from a specific playlist) and copied as many as would fit into the iPod Shuffle's storage.
