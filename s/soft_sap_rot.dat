50|$|This {{butterfly}} seldom visits flowers, {{but rather}} feeds on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, salts and minerals from puddling, and dung.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 56-70 mm. The upperside is {{brown with}} dark eyespots at the margins. The underside is light brown. Adults feed on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, carrion and dung.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 59-70 mm. Males have spotted forewings. The upperside is {{brown with}} patches of dark scales along the veins. The underside is tan for {{both males and}} females. Adults feed on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, carrion and dung.|$|R
50|$|Their mother, Hamadryas, is immortalized in {{the name}} of two genera: that of the cracker {{butterfly}}, and that of the northernmost monkey in Asia Minor, the hamadryas baboon. The cracker butterfly is more arboreal than most butterflies, as it commonly camouflages itself on trees. It feeds on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit and dung. The hamadryas baboon is one of the least arboreal monkeys, but was the most common monkey in Hellenic lands.|$|R
5|$|Butterflies feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen, tree <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, {{they do not}} carry as much pollen load as bees, but {{they are capable of}} moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 32-38 mm. The upperside is brown without markings. The underside is also brown, {{but with}} small eyespots rimmed with yellow on both wings. They feed on <b>sap</b> and <b>rotting</b> fruit.|$|R
50|$|An adult has a {{wingspan}} {{of up to}} 8 centimeters. The larva is a {{dark gray}} mottled caterpillar with thick pink-tinted legs and a jumping ability. The adults feed on nectar, <b>sap,</b> and <b>rotting</b> fruit, while the larvae prefer the foliage of several oak species.|$|R
50|$|Larval Diptera feed in leaf-litter, in leaves, stems, roots, {{flower and}} seed heads of plants, moss, fungi, rotting wood, rotting fruit or other organic matter such as slime, flowing <b>sap,</b> and <b>rotting</b> cacti, carrion, dung, {{detritus}} in mammal bird or wasp nests, fine organic material including insect frass and micro-organisms. Many Diptera larvae are predatory, sometimes on the larvae of other Diptera.|$|R
30|$|The fungus was {{observed}} to cause stem rot on Sawara cypress Chamaecyparis pisifera (Sieb. & Zucc.) Endl. (Fig.  1 C, D) and Hinoki cypress Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. & Zucc. (Fig.  1 E, F). Imazeki [4] called this disease “Hi-akagare-sei-mizogusare-byo” in Japanese, stem <b>sap</b> <b>rot.</b> Aoshima et al. [5] identified the causal fungus as Fomitiporia punctata (Fr.) Murrill (Phellinus punctatus) and named the fungus from Chiba Prefecture, Japan “Cha-ana-take-modoki” in Japanese. Recently, Hattori et al. [7, 8] morphologically and phylogenetically analyzed the preserved fruiting body and mycelia of this fungus, {{and reported that}} the causal organism was distinct from F. punctata [9 – 11] and was another species of the genus Fomitiporia. Ota et al. [12, 13] reported that the isolated fungus from C. japonica and that from stem rot of C. pisifera form a phylogenetically distinct clade from F. punctata, and discussed that the pathogens on these tree species were possibly conspecific.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 70-86 mm. The upperside is mottled {{brown and}} white {{although there is}} some red in the forewing cell bar. The hindwing eyespots have orange scales preceding black crescents. The underside of the hindwings is white and the submarginal eyespots are composed of a brown ring around a black crescent in a white center. Adults are on wing year round in the tropics and from August to October in southern Texas. They feed on <b>sap</b> and <b>rotting</b> fruit.|$|R
50|$|The {{larval food}} is the foliage of certain native and {{introduced}} tree species. The native species include wattles, Illawarra flame-tree, lacebark or white kurrajong, kurrajong and Celtis species, while the black locust or false acacia is an exotic species {{that is also}} favoured. Adults may feed on the <b>sap</b> of trees, <b>rotting</b> fruit and moisture from dung.|$|R
60|$|At length the joyful day arrived when I was to cease, in outward {{appearance}} at all events, {{to be an}} alien; for returning at noon from the fields, on entering my cell I beheld my beautiful new garments--two complete suits, besides underwear: one, the most soberly colored, intended only for working hours; but the second, which was for the house, claimed my first attention. Trembling with eagerness, I flung off the old tweeds, the cracked boots, and other vestiges of a civilization which they had perhaps survived, and soon found that I had been measured with faultless accuracy; for everything, down to the shoes, fitted to perfection. Green was the prevailing or ground tint--a <b>soft</b> <b>sap</b> green; the pattern on it, which was very beautiful, being a somewhat obscure red, inclining to purple. My delight culminated when I drew on the hose, which had, like those worn by the others, a curious design, evidently borrowed from the skin {{of some kind of}} snake. The ground color was light green, almost citron yellow, in fact, and the pattern a bright maroon red, with bronze reflections.|$|R

40|$|Engineering an {{artificial}} matrix to direct stem cell neuronal differentiation provides a promising approach for neural tissues repair and regeneration. Stem cells {{can serve as}} an ideal cell source due to their intrinsic ability to proliferate and produce specific cell lineage. They can be induced to differentiate into neurons under a permissive microenvironment. However, it remains unclear how to orchestrate various properties of the artificial matrix to achieve this objective most efficiently. In this project, we have considered multiple matrix properties and created {{an artificial}} extracellular matrix with designer self-assembling peptide (SAP) that favors neuronal differentiation. These properties include the presentation of biochemical signals, mechanical strength and culture dimensionality. We {{took advantage of the}} ease of using SAP to tailor different matrix properties to conduct a factorial analysis on stem cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. The study has identified three-dimensional (3 D) culture in a <b>soft</b> <b>SAP</b> matrix (with storage modulus from 262 to 672 Pa) presenting laminin-derived pentapeptide signal as the most favorable for neuronal differentiation for the P 19 embryonic carcinoma. The results also revealed the synergistic effect between culture dimensionality and signal presentation. Optimal matrix properties identified with these pluripotent murine cells were also found applicable to totipotent murine embryonic stem cells. In absence of any growth factor, this 3 D tailor-made matrix was found to promote the spontaneous formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) and prime the neuronal differentiation. During 3 D culture, cells expressed a marker of neuronal differentiation but did not display characteristic neuronal morphology. When retrieved and re-cultured on a tissue culture plate (without SAP), the primed neuron like cells continued to differentiate, exhibiting extended neurite outgrowths and networks, elevated expression of genes of mature neurons (MAP 2 and MeCP 2), and down-regulation of glial marker (GFAP). In summary, an integrative and versatile approach for systematically studying cell-matrix interaction was developed and demonstrated in this study. By customizing the artificial matrix, our approach can be applied to investigate stem cells differentiation of other lineages, which will help further elucidate the complex cell-matrix interactions. It will provide more detailed guideline to generate the suitable artificial matrix for stem cell-specific differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Graph {{matching}} and graph mining are two typical ar-eas in artificial intelligence. In this paper, {{we define}} the <b>soft</b> attributed pattern (<b>SAP)</b> {{to describe the}} common sub-graph pattern among a set of attributed relational graphs (ARGs), considering both the graphical structure and graph attributes. We propose a direct solution to extract the S-AP with the maximal graph size without node enumeration. Given an initial graph template {{and a number of}} ARGs, we modify the graph template into the maximal SAP among the ARGs in an unsupervised fashion. The maximal SAP ex-traction is equivalent to learning a graphical model (i. e. an object model) from large ARGs (i. e. cluttered RGB/RGB-D images) for graph matching, which extends the concept of “unsupervised learning for graph matching. ” Furthermore, this study can be also regarded as the first known approach to formulating “maximal graph mining ” in the graph do-main of ARGs. Our method exhibits superior performance on RGB and RGB-D images. The code will be published later. 1...|$|R
