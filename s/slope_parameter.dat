40|$|Three {{distinctive}} {{methods of}} assessing measurement equivalence of ordinal items, namely, confirmatory factor analysis, differential item functioning using item response theory, and latent class factor analysis, make different modeling assumptions and adopt different procedures. Simulation data {{are used to}} compare the performance of these three approaches in detecting the sources of measurement inequivalence. For this purpose, the authors simulated Likert-type data using two nonlinear models, one with categorical and one with continuous latent variables. Inequivalence was set up in the <b>slope</b> <b>parameters</b> (loadings) {{as well as in the}} item intercept parameters in a form resembling agreement and extreme response styles. Results indicate that the item response theory and latent class factor models can relatively accurately detect and locate inequivalence in the intercept and <b>slope</b> <b>parameters</b> both at the scale and the item levels. Confirmatory factor analysis performs well when inequivalence is located in the <b>slope</b> <b>parameters</b> but wrongfully indicates inequivalence in the <b>slope</b> <b>parameters</b> when inequivalence is located in the intercept parameters.

They used the same model and microphysics scheme, turning off different microphysical mechanisms to understand which ones are the most important. They note that modifications to the microphysics scheme dramatically impacted the hurricane intensity. The most intense hurricanes were when melting was suppressed, or when no evaporation was allowed. They interpret this as meaning that the energy needed to either melt or evaporate the particles could instead be used to heat the air column, which increased convection leading to a stronger storm. During the weakest simulated storm, the fall speed of the snow and graupel particles was increased. The increased rate of fallout also increased the evaporation, leading to weakened convection. Changes in the intercept parameter showed little change. This implies that the total number of particles does not matter as much as the relative distribution between different sizes of particles.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} study is to analyse the effect of meansurement errors on the {{regression}} model. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts: transformation of the respsonse Y and transformation of the explanatory variable. In the first part, we consider a regression model with two explanatory variables and the explanatory variables are measured with errors. We find out the estimator of the <b>slope</b> <b>parameters</b> and their ratio. After fitting the model, we draw a residual plot to see whether the residual is random and constant variance. If the residual is not random, we transform the response Y to In(Y) and regress In(Y) on the explanatory variables. If measurement error does not exist in the explanatory variable, the ratio of the <b>slope</b> <b>parameters</b> in the true model asymtotically equals the <b>slope</b> <b>parameters</b> in the transformed model (Brillinger, 1983). When the explanatory variables are measured with errors, we find out the relationship of the expected ratio of the <b>slope</b> <b>parameters</b> in the true model and the ratio of <b>slope</b> <b>parameters</b> in the transformed model. In the second part, we consider the effect on the estimation of the intercept and slope in a simple linear model when explanatory variable does not follow normal distribution. If we ignore the non-normality of explanatory variable, we simply regress the response Y on the explanatory variable ξ and the estimates of intercept and slope are found here. It is supposed that the explanatory variable ξ follows lognormal distribution and so logarithm of ξ follows normal distribution. We regress Y on In(ξ) and the estimates of intercept and slope are also calculated in this transformed model. By inverting the estimates in the transformed model, we can introduce other estimates for the intercept and <b>slope</b> <b>parameters</b> in the true model. F'urther-more, we compare those estimates in the transformed model with that in the untransformed model. It is interesting to see that transformation can make the estimation worse...|$|R
