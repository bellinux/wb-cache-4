25|$|The {{weapon is}} secured against {{misfires}} through a manually operated safety (whose lever, {{as in the}} AKM {{is located on the}} right side of the receiver), that disables the trigger bar and limits the movement of the bolt carrier. Sliding the safety selector to the top position (marked with a “Z” symbol) secures the weapon, lowering the lever down (“O” setting) disables the safety. The Tantal feeds from a double-column curved box magazine, made from a synthetic bakelite material or <b>stamped</b> <b>metal,</b> with a 30-round cartridge capacity.|$|E
25|$|In {{heavy-duty}} industrial high-current applications, a grid resistor {{is a large}} convection-cooled lattice of <b>stamped</b> <b>metal</b> alloy strips {{connected in}} rows between two electrodes. Such industrial grade resistors can be {{as large as a}} refrigerator; some designs can handle over 500 amperes of current, with a range of resistances extending lower than 0.04 ohms. They are used in applications such as dynamic braking and load banking for locomotives and trams, neutral grounding for industrial AC distribution, control loads for cranes and heavy equipment, load testing of generators and harmonic filtering for electric substations.|$|E
