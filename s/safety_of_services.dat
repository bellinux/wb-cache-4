40|$|Healthcare {{information}} systems (HISs) are often implemented {{to enhance the}} quality of care {{and the degree to which}} it is patient-centered, as well as to improve the efficiency and <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> However, the outcomes of HIS implementations have not met expectations. We set out to organize the knowledge gained in qualitative studies performed in association with HIS implementations and to use this knowledge to outline an updated structure for implementation planning. A multi-disciplinary team performed the analyses in order to cover as many aspects of the primary studies as possible. We found that merely implementing an HIS will not automatically increase organizational efficiency. Strategic, tactical, and operational actions have to be taken into consideration, including management involvement, integration in healthcare workflow, establishing compatibility between software and hardware and, most importantly, user involvement, education and training. The results should be interpreted as a high-order scheme, and not a predictive theory.

40|$|A {{group of}} {{consumers}} of private hospital services and their carers collaborated with staff of a Melbourne private hospital and with industry representatives {{to develop a}} consumer-driven performance report on cardiac services. During the development process participating consumers identified situational and structural barriers to their right to be informed of costs, to choice and to quality care. Their growing appreciation of these barriers led them to a different perspective on performance reporting, which resulted in their redirecting the project. The consumer participants no longer wanted a performance report that provided comparative quantitative data. Instead they designed a report that outlined the structures, systems and processes the hospital had in place to address the quality and <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> provided. In addition, consumer participants developed a decision support tool for consumers to use in navigating the private health care sector. The journey of these consumers in creating a consumer driven performance report for a private hospital service may assist those responsible for governance of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s health system in choosing appropriate strategies and mechanisms to enhance private hospital accountability.

40|$|Objectives: To explore staff {{views on}} their roles, skills and {{training}} to deliver high quality and local intrapartum services in remote and rural settings against national recommendations. Design: Interview and postal survey. Setting: A stratified representative sample of remote and rural maternity units in Scotland (December 2002 to May 2003). Participants: Staff proportionally representative of professional groups involved in maternity care. Results: Staff interviews took place at 11 units (response rate 93 %). A subsequent postal survey included the interview sample and staff in a further 11 units (response rate 78 %). Medical specialisation, workforce issues, and proposed regulatory evaluation of competencies linked to throughput raised concerns about the sustainability and <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> particularly for ‘‘generalists’’ in rural maternity care teams and for medical cover in small district general hospitals with large rural catchments. Risk assessment and decision making to transfer were seen as central for effective rural practice and these were influenced by rural context. Staff self-reported competence and confidence varied according to procedure, but noted service change appeared to be underway ahead of their preparedness. Self-reported competence in managing obstetric emergencies was surprisingly high, with the caveat {{that they were not}} independently assessed in this study. Staff with access to video conference technology reported low actual use although there was enthusiasm about its potential use. Conclusions: Considerable uncertainties remain around staffing models {{and training to}} maintain maternity care team skills and competencies.

The theoretical part is {{a cross section of}} the whole topic of quality and safety from a culture of quality and safety, ensuring and creating safe care at European and global level, through causes and prevention of adverse events, the influence of the European Union on this issue, the national legislation, the accreditation investigation and evaluation of the quality and safety. The research is focused towards deeper investigation the issue, clarification of concepts, causes and contexts. The pur-pose is not to draw conclusions directly, but to explore how some facilities are in comparison with the theory and in comparison with each other. The purpose and goal of this work is to determine whether the currently implemented measures and changes lead to improving of services and greater safety. The main goal of the thesis is: To determine whether the introduction of DSO (Departmental security objectives) has a positive effect on patient safety in health facilities in Pilsen and South Bohemia regions and compare the differences. As a tool to clarify the quality and safety I chose a descriptive qualitative research and quantitative analysis of adverse events in observed group. Quality was assessed by using questionnaire consisting of the main and most important parts of the theoretical concept. From data obtained by questionnaire was subsequently compiled a description of the culture of quality and safety of each facility and then compared.

40|$|À l'origine dans / Was {{originally}} part of : ESPUM - Dép. médecine sociale et préventive - Travaux et publications]A subcategory {{of medical}} tourism, reproductive tourism {{has been the}} subject of much public and policy debate in recent years. Speciﬁc concerns include: the exploitation of individuals and communities, access to needed health care services, fair allocation of limited resources, and the quality and <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> provided by private clinics. To date, the focus of attention has been on the thriving medical and reproductive tourism sectors in Asia and Eastern Europe; there has been much less consideration given to more recent ‘players’ in Latin America, notably fertility clinics in Chile, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. In this paper, we examine the context-speciﬁc ethical and policy implications of private Argentinean fertility clinics that market reproductive services via the internet. Whether or not one agrees that reproductive services should be made available as consumer goods, the fact is that they are provided as such by private clinics around the world. We argue that basic national regulatory mechanisms are required in countries such as Argentina that are marketing fertility services to local and international publics. Speciﬁcally, regular oversight of all fertility clinics is essential to ensure that consumer information is accurate and that marketed services are safe and effective. It is in the best interests of consumers, health professionals and policy makers that the reproductive tourism industry adopts safe and responsible medical practices.

40|$|Passenger {{transport}} in South Africa, {{just like}} in many other developing countries has many characteristics that are generally absent from public transport systems {{in the first world}} countries. The first and prime characteristic is the high volume of low capacity vehicles (less than 20 seaters) in commuter services and the dominance of this form of public transport in the overall public transport sphere. It is estimated that minibuses (taxis) account for 70 % (based on market access permit volumes) of modal share in the cross-border road transport industry within Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. The minibuses operate on fixed corridors and in most cases for distances longer than 1000 kilometres a single trip. The fact that the minibuses have limited carrying capacity yet they travel such long distances raises key questions in regard to the economics of cross-border operations particularly in respect to the sustainability, viability, cost-effectiveness and productivity thereof. Furthermore, it also raises questions in regard to <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> given that only one driver is assigned to drive over such long distances. This paper looks at the economics of long distance minibus passenger operations focusing on cross-border road transport between South Africa and neighbouring countries. It is partly based on findings from a study entitled ?Market Access Regulation? (CSIR & C-BRTA, 2013) conducted by the Cross-Border Road Transport Agency (C-BRTA) in partnership with the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Quantitative and qualitative methodologies were utilized in executing the study. Furthermore, consultations were conducted with relevant stakeholders in the regulatory environment in SADC region. It was established that some routes are already over-saturated and sustainability of operations is under threat. Despite the fact that minibuses are more flexible than conventional buses, passengers are shifting preference towards the latter for safety and comfort amongst other reasons. Furthermore, it was also established that viability and productivity in cross-border minibus operations are on the decline thus, a new regulatory regime is required in the industry. This paper also provides interventions that can be deployed to close the gaps in the cross-border long distance passenger transport with a view to enhance operational efficiency and productivity.

40|$|Objective This paper articulates the {{importance}} of accurately identifying maternity services. It describes the process and challenges of identifying the number, level and networks of rural and remote maternity services in public hospitals serving communities of between 1000 and 25 000 people across Australia, and presents {{the findings of this}} process. Methods Health departments and the national government’s websites, along with lists of public hospitals, were used to identify all rural and remote Australian public hospitals offering maternity services in small towns. State perinatal reports were reviewed to establish numbers of births by hospital. The level of maternity services and networks of hospitals within which services functioned were determined via discussion with senior jurisdictional representatives. Results In all, 198 rural and remote public hospitals offering maternity services were identified. There were challenges in sourcing information on maternity services to generate an accurate national picture. The nature of information about maternity services held centrally by jurisdictions varied, and different frameworks were used to describe minimum requirements for service levels. Service networks appeared to be based on a combination of individual links, geography and transport infrastructure. Conclusions The lack of readily available centralised and comparable information on rural and remote maternity services has implications for policy review and development, equity, safety and quality, network development and planning. Accountability for services and capacity to identify problems is also compromised. What is known about the topic? Australian birthing services have previously been identified for hospitals with 50 or more births a year. Less is known about public hospitals with fewer than 50 births a year or those with only antenatal and postnatal services, particularly in rural and remote locations, or how maternity services information may be identified from publicly available sources. What does this paper add? This paper describes the process and challenges of identifying maternity services in rural and remote public hospitals serving towns of between 1000 and 25 000, and presents the findings of this process. What are the implications for practitioners? Nationally accessible, reliable and comparable information is important for health planners, policy makers and health practitioners. This paper provides useful information on the variations in the capability and location of maternity services across Australia. Opportunities exist for consistent collection, collation and reporting of maternity services across rural and remote Australia. This will ensure quality and <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> contribute to policy review, support the development and maintenance of service networks, and assist in planning services and expenditure, {{as well as in the}} identification of problems.

40|$|Quality of {{care has}} become an {{important}} concept in present nursing. Accreditation is proper evidence and also the most efficient means to achieve high-quality care. Procedure of accreditation in the Czech Republic is most frequently administered at national level by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of the Czech Republic. The main objective of my thesis was to survey the setting of quality management and safety in selected hospitals in the Czech Republic. I used quantitative research and quantitative method { [...] } interviews and questionnaires in hospitals in České Budějovice, Český Krumlov, Písek, Prachatice, Tábor, Jindřichův Hradec from January to March in 2010. The qualitative part had the form of interviews with staff-nurses from above mentioned hospitals. For this part of work I set seven survey questions that had stemmed from the standards of accreditation of the Joint Commission on Accreditation. These questions referred to implementation of Programme of Quality Improvement and Safety of Provided Services, {{to the process of}} auditing, to the quality and safety data collecting, to the process of observing clients/patients´ satisfaction with nursing care, to the setting of report system of unusual and abnormal situations, to the setting of efficient system of complaints solving and to the standardization of health care. On the grounds of these interviews 9 hypotheses were set. These hypotheses were acknowledged in the quantitative survey among head nurses from above mentioned hospitals. 111 questionnaires were handed out, 82 questionnaires returned. The first hypothesis (proved) was: Head nurses play active parts in the Programme of Quality Improvement and <b>Safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>Services</b> Provided. The second hypothesis (not proved) was: Head nurses who perform the function of an auditor, have the certificate of accredited course. The third hypothesis (proved) is: The most frequent indicator of quality of nursing care is observation of patients´ satisfaction with provided care. The fourth hypothesis (proved) is: Head nurses have a form for reporting unusual/abnormal situations available. The fifth hypothesis (proved) is: Patients/clients have questionnaires available to express satisfaction with the care. The sixth hypothesis (proved) is: Corrective measures are taken at wards, on the grounds of patients/clients´ satisfaction with care. The seventh hypothesis (proved) : Head nurses participate in preparation of nursing care standards. The eighth hypothesis (not proved) is: Head nurses engage nurses with advanced education in preparation of the standards. The results proved that only those nurses are engaged, who display interest, regardless of their education.

The purpose of writing this article is the development of the overall management system of an organization, identification of major qualitative characteristics of an efficient system of the management of an organization and of various innovations that allow implementing its long–term strategy and ensuring its competitiveness in general. Research methods are system approach, methods of analysis and synthesis, comparison. The approaches to the essence, structure and the content of modern systems of management of an organization were analyzed. The specifics were discovered and the functioning of companies in retail and of their structural units was analyzed. Qualitative efficient characteristics of modern system of the management of organizations were identified, and the definition of a modern system of the management of an organization (an enterprise) was formulated. General structure of the system of the management of the organization of a "higher level" was proposed to ensure competitiveness and development of the organization. The measures to enhance competitiveness and strategic stability of the company «ALLO» were formulated, namely: 1) taking into account seasonal factors in the demand for goods; 2) implementation of new ideas (social innovations) to attract customers, which differ from the ideas of the companies–competitors; 3) introduction of more motivational programs for the promotion of employees, into the system of management; 4) application of innovative educational measures in the programs of customer loyalty, which increase the value of the company's services for both individuals and society as a whole; 5) expanding the assortment in the stores to attract new customers and increase profits. The scientific novelty of the research is in determining current requirements of consumers to the companies, retailers of electronic equipment; substantiating the expanding of social innovations under conditions of unstable external environment and growth in the European integration processes in Ukraine; formulating essential qualitative characteristics of an efficient system of an organization management; interpreting the term "management system of an organization" and developing optimal general operation structure of the overall management system ("higher level") of an organization with regard to the processes of creation and improvement. The practical significance of the study is the creation of a clear-cut procedure of implementation of the management system ("higher level") of an organization that fulfills the functions of development, implementation, evaluation and support for an organization of any type, including the company in the electronic equipment retail sales.
