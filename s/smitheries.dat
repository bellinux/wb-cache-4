50|$|Because {{of their}} {{inferior}} efficiency {{compared to a}} water mill, water scoops are less common, and {{have been used in}} the past mostly for applications where linear motion is required rather than rotation, for example hammers in <b>smitheries,</b> saws in sawmills, and stamp mills in mining. They are also used for fulling and, nowadays, to operate animated sculptures in fountains.|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} importance {{was based}} on the one hand by the central functions of the town for the surrounding locations, and by the metal ore mining in the wider surrounding area ("osemund"/osmond iron), which were exploited in the Middle Ages. While the ore was processed in the hammers and wire drawers with the water power in the surrounding valleys, a number of artisanal <b>smitheries</b> in Lüdenscheid made finished products of those materials. In order to market these products to a wider area, Lüdenscheid joined the Hanseatic League.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expanded}} mining industry, {{backed by}} the Lords of Würbenthal, led to the founding of several neighbouring towns, for example Andělská Hora about 1550, and Vrbno pod Pradědem in 1611. Additionally, many other kinds of industry intensified at this time, like the <b>smitheries</b> built at Suchá Rudná (1405) and Mezina (1567), and seven timber mills in 1579. In May 1617 Bruntál was bought by the last Lord of Vrbno, John IV of Vrbno, who joined the Uprising of the Estates and was awarded the rank of Director in 1619. His {{close ties to the}} [...] "Winter King" [...] Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who was John's guest in February 1620, left him in very dangerous circumstances at the outcome of the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, when he was forced to leave his Freudenthal property and escape from the country. The emperor Ferdinand II (1619-1637) confiscated the Bruntál domain and gave it to his brother, Karl I of Austria (1619-1624) who was the Grand Master (Hochmeister) of the Teutonic Order.|$|E

At around the same time, a <b>smithery</b> was built (1776; though subsequently rebuilt it still stands, the earliest surviving <b>smithery</b> in any royal dockyard). Initially used for the manufacture of anchors and smaller metal items, it would later be expanded to fashion the iron braces with which wooden hulls and decks began to be strengthened; as such, it provided a hint of the huge change in manufacturing technology that would sweep the dockyards in the nineteenth century as sail began to make way for steam, and wood for iron and steel.|$|R
