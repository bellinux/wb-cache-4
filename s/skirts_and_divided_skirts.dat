50|$|Most Japanese men only {{wear the}} kimono {{at home or}} in a very laid back environment, however it is {{acceptable}} for a man to wear the kimono when he is entertaining guests in his home. For a more formal event a Japanese man might wear the haori and hakama, a half coat <b>and</b> <b>divided</b> <b>skirt.</b> The hakama is tied at the waist, over the kimono and ends near the ankle. Hakama were initially intended for men only, but today it is acceptable for women to wear them as well. Hakama can be worn with types of kimono, excluding the summer version, yukata. The lighter and simpler casual-wear version of kimono often worn in Japanese summer festival is called yukata.|$|R

50|$|A more {{fruitful}} {{account of}} the recognition of non-conformist costume or dress of that time lies {{in the history of}} “alternative dress”. The alternative dress style can be described as a “set of signs, borrowed from male clothing, that appeared sometimes singly, sometimes in combination with one another, but always associated with items of female clothing.” This alternative dress is a form of non-verbal communication and is different than the “Victorian dress reform” (as mentioned above), being a form of verbal communication. Bicycling, for example, was a late nineteenth century sport that was not identified as a male activity. Women, therefore, were able to wear <b>divided</b> <b>skirts</b> <b>and</b> knee-length bloomers without having difficulties considering gender roles because this “alternative dress” did not intend to undermine patriarchy. After a while, this and many other alternative dress examples, such as uniforms, became more effective in conveying a message than that of dress reformers, because alternative dress had more “followers” in everyday life. The bicycle, therefore, can be seen as ‘one of the symbols of emancipation’ that has changed the attitude towards women’s sports apparel.|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "Girl Graduate," [...] with a pathos {{to which}} I am not insensible, entreats {{me not to}} apotheosize [...] "that awful, befringed, beflounced, <b>and</b> bekilted <b>divided</b> skirt." [...] Well, I will {{acknowledge}} that the fringes, the flounces, and the kilting do certainly defeat the whole object of the dress, which is that of ease and liberty; but I regard these things as mere wicked superfluities, tragic proofs that the <b>divided</b> <b>skirt</b> is ashamed of its own division. The principle of the dress is good, and, {{though it is not}} by any means perfection, it is a step towards it.|$|R
5000|$|Cycle Chic is {{a modern}} phrase to {{describe}} something that has existed since {{the invention of the}} bicycle in the 1880s - regular citizens on bicycles. Cycling was fashionable from the late 1880s and through the 1940s. At the end of the 19th century, the height of cycle chic was to play polo on bicycles, using long-handled tennis rackets and rubber balls. Women's wear (such as corsets and petticoats) was impractical for cycling and so rational dress was required. [...] <b>Divided</b> <b>skirts,</b> bloomers <b>and</b> knickerbockers were tried as fashionable women attempted to resolve the matter without provoking hostility, ridicule or violence. More recently, in the 1980s bicycle messengers became a common sight on the streets of major cities, and the messengers' mix of street fashion and cycling gear was seen as an alternative fashion statement.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of large trim and heel angles of the wrecked submarine, the double spherical shell {{rotating}} docking skirt is studied. According to the working principle of the rotating docking <b>skirt,</b> <b>and</b> the fixed <b>skirt,</b> the directional skirt, the angle skirt are simplified as the connecting rod. Therefore, the posture equation and kinematics model of the docking <b>skirt</b> are deduced, <b>and</b> according to the kinematics model, the angle of rotation of the directional <b>skirt</b> <b>and</b> the angle <b>skirt</b> is obtained when the wrecked submarine is in different trim and heel angles. Through the directional <b>skirt</b> <b>and</b> angle <b>skirt</b> with the matching rotation can make docking skirt interface in the 0 °~ 2 γ range within the rotation, to complete the docking <b>skirt</b> <b>and</b> the wrecked submarine docking. The MATLAB software is used to visualize the rotation angle of fixed <b>skirt</b> <b>and</b> directional <b>skirt,</b> which lays a good foundation for the development of the control of the double spherical shell rotating docking skirt in future...|$|R
2500|$|Chinese fashion {{had a huge}} {{influence}} on Japan from the Kofun period to the early Heian period {{as a result of}} mass immigration from the continent and a Japanese envoy to the Tang Dynasty. During Japan's Heian period (794–1192 AD), the kimono became increasingly stylized, though one still wore a half-apron, called a mo, over it. During the Muromachi age (1392–1573 AD), the Kosode, a single kimono formerly considered underwear, began to be worn without the hakama (trousers, <b>divided</b> <b>skirt)</b> over it, <b>and</b> thus began to be held closed by an obi [...] "belt". During the Edo period (1603–1867 AD), the sleeves began to grow in length, especially among unmarried women, and the Obi became wider, with various styles of tying coming into fashion. Since then, the basic shape of both the men’s and women’s kimono has remained essentially unchanged. Kimonos made with exceptional skill from fine materials have been regarded as great works of art.|$|R
