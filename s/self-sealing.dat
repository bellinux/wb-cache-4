5|$|Data {{from the}} {{captured}} Zero had been {{transmitted to the}} U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) and Grumman Aircraft. After careful study, Roy Grumman decided that he could match or surpass the Zero in most respects, except in range, without sacrificing pilot armor, <b>self-sealing</b> tanks and fuselage structure. The new F6F Hellcat would compensate for the extra weight with additional power.|$|E
5|$|During {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, nine Zeros were shot down. From these wrecks, the Allies learned that the Zero lacked armor and <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, but little else about its capabilities. The Zero's flight {{performance}} characteristics—crucial to devising tactics and machinery to combat it—remained a mystery.|$|E
5|$|The Dornier had <b>self-sealing</b> {{fuel tanks}} to protect fuel {{stored in the}} wings and fuselage. This reduced the loss of fuel and risk of fire when hit in action, and often enabled the {{aircraft}} to return. Twenty oxygen bottles were provided for crew use during long flights above 3,660 m (12,000ft).|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{assessment of}} both sides was radically different. Bomber Command believed the attack was a failure {{as a result of}} poor formation flying and leadership. It was also maintained that better beam defensive armament and <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks were needed. These tactical considerations might, they believed, still salvage the day-bomber concept.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's <b>self-sealing</b> capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two <b>self-sealing</b> sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{supplied}} by a separate 1,074 litre (276 US Gallon, 230 Imperial Gallon) fuel tank using dual booster pumps. Optional {{fourth and fifth}} tanks {{can be added to}} act as a reservoir supply, topping up the main tanks during flight, increasing range or endurance. The AW101 can also be outfitted with a probe for aerial refuelling. <b>Self-sealing</b> fuel tanks are an optional item to be selected by the customer. An inlet particle separator system can be installed, protecting the engine when operating in sandy environments.|$|E
5|$|In June 1941, JG51 was {{transferred}} East {{to take part}} in Operation Barbarossa with 1 staffel. On the morning of the 22 June, Bär and his wingman Oberfeldwebel Heinrich Höfemeier were escorting a damaged Heinkel He 111 over German lines when they made contact with 18 Tupolev SB bombers from the 39 SBAP (Skorostnoy Bombardirovohchnyy Aviatsionny Polk—high speed bomber aviation regiment) and 10 SAD (Smeshannaya Aviatsionnaya Diviziya—composite aviation regiment). The German pilots attacked; Höfemeier claimed four, Bär two—though the former was wounded in the arm. The Germans noted the vulnerability of the Soviet aircraft which lacked <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks and had a propensity to burst into flames. More JG51 Bf 109s appeared and claimed six more. None of the 39 SBAP or 10 SAD aircraft returned home. Bär had achieved his 19th and 20th victory.|$|E
5|$|At 13:10, the RAF {{formation}} {{flew over}} the mud flats {{to the west of}} Cuxhaven and Wesermünde and came under heavy ground fire from the German flak positions, 214, 244 and 264. As Kellett turned west towards the Jade Estuary and over Wilhelmshaven anti-aircraft units 212, 222, 252, 262 and 272 opened fire. Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and all the other naval ships in the dock opened fire in support. In the distance, at Schillig Point, the bombers could see German fighters taking off from a camouflaged airstrip. In a quick briefing, JG 1's commander had told his pilots to make a beam attack as it was a blind spot for the Wellington. A stern attack was dangerous, as the gunners could then target an attacking fighter with a coordinated and concentrated cone of fire. One weakness also noted was that early types of Wellingtons lacked <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks. This meant if the German fighters hit the wings, the bomber was liable to burn.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was given the}} service designation of MiG-9 (internal OKB designations of I-301 and izdeliye FS) and a small batch of ten aircraft, equipped with original German engines, was ordered during 1946 from Factory No. 1 in Kazan before flight testing was completed. They were intended {{to be used in}} the parade, but bad weather forced the cancellation of their flypast. Two of them were assigned to participate in the state acceptance trials while others were used as testbeds for various programs. The trials were concluded in June and the MiG-9 generally met the performance goals set by the Council of People's Commissars. The test pilots found the fighter easy and simple to fly. Defects noted during testing were that the engines flamed out when firing the cannon at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion, no ejection seat was fitted, nor were air brakes or a fire suppression system. The fuel tanks were not <b>self-sealing</b> and no armor was provided for the pilot. Despite these drawbacks, the MiG-9 was ordered into production at Factory No. 1 before the acceptance tests were completed as the Soviet leadership believed that its shortcomings could be rectified during production. A batch of 50 aircraft, 40 single-seat fighters and 10 two-seat trainers, were ordered in late 1946 to participate in the 1947 May Day parade. In recognition of their accomplishment Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1947.|$|E
25|$|Production variant with {{modified}} tailplane incidence, <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, 36 built.|$|E
25|$|Variant {{armed with}} 2 × 7.7mm (.303in) Type 89 machine guns, three rubber layers of <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks.|$|E
25|$|Prototypes and evaluative models. Introduce Ha-115 engine, <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, {{shorter and}} {{stronger}} wings, reflex sight, improved canopy.|$|E
25|$|This {{was similar}} to the A6M5c, but with <b>self-sealing</b> wing tanks and a Nakajima Sakae 31a engine {{featuring}} water-methanol engine boost.|$|E
25|$|As the T.V lacked <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, {{they gained}} a {{reputation}} for rapidly catching fire when hit by enemy fire.|$|E
25|$|While {{the five}} main fuel tanks are <b>self-sealing,</b> the UH-1H was not {{equipped}} with factory armor, although armored pilot seats were available.|$|E
25|$|One 62gal (234l) {{auxiliary}} fuel cell (not a <b>self-sealing</b> type) {{was installed in}} each wing leading edge, just outboard of the guns.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} service trials, and originally designated P-45, a {{first order}} for 80 aircraft was placed 10 August 1939; the designation reverted to P-39C before deliveries began. After assessing aerial combat conditions in Europe, {{it was evident}} that without armor or <b>self-sealing</b> tanks, the 20 production P-39Cs were not suitable for operational use. The remaining 60 machines in the order were built as P-39Ds with armor, <b>self-sealing</b> tanks and enhanced armament. These P-39Ds were the first Airacobras to enter into service with the Army Air Corps units and would be the first ones to see action.|$|E
25|$|Single-seat fighter aircraft, {{equipped}} with folding wings, a retractable tailwheel, <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, {{a very small}} dorsal fin, powered by a 2,100hp (1,566kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2800-34W Double Wasp radial piston engine, armed with four 0.50in (12.7mm) machine guns, 658 built.|$|E
25|$|The {{improved}} HH-3E variant {{would follow}} later, with eight built, and all 50 CH-3Es {{were converted to}} this standard. Known as the Jolly Green Giant, the HH-3E featured protective armor, <b>self-sealing</b> tanks, a retractable inflight refueling probe, jettisonable external tanks, a high-speed hoist, and other specialized equipment.|$|E
25|$|Rigid {{removable}} {{tanks are}} {{installed in a}} compartment designed to accommodate the tank. They are typically of metal, plastic or fibreglass construction, and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. The aircraft does not rely on the tank for structural integrity. These tanks are commonly found in smaller general aviation aircraft, such as the Cessna 172. Combat aircraft and helicopters generally use <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks.|$|E
25|$|The XP-47B was of {{all-metal}} construction (except for the fabric-covered {{tail control}} surfaces) with elliptical wings, {{with a straight}} leading edge that was slightly swept back. The air-conditioned cockpit was roomy and the pilot's seat was comfortable—"like a lounge chair", as one pilot later put it. The canopy doors hinged upward. Main and auxiliary <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks were placed under the cockpit, giving a total fuel capacity of 305U.S. gal (1,155L).|$|E
25|$|The CH-46 Sea Knight and its Canadian variant, the CH-113 Labrador, can land {{on water}} and rest {{for up to}} two hours in calm water. The rear {{sponsons}} hold two of the three landing gear units as well as <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks. The helicopter began service with the United States Marine Corps in 1962, and with the Canadian military in 1963, and is used to carry cargo and combat troops.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a military-configured variant, the AW139M, was {{revealed}} by AgustaWestland. It was promoted at the US market, including for the U.S. Air Force's Common Vertical Lift Support Program. The AW139M {{is equipped with}} a high definition forward-looking infrared (FLIR), self-protection system, heavy-duty landing gear, and has low thermal and acoustic signatures; a significant proportion of the equipment is sourced from American manufacturers. Options offered include an external stores system including various armaments, armored seats, <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, and a full ice-protection system for all-weather operations.|$|E
25|$|Ommaya first {{reported}} the Ommaya reservoir in 1963. The reservoir is subcutaneous implant for repeated intrathecal injections, to treat hydrocephalus and malignant tumors. The reservoir {{was the first}} medical port to use silicone which is biologically inert and <b>self-sealing.</b> The Ommaya reservoir allows delivery of intermittent bolus injections for chemotherapy to the tumor bed. Agents are injected percutaneously into the reservoir and delivered to the tumor by compression of the reservoir. The Ommaya reservoir provided a great improvement for treatment which {{reduces the risk of}} infection.|$|E
25|$|Vitrectomy may be {{successful}} in treating more severe cases. The technique usually involves making three openings through {{the part of the}} sclera known as the pars plana. Of these small gauge instruments, one is an infusion port to resupply a saline solution and maintain the pressure of the eye, the second is a fiber optic light source, and the third is a vitrector. The vitrector has a reciprocating cutting tip attached to a suction device. This design reduces traction on the retina via the vitreous material. A variant sutureless, <b>self-sealing</b> technique is sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|The Army ordered 12 YP-39s (with only a single-stage, single-speed supercharger) {{for service}} {{evaluation}} and one YP-39A. After these trials were complete, {{which resulted in}} detail changes including deletion of the external radiator, and on advice from NACA, the prototype was modified as the XP-39B; after demonstrating a performance improvement, the 13 YP-39s were completed to this standard, adding two 0.30in (7.62mm) machine guns to the two existing 0.50in (12.7mm) guns. Lacking armor or <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, the prototype was one ton (900kg) lighter than the production fighters.|$|E
25|$|The JLTV {{also has}} an {{automatic}} fire-extinguishing system to protect the crew cabin and engine compartment. Fires in the engine compartment are to be detected and extinguished within 10 seconds to minimize vehicle damage. In addition, the driver also has access to a small portable fire extinguisher. Fixed fuel tanks are <b>self-sealing,</b> mounted externally and shielded by the JLTV structure. Each crew seat has a combined seat and blast restraint device. Ingress time for a crew of four in combat equipment is 30 seconds or less. Egress with B-kit doors is within 10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|So many C-46s {{were lost}} in the {{paratroop}} drop during Operation Varsity that Army General Matthew Ridgway issued an edict forbidding the aircraft's use in future airborne operations. Even though the war ended soon afterwards and no further airborne missions were flown, the C-46 may well have been unfairly demonized. The operation's paratroop drop phase was flown in daylight at low speeds at very low altitudes by an unarmed cargo aircraft without <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, over heavy concentrations of German 20mm, 37mm, and larger caliber antiaircraft (AA) cannon utilizing explosive, incendiary, and armor-piercing incendiary ammunition. By that stage of the war, German AA crews had trained to a high state of readiness; many batteries had considerable combat experience in firing on and destroying high-speed, well-armed fighter and fighter-bomber aircraft while under fire themselves. Finally, while many, if not all of the C-47s used in Operation Varsity had been retrofitted with <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, the C-46s received no such modification. Although 19 of 72 C-46 aircraft were shot down during Operation Varsity, it is not as well known that losses of other aircraft types from AA fire during the same operation were equally as intense, including 13 gliders shot down, 14 crashed, and 126 badly damaged; 15 B-24 bombers shot down, and 104 badly damaged; 12 C-47s shot down, with 140 damaged.|$|E
25|$|By 1946, Dunlop had 70,000 employees, {{and sales}} outlets {{in nearly every}} country in the world. In 1948 Dunlop invented the <b>self-sealing</b> tyre, which reduced the risk from blowouts. In the early 1950s, Dunlop {{developed}} Maxaret, the first anti-lock braking system. By 1955 Dunlop had almost half of the UK tyre market. A report by the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission in that year found that Dunlop and the four other main sellers in the UK market (Goodyear, Avon, Firestone and Michelin) companies had arrangements which resulted in fixed prices. These arrangements were forced to change, and Dunlop's market share decreased.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} May 1944, the IX Troop Carrier Command had {{available}} 1,207 Douglas C-47 Skytrain troop carrier {{airplanes and}} was one-third overstrength, creating a strong reserve. Three quarters of the planes were {{less than one year}} old on D-Day, and all were in excellent condition. Engine problems during training had resulted in a high number of aborted sorties, but all had been replaced to eliminate the problem. All matériel requested by commanders in IX TCC, including armor plating, had been received with the exception of <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, which Chief of the Army Air Forces General Henry H. Arnold had personally rejected because of limited supplies.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} that the Battle was {{entering}} service in 1937, the Battle had already been rendered obsolete by the rapid advances in aircraft technology were being made at the time. Specifically, the performance and capabilities of fighter aircraft had increased to outstrip the modest performance gains that the light bomber had achieved over its biplane antecedents. In terms of a self-defence capability, the Battle had been armed only with a single Browning machine gun and a trainable Vickers K in the rear position; in service, these proved to be desperately inadequate. Moreover, it lacked other common defensive features of the era, such as an armoured cockpit and <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks.|$|E
25|$|Like the Mitsubishi-produced A6M Zero, the radial-engined Ki-43 {{was light}} {{and easy to}} fly and became legendary for its combat {{performance}} in East Asia {{in the early years}} of the war. It could outmaneuver any opponent, but did not have armor or <b>self-sealing</b> tanks, and its armament was poor until its final version, which was produced as late as 1945. Allied pilots often reported that the nimble Ki-43s were difficult targets but burned easily or broke apart with few hits. In spite of its drawbacks, the Ki-43 shot down more Allied aircraft than any other Japanese fighter and almost all the JAAF's aces achieved most of their kills in it.|$|E
25|$|The Re.2000 had no {{fuel tanks}} {{contained}} within the fuselage; nevertheless, using {{the entirety of the}} wing's internal volume for fuel tankage, it could house a maximum of 460kg (640 lt) of gasoline, providing it with a 900–1,100km endurance, far in excess of its contemporary rivals built by Macchi and Fiat. However, the Re.2000 was considered to be not as rugged as its Macchi-built contemporaries; specifically, its fuel tanks were considered to be vulnerable, which were not of the <b>self-sealing</b> variety then becoming popular in military service. It has been claimed that this lack of durability had been a major factor when, following an official evaluation by the Regia Aeronautica, the service decided to reject the type.|$|E
25|$|The Sea Fury was {{powered by}} the newly {{developed}} Bristol Centaurus piston engine, which drove a five-bladed propeller. Many of the engine's subsystems, such as the fully automated cooling system, cockpit gauges, and fuel booster pump were electrical, powered by an engine-driven generator supplemented by two independent batteries. The hydraulic system, necessary to operate the retractable undercarriage, tail hook, and flaps, was pressurised to 1,800 psi by an engine-driven pump. If this failed a hand pump in the cockpit could also power these systems, a pneumatic pump was also driven by the engine for the brakes. Internal fuel was stored {{in a total of}} five <b>self-sealing</b> fuel tanks, two within the fuselage {{directly in front of the}} cockpit and three housed within the wings.|$|E
25|$|The canopy stayed {{essentially}} {{the same as that of}} the E-4, although the handbook for the 'F' stipulated that the forward, lower triangular panel to starboard was to be replaced by a metal panel with a port for firing signal flares. Many F-1s and F-2s kept this section glazed. A two-piece, all-metal armour plate head shield was added, as on the E-4, to the hinged portion of the canopy, although some lacked the curved top section. A bullet-resistant windscreen could be fitted as an option. The fuel tank was <b>self-sealing,</b> and around 1942 Bf 109Fs were retrofitted with additional armour made from layered light-alloy plate just aft of the pilot and fuel tank. The fuselage aft of the canopy remained essentially unchanged in its externals.|$|E
25|$|Potez 63.11:Because {{the pilot}} {{needed to be}} seated above the observer, the {{fuselage}} was taller, which resulted in degraded top speed and manoeuvrability. As a result, the 63.11 proved very vulnerable, despite being protected with some armour and basic <b>self-sealing</b> coating over the fuel tanks. As a secondary light bomber capability {{was part of the}} requirements (though it was rarely if ever used), the fuselage accommodated a tiny bomb bay, carrying up to eight 10kg-class bombs. This bomb bay was replaced by an additional fuel tank on late examples. Additionally, two 50kg-class bombs could be carried on hardpoints under the inner wings. Frontal armament was originally one, then three MAC 1934s under the nose, and many 63.11s were equipped with the same additional guns in wing gondolas as the 631s.|$|E
