Introduction Independence structures can be found in profusion throughout many mathematical disciplines. The concept of matroid which appeared in the works of Whitney [27] and Van der Waerden [24] is a classical model of abstract independence approaches.

50|$|Research on Patient Cochrane {{also led}} to greater {{understanding}} of priming in amnesics. Priming involves the exposure of a person to information under false pretenses. This information is ultimately recalled at a later period {{with the hope that}} the previous priming will improve recall ability. With respect to patient Cochrane, researchers found that successful priming is independent of both semantic and episodic memory. Episodic and semantic memory are therefore described as showing <b>stochastic</b> <b>independence,</b> ruling out the idea that Cochrane was able to retain information because certain words were of greater significance to him than others. Studies on Cochrane’s semantic learning also provided insight into the conditions that are necessary to promote successful semantic learning in amnesic patients. Researchers found that maximizing amnesics’ ability to obtain new information requires efforts to minimize interference, which occurs when previously learned information prevents patients from correctly remembering subsequent information. The finding that interference significantly prevents successful semantic learning in amnesics provided explanation for why earlier experiments failed, as they did not make efforts to minimize interference.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} preference-based {{condition}} for <b>stochastic</b> <b>independence</b> of a randomizing device in a product state space. This condition {{is applied to}} investigate some classes of preferences that allow for both independent randomization and uncertainty or ambiguity aversion (a la Ellsberg). For example, when imposed on Choquet Expected Utility (CEU) preferences in a Savage framework displaying uncertainty aversion {{in the spirit of}} Schmeidler [27], it results in a collapse to Expected Utility (EU). This shows that CEU preferences that are uncertainty averse in the sense of Schmeidler should not be used in settings where independent randomization is to be allowed. In contrast, Maxmin EU with multiple priors preferences continue to allow for a very wide variety of uncertainty averse preferences when <b>stochastic</b> <b>independence</b> is imposed. Additionally, these points are used to reexamine some recent arguments against preference for randomization with uncertainty averse preferences.

This phenomenon more generally applies to one-sided nonparametric tests which have a sup norm of a shifted standard Brownian bridge as their limit under √n-converging Pitman local alternatives.

40|$|General Recognition Theory (GRT; Ashby 2 ̆ 6 Townsend, 1986) is {{a multidimensional}} theory of classification. Originally {{developed}} to study {{various types of}} perceptual independence, {{it has also been}} widely employed in diverse cognitive venues, such as categorization. The initial theory and applications have been static, that is, lacking a time variable and focusing on patterns of responses, such as confusion matrices. Ashby proposed a parallel, dynamic stochastic version of GRT with application to perceptual independence based on discrete linear systems theory with imposed noise (Ashby, 1989). The current study again focuses on cognitive/perceptual independence within an identification classification paradigm. We extend stochastic GRT and its implicated methodology for cognitive/perceptual independence, to an entire class of parallel systems. This goal is met in a distribution-free manner and includes all linear and non-linear systems satisfying very general conditions.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} semi-parametric test of {{independence}} (or serial independence) between marginal vectors {{each of which}} is normally distributed but without assuming the joint normality of these marginal vectors. The test statistic is a Cramer-von Mises functional of a process defined from the empirical characteristic function. This process is defined similarly as the process of Ghoudi et al. [J. Multivariate Anal. 79 (2001) 191] built from the empirical distribution function and used to test for independence between univariate marginal variables. The test statistic can be represented as a V-statistic. It is consistent to detect any form of dependence. The weak convergence of the process is derived. The asymptotic distribution of the Cramer-von Mises functionals is approximated by the Cornish-Fisher expansion using a recursive formula for cumulants and inversion of the characteristic function with numerical evaluation of the eigenvalues.

40|$|R. Duncan Luce once {{mentioned}} {{in a conversation}} {{that he did not}} consider Kolmogorov's probability theory well-constructed because it treats <b>stochastic</b> <b>independence</b> as a "numerical accident," while it should be treated as a fundamental relation, more basic than the assignment of numerical probabilities. I argue here that <b>stochastic</b> <b>independence</b> is indeed a "numerical accident," a special form of stochastic dependence between random variables (most broadly defined). The idea that it is fundamental may owe its attractiveness to the confusion of <b>stochastic</b> <b>independence</b> with stochastic unrelatedness, the situation when two or more random variables have no joint distribution, "have nothing to do with each other. " Kolmogorov's probability theory cannot be consistently constructed without allowing for stochastic unrelatedness, in fact making it a default situation: any two random variables recorded under mutually incompatible conditions are stochastically unrelated. However, stochastically unrelated random variables can always be probabilistically coupled, i. e., imposed a joint distribution upon, and this generally can be done in an infinity of ways, independent coupling being merely one of them.

Stimuli were Gaussian enveloped 1 c/d sinusoidal gratings represented in a 3 D cardinal space transformed from cone contrast axes, and normalized to detection threshold.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that it is {{possible}} to regard stochastic and fuzzy logics as being derived from two different constraints on a probability logic: statistical <b>independence</b> (<b>stochastic)</b> and logical implication (fuzzy). To contrast the merits of the two logics, some published data on a fuzzylogic controller is reanalysed using stochastic logic and it is shown that no significant difference results in the control policy. Fuzzy logic as probability logic The literature on fuzzy logic (Lee, 1972; Zadeh 1973) treats it very much as a new concept, distinct from that of probability logic (Rescher, 1969), even though both ascribe to events numbers in the interval [0, 1]. This suggests that a new theoretical framework is required in which to analyse the results of practical applications of fuzzy logic. This letter is to demonstrate that fuzzy logic may be treated in terms of probability theory. This is possible because probability logic is itself not truth functional (Rescher, 1969) —the truth value of a logical expression is not uniquely determined by those of its components, and additional assumptions are necessary to determine it. It will be shown that, if a relationship of logical implication is assumed between variables, the rules of fuzzy logic apply. Conversely, if these rules do apply...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss a}} method to {{determine}} strategies for preventive maintenance of systems consisting of gradually deteriorating components. A model has been developed to compute not only the range of conditions inducing a repair action, but also inspection moments based on the last known condition value so as to minimize expected costs per time unit. ln our cost optimization, we include costs of inspection, repair, failure and operation, while accounting for savings that {{can be obtained by}} combining inspection or repair of two or more components. Deterioration is modelled as a <b>stochastic</b> process; an <b>independence</b> assumption allows us to model the decision problem as a (semi-) Markov decision process. The solution procedure for the system as a whole is a heuristic one as we use only aggregate information about the other components while determining a maintenance strategy for a particular component. This strategy is of the opportunistic control-limit type: upper limits induce mandatory actions, lower limits allow anticipatory action if a combination with a mandatory action on at least one other component is possible. ln this paper we describe the principles of this heuristic.

30|$|Another {{assumption}} of the Rasch model, one-dimensionality, was checked using the non-parametric version of the Martin-Löf test, which assesses whether different item-subsets all measure the same underlying dimension (see Verguts and De Boeck, 2000).

Thus, the first and second halves of the items were compared. The median of the item-specific solution rates was used as another criterion to split the items. In addition, odd items were compared with even items. A maximum-likelihood factor analysis with varimax rotation and the global non-parametric T 11 -statistic (Ponocny, 2001) that specifically tests for local <b>stochastic</b> <b>independence</b> were inspected to examine further whether a one-factor-solution fits the data and one-dimensionality can be warranted.
