2500|$|... 1888 and 1889 {{proved to}} be amazingly {{productive}} years for Wolf, and {{a turning point in}} his career. After the publication of a dozen of his songs late the preceding year, Wolf once again desired to return to composing, and travelled to the vacation home of the Werners—family friends whom Wolf had known since childhood—in Perchtoldsdorf (a short train ride from Vienna), to escape and compose in solitude. Here he composed the Mörike-Lieder at a frenzied pace. A <b>short</b> <b>break,</b> <b>and</b> a change of house, this time to the vacation home of more longtime friends, the Ecksteins, and the Eichendorff-Lieder followed, then the 51 Goethe-Lieder, spilling into 1889. After a summer holiday, the Spanisches Liederbuch was begun in October 1889; though Spanish-flavoured compositions were in fashion in the day, Wolf sought out poems that had been neglected by other composers.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the tour}} ended in April 1973, Yes took a <b>short</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> regrouped in London and {{proceeded}} to rehearse and develop Anderson and Howe's material at Manticore Studios in Fulham, then owned by fellow progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Wakeman thought the musical direction the band had begun to take ventured into [...] "avant-garde jazz rock, and I had nothing to offer there". Squire recognised [...] "a lot of substance" [...] to the four tracks, but at times there was not as much which made the album become [...] "too varied and too scattered". Despite their opinions, Anderson wrote in the liner notes that Squire, Wakeman and White made [...] "important contributions of their own" [...] to the music. He believed the entire group were [...] "on the same page" [...] and supported the concept and material at the time, but realised Wakeman's criticisms ended a period of [...] "elusive harmony" [...] that had existed within the band for their successful albums Fragile (1971) and Close to the Edge. Howe recalled that despite the lengthy arrangements, no one [...] "bottled it" [...] and thought a single album would be more appropriate. White contributed some lengthy sections of music that bridged between the main sections of tracks, but did not receive a writing credit which bothered him at first, but later allowed it as the album was mostly Anderson and Howe's idea.|$|E

The next theme looks at the physical location of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> how access issues and the suitability of the location and venue can affect their beneficial impact. The ways in which information and communication affect access to <b>and</b> experience of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> is considered in the third theme. What families and disabled children want from the people who provide the <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> forms the focus of the fourth theme. The relationship between family members <b>and</b> <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> carers is considered in the fifth theme and the final theme examines issues around sustainability and support for disabled children and their families to lead normal lives...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} unmet needs of {{informal}} carers of community dwelling disabled {{people and to}} compare their perspectives to those of disabled people and nominated professionals. It was hypothesised that a poor recognition of carers' needs could have implications for carers' well- being and thus their ability to maintain their caring role. Need {{was defined as a}} service or a resource that would confer a health or rehabilitation gain. Design: Face to face interviews with carers and disabled participants, telephone interviews with professionals (Southern England). Disabled participants had been selected randomly from two disability registers. Main outcome measures: The Southampton Needs Assessment Questionnaire (carers version), SF- 36 (carers' health status). Results: Carers experienced similar health status to people in the general population. The most frequently carer-reported unmet needs were for <b>short</b> <b>breaks,</b> domestic help <b>and</b> respite care. Carers who had reported unmet need for <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> had significantly poorer levels of mental health and vitality (SF- 36) than carers who had not reported this. Similar numbers of unmet carers' needs were reported by disabled participants, professionals and carers themselves. In terms of type of unmet needs, poor concordance between carers and disabled participants occurred in 52 % of cases: carers reported more unmet needs than disabled participants for <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> domestic help. Poor concordance scores between carers and professionals occurred in 59 % of cases: carers reported more unmet needs for <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> than professionals <b>and</b> professionals reported more unmet needs for formal respite care. Conclusion: In line with recent legislation, carers' needs must be independently addressed and services, especially for flexible community support such as <b>short</b> <b>break</b> services, must be developed specifically {{to meet the needs of}} carers. Further research is warranted to evaluate whether recent legislation for carers has any effect on carers' well-being and ability to cope with their caring role...|$|R
