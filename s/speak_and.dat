5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should <b>speak,</b> <b>and</b> how they can stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate.

In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E

A quasi-experimental study of non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design or comparison group design was used in this research. The population of this {{research was}} the all first semester undergraduate students of urban and regional planning study program of Indo Global Mandiri University. Forty students were selected as the sample by using purposive sampling technique in which each group consisted of 20 students, respectively. The treatment was given for 14 meetings. This research was primarily concerned on the quantitative data {{in the form of the}} students’ <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing scores. Rubrics were used to measure the students’ <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing achievements. The findings showed that (1) there was a significant improvement in <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing achievements where t-obtained of speaking skill by using rubric was 16. 110 (p< 0. 000) and t-obtained of writing skill by using rubric was 18. 291 (p< 0. 000), (2) there was also a significant mean difference in <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing achievements between the experimental and control groups were 4. 533 (p< 0. 000) and 3. 504 (p< 0. 000), (3) the aspect of <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing skill gave high contribution on the students’ <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing achievements in the experimental group. The highest contribution of speaking skill aspect toward the speaking achievement was fluency. Meanwhile the highest contribution of writing skill aspect toward the writing achievement was vocabulary. Hence, it could be concluded that using short stories significantly improve the students’ <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing achievements...|$|R

George was now Queen Anne's direct heir. He swiftly revised the membership of the Regency Council that would take power after Anne's death, as it was known that Anne's health was failing and politicians in Britain were jostling for power. She suffered a stroke, which left her unable to <b>speak,</b> <b>and</b> died on 1 August 1714. The list of regents was opened, the members sworn in, and George was proclaimed King of Great Britain and Ireland. Partly due to contrary winds, which kept him in The Hague awaiting passage, he did not arrive in Britain until 18 September. George was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 20 October. His coronation was accompanied by rioting in over twenty towns in England.|$|E

Taft was afraid that Stone would be made chief justice; he did not resign until he had secured assurances from Hoover that Hughes would be the choice. Returning to Washington after his resignation on February 3, Taft had barely enough strength to sign a reply to a letter of tribute from the eight associate justices. He died at his home in Washington on March 8, 1930.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the British Empire had {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication. As England continued to form new colonies, these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and {{its status as a}} superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet. By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
