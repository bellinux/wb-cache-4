5|$|As before, the MPGA {{supported}} and assisted the new fundraising campaign. However, although {{the campaign was}} initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised. The churchwardens and the MPGA began to consider ideas for initiatives which would publicise the campaign and provide a reason to justify preserving {{the whole of the}} park.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> therefore flat, and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key.|$|E
5|$|COBOL 2002 {{suffered}} from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard. Micro Focus {{found that it}} was {{due to a lack of}} user demand for the new features and due to the abolition of the NIST test suite, which had been used to test compiler conformance. The standardization process was also found to be <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> under-resourced.|$|E

5000|$|Metronomically, we were {{a pretty}} {{accurate}} band. If we were speeding up or slowing down, it was by design. If {{you listen to the}} solo break on [...] "There She Goes Again," [...] it <b>slows</b> down—slower <b>and</b> <b>slower</b> <b>and</b> <b>slower.</b> <b>And</b> then when it comes back into the [...] "bye-bye-byes" [...] it's double the original tempo, a tremendous leap to twice the speed.|$|R
5|$|Cockroaches have {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, {{meaning that}} the nymphs are generally similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and genitalia. Development is generally <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> may take {{a few months to}} over a year. The adults are also long-lived, and have survived for as much as four years in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Cryptum {{received}} mixed reviews; {{some critics}} liked the Forerunner culture and suspense that Bear created, but others disliked the characters, found the plot too <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> {{concluded that the}} novel was suited only to existing fans of the Halo series. Cryptum appeared on multiple bestseller lists after promotion on Halo Waypoint, a website {{that serves as a}} hub for Halo-related information.|$|E
5|$|He {{drew and}} painted {{numerous}} preparatory sketches while deciding which of several alternative {{moments of the}} disaster he would depict in the final work. The painting's conception proved <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> difficult for Géricault, and he struggled to select a single pictorially effective moment to best capture the inherent drama of the event.|$|E
50|$|In fact, the {{collapse}} gets <b>slower</b> <b>and</b> <b>slower,</b> so a singularity could only form in an infinite future. Unlike a black hole, the MECO never fully collapses. Rather, {{according to the}} model it <b>slows</b> down <b>and</b> enters an eternal collapse.|$|R

40|$|In schizophrenia, {{psychomotor}} <b>slowing</b> <b>and</b> stereotypy {{are poorly}} delineated from cognitive deficits like diminished processing speed. Inpatients' performance outcomes on a line-copying task, a task assessing stereotypy and a processing-speed task are compared. Results suggested that psychomotor <b>slowing</b> <b>and</b> stereotypy are related and {{may represent a}} catatonic symptom cluster...|$|R
5|$|In 2011, Kaspersky made a {{decision}} against taking the company public, saying it would make decision-making <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> prevent long-term R investments. This led {{to a series of}} high-level departures from the company, including his ex-wife and co-founder. Another series of departures occurred in 2014 due to disagreements over how to run the company.|$|E
5|$|Keith's <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> erratic {{movement}} {{caused it to}} produce strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central America. Belize bore {{the brunt of the}} storm, with about $280 million in damage and 19 confirmed fatalities, primarily related to flooding. Several other countries reported significant but less severe flooding, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Overall, Keith was responsible for 40 deaths, as well as approximately $319 million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Moulting is very <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> complex. Black {{cockatoos}} {{appear to}} replace their flight feathers {{one at a}} time, their moult taking two years to complete. This process is much shorter in other species, such as the galah and long-billed corella, which each take around six months to replace all their flight feathers.|$|E

5|$|Ordinary {{ticket sales}} from Morden South station {{increased}} from 9,840 in 1930 to 50,817 in 1938 but, from the SR's perspective, {{the line was}} not a great success. The service, originally operating from West Croydon to Holborn Viaduct station in Central London, was <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> indirect {{and many of the}} potential passengers from the line's catchment area continued to use the buses and tube route via Morden.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium {{has only}} one stable and {{naturally}} occurring isotope, 141Pr. It is thus a mononuclidic element, and its standard atomic weight can be determined with high precision. This isotope has 82 neutrons, a magic number that confers additional stability. This isotope is produced in stars through the s- and r-processes (<b>slow</b> <b>and</b> rapid neutron capture, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Progress in {{clearing}} and covering the burial ground was <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was not}} until 28 October 1880 that the churchyard was reopened as a public park. Laid out with flower beds and gravel paths, the park became a popular place for local workers to spend breaks.|$|E

5|$|Progression {{towards an}} erect limb posture, which would {{increase}} the animals' stamina by avoiding Carrier's constraint. But this process was <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> erratic: for example, all herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern monotremes still have semisprawling limbs.|$|E
5|$|Regent Street {{was one of}} {{the first}} planned {{developments}} of London. The desire to impose order on the city's medieval street pattern dates back to the aftermath of the Great Fire of London (1666) when Sir Christopher Wren and John Evelyn drew plans for rebuilding the city on the classical formal model, but progress was <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> houses were rebuilt on the old street network anyway.|$|E
5|$|Retirement from Speyer & Co. – it {{was decided}} that Speyer had been <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> {{reluctant}} to resign as a partner of the American bank of which he was still in partnership with his German brother-in-law, Edward Beit von Speyer.|$|E

60|$|He walked <b>slower</b> <b>and</b> <b>slower.</b> <b>And</b> indeed, {{considering}} the guest {{he had in}} his rooms, it was no wonder he lingered on the way. It was like harbouring a pestilential disease that would not perhaps take your life, but would take from you all that made life worth living--a subtle pest that would convert earth into a hell.|$|R
60|$|Around and around, {{in a broad}} circle, went Phil and {{his horse}} and the steer. But {{the steps of the}} latter were <b>slower</b> <b>and</b> <b>slower,</b> <b>and</b> {{presently}} the beast dropped into a walk and then refused to take another step. Phil came to a halt also, but kept the lasso tight. Then the steer lay down on his side.|$|R
5|$|Shankar {{developed}} a style distinct {{from that of}} his contemporaries and incorporated influences from rhythm practices of Carnatic music. His performances begin with solo alap, jor, and jhala (introduction and performances with pulse and rapid pulse) influenced by the <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> serious dhrupad genre, followed by a section with tabla accompaniment featuring compositions associated with the prevalent khyal style. Shankar often closed his performances with a piece inspired by the light-classical thumri genre.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its {{induction}} pharmacokinetics, methoxyflurane {{has very}} <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> somewhat unpredictable emergence characteristics. During initial clinical studies in 1961, {{the average time}} to emergence after discontinuation of methoxyflurane was 59minutes after administration of methoxyflurane for an average duration of 87minutes. The longest time to emergence was 285minutes, after 165minutes of methoxyflurane administration.|$|E
5|$|Slow second movement, {{in a key}} {{different}} from the tonic, and in A–B–A (ternary) or A–B–A–B–A form. The main sections (A and B) are contrasted in key and character, A is <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> meditative; B is more intense and animated. The movement begins and ends slowly and quietly.|$|E
