2500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, most European Karaites {{were no longer}} very {{knowledgeable}} about the religion and <b>Seraya</b> Shapshal, a Karaite soldier of fortune {{who had been the}} tutor of the last Qajar Shah of Persia, Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar and a Russian spy, managed about 1911 to get himself elected Chief Ḥakham of the Karaites in the Russian Empire (by that time, due to Russian regulations, the position had become more of a political one than a spiritual one). Influenced by the Pan-Turkic movement in Turkey, Szapszal made his position into that of an Emperor-priest. He changed the title Hakham to [...] "Ḥakhan" [...] (a cross between the Turkic titles khagan and khan), forbade the use of Hebrew, and in the 1930s introduced pagan elements (such as the veneration of sacred oak trees in the cemetery).
