40|$|AbstractAfter the {{expiration}} of patents on originator biological products, Jordanian local manufacturers and {{the agents of}} international pharmaceutical companies in Jordan started to submit registration dossiers for biosimilar products. The Jordan Food and Drug Administration (JFDA) is the national regulatory authority responsible for the registration of biosimilar products. Biosimilars are registered under the same regulations used for drugs until specific guidelines for registration of biological and biosimilar products are released. Those regulations are called Criteria of Registration of Drugs, Vaccines, Sera and Biological Products, the Renewal of its Registration and the Cancellation of Any of them {{which was published in}} the official gazette in 2004 under the Provisional Law Number 80 of the year 2001, Drug and Pharmacy Law and its amendments of the year 2003.

40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>similar</b> <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> or ‘biosimilars’ in Europe in the 2000 s {{has led to}} {{development}} of a global biosimilars market and regulatory frameworks designed specifically for approval of biosimilars. Like originator biologicals, biosimilars exhibit greater molecular complexity than small-molecule drugs, including generics. Current estimates suggest that biosimilars are more expensive and require longer development times than generics. Regulatory and industry conferences have addressed how to achieve the appropriate level of regulation for biosimilars. Many originator biologicals feature support programmes or additional services {{that are designed to}} improve usage by patients, prescribers, and payers; these are not a mandatory part of the regulatory approval process.

40|$|Many of {{the best-selling}} ‘blockbuster’ <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> are, or will soon be, facing {{competition}} from <b>similar</b> <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (biosimilars) in the EU.

Over the last 10 years, experience with biosimilars has shown that even complex biotechnology-derived proteins can be copied successfully. Most best-selling biologicals are used for chronic treatment. This has triggered intensive discussion on the interchangeability of a biosimilar with its reference product, with the main concern being immunogenicity. We explore the theoretical basis of the presumed risks of switching between a biosimilar and its reference product and the available data on switches. Our conclusion is that a switch between comparable versions of the same active substance approved in accordance with EU legislation is not expected to trigger or enhance immunogenicity. On the basis of current knowledge, it is unlikely and very difficult to substantiate that two products, comparable on a population level, would have different safety or efficacy in individual patients upon a switch.

40|$|Abstract Background and scope: <b>Similar</b> <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> {{also called}} 'biosimilars', are copies of {{biopharmaceutical}} products whose patent has expired. Whether biosimilars are truly comparable and interchangeable with their reference biopharmaceutical products {{in terms of}} quality, efficacy and tolerability, is still a matter of debate. This review discusses the controversies related to the criteria for regulatory approval of biosimilars. These concerns are illustrated using recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) biosimilars as an example. Methods: Publications on the regulatory approval of biosimilars in general and rhGH biosimilars in particular were searched in MEDLINE by exploding and combining the medical subject heading terms 'human growth hormone', 'efficacy' or 'safety' and the free-text words 'biosimilar', 'biopharmaceutical', 'similar <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> product', 'follow-up biologic' or 'biogeneric'. Searches were limited to full-text English-language articles. The websites from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and from the American Food and Drug Administration were also consulted. Regulatory status: To obtain regulatory approval of a biosimilar product by EMA, demonstration of comparability with an approved reference biopharmaceutical product in terms of quality, efficacy and tolerability is needed. Thus, comparative quality studies, non-clinical and clinical efficacy and tolerability studies are required. However, {{in contrast to the}} reference product, comparative non-clinical pharmacokinetics, safety pharmacology, reproduction toxicology, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies are not mandatory to obtain approval of a biosimilar. In addition, comparable efficacy and tolerability only needs to be established by one study in a single population during a limited time interval (12 months) and often allows extrapolation to all other approved indications of the reference product. Consequently, for the currently approved rhGH biosimilars, long-term efficacy and tolerability in all indications has not been proven to the same degree as for the reference products. Conclusions: The validity of the current criteria for comparability and interchangeability of biosimilars and their reference products remains controversial. The authors conclude that long-term clinical investigations and systematic monitoring of the efficacy and tolerability of rhGH biosimilars in all indications are needed. In addition, the medico-economical environment should allow physicians to take a free and informed decision about the type of rhGH to be prescribed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to examine the effect of regulation on development of new biopharmaceuticals, tissue engineering and biogenerics. This includes defining key issues, which may influence the outcome of receiving marketing authorization. Most of the results are based on interviews conducted with experts with different backgrounds: regulators, representatives of biocompanies, investors, researchers and representatives of trade associations. Product information retrievable from the homepages of the EMEA and FDA has also been used as a data source. A review article is also included as it highlights central issues of the thesis and contains new information in addition to the review data. Integration of regulation from the very early stages of product development and a sound understanding of regulatory requirements will {{have a positive impact on}} product development. However, detailed regulation is not necessarily available as new technologies push forth. This often leads to case-by-case evaluation, which is demanding and time consuming for both product developer and regulator. Tissue engineering is an example of such emerging technologies for which the regulation is still immature or lacking. According to the present study, a centralised evaluation seems the only possible route for ensuring uniform assessment of tissue engineering products. Currently product developers should develop products according to the <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> legislation, which also applies to biopharmaceuticals. Risk assessment and management is essential for Tissue engineering as the risks of these technologies are generally regarded as being substantial. Biogenerics, called <b>similar</b> <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the EU legislation, are and have been in the focus of heated debate in the EU and USA although generics may be regarded as an inevitable step of the technological cycle. The pivotal regulatory issue is the question of comparability, for which the present study reflected no agreement. Control of post-translational modifications, immunogenicity and the extent of clinical trials required by the regulators pose major challenges for the biogenerics manufacturers. Thus, at the present time, biogenerics should be regulated on a case-by-case basis. Data from this thesis shows that intensified monitoring of the safety prof 11 e is called for. It is evident that risks of biotechnology-derived products are different from small chemical entities. This should lead to focused risk management programs. The main risk is the transmission of infectious agents. From the regulatory point of view, the risk management of biologicals is currently far from optimal as the appropriate legislation lags behind. The SPCs (Summary of Product Characteristics) of the EMEA and the PIs (Package Inserts) of the FDA of 32 approved biopharmaceuticals were compared. A general observation was that the EU SPC is more detailed in its instructions and the approach to safety information was clearly stricter. This difference may reflect the approaches to risk management of new <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> by the two agencies. Consequently, in spite of increasing harmonisation of the regulatory requirements, there are significant differences between the regulatory approaches that should be taken into consideration in drafting clinical development plans for biopharmaceuticals for global market. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|According to the European Medicine Agency, a “biosimilar” is a <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> that {{contains}} {{a version of the}} active substance of an original <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> (reference or innovative <b>medicinal</b> <b>product)</b> that has been authorized in the European Economic Area.

5000|$|Terminology {{surrounding}} biopharmaceuticals varies {{between groups}} and entities, with different terms referring to different subsets of therapeutics within the general biopharmaceutical category.

40|$|Biological medical {{products}} nowadays {{are one of}} the most promising area at the pharmaceutical market. Biopharmaceutical market has significant benefits such as fast and effective development of production facilities, the development of more effective and safer {{medical products}}. The aim of our research was, on the example of medical products Cortexin and Retinalamin, examine the specifics of quality of <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the chain from production to sale. The objects of study - original biological medicines Cortexin and Retinalamin. Comparative, systematic, analytical methods and reviews were used. Biological medical products have fundamental differences from synthetic medicines, due to their source - alive cells which are usually used in their production process. Each production cycle results in a unique finished pharmaceutical products and minimal differences in the modes of production can significantly effect on the properties of biological medical products. Therefore, even if the physical, chemical and biological properties of the product thoroughly studied and described, it does not guarantee therapeutic equivalence of two biological products which are manufactured in different conditions. One of the most important issues today is the problem of maintaining properties and quality of biological medicines. These issues are actively resolving on the native pharmaceutical market: quality control system are developing and implementing in accordance with international standards in order to maintain maximum efficiency of biological medicines and to protect consumers from defective products. Biological products require special conditions of storage and transportation. In order to save physical, chemical and therapeutic properties, strict compliance with the relevant conditions of packaging, transport and intermediate storage, related to deviations in temperature during transportation and storage is needed. The production process consists of the following stages: preparing of the solution for bottling, sterilizing filtration, washing and sterilizing of the bottles, aseptic filling, freeze drying and plugging, seaming, continuous monitoring in bulk. After getting the quality certificate and declaration of conformity products are transferred to the storage place for finished products. The specificity of differences between biological medical products and synthetic medicines was investigated. Stages of ensuring of the quality of <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> with considering of particular qualities of the critical points were considered - the special conditions in the manufacturing process, temperature monitoring, systems and procedures of ensuring in quality during transportation, storage.

40|$|Transfer {{of genes}} to cells and the {{subsequent}} expression of these genes can alleviate the symptoms of a disease (gene therapy), or prevent infectious diseases (DNA vaccination). Gene therapy and DNA vaccination are based on relatively new technologies. The first gene therapeutics are expected to enter the market as registered <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> within 2 - 4 years. The vectors used to transfer the gene of interest to target cells are genetically modified viruses or plasmids. Viral vectors and plasmids are produced biotechnologically and are therefore considered to be <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> ('biologicals'). Since the production of biologicals is inherently variable and difficult to control, these products require extra safety measures and regulations. The Laboratory for Medicines and Medical Devices of the RIVM, involved in the regulatory assessment and control authority batch-release testing of biologicals, has carried out an inventory study on both the analytical methods used for characterisation of viral and plasmid vectors and the regulatory issues affecting these products. The {{results of this study}} indicate that many quality and safety considerations applicable to viral and plasmid vectors are identical to those applied to other biologicals. Novel analytical methods are those for testing the identity of the vector, measuring transduction efficiency, testing for replication-competent viruses, assays for particle count and infectious virus titer, as well as tests for genetic and chemical stability and structure of plasmid vectors. These analytical methods are not yet standardised. However, international initiatives have been started for standardisation.

40|$|Biosimilars, {{defined as}} <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{comparable}} in quality, {{safety and efficacy}} to reference products, follow the independent regulatory pathway in the EU for marketing authorizations after the patent expirations of the reference products. With the recent advent of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the evolving EU guidelines on biosimilars are {{about to have a}} new regulatory landscape. The development of guideline on biosimilar mAbs is considered as a regulatory challenge due the tremendous complexity of mAbs. MAbs are highly complex molecules with secondary and tertiary structures subject to post-translational modifications, which are often heterogeneous and vulnerable to slight change in manufacturing process. Thus, to what extent of the similarity a biosimilar mAb should demonstrate, compared with its reference product, is currently the most controversial regulatory issue. This review discusses this issue by raising the questions in tiers of quality, non-clinical, clinical issues. In principle, the similarity issue on mAbs will be extensively discussed and justified on case-by-case basis. Most importantly, evaluation of biosimilar mAbs should be conducted with a holistic approach, i. e. rigorous interpretation between structure-function relationships to reduce unnecessary clinical trials while providing comprehensive post-marketing risk management plans. In the long run, biobetters might be gradually taking over biosimilars on the established regulatory track and leading to better access to biological medications...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{approaches}} for allergen immunotherapy (AIT) products {{and the availability}} of high quality AIT products are inherently linked to each other. While allergen products are available in many countries across the globe, their regulation is very heterogeneous. First, we describe the regulatory systems applicable for AIT products in the European Union (EU) and in the United States (US). For Europe, a depiction of the different types of relevant procedures, as well as the committees involved is provided and the fundamental role of national agencies of the EU member states in this complex and unique network is highlighted. Furthermore, the regulatory agencies from Australia, Canada, Japan, Russia, and Switzerland provided information on the system implemented in their countries for the regulation of allergen products. While AIT products are commonly classified as <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> they are made available by varying types of procedures, most commonly by either obtaining a marketing authorisation or by being distributed as named patient products. Exemptions from marketing authorisations in exceptional cases, as well as import of allergen products from other countries, are additional tools applied by countries to ensure availability of needed AIT products.

40|$|Background and Objective: <b>Biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (biologics) {{are subject}} to {{specific}} pharmacovigilance requirements to ensure that biologics are identifiable by brand name and batch number in adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports. Since Member States collect ADR data {{at the national level}} before the data is aggregated at the European Union (EU) level, it is important that an unambiguous understanding of which <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> belong to the biological product category exists. This study aimed to identify the level of consistency between Member States regarding the classification of biologics by national authorities responsible for ADR reporting. Methods: A sample list of recombinant biologics from the European Medicines Agency database of European Public Assessment Reports was created to analyze five Member States (Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK) according to which products were classified as biologics by each Member State. We calculated the Fleiss kappa value to analyze interrater reliability. Results: A considerable divergence was identified regarding the classification of the 146 recombinant biologics from the sample list: one Member State classified 100 % of the recombinant biologics from the sample list as biologics, whereas the classification rates in the remaining four Member States ranged between 70 and 88 % for products available on the national market. The interrater reliability for 87 products available on the market in all five Member States was considered poor. Conclusion: Discrepancies exist between Member States in the classification of biologics; less divergence exists for common well-known biologics. These findings highlight the need to think about the best approaches to translate EU legislation into national practices.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{progressive}} joint disease, that occurs {{frequently in the}} aging population and is {{a major cause of}} disability worldwide. Both glucosamine and chondroitin are biologically active molecules that are substrates for proteoglycan, an essential component of the cartilage matrix. Evidence supports the use of glucosamine and chondroitin as symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs) with impact on OA symptoms and disease-modifying effects in the long term. Glucosamine and chondroitin are administered in exogenous form as a sulfate salt and multiple formulations of these agents are available, both as prescription-grade products and nutritional supplements. However, while all preparations may claim to deliver a therapeutic level of glucosamine or chondroitin not all are supported by clinical evidence. Only patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate (pCGS) is shown to deliver consistently high glucosamine bioavailability and plasma concentration in humans, which corresponds to demonstrated clinical efficacy. Similarly, clinical evidence supports only the pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate. The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) advocates, through careful consideration of the evidence base, that judicious choice of glucosamine and chondroitin formulation is essential to maximize clinical benefit, patient adherence and satisfaction with treatment. In future, the ESCEO recommends that complex molecules with biological activity such as pCGS may be treated as “biosimilars” akin to the European Medicines Agency guidance on <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> It seems likely that for all other complex molecules classed as SYSADOAs, the recommendation to use only formulations clearly supported by the evidence-base should apply.

40|$|One of {{the main}} sources {{of a wide range}} of {{biological}} products as starting material is the human blood. These biological human plasma derived medicines play essential role in prevention and treatment of a variety of life threatening diseases. Mention to the starting material of these medicines which is blood or in another word human plasma, possibility of contamination by blood borne viruses cannot be omitted. In recent years possibility of contamination by blood borne viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important concern. Nowadays most of developed countries the risk is minimum, although in developing countries it is still a challenge. Despite measures for human plasma biological derived medicines safety, such as donor selection, testing of donations, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on pooled plasma, still more actions are needed to inactivate or remove viruses such as HBV, HCV and HIV. During the process of manufacturing of biological human plasma medicines, there is several production steps which may contribute to viral reduction. These steps consist of precipitation by centrifugation, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, octanoic acid, or ammonium sulphate, chromatographic methods such as immunoaffinity chromatography or ion exchange chromatography, adsorption by aluminum hydroxide, and separation by filtration. All these steps are considered to be weakly effective as viral reduction treatment, and more effective viral inactivation methods are needed to be implemented in line of production of human plasma derived <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> These safety measures included virus inactivation by different techniques such as acidic pH, solvent/detergent method, pasteurization and heat treatment, beta-propiolactone plus U/V and also virus removal by nanofiltration, which all these virus inactivation or virus removal methods before implementation in line of production of plasma derived biological medicines, should undergo for validation study. 	 		 			Nowadays by screening and testing of donations and implementation of different measures of virus inactivation or virus removal, a good level of safety of plasma derived biological medicines has been achieved. Due to the possibility of emerging new pathogens investigation in this subject should be continued.  ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Biological</b> and biosimilar <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have {{specific}} characteristics {{that call for}} a closer monitoring of their safety profile. Since the current legal framework stems from both European and national regulations, some gaps in the operational field may be expected. The goal {{of this paper is}} to identify these gaps and propose changes to the current information systems and pharmacovigilance regulations. Material and Methods: A qualitative analysis of current pharmacovigilance regulatory framework and supporting information system was conducted. Results: Current pharmacovigilance system does not seem to vouch for the safe use of biologicals and biosimilar drugs. The gaps found in reviewed materials may be attributable to their lack of specificity for biopharmaceuticals. Discussion: Biologicals therapy presents specific determinants related with the drugs, prescription, and traceability, without replication in any other segment of the pharmaceutical market. They are able to shape their safety profile. Conclusion: The existing pharmacovigilance’s regulatory framework should be adjusted in order to improve the safety related with biopharmaceutical therapy.

Medicines of biological and biotechnological origin are obtained from cells, tissue, animal fluids or plant viruses, microorganisms, toxins using methodologies rDNA, transgénesis, hybridoma, among others, {{as set forth}} in Decree 1782 of 2014 in their definitions. These {{have proven to be}} a new alternative in the treatment of diseases of high impact on health with less toxicity for its resemblance to the biological components and for which conventional chemical therapy, it has shown greater inherent adverse effects chemistry and low selectivity the therapeutic target. The development of drugs of biotechnological origin has led to rethinking and changing regulations in each country in order to regulate the marketing of medicinal and guarantee the safety, quality and efficacy thereof. In this context, Colombia has not been the exception and issue in our country of Decree 1782 of 2014 which establishes the health requirements and the procedure for pharmacological evaluation and pharmaceutical <b>biological</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> for processing health record is the sign of this situation.

40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for interchangeable <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed years. The regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices ofgeneric <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined more than the prices of original <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Conclusions: We have found that the analysed regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed period 2003 – 2010.
