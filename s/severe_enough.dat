5|$|Drug therapies {{for those}} with cardiac {{abnormalities}}, as those abnormalities become <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> to warrant {{the use of these}} therapies. ECG's are mandatory prior to any surgical interventions, due to possible arrythmia.|$|E
5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E

50|$|Discrimination against Shia Muslims in Bahrain is <b>severe</b> and {{systematic}} <b>enough</b> {{for a number}} of sources (Time magazine, Vali Nasr, Yitzhak Nakash, Counterpunch, Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, etc.) to have used the term “apartheid” in describing it.|$|R
50|$|On August 5, 2011, the {{combined}} cloud of three consecutive CMEs produced brilliant auroras, reported {{as far south}} as Oklahoma and Alabama. The geomagnetic storm reached a G4 (<b>severe)</b> level, <b>enough</b> to make power outages. It was one of the strongest geomagnetic storms in years. In the southern hemisphere, auroras could have been seen as far north as South Africa, Southern Chile and Southern Australia. The CMEs were hurled by three M-class flares erupted in active sunspot 1261: M1.4 on August 2, M6.0 on August 3 and M9.3 on August 4.|$|R
5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> to warrant a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of the Gothic Revival and saw the renovation as a chance to return St.Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier Gothic design.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the Australian weasel shark is {{commonly}} caught by prawn and fish trawlers operating off northern Australia. Smaller numbers are also captured in gillnets and on longlines. As this species has {{a relatively high}} reproductive rate and losses to fisheries are not <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> to affect its population, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{rainfall}} is {{the only}} effect that these cyclones have on California. Sometimes, the rainfall is <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> to cause flooding and damage. For example, floods from Hurricane Kathleen devastated Ocotillo, California and killed several people. Precipitation other than rainfall is unusual in tropical cyclones, because of their weak updrafts and lack of supercooled water.|$|E
30|$|Discussion Mortality {{was high}} {{in both groups}} ECMO and non-ECMO, {{confirming}} severity of ARDS. Our study identifies a group of patients (AO) proposed to ECMO but, in our opinion, not <b>enough</b> <b>severe</b> to receive it immediately. These patients, with optimization of ventilator settings or implementation of adjuvant therapy, rapidly increase their oxygenation within 24  h and have a low mortality. Interestingly in non-ECMO patients, the PRESERVE score was higher in the CI group.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are a few}} ethical {{concerns}} {{concerning the}} use and development of using virtual reality simulation for helping clients/patients with mental health issues. One example of these concerns is the potential side effects and aftereffects of virtual reality exposure. Some of these side effects and aftereffects could include cybersickness (a type of motion sickness caused by the virtual reality experience), perceptual-motor disturbances, flashbacks, and generally lowered arousal (Rizzo, Schultheis, & Rothbaum, 2003). [...] If <b>severe</b> and widespread <b>enough,</b> these effects should be mitigated via various methods by those therapists using virtual reality.|$|R
50|$|August 1900 {{brought a}} severe drought to the region, so {{negatively}} affecting the A&A's ability to fill its locomotives' boilers that some passenger services {{had to be}} annulled and the railroad was forced to warn freight shippers {{that they might not}} be able to move their cargo. The effects of the drought, although <b>severe,</b> were not <b>enough</b> to stop the railroad's further expansion, with a branch from West End to Jackson Springs announced the following month, and completed in early 1901. Through service over the new branch to Jackson Springs from the Seaboard Railroad began on June 17, 1901.|$|R
5|$|These {{symptoms}} may be <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> {{to warrant}} hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and activated charcoal may be administered {{early on to}} bind residual toxin. Intravenous fluids may be required if dehydration has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly. Once gastric contents are emptied, metoclopramide {{may be used in}} cases of recurrent vomiting.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{abnormalities}} <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> {{to warrant}} treatment {{have an increased}} risk of death reported to be 23% over 18 months and 46% over 50 months. This risk is reduced to less than 10% in those receiving treatment with PAP. Treatment also reduces the need for hospital admissions and reduces healthcare costs.|$|E
5|$|When winter storms hit, {{bringing}} with them combinations of precipitation that making driving difficult and sometimes dangerous, moviegoers often prefer to stay home. Non-essential travel is officially discouraged, and in <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> weather all non-emergency driving can be banned {{in some areas}} until the situation improves. In anticipation of the February 2013 nor'easter, which struck on the month's first weekend, three large chains closed down many of their theaters in the Northeast.|$|E
5000|$|Less frequently, micromanagement is {{a tactic}} {{consciously}} {{chosen for the}} purpose of eliminating unwanted employees: A micromanager may set unreachable standards later invoked as grounds for termination of those employees. These standards may be either specific to certain employees or generally applicable but selectively enforced only against particular employees. Alternatively, the micromanager may attempt by this or other means to create a stressful workplace in which the undesired employees no longer desire to participate. When such stress is <b>severe</b> or pervasive <b>enough,</b> its creation may be regarded as constructive discharge (also known in the United Kingdom as [...] "constructive dismissal" [...] and in the United States as [...] "constructive termination").|$|R
60|$|The {{captain was}} a young man and had {{distinguished}} himself during the war, or he would never have been advanced to rank so early. He was, moreover, the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Monsieur de Potzdorff, a relationship which no doubt aided in the young gentleman's promotion. Captain de Potzdorff was a <b>severe</b> officer <b>enough</b> on parade or in barracks, but he was a person easily led by flattery. I won his heart in the first place by my manner of tying my hair in queue (indeed, it was more neatly dressed than that of any man in the regiment), and subsequently gained his confidence by a thousand little arts and compliments, which as a gentleman myself I knew how to employ. He was a man of pleasure, which he pursued more openly than most men in the stern Court of the King; he was generous and careless with his purse, and he had a great affection for Rhine wine: in all which qualities I sincerely sympathised with him; and from which I, of course, had my profit. He was disliked in the regiment, because he was supposed to have too intimate relations with his uncle the Police Minister; to whom, it was hinted, he carried the news of the corps.|$|R
5000|$|Once SCFE is suspected, {{the patient}} should be non-weight bearing and remain on strict bed rest. In <b>severe</b> cases, after <b>enough</b> rest the patient may require {{physical}} therapy to regain strength and movement {{back to the}} leg. A SCFE is an orthopaedic emergency, as further slippage may result in occlusion of the blood supply and avascular necrosis (risk of 25 percent). Almost all cases require surgery, which usually involves the placement {{of one or two}} pins into the femoral head to prevent further slippage. [...] The recommended screw placement is {{in the center of the}} epiphysis and perpendicular to the physis. Chances of a slippage occurring in the other hip are 20 percent within 18 months of diagnosis of the first slippage and consequently the opposite unaffected femur may also require pinning.|$|R
5|$|Asama made a {{training}} cruise in 1921 before her armament was modified in 1922. All of her main deck guns, six 6-inch and four 12-pounder guns, were removed and their casemates plated over. In addition {{all of her}} QF 2.5-pounder guns were removed and a single 8cm/40 3rd Year Type AA gun was added. After the refit, she resumed her training cruises, generally at two-year intervals, until she ran aground in 1935. The damage to her bottom was <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> that the IJN decided make her a stationary training ship in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{attended}} Charleston's Episcopal Porter-Gaud School, {{where he}} participated in several school plays {{and contributed to the}} school newspaper but was not highly motivated academically. During his adolescence, he briefly fronted A Shot in the Dark, a Rolling Stones cover band. When he was younger, he had hoped to study marine biology, but surgery intended to repair a severely perforated eardrum caused him inner ear damage. The damage was <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> that he was unable to pursue a career that would involve scuba diving. The damage also left him deaf in his right ear.|$|E
5|$|Cracking {{along the}} {{vertical}} join {{of the wooden}} panels was <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> to warrant a third restoration in 1982. Raking light revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E
60|$|The revenue vessel resumed her course {{towards the}} nighest port, worked by but four men: the captain, Israel, and two officers. The cabin-boy was kept at the helm. As the only {{foremast}} man, Israel {{was put to}} it pretty hard. Where there is but one man to three masters, woe betide that lonely slave. Besides, it was of itself <b>severe</b> work <b>enough</b> to manage the vessel thus short of hands. But to make matters still worse, the captain and his officers were ugly-tempered fellows. The one kicked, and the others cuffed Israel. Whereupon, not sugared with his recent experiences, and maddened by his present hap, Israel seeing himself alone at sea, with only three men, instead of a thousand, to contend against, plucked up a heart, knocked the captain into the lee scuppers, and in his fury was about tumbling the first-officer, a small wash of a fellow, plump overboard, when the captain, jumping to his feet, seized him by his long yellow hair, vowing he would slaughter him. Meanwhile the cutter flew foaming through the channel, as if in demoniac glee at this uproar on her imperilled deck. While the consternation was at its height, a dark body suddenly loomed at a moderate distance into view, shooting right athwart {{the stern of the}} cutter. The next moment a shot struck the water within a boat's length.|$|R

40|$|On May 7, 2015, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, held {{in favor}} of Reya C. Boyer-Liberto, an African American {{cocktail}} waitress employed by defendant Fontainebleau Corporation, who claimed racial harassment in violation of Title VII by fellow employee, Trudi Clubb. In Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau Corp., the majority based its analysis on Clubb’s use of a racial epithet, twice in a twenty-four hour period, which they determined was <b>severe</b> or pervasive <b>enough</b> to create a racially hostile work environment, even in isolation. The separate concurring and dissenting opinions emphasized the majority’s departure from precedent established in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. and Faragher v. City of Boca Raton. Both the concurrence and dissent were concerned that the majority’s decision would increase segregation in the workplace, which would be counterproductive to Title VII’s purpose, and would {{lead to an increase}} in frivolous employment litigation...|$|R
5|$|In {{the face}} of {{neighbourhood}} gossip about the death rate in the home, Catherine, Margaret, and Thomas moved their household to 105 Latimer Street and then again to 27 Ascot street. In September 1883, Thomas Higgins, then 45, became yet {{another member of the}} household to fall mysteriously ill. His stomach pains were <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> that Doctor Whitford was called; the doctor attributed Higgins's illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap whiskey and prescribed opium and castor oil. Higgins died after two days of illness. Days later, the same doctor was contacted and asked to provide a death certificate. He did so, attributing the death to dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Guillermo's track, {{the storm}} never {{threatened}} any major landmass, resulting in {{little impact on}} land. However, because of its extreme intensity, it produced large swells across the Pacific Ocean, affecting areas from Hawaii to coastal Mexico. Along the American Pacific coast, three people drowned amid high waves, two in Baja California and one in California. At its peak, Guillermo was the second strongest known Pacific hurricane on record; however, it has since been surpassed by seven other storms, including Linda later that year. The effects of Guillermo were not deemed <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> to justify retirement of its name.|$|E
40|$|In a field {{experiment}} Hagberg falling number differed between varieties and was lowest for Brimstone and highest for Avalon. There was a linear increase in HFN with increasing nitrogen application for Avalon and Brimstone but Mission showed little response. Brimstone lodged more than Avalon or Mission, and nitrogen increased lodging. No sprouting of the grain was observed, however, and since increased lodging caused by nitrogen {{was not associated}} with decreased HFN, lodging was probably insufficiently <b>severe</b> for long <b>enough</b> to stimulate germination. This is supported by the moisture content readings at harvest which did not differ significantly between varieties or fertilizer applications. Nitrogen may have increased HFN in Avalon and Brimstone through delaying grain maturity. Further work is required, however, to confirm this and to explain why the HFN of Mission appeared little affected by nitrogen fertilizer application, which has also been found in other experiments.

40|$|In {{addition}} to its retributive and restorative functions, by its mere existence the International Criminal Court is slated to play a deterrence role never before seen in international criminal law. However, unabated sexualized violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo evidences limits of the permanent ICC’s deterrent capacity. Despite the ICC’s investigation, and indictments and proceedings against Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo for sexually violent war crimes and crimes against humanity, the nascent court is yet unable to elicit preventive effects. While deterrence theory is logically compelling, mechanisms and assumptions underlying it prove impractical when deterrence is assessed in reality. First, the ICC cannot execute certain, <b>severe</b> or swift <b>enough</b> punishment to generally deter. Second, deterrence theory’s assumption that perpetrators are rational actors engaged in utilitarian calculations of legal risk is dispelled by an analysis of Congolese perpetrators’ accounts. Evidently, prosecutions alone will not end sexualized violence in the DRC...|$|R

5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|By {{the next}} day, Mackay {{realised}} {{that the position}} could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied with {{the security of the}} new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed. Mackay's injuries were <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> for him to be evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|In September 1987, B-1B (s/n 84-0052) {{from the}} 96th Bomb Wing, 338th Combat Crew Training Squadron, Dyess AFB crashed near La Junta, Colorado while flying on a {{low-level}} training route. This {{was the only}} B-1B crash to occur with six crew members aboard. The two crew members in jump seats, {{and one of the}} four crew members in ejection seats perished. The root cause of the accident was thought to be a bird strike on a wing's leading edge during the low-level flight. The impact was <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> to sever fuel and hydraulic lines {{on one side of the}} aircraft, the other side's engines functioned long enough to allow for ejection. The B-1B fleet was later modified to protect these supply lines.|$|E
40|$|Histological changes {{attributable}} to busulphan {{were found at}} necropsy in the lungs of six out of 14 cases of chronic granulocytic leukaemia. The alveoli contained persistent fibrinous oedema converting to fibrous tissue, and also atypical cells. Only one out of seven controls with leukaemia showed fibrinous oedema, and atypical cells were absent. In the lungs from rare cases of fatal pulmonary fibrosis due to busulphan, the histological changes were similar but more severe. It is concluded that busulphan commonly causes fibrinous oedema in chronic granulocytic leukaemia and on rare occasions it becomes <b>severe</b> or persistent <b>enough</b> to cause fatal fibrosis of the lungs. The name busulphan lung is suggested {{for any of these}} changes. The term `intra-alveolar fibrosis' should be used instead of `interstitial fibrosis', as it had been called by most previous authors. Despite these findings we consider that this valuable drug should be discontinued only in those very rare instances when intra-alveolar fibrosis shows signs of becoming disabling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: Prognosis of post-cardiac arrest {{patients}} {{remains very}} bleak, {{not only because}} of anoxic-ischemic neurological damage, but also because of the "post-cardiac arrest syndrome", a phenomenon often <b>enough</b> <b>severe</b> to cause death before any neurological evaluation. This syndrome includes all clinical and biological manifestations related to the phenomenon of global ischemia-reperfusion triggered by cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation. The main component of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome is an early but severe cardio-circulatory dysfunction that may lead to multiple organ failure and death. Cardiovascular support relies on conventional medical and mechanical treatment of circulatory failure. Hemodynamic stabilization is a major objective to limit secondary brain insult. When the cause of cardiac arrest is related to myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary revascularization is associated with improved prognosis; early angiographic exploration should then be discussed when there is no obvious extra-cardiac cause. Therapeutic hypothermia is now the cornerstone of post anoxic cerebral protection. Its widespread use is clearly recommended, with favourable risk-benefit ratio in selected population. Neuroprotection is also based on the prevention of secondary cerebral damages, pending the results of ongoing therapeutic evaluations regarding the potential efficiency of new therapeutic drugs...|$|R
5000|$|The {{placement}} of tubes {{is not a}} cure. If middle ear disease has been <b>severe</b> or prolonged <b>enough</b> to justify tube placement, {{there is a strong}} possibility that the child will continue to have episodes of middle ear inflammation or fluid collection. There may be early drainage through the tube (tube otorrhea) in about 15% of patients in the first two weeks after placement, and developing in 25% more than three months after insertion, although usually not a longterm problem. [...] Otorrhea is considered to be secondary to bacterial colonization. The most commonly isolated organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the most troublesome is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Some practitioners use topical antibiotic drops in the postoperative period, but research shows that this practice does not eradicate the bacterial biofilm. [...] A laboratory study showed that tubes covered in the antibiotic vancomycin prevented in-vitro formation of MRSA biofilm as compared to noncoated ones, although no study has been conducted on humans yet. Comparing phosphorylcholine-coated fluoroplastic tympanostomy tubes to uncoated fluoroplastic tympanostomy tubes showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of post-operative otorrhea, tube blockage, or extrusion.|$|R
