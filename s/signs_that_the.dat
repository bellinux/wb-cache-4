5|$|By 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimated}} that 4,011 people had {{succumbed to the}} waterborne disease since the outbreak began in August 2008, and {{the total number of}} cases recorded had reached 89,018. In Harare, the city council offered free graves to cholera victims. There had been <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> disease is abating, with cholera infections down by about 50% to around 4,000 cases a week.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{experienced}} an earthquake in Chile and saw <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> land {{had just been}} raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide. High in the Andes he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls.|$|E
5|$|Air can {{be trapped}} {{under the skin}} in necrotizing infections such as gangrene, {{occurring}} as a late sign in gas gangrene, {{of which it is}} the hallmark sign. Subcutaneous emphysema is also considered a hallmark of fournier gangrene. Symptoms of subcutaneous emphysema can result when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation. When emphysema occurs due to infection, <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> infection is systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.|$|E

50|$|Differences {{in values}} cause parents to {{interpret}} different actions in different ways. Asking questions {{is seen by}} many European American parents as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> child is smart. Italian parents, who value social and emotional competence, believe that asking questions is a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> child has good interpersonal skills. Dutch parents, who value independence, view asking questions negatively, as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> child is not independent. Indigenous American parents often try to encourage curiosity in their children. Many use a permissive parenting style <b>that</b> enables <b>the</b> child to explore and learn through observation {{of the world around}} it.|$|R

5|$|Two {{months after}} the protests in Shifang, {{residents}} told the New York Times {{that there were no}} <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sichuan Hongda project was being resuscitated, and that the city had been quiet since the demonstrations concluded. An executive with Sichuan Hongda told Caijing magazine on July 9 that it was unclear whether the construction for copper plant would go forward in the future, and whether it would be located in Sichuan province.|$|E
5|$|Although still {{billed as}} having been the most {{extensive}} television coverage of the Pan American Games ever broadcast in the country, the CBC faced criticism {{for the amount of}} coverage it produced and broadcast from the 2015 Pan American Games. Only condensed, tape-delayed highlights of events aired on CBC Television, drawing comparisons to the similar practices imposed by NBC's coverage of the Olympics. Most events were streamed online, and pay television channel Sportsnet aired the soccer tournaments on TV, but events in some sports received only limited online coverage, or were not broadcast at all. Part-way through the Games, the CBC expanded its primetime coverage block, while broadcasts of a semi-final game in men's basketball on Sportsnet and the baseball finals online were added at the last minute. Critics perceived these last-minute changes as <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CBC had underestimated viewer interest in the Pan-Am Games.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January {{a native}} {{reported}} seeing seven Japanese {{in the hills}} south west of Sio and a patrol was sent out under Corporal Bengari to investigate. On arriving in the vicinity on 24 January, a local reported that another 22 Japanese had arrived. The next morning, Bengari and his five companions ambushed the Japanese and killed them all before they could fire a shot. Wirraway and Boomerang aircraft of No. 4 Squadron RAAF scouted ahead of the advance. Its aerial reconnaissance work let the Australians and Papuans know where opposition could be expected, thereby speeding up the advance. The pilots noted Japanese parachutes, <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese were receiving supplies by air. On 4 February, the Australians were also forced onto air supply, as swollen rivers washed {{out a number of}} bridges.|$|E

50|$|Infections {{involving}} fascial {{spaces of}} the head and neck may give varying signs and symptoms depending upon the spaces involved. Trismus (difficulty opening the mouth) is a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> muscles of mastication (<b>the</b> muscles <b>that</b> move <b>the</b> jaw) are involved. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and dyspnoea (difficulty breathing) may be a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> airway is being compressed by the swelling.|$|R

5|$|The most {{characteristic}} initial {{physical symptoms}} are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea. Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction {{by at least}} three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system in the brain {{that is responsible for}} movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.|$|E
5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{was named}} Lord Chancellor of England on 17 May 1226. The {{appointment}} {{was made by}} the great council during the minority of King Henry III, and Neville obtained a grant of the office for life. Unlike Hubert de Burgh, who lost his offices when Henry III attained his majority and took control of the government, Neville remained chancellor with only slight disagreements until 1238, although a confirmation of the lifetime nature of his tenure was made in 1232. Under Neville, the first <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chancery was becoming a department of the government, rather than just a royal department {{that was part of the}} royal household, began to emerge. The contemporary writer Matthew Paris praised Neville for his actions as chancellor, claiming that he treated all equally and was transparent in discharging his duties, which was important, as the chancellor's office controlled access to the king. Neville oversaw a number of changes in chancery procedures, splitting off the liberate rolls from the letters close in 1226 and reviving the keeping of the Charter Rolls in 1227. He also issued writs on his own authority, the so-called writs de cursu. Neville received a number of gifts and privileges from the king while chancellor, including the right of exemption from the seizure of his possessions by any royal or other secular official. The king also agreed not to interfere with the execution of Neville's last will and testament.|$|E

25|$|Tolerance to the {{therapeutic}} effects of stimulants can occur, and rebound of symptoms may {{occur when the}} dose wears off. Rebound effects are often {{the result of the}} stimulant dosage being too high or the individual not being able to tolerate stimulant medication. <b>Signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stimulant dose is too high include irritability, feeling stimulated or blunting of affect and personality.|$|E

There were rumours that he would return to Stoke City, but at the end of the season he was still in tangerine.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} may be starting to change, as conservation {{groups and the}} media spotlight have pressured the government to fire some local officials for participating in illegal exports and send gendarmerie to increase surveillance in part of the SAVA region. They have also promised to more closely monitor the exports that they have temporarily approved.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{opposition}} from conservatives, in April 2008, there were <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party base was coalescing behind McCain's candidacy. A CBS News/New York Times {{poll showed that}} McCain was viewed favorably by 78 percent of conservatives, and unfavorably by only 18 percent. This was the same percentage who had an unfavorable opinion of George W. Bush {{at the same time}} in 2000.|$|E

50|$|Many {{types of}} surgery {{do not require}} the patient to be paralyzed. A patient who is anesthetized but not paralyzed can move in {{response}} to a painful stimulus if the analgesia is inadequate. This may serve as a warning <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> anesthetic depth is inadequate. Movement under general anesthesia does not imply full awareness but is a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> anesthesia is light. Even without the use of paralytics the absence of movement does not necessarily imply amnesia.|$|R

Foote sent Phelps to {{the post}} with a flag of truce and discovered that the Confederates {{were in the process}} of abandoning the location, and were moving most of their heavy guns to Island No. 10. Columbus was occupied by Union forces, on March 4.|$|E
