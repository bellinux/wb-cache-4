40|$|Stem {{diameter}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly measured attributes of trees, forming the foundation of forest censuses and monitoring. Changes in tree stem circumference include both irreversible woody stem growth and reversible circumference changes related to water status, yet these fine-scale dynamics are rarely leveraged to understand forest ecophysiology and typically ignored in plot- or stand-scale estimates of tree growth and forest productivity. Here, we deployed automated dendrometer bands on 12 - 40 trees at four different forested sites-two temperate broadleaf deciduous, one temperate conifer, and one tropical broadleaf semi-deciduous-to understand how tree circumference varies on time scales of hours to months, how these dynamics relate to environmental conditions, and whether the structure of these variations might introduce <b>substantive</b> <b>error</b> into estimates of woody growth. Diurnal stem circumference dynamics measured over the bark commonly-but not consistently-exhibited daytime shrinkage attributable to transpiration-driven changes in stem water storage. The amplitude of this shrinkage was significantly correlated with climatic variables (daily temperature range, vapor pressure deficit, and radiation), sap flow and evapotranspiration. Diurnal variations were typically < 0. 5 mm circumference in amplitude and unlikely to be of concern to most studies of tree growth. Over time scales of multiple days, the bands captured circumference increases in response to rain events, likely driven by combinations of increased stem water storage and bark hydration. Particularly at the tropical site, these rain responses could be quite substantial, ranging up to 1. 5 mm circumference expansion within 48 hours following a rain event. We conclude that over-bark measurements of stem circumference change sometimes correlate with but have limited potential for directly estimating daily transpiration, but that they can be valuable on time scales of days to weeks for characterizing changes in stem growth and hydration...|$|E

For discussion purposes, the article describes two hypothetical models for Supreme Court decisionmaking in patent cases: an aggressive interventionist model and an extreme non-interventionist model. After considering the shortcomings of both models, the article proposes an intermediate, managerial model. The managerial model rejects the proposition that the Court should intervene in patent cases to correct perceived <b>substantive</b> <b>errors</b> in Federal Circuit decisions. Instead, the model encourages the Court to manage disputes over the appropriate allocation of power among institutions of the patent system. Accordingly, the Court should intervene in patent cases that present such issues, and should direct its opinions towards resolving such issues, leaving the elaboration of detailed substantive patent doctrine to the Federal Circuit...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether an intervention program {{based on a}} neuropsychological approach to specific reading disability subtypes would improve overall reading ability, Subjects were middle school righthanded boys and girls who were low achieving readers. The readers were initially subtyped according to Bakker's clinical-inferential approach used with clinic children and classified as L-type dyslexic (<b>substantive</b> <b>errors</b> and excessively fast reading), P-type dyslexic (slow and laborious reading), or M-type dyslexic (a combination of both L-type and P-type dyslexia). The method of assessment {{was used as a}} pre-posttest group design. The dependent variables included a reading decoding measure, oral reading errors, and comprehension scores from the Multilevel Academic Skills Inventory (MASI), which is a reading and language battery. All three groups were receiving additional reading instruction from their school reading program. Experimental treatment occurred in two parts: Hemispheric Specific Stimulation (HSS) and Hemispheric Alluding Stimuli (HAS). When the study was concluded, a fused dichotic listening task was administered once to discern a potential relationship between the subtypes of the groups and their particular hemispheric processing capacity for language. The results revealed that the neuropsychological treatment was effective at improving reading comprehension and accuracy. Although there were perceived benefits in comprehension, no direct comprehension exercises were used in this study so the gains could have been attributed to the school reading program. There were no changes in word recognition between the pretest and the posttest. The results from the fused dichotic words task were not significant...|$|R

This historical study examines the Aristotelian foundations of the Library and Museum of Alexandria for the purpose of (1) understanding how the Library and Museum differed from preceding ancient Near Eastern information institutions (i. e., protolibraries) and (2) how Aristotle‘s methodologies for producing scientific knowledge were carried out in Alexandria. While protolibraries served as safeguards for maintaining a static cultural/political ―stream of tradition‖ and created, organized, and maintained ―library‖ documents to this end, the Library of Alexandria was a tool for theoretical knowledge creation. The Library materialized Aristotelian pre-scientific theory, specifically dialectic and served the scholarly community of the Museum in its research. Following the Library, collections of materialized endoxa, or recorded esteemed opinions, became a necessary tool for use by scholarly communities. The Library established the post-Aristotelian paradigm under which academic libraries still operate. Although the Library of Alexandria represented a fundamental shift in the meaning and purpose of collections of recorded documents, a feminist critique of the post-Aristotelian library shows that the academic library, while used in knowledge creation, is rooted in a foundationalist philosophy that validates and maintains the status quo...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relative}} incidence of serious errors of omission versus errors of commission. Objective : To identify the most common <b>substantive</b> medical <b>errors</b> identified by medical record review. Design : Retrospective cohort study. Setting : Twelve Veterans Affairs health care systems in 2 regions. Participants : Stratified random sample of 621 patients receiving care over a 2 -year period. Main Outcome Measure : Classification of reported quality problems. Methods : Trained physicians reviewed the full inpatient and outpatient record and described quality problems, which were then classified as errors of omission versus commission. Results : Eighty-two percent of patients had at least 1 error reported over a 13 -month period. The average number of errors reported per case was 4. 7 (95 % confidence intervals [CI]: 4. 4, 5. 0). Overall, 95. 7 % (95 % CI: 94. 9 %, 96. 4 %) of errors were identified as being problems with underuse. Inadequate care for people with chronic illnesses was particularly common. Among errors of omission, obtaining insufficient information from histories and physicals (25. 3 %), inadequacies in diagnostic testing (33. 9 %), and patients not receiving needed medications (20. 7 %) were all common. Out of the 2, 917 errors identified, only 27 were rated as being highly serious, and 26 (96 %) of these were errors of omission.

40|$|How {{does the}} choice of size metric, {{specimen}} selection, and taxonomic level affect the results of macroevolutionary or ecological analyses? Four molluscan data sets are used {{to address this question}} as follows. First, the relationships among various size metrics are examined using a morphometric data set of Late Cretaceous–Oligocene veneroid bivalves. Second, the relationship between the size of bulk-sampled specimens and the size of species' type specimens is examined using bulk-sampled bivalves and gastropods from the Coffee Sand (Upper Cretaceous, Mississippi). Third, the same relationship is examined using mollusk-dominated field censuses from the type Cincinnatian (Upper Ordovician, Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky). Fourth, the relationship between the size of the type species of a genus and median species size is examined using literature-derived measurements of bivalve type specimens from the recent eastern Pacific continental shelf. Together these data sets provide estimates of the biases imposed by measuring different kinds of specimens and using different methods of estimating body size. The geometric mean of length and height is highly correlated with more complex morphometrically based metrics and is our preferred bivalve size metric. Bulk or randomly sampled specimens are significantly smaller than species' type specimens for the Cretaceous dataset but significantly larger for the Ordovician dataset. Genus' type-species size is an unbiased estimate of median species size. These results suggest that large-scale studies can use the size of the type species of a genus as an unbiased proxy for a type-specimen size of a genus' median species, but that species' type-specimen size is a biased proxy for bulk or randomly sampled specimens. In addition, this study emphasizes the importance of using a single type of measurement within studies and suggests that combining multiple types of specimens (e. g., type specimens and bulk-sampled specimens) could lead to <b>substantive</b> <b>errors.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Classical {{parametric}} statistic {{procedures are}} widely used in the research community. However, for classical tests to produce accurate results, the assumptions underlying them must be sufﬁciently satisﬁed. When the assumptions are not met, {{the results of the}} analysis {{may be due to the}} violation of the assumptions, instead of the true pattern of the data. The assumptions are rarely met when analyzing real data. The use of classic parametric methods with violated assumptions may lead to <b>substantive</b> <b>errors</b> in the interpretation of data. As an alternative to normal theory statistics, nonparametric statistical procedures do not make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, nor do they require large sample sizes to produce a normal distribution of errors. Nonparametric statistics also have an advantage of preserving Type I error rates to nominal alpha and having more power under the conditions of concomitant heteroscedasticity and treatment effects under nonnormal distributions. Haga’s test is a nonparametric method to exam locations of ranks of two independent samples. It is an improved version of Rosenbaum test. This study examines and compares the robustness and power of the nonparametric Haga test with that of the Tukey’s Quick test, Welch-Aspin t test, Yuen’s test and Student’s t test under the condition of concomitant heteroscedasticity and treatment effect via the method of Monte Carlo simulations. The result of the simulations indicated that under the theoretical nonnormal distributions, Haga’s test and Tukey’s Quick test were more robust than Student’s t test, Welch-Aspin’s t test and Yuen’s test at all alpha levels. When there was no variance effects (scale 1 : 1) or a slight variance increment (scale 1 : 1. 1), Haga’s test was the most powerful test for nonnormal theoretical distributions. When there was medium (scale 1 : 4) or large (scale 1 : 16) variance effects, Haga’s test was the most powerful test for equal sample sizes, and Student’s t test was the most powerful test for unequal sample sizes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the failure of {{individual}} people living in affluent societies {{to do more to}} help those living in conditions of extreme poverty at the present moment. Affluent people have the capacity to assist, by contributing additional funds to aid and humanitarian organisations. Given an understanding of what is at stake, the fact that they fail to do so is both morally problematic and difficult to explain. Yet, without an understanding of the causes of inaction, {{it is difficult to know}} what measures may be taken to alleviate extreme suffering in the world today. The thesis draws upon different philosophical accounts of practical reason to argue that the conduct of the affluent can only be understood in one of three ways: these people may lack decisive reason to assist, they may be misinformed, or they may be rationally deficient in some regard. Considering each possibility in turn, it advances two central arguments. Firstly, the normative reasons claim is sound: affluent people, who do not incur minor costs by assisting, ought to do more. Secondly, these people tend to have false beliefs about the nature of poverty, to make <b>substantive</b> <b>errors</b> of judgement, and to follow flawed patterns of reasoning when they deliberate about what to do. Taken together, these factors explain their failure to act. Building upon this diagnosis, the thesis then considers how to respond to the problem of inaction, advancing a solution that is institutional in character. It argues for the construction of a division of labour between state and citizen, at the national level, which would see political institutions take on responsibility for poverty eradication, thereby leaving individuals freer to pursue their own personal goals and objectives. In order to perform this function effectively, wealthy nations would have to improve the quantity and quality of assistance that they provide to low-income countries. They would also have to cease partaking in practices that harm the global poor. This approach has a number of advantages over reliance on private philanthropy alone: it forms part of a fair and effective solution to the problem of motivating assistance, the arrangement it proposes is both stable and legitimate, and it is also something that could be achieved in practice. Therefore, it represents part of the best possible way in which to proceed. this thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of environmental assessment (EA) in Ontario, Canada and elsewhere {{has been criticized}} for resulting in projects that are not necessarily “good” for the environment or society, but simply “less bad. ” In Ontario, the ongoing erosion over time of meaningful public involvement in the EA process is seen as a major reason for the degradation of EA practice from something closer to its idealistic purpose of creating “sustainable” development down to its current state, as many have suggested, as an administrative process to ensure legislated minimum requirements (for action or outcome) are met. Nonetheless, the EA process in Ontario continues to offer one of the best legislated processes available for addressing the potential negative impacts associated with public projects in the province. Ontario’s streamlined Class EA process allows for routine, low-impact public projects to proceed without ministerial review so long as certain minimum standards for technical review and public consultation are met. It also includes a mechanism for stakeholders to request ministerial review should a stakeholder believe a <b>substantive</b> or procedural <b>error</b> or oversight has occurred during the study. This mechanism, called a Part II Order request, has been invoked in recent years for multiple reasons in addition to correcting <b>substantive</b> or procedural <b>errors</b> or oversights. This research asks why stakeholders request Part II Orders. Through review and coding of Part II Order request letters from various projects across Ontario, and conducting detailed case studies of projects for which Part II Order requests were made in the Greater Toronto Area, it was determined that the two most commonly-found issues in the Part II Order letters were related to stakeholders feeling distrustful of the proponent or the EA process, and stakeholders feeling as though they were not adequately engaged in public consultation activities for the EA study. The case studies examined these themes in greater detail, and found that these two issues were intertwined with issues of stakeholder power and control. The research findings suggest that EA outcomes can be improved by altering public consultation activities to provide stakeholders with greater control over the decision-making process in a transparent manner so that stakeholders are aware not only of the perspectives of the proponent, but also those of other stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|The appeal plays {{a central}} role in the modern Canadian {{criminal}} justice system. Appellate rulings are the primary means by which, through the assessment of trial <b>error,</b> <b>substantive</b> criminal law and the law of evidence evolve and develop. Scarcely more than a century ago, however, formal criminal appeals were unknown to Anglo-Canadian criminal procedure. What provoked the creation of a criminal appellate procedure? Why and how did criminal appeals emerge in Canada at the end of the 19 th century? Answers to these questions can enrich our appreciation of the essential nature and function of the modern criminal appeal. This article examines the 19 th century English debates on the establishment of a criminal appeal and places these debates in the context of the loss of the old forms of jury control in the 18 th century. The author shows that the emergence of the criminal appeal was closely tied to a 19 th century debate between the judges of England and members of the legal profession about the frailties of trial by jury and the need for a new means of trial error correction. The author argues that, accordingly, the modern criminal appeal is best understood as, at core, a mechanism of jury control...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether arbitrators’ {{application of}} the wrong substantive law is a ground for challenge of arbitral awards. The topic is divided into the theoretical question of whether to refer the arbitrators’ {{application of the}} wrong substantive law to excess of mandate or procedural irregularity, and the practical question of how national courts handle the demarcation problems that occur in review of awards. The scope of the thesis is limited to challenges on the grounds excess of mandate and procedural irregularity under section 34 of the Swedish Arbitration Act (SAA). [1] The SAA has thereby served {{as a basis for}} the study, but the legislative history, case law and doctrine have also been important. The thesis finds that arbitrators’ application of the wrong substantive law could in theory constitute both excess of mandate and procedural irregularity. However, there are several demarcation problems that occur in practice because it is difficult to distinguish between <b>substantive</b> and procedural <b>errors.</b> Therefore, it seems like only a deliberate disregard of the parties’ choice of law could lead to awards being set aside. Throughout the thesis, the interests of party autonomy and finality of awards are weighed against one another with the conclusion that theory seems to emphasize party autonomy whereas practice seems to emphasize finality of awards. The thesis provides an alternative school of thought of how national courts’ could handle demarcation problems to allow for a wider scope of review on the provision procedural irregularity. This would permit review of also substantive matters to ensure that no significant procedural error has occurred and thus, it would lead to a better balance between party autonomy and finality of awards.

40|$|Before {{test scores}} {{should be used}} for {{educational}} decision-making, it is important {{to determine the extent to}} which the test activates processes that are actually related to the skills it purports to measure. This study explored the role that picture perception plays in children's performance on the Word Knowledge subtest of the Gates MacGinitie Reading Test. Research has demonstrated that African American children have scored significantly lower than their European American peers on a receptive picture vocabulary test, but these studies did not use qualitative methods to explore the role picture interpretation plays in performance. To address limitations of previous picture vocabulary research, 128 second grade students from two predominantly African American school districts were randomly assigned to the following test conditions: a) Standard Administration Format. b) Think-Aloud. Students discussed how they selected answers. c) No-picture. Pictures were replaced with verbal definitions. d) Free Response. Students described the picture showed; no response choices were provided. These test conditions addressed three questions: a) Did performance differ as a function of test condition? b) Was syntactic class of the vocabulary items related to performance? c) What processes did children use to select their answers, especially for frequently missed items? Results revealed that overall, thinking aloud and the type of stim ulus (picture versus definition) was not related to performance. However, item-level analyses revealed 9 items in which performance differed based on stimulus type. For children in the standard and think-aloud conditions, performance was better on nouns and verbs than on adjectives, and performance on nouns and verbs was comparable. For the no-picture condition, performance was best on verbs and performance on nouns and adjectives was comparable. Think-alouds and free-responses revealed possible explanations for why students frequently missed some items, such as misinterpreting key elements of the picture, and choosing distracters. There was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the Word Knowledge subtest lacks <b>substantive</b> validity. However, <b>error</b> patterns revealed recommendations for test administration (e. g., use different prompts for each part of speech) and instruction (e. g., monitoring and cognitive flexibility) that could help to minimize errors related to picture perception skills...|$|R
