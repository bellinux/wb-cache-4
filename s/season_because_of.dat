Two months later, it was reported that she was undergoing wrist surgery and would miss about half the <b>season</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> recovery. Joining news that Amy Rodriguez would be out for the <b>season</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy and Megan Rapinoe would be returning mid-season after a six-month stint for Olympique Lyonnais, the Reign faced a tough first half of the season and went 0–9–1 in their first ten games.

5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season.

The American Football Coaches Association brought the national championship trophy to the game and displayed it on the field near Bevo, the UT mascot (photo below).|$|E

Despite playing in only four games during the season, he finished the regular season as the Hokies' No. 5 receiver, catching 13 passes for 298 yards. Scales' injury caused the Hokies to be ranked among {{the worst in the}} Big East in receiving yardage, averaging less than 180 yards per game through the air. As the game moved closer, however, Scales recovered from his injury and appeared near full strength.|$|E

Carlisle represented his home county of Lancashire at youth level. The start of his professional career was his Football League debut for Blackpool in September 1997. He moved to Queens Park Rangers in May 2000. In the same year, Carlisle won three caps for the England under-21 national team. He missed a number of matches for Queens Park Rangers due to a posterior cruciate ligament injury which at one stage led doctors to believe that his career was over.

Later that month he returned to England and raced for Lord Derby at his Newmarket stables. Formby continued as a jockey until 1921, although he never won a race.|$|E
5|$|Jones was {{selected}} by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) with the second pick in the 1946 NFL Draft, but did not sign with the team as he pondered returning to LSU to finish his studies. When the Miami Seahawks of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) offered him a $12,000 contract, however, he accepted it and joined the team. The Seahawks won just three games in 1946, the AAFC's first season of play, and Jones was traded along with two other players to the Brooklyn Dodgers, another AAFC team, in December.

Jones played sparingly for the Dodgers {{in the last three}} games of the 1946 season, rushing for 62 yards on 19 carries.|$|E

Brown missed {{the entirety of the}} following <b>season</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> injury. Upon his return, he was unable to repeat his previous success and was ousted from the opening positions by Arthur Morris and Sid Barnes. Selected for the Invincibles tour, he performed reasonably well in the tour matches but, with Morris and Barnes entrenched as openers, he batted out of position in the middle order during the first two Tests. He struggled and was dropped from the Test team, never to return. Upon returning to Australia, Brown continued playing for Queensland {{until the end of the}} 1949–50 season.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{special teams}} squad was more highly {{regarded}} than its defense. Overall, Virginia Tech was 14th nationally in net punting and 37th in kickoff returns. Punter Jimmy Kibble was the No. 10 {{player in the}} country at his position, averaging 45.1 yards per kick during the regular <b>season.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> Virginia Tech's success at blocking kicks—the Hokies blocked seven during the season—North Carolina made a special effort to prepare for Virginia Tech's kick blockers on special teams. Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham set Big East single-season records for field goals made (19) and points scored by kicking (92) during the season. He was 35 of 36 on extra points and 19 for 23 on field goals, but caught the flu prior to the Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Cricket and {{football}} became {{popular in the}} state; both were introduced in Malabar during the British colonial period in the 19th century.

However, the Kerala cricket team has never won or performed well at the Ranji Trophy. A cricket club from Kerala, the Kochi Tuskers, played in the Indian Premier League's fourth season. However, the team was disbanded after the <b>season</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> conflicts of interest among its franchises. Football {{is one of the}} most widely played and watched sports with huge support for club and district level matches. In the Indian Super League the official team of Kerala is the Kerala Blasters. Kozhikode in Kerala hosts the Sait Nagjee Football Tournament. Kerala is one of the major footballing states in India along with West Bengal and Goa and has produced national players like I. M. Vijayan, C. V. Pappachan, V. P. Sathyan, Jo Paul Ancheri, and Pappachen Pradeep. The Kerala state football team has won the Santhosh Trophy five times; in 1973, 1992, 1993, 2001 and 2004.
