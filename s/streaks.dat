5|$|<b>Streaks</b> {{are common}} across Mars and new ones appear {{frequently}} on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The <b>streaks</b> are dark {{at first and}} get lighter with age. The <b>streaks</b> can start in a tiny area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils. Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.|$|E
5|$|It has {{parallel}} wing bars on {{the half}} of the wings connected near the white patch giving it a distinctive appearance in flight. The black central rectrices and typical white lateral rectrices are also noticeable in flight. The iris is usually a light green-yellow or a yellow, {{but there have been}} instances of an orange color. The bill is black with a brownish black appearance at the base. The juvenile appearance is marked by its <b>streaks</b> on its back, distinguished spots and <b>streaks</b> on its chest, and a gray or grayish-green iris.|$|E
50|$|The Cardinals {{finished}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 17-11, including an 8-8 conference record an appearances in two tournaments.

5|$|The cheetah {{is often}} {{confused}} with the leopard and the cougar and can be distinguished by its small round spots {{in contrast to the}} leopard's rosettes and the cougar's plain coat; in addition, the leopard lacks the tear <b>streaks</b> of the cheetah. The cougar possesses neither the tear <b>streaks</b> nor the spotted coat pattern of the cheetah. The serval has a form very {{similar to that of the}} cheetah but is significantly smaller. Moreover, it has a shorter tail and spots that fuse to form stripes on the back.|$|E
50|$|Alabama won {{the first}} five games of he season, {{extending}} their winning <b>streak</b> to 28 games, matching the longest win <b>streak</b> in school history.

50|$|Miami {{holds the}} longest {{consecutive}} post season appearance <b>streak</b> at 44 consecutive years (1973-2016). This <b>streak</b> {{is the longest}} of any men's NCAA Div. 1 major sport, topping the football post season <b>streak</b> of 35 seasons (Nebraska 1972-2006) and the basketball <b>streak</b> of 27 seasons (North Carolina 1974-2001).|$|R
5|$|The female is {{very similar}} to the male but the upper parts are {{somewhat}} more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes. The throat and breast are paler with fewer, smaller markings. The beak is similar to the male's winter beak. The juvenile are a duller colour than the adults with pale coloured <b>streaks</b> on the feathers that have dark <b>streaks</b> in the adult. The young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|The tear <b>streaks</b> are a {{means of}} visual communication. The tear <b>streaks</b> {{combined}} with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscure from a distance, {{and so are the}} expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{variations}} in plumage {{between the three}} subspecies. Anairetes parulus aequatorialis tends to be browner than the nominate subspecies in its upperparts, with broader and more extensive breast <b>streaks</b> and broader and more distinct white wingbars. A. p. patagonicus has more variation from the nominate subspecies as it is paler gray overall, particularly on the crown, and the wingbars and breast <b>streaks</b> are broader and more distinct. A. p. patagonicus underbelly is also a paler yellow to white.|$|E

50|$|Automated {{equipment}} is used at industrial level for <b>streak</b> plating the solid media {{in order to}} achieve better sterilization and consistency of <b>streaking</b> and for reliably faster work. While <b>streaking</b> manually it is important to avoid scratching the solid medium as subsequent <b>streak</b> lines will be damaged and non-uniform deposition of inoculum at damaged sites on the medium yield clustered growth of microbes which may extend into nearby <b>streak</b> lines.|$|R
50|$|Boston College {{has been}} to 25 bowl games, {{currently}} holding a 14-11 record. The Eagles posted an 8-game bowl winning <b>streak</b> from 2000 to 2007 and went to 12 consecutive bowl games from 1999 to 2010. BC's 8-game bowl win <b>streak</b> was the nation's longest active <b>streak</b> before it was snapped in 2008. The 12-year <b>streak</b> was tied with Oklahoma for the 6th longest active <b>streak</b> in country.

5|$|A. r. scottii, {{described}} by George Sennett in 1888, is found from northern Arizona to New Mexico south to northeastern Sonora and northwestern Coahuila. It {{appears to be}} a darker gray than A. r. eremoeca and has narrower and darker rufous <b>streaks</b> on its breast.|$|E
5|$|During this process, fungal spores {{germinate}} in the boreholes, {{a reaction}} {{caused by the}} dryness of the tree, creating an appropriate environment and an entry for air. The fungus breaks down the lignin, causing white rot. It moves towards the vertically aligned xylem.

50|$|The Blackhawks {{began their}} title defense with and average month of October. The Hawks went 6-5-0. However {{fortunes}} increased in November (7-3-1) and December (9-5-1). The Hawks finished December on two game winning <b>streak,</b> looking {{to keep the}} wins coming in 2016. The Blackhawks did just that, winning the first 10 games of January to bring the win <b>streak</b> to 12 games. The <b>streak</b> set a franchise record for consecutive wins. The <b>streak</b> tied the Florida Panthers win <b>streak</b> {{earlier in the season}} for the longest winning <b>streak</b> in the NHL that season.|$|R

5000|$|The current {{record for}} the largest group <b>streak</b> was {{established}} at the University of Georgia, with 1,543 simultaneous streakers on March 7, 1974. The University of Colorado comes in second with 1,200 streakers, and the University of Maryland ranks third, with 553 naked students <b>streaking</b> three miles in March 1974. Erskine College claimed the highest per-capita <b>streak,</b> when 25% of its 600 students participated in a <b>streaking</b> party in 1974. It is also believed that an alumni from Cornell College in Iowa has <b>streaked</b> the homecoming pep rally (estimated 1,200 attendees) 7 consecutive years without being caught. This individual <b>streaked</b> all four years he attended Cornell College and continued to <b>streak</b> for the 3 years following his graduation.|$|R
5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and {{hepatopancreas}} are visible through the shell but are often slightly obscured by {{the thickness of the}} shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, tinted with olive, often marked with black <b>streaks</b> and blotches. Over the hepatopancreas is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and <b>streaks.</b> A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive. However, the mark is not present on the hatchlings, making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler {{has mostly}} black, gray, and white plumage, which is soft, lacking gloss. With its {{striping}} {{and the small}} yellow spot between its eye and bill, it is a distinctive bird. The sexes differ slightly, both having gray upperparts with black <b>streaks,</b> and white underparts with black <b>streaks</b> on the flanks. The adult male is striped with a black on the crown, throat, and below the eye, and has white around its chin and above its eye. The adult female has more dingy plumage on its head, with a white throat and dark gray cheeks. The most similar birds to the black-throated gray warbler are the black-and-white and blackpoll warblers, which although marked in black have entirely different plumage patterns.|$|E
5|$|The female has {{no black}} {{markings}} or grey crown. Its upperparts and head are brown with darker <b>streaks</b> around the mantle and a distinct pale supercilium. Its underparts are pale grey-brown. The female's bill is brownish-grey and becomes darker in breeding plumage approaching {{the black of}} the male's bill.|$|E
50|$|Finally, BMP {{signaling}} is {{also important}} for regulating the process of <b>streak</b> formation in the chick embryo. The site of <b>streak</b> formation is characterized by low BMP signals, {{while the rest of}} the epiblast displays high levels of BMP activation. In addition, misexpression of either BMP4 or BMP7 prevents <b>streak</b> formation, while the BMP inhibitor Chordin induces ectopic <b>streak</b> formation in the chick, suggesting that <b>streak</b> formation is likely to require BMP inhibition.|$|R
50|$|The streaky-headed {{seedeater}} is 13-14 cm in length. The adult has brown upperparts {{with some}} faint <b>streaking</b> and a plain brown rump. The head has a finely white-streaked crown, dark face, and white supercilium and chin. The underparts are warm buff. The sexes are similar, but some females {{show a little}} breast <b>streaking.</b> The juvenile has less head <b>streaking,</b> a dull supercilium, more heavily <b>streaked</b> upperparts, and heavy <b>streaking</b> on the pale grey underparts.|$|R
