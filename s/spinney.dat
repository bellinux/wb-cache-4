5|$|While {{repairing}} one of {{the heat}} generators, Humphreys catches an eco-terrorist named Doug <b>Spinney.</b> He tells the group that there's a deadly swarm of insects in the forest and that they must avoid darkness to stay alive. The next morning, they find an old-growth tree cut down with an unexplained band of green contained within its growth rings. <b>Spinney</b> suspects that an organism that was dormant in the tree for centuries was disturbed when the tree was illegally cut down. Humphreys hikes down to Moore's truck, but is killed by the swarm at nightfall. In the cabin, everyone else is kept safe by the light. The next morning, <b>Spinney</b> convinces Mulder to let him hike to his colleagues with gasoline so he can return with a Jeep to pick them up. Scully and Moore confront Mulder, since this will leave them with little fuel for the generator.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Tenney {{worked for the}} Equitable Life Insurance Society and continued writing for The New York Times. In 1912, he was vice-president of the Usher–Stoughton shoe manufacturing company in Lynn, Massachusetts; later, he formed the Tenney–Spinney Shoe Company in partnership with Henry <b>Spinney.</b> He was balloted for the National Baseball Hall of Fame from 1936–1942 and again in 1946, but never received more than eight votes, receiving eight (3.1% of total ballots cast) during the Baseball Hall of Fame balloting in 1938. Tenney died on July 3, 1952 at Massachusetts General Hospital after a long illness. He was interred at Harmony Chapel and Cemetery in Georgetown.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the Chinese co-production of Sesame Street, Zhima Jie, was created. An auto {{mechanic}} became the head writer of this show, broadcast in Mandarin Chinese, {{because there were}} few people with experience in writing for children in the country. It has aired in 40 local markets, comprising forty percent of all Chinese homes. Its curriculum emphasized aesthetics. The Chinese puppeteers were trained by Kevin Clash and Caroll <b>Spinney.</b> Also in 1998, a fifteen-minute version of the Israeli show was dubbed in Arabic and renamed Shara'a Simsim; this Palestinian co-production promoted children's sense of national identity.|$|E
5|$|The Jubilee Plantation, {{created to}} commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, was {{established}} in 1887. Prince Charles' <b>Spinney</b> was planted out in 1951 with trees protected from the deer by fences, to preserve a natural habitat. The bluebell glade is managed to encourage native British bluebells. Teck Plantation, established in 1905, commemorates the Duke and Duchess of Teck, who lived at White Lodge. Their daughter Mary married George V. Tercentenary Plantation, in 1937, marked the 300th anniversary of the enclosure of the park. Victory Plantation was established in 1946 to {{mark the end of}} the Second World War. Queen Mother's Copse, a small triangular enclosure on the woodland hill halfway between Robin Hood Gate and Ham Gate, was established in 1980 {{to commemorate the}} 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch <b>Spinney,</b> Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, the Second Periodical Report of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for England reduced Leicester {{from four}} seats to three, and recreated Leicester South as a borough {{constituency}} {{consisting of the}} Aylestone, Castle, De Montfort, Knighton, <b>Spinney</b> Hill and Wycliffe wards of Leicester.|$|E
25|$|Presently {{the seat}} is centred on the {{southern}} part of Leicester, and covers leafy suburbs such as Stoneygate and Knighton, inner-city areas with a strong Asian community, and deprived outer estates such as Saffron and Eyres Monsell. The constituency encompasses the council wards of <b>Spinney</b> Hills, Stoneygate, Knighton, Freemen, Aylestone, Eyres Monsell and virtually all of Castle. Another demographic feature is the presence {{of a large number of}} students studying at the University of Leicester and De Montfort University, which are both situated in the constituency.|$|E

25|$|Minor {{boundary}} {{changes were}} made {{as a result of}} the Third Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission in 1983. Ward boundaries having changed, the constituency was defined as including the Aylestone, Castle, Crown Hills, East Knighton, Eyres Monsell, Saffron, <b>Spinney</b> Hill, Stoneygate, West Knighton and Wycliffe wards. The new constituency took in about 3,000 voters who were previously in other Leicester seats. No {{changes were made}} in the Fourth Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission in 1995, and in the Fifth Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission in 2007, the constituency had only minor changes with 73 voters being added from Leicester West.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial report}} of the Boundary Commission for England dated October 1947 and {{published}} in December 1947 recommended that Leicester retain three seats, including a revised Leicester South constituency consisting of the wards of Aylestone, De Montfort, Knighton, North Braunstone and <b>Spinney</b> Hill, giving an electorate of 67,574 as of the review date of 15 October 1946. When the Representation of the People Bill enacting the Commission's recommendations was debated in the House of Commons, the Government brought forward amendments at Committee stage on 24 March 1948 to allow 17 more constituencies in England. Home Secretary James Chuter Ede announced that the Boundary Commission would be invited to consider an additional constituency to each of nine cities, including Leicester. The Government issued a White Paper proposing the new boundaries which created new borough constituencies of Leicester South East and Leicester South West in place of Leicester South. The Boundary Commission recommended no alteration to the proposals, and the revised constituencies were therefore enacted.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the Muppets' formation, Jim and Jane Henson were the group's only performers. In 1961, Jane retired to focus on raising their children. Seeking {{additional}} performers, Jim came into contact with Frank Oz that same year. Although interested, Oz declined participation due to his youth and commitment to high school, and instead suggested Jerry Juhl, a fellow puppeteer who worked alongside Oz at the Vagabond Puppet Theater in Oakland, California. Upon graduating, Oz subsequently joined in August 1963. When The Muppet Show began, the main cast of performers grew to include Henson, Oz, Dave Goelz, Jerry Nelson, Richard Hunt, and later Steve Whitmire, while Juhl became head writer for the series. From The Muppet Show onwards, Kevin Clash, Kathryn Mullen, Louise Gold, Karen Prell, Caroll <b>Spinney,</b> and Brian Henson performed several minor characters and often assisted the main performers with puppeteering. Nearly all of the aforementioned puppeteers cross-performed characters across a variety of media, including The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, and other Henson-related projects.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{aired on}} Thanksgiving Day 1983, {{a year after}} Lee's final {{appearance}} as Mr. Hooper at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. [...] The producers chose to air it {{the first week of}} the new season in order to explain Mr. Hooper's absence as soon as possible, for maximum exposure, and to ensure that parents were at home with their children in order to discuss it. [...] The illustrations used for the episode were drawn by Caroll <b>Spinney,</b> who performed Big Bird. [...] Mr. Hooper's picture remained on the set from then on, as a continuing memorial to Lee and Mr. Hooper. [...] <b>Spinney,</b> speaking of the scene in which the pictures were passed out, reported, [...] "When we finished that scene there wasn't one of us whose face wasn't streaked with tears", even <b>Spinney</b> underneath his costume. [...] Jon Stone, who directed the episode, wanted to do another take, although <b>Spinney</b> later said, [...] "There was nothing wrong with that take. [...] It was perfect". [...] Cameraman Frankie Biondo was touched by the performance.|$|E

500|$|The {{estate of}} Althorp covers {{an area of}} at least , and not only {{includes}} the house grounds but areas of woodland, cottages, farms, and surrounding hamlets. The soil in the area is of a rich, dark-coloured loam, and the estate is situated mainly on Jurassic Clay between [...] and [...] above sea level, with the highest area lying in the southeast of Althorp on Northampton Sand. Within the grounds, there are earthworks of the lost village of Althorp on which the estate was built. To the southwest {{of the house is}} High Wood, with the Dog Pond to the east of this. Bircham <b>Spinney</b> is immediately to east, to the south of the pond. Hopyard <b>Spinney</b> lies in the north-east corner of the estate bordering the A428, and Sir John's Wood marks the northwest corner. Sir John's Wood is named after John Spencer who was responsible for the planting of a number of woods on the grounds {{in the latter half of}} the 16th century. One tablet mentions he planted one of the woods in 1567-8 and Sir John's Wood in 1589, at a time when lords of manors around Britain grew increasingly anxious of their security following the Spanish Armada and planted woodlands around their properties. Between 1567 and 1901 at least seven stone date tablets were erected in the park commemorating the planting of trees. In the north and north-eastern part of Althorp is marshy ground which is natural feeding ground for herons, a prized delicacy historically at the house. They were harvested by the gamekeeper usually from early March, after being fattened up by meal and bullock's liver. In 1842 one hundred nests were recorded at the estate but this had fallen to ten by 1889. The herons were moved to a pond about two miles away in 1993 and are no longer produced for domestic consumption at Althorp. Northampton Golf Club, established in July 1893, is situated immediately to the southeast of Althorp.|$|E
500|$|Chapters 112: The {{origins and}} {{development}} of the show and the creation of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW). [...] Sesame Street was created after a dinner party hosted by Cooney and her husband in early 1966, attended by Carnegie Foundation vice-president Lloyd Morrisett and Cooney's boss at New York City educational television station WNDT, Lewis Freedman. [...] The discussion inspired them to create a children's television program, different than what was offered at the time, that could [...] "master the addictive qualities of television" [...] and help young children, especially from low-income families, learn and prepare for school. [...] Davis includes the biographies of key players in the show's development: Cooney, Morrisett, Jon Stone, Sam Gibbon, Tom Whedon, Evelyn Payne Davis, Jim Henson, Caroll <b>Spinney,</b> Gerald S. Lesser, Edward Palmer, Joe Raposo, Loretta Long, Bob McGrath, Will Lee, and Matt Robinson. [...] There is also a discussion of the history of early children's television; specifically, Captain Kangaroo and The Howdy Doody Show. [...] Davis emphasizes the coincidence that many involved with the show had first names that started with the letter J: Joan Cooney, Jon Stone, Jim Henson, Jerry Nelson, and Joe Raposo.|$|E
