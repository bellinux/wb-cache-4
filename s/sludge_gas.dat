40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Deep <b>Sludge</b> <b>Gas</b> Release Event Analytical Evaluation (DSGRE-AE) is to {{evaluate}} the postulated hypothesis that a hydrogen GRE may occur in Hanford tanks containing waste sludges at levels greater than previously experienced. There {{is a need to}} understand gas retention and release hazards in sludge beds which are 200 - 300 inches deep. These sludge beds are deeper than historical Hanford sludge waste beds, and are created when waste is retrieved from older single-shell tanks (SST) and transferred to newer double-shell tanks (DST). Retrieval of waste from SSTs reduces the risk to the environment from leakage or potential leakage of waste into the ground from these tanks. However, the possibility of an energetic event (flammable gas accident) in the retrieval receiver DST is worse than slow leakage. Lines of inquiry, therefore, are (1) can sludge waste be stored safely in deep beds; (2) can gas release events (GRE) be prevented by periodically degassing the sludge (e. g., mixer pump); or (3) does the retrieval strategy need to be altered to limit sludge bed height by retrieving into additional DSTs? The scope of this effort is to provide expert advice on whether or not to move forward with the generation of deep beds of sludge through retrieval of C-Farm tanks. Evaluation of possible mitigation methods (e. g., using mixer pumps to release gas, retrieving into an additional DST) are being evaluated by a second team and are not discussed in this report. While available data and engineering judgment indicate that increased gas retention (retained gas fraction) in DST sludge at depths resulting from the completion of SST 241 -C Tank Farm retrievals is not expected and, even if gas releases were to occur, they would be small and local, a positive USQ was declared (Occurrence Report EM-RP [...] WRPS-TANKFARM- 2012 - 0014, "Potential Exists for a Large Spontaneous Gas Release Event in Deep Settled Waste Sludge"). The purpose of this technical report is to (1) present and discuss current understandings of gas retention and release mechanisms for deep sludge in U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) complex waste storage tanks; and (2) to identify viable methods/criteria for demonstrating safety relative to deep <b>sludge</b> <b>gas</b> release events (DSGRE) in the near term to support the Hanford C-Farm retrieval mission. A secondary purpose is to identify viable methods/criteria for demonstrating safety relative to DSGREs in the longer term to support the mission to retrieve waste from the Hanford Tank Farms and deliver it to the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP).

An apparatus specially designed to keep the pressure in the chamber at the level of atmospheric pressure was employed, so that collection of gas liberated by the digesting night soil might not influence volatile matter reduction rates. Gas production during the digestion of night soil at both 37 ℃ and 30 ℃, like gas production in sewage solids digestion, is a two-stage process, consisting of the first and second stages of gasification. The course of night soil digestion, as traced by cummulative gas production, is an S-shaped curve.

The effects of sludge dosage, its treatment temperature and oxygen content on PCDD/Fs suppression were observed during test runs using a model fly ash (MFA) system, generating high chlorinated PCDD/Fs. The experiments were carried out in two parts: a first set with SDG of undefined composition, and a second with injection of NH 3 and SO 2 combined in three different concentration ratios. It was observed that the SDG evolving from dried sludge (DS) could suppress the formation of 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDD/Fs even with very high efficiency (> 99 %), both in weight units and in I-TEQ units. Such suppression was somewhat stronger for PCDD than PCDF. It was also found that 300 °C might be a suitable sludge decomposition temperature when using SDG as suppressant in PCDD/Fs inhibition. Moreover, the oxygen content only slightly influenced upon the suppression capabilities. The results revealed that SO 2 was more effective than NH 3 in suppressing PCDD/Fs formation, with suppression efficiencies of 61. 9 % and 38. 6 %, respectively. Remarkably, the formation of OCDD/Fs was inhibited least and even further formation could occur when both NH 3 and SO 2 were injected together as simulated flue gas. The results exposed that NH 3 and SO 2 might be the primary PCDD/Fs suppressants resulting from mild thermal decomposition of sludge. However, further parameters should be evaluated and adjusted before SDG could be used in large-scale applications...|$|R
40|$|An {{activated}} sludge pilot plant {{was used to}} acclimatise sludge to a low dose of H 2 S <b>gas.</b> <b>Sludge</b> samples from different types of treatment works were compared with acclimatised and unacclimatised sludges using batch absorption tests. The effects of sludge source and acclimatisation {{on the ability of}} the sludge to withstand shock loads of 50 ml l- 1 H 2 S were evaluated. Sludge that had been acclimatised to 5 ml l- 1 H 2 S in the air supply removed 70 % of a 50 ml l- 1 load in a batch reactor after three sludge ages of acclimatsation. Pre-exposure to low H 2 S concentrations enabled the bacterial community to maintain a sufficient sulphide-degrading population to retain acclimatisation and degrade subsequent high loads which are toxic to unacclimatised sludge. Acclimatisation to H 2 S is therefore mainly an effect of selection pressure on the mixed bacterial population, which suggests that the H 2 S removal capacity of different types of {{activated sludge}} will converge after acclimatisation, irrespective of their initial degradative abilitie...|$|R
40|$|AIR:EAU+LLM:CFE:LFI:JMCVolatile methyl {{siloxanes}} (VMS) {{have been}} detected in many different atmospheres such as biogas, sewage <b>sludge,</b> landfill <b>gas,</b> gasoline and ambient air. In these different atmospheres, their presence can involve several contamination problems and negative effects in industrial processes, their identification and quantification become a real challenge. Up to {{now there is no}} standardized procedure for VMS quantification, the sampling step remaining the major obstacle. Sampling gas through sorbent tube followed by analysis on TD-GC-MS is one of the reliable possibilities. It gathers sampling and preconcentration in one step and allows discrimination between all VMS, despite the difficulty to choose the appropriate adsorbent in order to avoid loss of analytes during sampling. In this context, this work deals with the comparison of different types of adsorbents based on the determination of the VMS breakthrough volume (BV). Although Tenax TA is the most widely used adsorbent, experiments show low BV values for the lightest VMS. At 25 degrees C, the BV of TMS and L 2 are, respectively, 0. 2 and 0. 44 L g(- 1) which can contribute to an underestimation in concentration during their quantification. Carbosieve SIII usually used for C 2 -C 5, did not adsorb light VMS as it was expected, and breakthrough volume obtained for VMS are more than ten times less than the values obtained for Tenax. On other hand, Chromosorb 106 and Carboxen 1000 in association with Carbotrap C and Carbotrap proved to be appropriated for VMS sampling, due to the high breakthrough volumes obtained for the lightest compounds comparing to the other adsorbents. The BVs of TMS for Carboxen 1000 and Chromosorb 106 are 1. 2 x 10 (4) and 39 L g(- 1), respectively, and 49 x 10 (4) and 1142 L g(- 1) for L 2, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceGasification {{of sewage}} <b>sludge</b> {{produces}} combustible <b>gases</b> {{as well as}} tar and a solid residue as by-products. This {{must be taken into}} account when determining the optimal thermal conditions for the gasification process. In this study, the influence of temperature, heating atmosphere and residence time on the characteristics of the gasified sewage sludge residues is investigated. ICP-AES analyses reveal that the major chemical elements in the char residues are phosphorus, calcium, iron and silicon. Heavy metals such as copper, zinc, chromium, nickel and lead are also present at relatively high levels - from 50 to more than 1000 mg/kg of dry matter. The major mineral phases' identification - before and after heating as well as their morphology and approximate chemistry (XRD and SEM-EDX) demonstrate that a number of transformations take place during gasification. These are influenced by the reactor's temperature and the oxidative degree of its internal atmosphere. The copper-, zinc- and chromium-bearing phases are studied using chemometric tools, showing that the distribution of those metals among the mineral phases is considerably different. Finally, batch-leaching tests reveal that metals retained in the residue are significantly stabilized after thermal treatment to a higher or lower extent, depending on the thermal conditions applied...|$|R
40|$|According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) guidelines, when calculating CO 2 {{emissions}}, CO 2 {{emissions from}} biomass should {{be excluded from}} {{the total amount of}} CO 2 emissions and should be separately reported due to their “carbon neutrality”. Sewage sludge is one of the representative biomass fuels. It is mixed with fossil fuels to achieve greenhouse gas reduction or is used by itself as a fuel to replace fossil fuels. According to the results of this study, biomass fractions of both the sewage sludge and the sewage <b>sludge</b> incineration exhaust <b>gases</b> did not amount to 100 %. At present, in many countries (South Korea, Japan, and Germany), when calculating greenhouse gas emissions from sewage sludge incinerators, all CO 2 emissions from sewage sludge are judged to be biomass and only the greenhouse gas emissions that correspond to non-CO 2 gases are calculated as greenhouse gas emissions. However, since, according our results, the content of sewage sludge is not 100 % biomass, if CO 2 emissions are excluded according to the existing greenhouse gas emission calculation method, the amount of emissions may be underestimated. Therefore, to accurately calculate greenhouse gas emissions from a sewage sludge incinerator, CO 2 emissions should be calculated in consideration of the fossil carbon fractions of sewage sludge...|$|R
