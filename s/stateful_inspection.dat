2500|$|Check Point was {{established}} in Ramat-Gan, Israel in 1993, by Gil Shwed (CEO [...] ), Marius Nacht (Chairman [...] ) and Shlomo Kramer (who left Check Point in 2003). Shwed had the initial idea for the company’s core technology known as <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection,</b> which became {{the foundation for the}} company's first product, FireWall-1; soon afterwards they also developed one of the world’s first VPN products, VPN-1. Shwed developed the idea while serving in the Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces, where he worked on securing classified networks.|$|E
50|$|That year, Shwed invented and {{patented}} <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection,</b> {{which served}} {{as the basis for}} the first version of the company’s renowned FireWall-1, released in 1994. <b>Stateful</b> <b>Inspection</b> is still widely used in network firewalls today.|$|E
50|$|VPN-1 is a {{stateful}} firewall {{which also}} filters traffic by inspecting the application layer. It {{was the first}} commercially available software firewall to use <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection.</b> Later (1997), Check Point registered U.S. Patent # 5,606,668 on their security technology that, among other features, included <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection.</b> VPN-1 functionality is currently bundled within all the Check Point's perimeter security products. The product, previously known as FireWall-1, is now sold as an integrated firewall and VPN solution.|$|E
50|$|Packet {{filtering}} {{alone is}} not regarded as providing enough protection. In order to effectively block peer-to-peer-related network traffic, {{what is needed is}} a firewall that does application filtering, which can be regarded as an extension to <b>stateful</b> packet <b>inspection.</b> <b>Stateful</b> packet <b>inspection</b> can determine what type of protocol is being sent over each port, but application-level filters look at what a protocol is being used for. For example, an application-level filter might {{be able to tell the}} difference between HTTP traffic used to access a Web page and HTTP traffic used for file sharing, whereas a firewall that is only performing packet filtering would treat all HTTP traffic equally.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stateful</b> packet <b>inspection</b> (SPI), also {{referred}} to as dynamic packet filtering, is a security feature often included in business networks.|$|R

50|$|NGFWs perform deeper {{inspection}} {{compared to}} <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> {{performed by the}} first- and second-generation firewalls. NGFWs use a more thorough inspection style, checking packet payloads and matching signatures for harmful activities such as exploitable attacks and malware.|$|E
50|$|NGFWs {{include the}} typical {{functions}} of traditional firewalls such as packet filtering, network- and port-address translation (NAT), <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection,</b> and {{virtual private network}} (VPN) support. The goal of next-generation firewalls is to include more layers of the OSI model, improving filtering of network traffic that {{is dependent on the}} packet contents.|$|E
50|$|Application layer {{firewalls}} {{are generally}} slower than <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection.</b> Application-layer firewalls are sometimes implemented using application proxies. Two TCP connections are established: one between the packet source and the firewall, another between the firewall and the packet destination. Application proxies intercept arriving packets {{on behalf of}} the destination, examine application payload, and then relay permitted packets to the destination. Suspicious data is dropped and the client and server never communicate directly with each other.Proxies necessarily involve more protocol stack overhead than inspecting packets at the network layer. Furthermore, because a unique proxy is required for each application, proxy firewalls can be less flexible and slower to upgrade than <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> firewalls. Nevertheless, because application-level proxies are application-aware, the proxies can more easily handle complex protocols like H.323 or SIP, which are used for videoconferencing and VoIP (Voice over IP).|$|E
50|$|NPF is {{designed}} for high performance on SMP systems and for easy extensibility.It supports various forms of Network Address Translation (NAT), <b>stateful</b> packet <b>inspection,</b> tree and hash tables for IP sets, bytecode (BPF or n-code) for custom filter rules and other features.NPF has extension framework for supporting custom modules. Features such as packet logging, traffic normalization, random blocking are provided as NPF extensions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stateful</b> packet <b>inspection</b> was {{developed}} to examine header information and the packet content to increase source and destination understanding. Instead of letting the packets through {{as a result of}} their addresses and ports, packets stayed on the network if the context was appropriate to the networks’ current ‘state’. This scheme was first used by Check Point firewalls and eventually Intrusion Prevention/Detection Systems.|$|R

These IP’s are detected by Intrusion Detection Technique (IDT).

50|$|CBAC can be {{configured}} {{to permit}} specified TCP and UDP traffic through a firewall {{only when the}} connection is initiated from within the network needing protection. (In other words, CBAC can inspect traffic for sessions that originate from the external network.) However, while this example discusses inspecting traffic for sessions that originate from the external network, CBAC can inspect traffic for sessions that originate from {{either side of the}} firewall. This is the basic function of a <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> firewall.|$|E

40|$|This paper commences by {{explaining}} some firewall definitions {{in order to}} understand basic terms for firewall techniques. Three firewall techniques, from packet filtering through to proxy services and <b>stateful</b> packet <b>inspection</b> are then discussed. Following techniques, various firewall architectures, ranging from dual-home host architecture, screened host architecture and screened subnet architecture are also covered. Finally, firewall business aspects and technological choices for hardware and software platforms are addressed...|$|R
50|$|Second-generation {{firewalls}} {{perform the}} work of their first-generation predecessors but operate up to layer 4 (transport layer) of the OSI model. This is achieved by retaining packets until enough information is available to make a judgement about its state. Known as <b>stateful</b> packet <b>inspection,</b> it records all connections passing through it and determines whether a packet {{is the start of}} a new connection, a part of an existing connection, or not part of any connection. Though static rules are still used, these rules can now contain connection state as one of their test criteria.|$|R

50|$|Palo Alto Networks {{was founded}} in 2005 by Nir Zuk, a former {{engineer}} from Check Point and NetScreen Technologies. Zuk served in the elite Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces and was the principal developer of the first <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> firewall and the first intrusion prevention system. When asked why he started Palo Alto Networks, Zuk cited his objective of solving a problem enterprises were facing with existing network security solutions: the inability to safely enable employees to use modern applications, which entailed developing a firewall that could identify and provide fine-grained control of applications.|$|E
50|$|A {{stateful}} firewall {{keeps track}} {{of the state of}} network connections (such as TCP streams or UDP communication) and is able to hold significant attributes of each connection in memory. These attributes are collectively known as the state of the connection, and may include such details as the IP addresses and ports involved in the connection and the sequence numbers of the packets traversing the connection. <b>Stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> monitors incoming and outgoing packets over time, as well as the state of the connection, and stores the data in dynamic state tables. This cumulative data is evaluated, so that filtering decisions would not only be based on administrator-defined rules, but also on context that has been built by previous connections as well as previous packets belonging to the same connection.|$|E
5000|$|The PIX runs a custom-written {{proprietary}} {{operating system}} originally called Finese (Fast Internet Service Executive), but [...] {{the software is}} known simply as PIX OS. Though classified as a network-layer firewall with <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection,</b> technically the PIX would more precisely be called a Layer 4, or Transport Layer Firewall, as its access is not restricted to Network Layer routing, but socket-based connections (a port and an IP Address: port communications occur at Layer 4). By default it allows internal connections out (outbound traffic), and only allows inbound traffic that {{is a response to}} a valid request or is allowed by an Access Control List (ACL) or by a conduit. Administrators can configure the PIX to perform many functions including network address translation (NAT) and port address translation (PAT), as well as serving as a virtual private network (VPN) endpoint appliance.|$|E
50|$|External {{networks}} must {{be carefully}} considered {{as part of the}} overall security strategy of the local network. A router may include a firewall, VPN handling, and other security functions, or these may be handled by separate devices. Many companies produced security-oriented routers, including Cisco PIX series, Cisco Meraki MX series and Juniper NetScreen. Routers also commonly perform network address translation, (which allows multiple devices on a network to share a single public IP address) and <b>stateful</b> packet <b>inspection.</b> Some experts argue that open source routers are more secure and reliable than closed source routers because open source routers allow mistakes to be quickly found and corrected.|$|R
40|$|Hardware {{assisted}} {{intrusion detection}} systems and content scanning engines {{are needed to}} process data at multigigabit line rates. These systems, when placed within {{the core of the}} Internet, are subject to millions of simultaneous flows, with each flow potentially containing data of interest. Existing IDS systems are not capable of processing millions of flows at gigabit-per-second data rates. This paper describes an architecture which is capable of performing complete, <b>stateful,</b> payload <b>inspections</b> on 8 million TCP flows at 2. 5 gigabits-per-second. To accomplish this task, a hardware circuit is used to combine a TCP protocol processing engine, a per flow state store, and a content scanning engine. ...|$|R
50|$|Deep packet {{inspection}} (DPI, {{also called}} complete packet inspection and information extraction or IX) {{is a form}} of computer network packet filtering that examines the data part (and possibly also the header) of a packet as it passes an inspection point, searching for protocol non-compliance, viruses, spam, intrusions, or defined criteria to decide whether the packet may pass or if it needs to be routed to a different destination, or, for the purpose of collecting statistical information that functions at the Application layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection model). There are multiple headers for IP packets; network equipment only needs to use the first of these (the IP header) for normal operation, but use of the second header (such as TCP or UDP) is normally considered to be shallow packet <b>inspection</b> (usually called <b>stateful</b> packet <b>inspection)</b> despite this definition.|$|R
50|$|With {{the spread}} use of {{distributed}} object-oriented systems like CORBA, client-side use of Java and weaknesses in mail readers {{and the like}} {{there is a wide}} variety of threats residing in the application and intermediate level of communication traffic. Firewall mechanisms at the perimeter can come useful by inspecting incoming e-mails for known malicious code fingerprints, but can be confronted with complex, thus resource-consuming situations when making decisions on other code, like Java.Using the framework of a distributed firewall and especially considering a policy language which allows for policy decision on the application level can circumvent some of these problems, under the condition that contents of such communication packets can be interpreted semantically by the policy verifying mechanisms. <b>Stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> of packets shows up to be easily adapted to these requirements and allows for finer granularity in decision making. Furthermore, malicious code contents may be completely disguised to the screening unit at the network perimeter, given the use of virtual private networks and enciphered communication traffic in general and can completely disable such policy enforcement on conventional firewalls.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} areas of a network intrusion detection system (NIDS), <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection,</b> is described in this paper. We present a novel reconfigurable hardware architecture implementing TCP <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> used in NIDS. This is to achieve a more efficient and faster network intrusion detection system as todays ’ NIDSs show inefficiency and even fail to perform while encountering the faster Internet. The performance of the NIDS described is expected to obtain a throughput of 3. 0 Gbps. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Stateful</b> <b>Inspection</b> {{is a key}} {{technology}} to network devices such as routers and firewalls. Existing session table architectures of <b>Stateful</b> <b>Inspection</b> devices store all session information in a single entry, which causes high time cost of session table timeout processing. In this paper we present a new architecture which divides a session entry into two parts, and designs different data structures for each other. The new architecture can improve the performance of session table greatly. A new PATRICIA algorithm is proposed to organize session table, which is {{proved to be an}} optimal 2 -ary trie for fixed-length match.

In this work, we pursue a novel architectural approach, named SANS, which takes both the advantage of new generation network processors for packet-header-based processing and the advantage of commodity x 86 platforms for packet payload data processing. A session table scheme is designed for the stateful frontend in SANS to achieve wire speed inline processing...|$|R
40|$|Application-layer tunnels {{nowadays}} {{represent a}} significant security threat for any network protected by firewalls and Application Layer Gateways. The encapsulation of protocols sub- ject to security policies such as peer-to-peer, e-mail, chat and others into protocols that are deemed as safe or necessary, such as HTTP, SSH or even DNS, can bypass any network- boundary security policy, even those based on <b>stateful</b> packet <b>inspection.</b> In this {{paper we propose}} a statistical classification mechanism that could represent an important step towards new techniques for securing network boundaries. The mechanism, called Tunnel Hunter, relies on the statistical characterization at the IP-layer of the traffic that is allowed by a given security policy, such as HTTP or SSH. The statistical profiles of the allowed usages of those protocols can then be dynamically checked against traffic flows crossing the network boundaries, identifying with great accuracy when a flow is being used to tunnel another protocol. Results from experiments conducted on a live network suggest that the technique can be very effective, even when the application-layer protocol used as a tunnel is encrypted, such {{as in the case of}} SSH...|$|R
40|$|Conventional Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) have heavyweight {{processing}} and memory requirements as they maintain per flow state using data structures like linked lists or trees. This {{is required for}} some specialized jobs such as <b>Stateful</b> Packet <b>Inspection</b> (SPI) where the network communications between entities are recreated in its entirety to inspect application level data. The downside to {{this approach is that}} the NIDS must {{be in a position to}} view all inbound and outbound traffic of the protected network. The NIDS can be overwhelmed by a DDoS attack since most of these try and exhaust the available state of network entities. For some applications like port scan detection, we do not require to reconstruct the complete network trac. We propose to integrate a detector into all routers so that a more distributed detection approach can be achieved. Since routers are devices with limited memory and processing capabilities, conventional NIDS approaches do not work while integrating a detector in them. We describe a method to detect port scans using aggregation. A data structure called a Partial Completion Filter(PCF) or a counting Bloom filter is used to reduce the per flow state...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} firewall technologies {{which an}} organisation {{can use to}} protect its network resources and corporate information from unauthorised access. There are three major firewall technologies in use. These include packet filtering, <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection,</b> and application layer. The Multi-Layer Firewall (MLF) technology has characteristics of a packet filter. The {{only difference is that}} the MLF uses filtering functionality at layer 2 and layer 3 of the ISO Model. Packet filters on the other hand implement the security policy at layer 3. The <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> technology allows firewalls to keep state of each connection that is established with an external network. This state is kept in dynamic state tables for evaluating subsequent connection attempts.

40|$|Abstract: To provide network {{services}} consistently under various network failures, enterprise networks increasingly utilize path di-versity through multi-homing. As a result, multi-homed non-transit autonomous systems become to surpass single-homed networks in number. In this paper, we address an inevitable problem that oc-curs when networks with multiple entry points deploy firewalls in their borders. The majority of today’s firewalls use <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> that ex-ploits connection state for fine-grained control. However, <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> has a topological restriction such that outgoing and in-coming traffic of a connection should {{pass through a}} single fire-wall to execute desired packet filtering operation. Multi-homed net-working environments suffer from this restriction and BGP poli-cies provide only coarse control over communication paths. Due to these features and the characteristics of datagram routing, there exists a real possibility of asymmetric routing. This mismatch be-tween the exit and entry firewalls for a connection causes connec-tion establishment failures. In this paper, we formulate this phenomenon into a state-sharing problem among multiple firewalls under asymmetric routing con-dition. To solve this problem, we propose a <b>stateful</b> <b>inspection</b> pro-tocol that requires very low processing and messaging overhead. Our protocol consists of the following two phases: 1) Generation of a TCP SYN cookie marked with the firewall identification num-ber upon a SYN packet arrival, and 2) state sharing triggered by a SYN/ACK packet arrival {{in the absence of}} the trail of its initial SYN packet. We demonstrate that our protocol is scalable, robust, and simple enough to be deployed for high speed networks. It also transparently works under any client-server configurations. Last but not least, we present experimental results through a prototype implementation.

40|$|Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) {{have been}} {{increasingly}} used in organizations, {{in addition to}} other security mechanisms, to detect intrusions to systems and networks. In the recent years several IDSs have been released, but (a) the high number of false alarms generated, (b) the lack of a high-level notation for attack signature specification, and (c) the difficulty to integrate IDSs with existing network management infrastructure hinder their wide-spread and efficient use. In this paper we address these problems by presenting an SNMP agent for <b>stateful</b> intrusion <b>inspection.</b> By using a state machine-based language called PTSL (Protocol Trace Specification Language), the network manager can describe attack signatures that should be monitored. The signatures to be used by the agent are configured by the network manager through the IETF Script MIB. Once programmed, the agent starts monitoring the occurrence of the signatures on the network traffic and stores statistics, according to their occurrence, in an extended RMON 2 MIB. These statistics may be retrieved from any SNMP-based management application and can be used to accomplish signature-based analysis. The paper also describes two experiments that have been carried out with the agent to assess its performance and to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of false alarm generation rates...|$|R

A <b>stateful</b> TCP flow <b>inspection</b> engine is implemented based on IXP Network Processor, which can monitor about 512 K flows. The performance issues about IXP Network Processors are evaluated and collected, and an analysis is made for further optimizing the system performance.

40|$|IPv 6 over Low power WPAN (6 loWPAN) is an {{adaption}} layer introduced {{between the}} link layer {{and the network}} layer in the TCP/IP protocol stack to t the IPv 6 datagrams over the IEEE 802. 15. 4 link layer. 6 loWPAN networks comprise of internet enabled resource-constrained smart objects which are interconnected with {{each other through the}} Internet Protocol (IPv 6). In Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices of the 6 loWPAN networks are connected to the unsecured public Internet. RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) is the standardized routing protocol dened for routing IP datagrams over the lossy links in LLN (Low-Power and Lossy Networks). In IoT, all devices have a global identity and could be accessed from anywhere in the globe. Hence, security {{is an important factor in}} protecting the devices and their informational resources from adversaries. Security solutions must be highly e ective for smart objects considering their limited resources. Despite the state of the art crypto solutions providing information security, IPv 6 enabled smart objects are vulnerable to attacks from outside and inside the 6 LoWPAN networks. This thesis attempts to identify the intrusions aimed to disrupt 6 LoWPAN networks and to prevent external adversaries taking advantage of the resource constrained 6 LoWPAN environment. We review state of the art security attacks in conventional WSNs and the RPL-based LLNs. In order to improve the security within 6 LoWPAN networks, we extend SVELTE (an IDS for the IoT) by adding ETX (Expected Transmissions) parameter in the 6 Mapper. In RPL, ETX is a link reliability metric which indicates the number of successful IP datagram transmissions with respect to the Border Router. Monitoring the ETX value could prevent the Border Router and neighboring nodes to engage actively with the malicious intruder. We propose a geographic routing algorithm to identify the malicious node conducting attacks against ETX-based solutions. We also implement a lightweight rewall at the Border Router to prevent 6 LoWPAN networks from external attackers. In this rewall we conduct a <b>stateful</b> deep packet <b>inspection</b> on the protocols adhering to the protocol stack for the 6 LoWPAN networks. Our evaluation shows that the IDS module with ETX metric consumes negligible energy and very less CPU processing power.
