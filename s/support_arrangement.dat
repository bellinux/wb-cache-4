25|$|Sperm {{storage is}} a method by which females can control the sperm that fertilizes their eggs. Female {{salamanders}} and newts, most notably Triturus vulgaris, possess sperm-storage glands called spermathecae in the walls of their cloacae. Sperm storage has evolved independently to control reproduction {{in response to the}} environment. Females have the ability to store multiple spermatophores until they are needed for fertilization. Sperm storage leads to the post-copulatory sexual selection process of cryptic female choice, which occurs when a female removes the deposited sperm or favors one set of spermatophore over another, during or after copulation. Spermatophores are composed of a cap containing the spermatozoa and a gelatinous <b>support</b> <b>arrangement</b> which fastens the spermatophore to a substrate. Spermatophores are very central to reproductive success; therefore, they are handled carefully. Mating success has a direct correlation to favorable phenotypic traits such as tail loss, adult body size, and age.|$|E

50|$|The {{effects of}} the attack also had {{political}} implications; in the United Kingdom, {{the impact on the}} National Health Service quickly became political, with claims that the effects were exacerbated by Government underfunding of the NHS; in particular, the NHS ceased its paid Custom <b>Support</b> <b>arrangement</b> to continue receiving support for unsupported Microsoft software used within the organization, including Windows XP. Home Secretary Amber Rudd refused to say whether patient data had been backed up, and Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth accused Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt of refusing to act on a critical note from Microsoft, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the National Crime Agency that had been received two months previously. Others argued that hardware and software vendors often fail to account for future security flaws, selling systems that − due to their technical design and market incentives − eventually won't be able to properly receive and apply patches. The NHS denied that it was still using XP, claiming only 4.7% of devices within the organization ran Windows XP.|$|E

The magnitudes of the strains at the location of the saddle horn are significantly reduced.

40|$|All organisations need {{facilities}} {{and services to}} support and sustain their operations and strategy. Different <b>support</b> <b>arrangements</b> are required in different sectors, at different stages in organisational development and in different countries and cultures. In time, <b>support</b> <b>arrangements</b> need to be modified as circumstances change. Although this issue is of fundamental importance for organisations of all kinds, {{it has not been}} adequately researched in any detail. This thesis focuses on the generic issues associated with the selection of appropriate facility management <b>arrangement</b> to <b>support</b> the specific needs of an organisation, with particular reference to the context of developments in Thailand. The thesis has four main parts. The first part identifies the key factors that reed to be considered when positioning and structuring facility management arrangements. This part of the Thesis describes the results from a comprehensive literature review and an investigation to establish the conceptual basis for the research. The second part describes specific case studies of the FM positioning process that were undertaken in five organisations with operations in Thailand, supported by document searches, semi-structured interviews and by direct observations. By undertaking cross-case comparisons, the changing patterns of relationship between organisational characteristics and their FM <b>support</b> <b>arrangements</b> were analysed and the main areas of decision within the FM positioning and repositioning process were identified. The results from these case studies inform the third part of the thesis which profiles the key areas of concern in detail and develops a seven part decision framework, with associated tools, to assist in a systematic process of data collection, option identification, evaluation, prioritisation, selection and implementation of FM <b>support</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The fourth and final part of the Thesis reports on field trials of the proposed positioning process. The trial included a critical examination of the practical applicability, potential use and value of the approach by a sample of independent experts, with their suggestions for the modification and improvement of the prototype decision framework and its tools. The thesis concludes with a detailed analysis of the field trial results, a revised and refined decision framework for Positioning FK followed by a discussion of future opportunities for the approach and the potential benefits of further research.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{an instrument for}} measuring the range of angular displacement associated with two human body portions connected to a common joint. The instrument includes two pivotally connected, elongate rods, and separate supports for supporting each of the rods on a respective one of the body portions in spaced relationship with the body portion. Each of the supports includes a pair of ball and socket assemblies which are mounted on the respective body portions in spaced relation to one another. The ball of each ball and socket assembly has an aperture formed therethrough for receiving the associated elongate rod. Such a <b>support</b> <b>arrangement</b> enables the body portions to be rotated about the common joint without affecting the natural movements of the body portions.

40|$|Abstract: One of the {{measures}} taken by the Flemish region in Belgium to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and to stimulate the market penetration of renewable energy was {{the introduction of a}} <b>support</b> <b>arrangement</b> for photovoltaic solar installations on building. This paper describes the analysis of the measuring results of the real-life monitoring of 13 financed photovoltaic solar installations in the Flemish Region in Belgium. All systems are grid-connected with installed powers between 0, 85 kWp and 5, 7 kWp, angles of inclination between 14 ° and 45 ° and orientations between 142 ° and 235 °. The following parameters were measured during 6 to 12 months: PV-electricity production, electric energy from the grid and from the PV-panels effectively used in the building, solar radiation in the plane of the panels and the part of the PV-energy that goes back into the grid. In addition, for 7 installations, both the DC and AC-power generated by the panels was measured in order to evaluate the efficiency of the modules and the inverters separately. Several conclusions were made regarding system efficiency, performance ratio, impact of orientation and angle of inclination, inverter problems, shadow effects and dimensioning problems.

40|$|Measurement of {{aerodynamic}} {{forces on}} a model craft exposed to hypervelocity flow in a shock tunnel must be performed {{during the period}} of steady flow which may be less than a millisecond. Measurement of drag has previously been achieved in this time frame at The University of Queensland, by deconvolution of strain signals measured in a sting attached to the model craft. This procedure has been extended to include measurement of lift and pitching moment. Finite element modelling has {{played a major role in}} the design of the device used to achieve this. Limitations of finite element predictions of strain signals are discussed, as is the applicability of two- and three-dimensional models in the design process. Finite element modelling has enabled questions to be answered that cannot easily be investigated experimentally: in particular, establishing what strain signals can be successfully processed to recover the input loading and what physical configurations produce acceptable strain signals. As well, the sensitivity of the procedure to the time history of loading, the distribution of loading and the flexibility of the model is studied. The chosen configuration for lift measurement involves mounting the craft to the sting by means of symmetrical triangulated bars, in which the axial strains are measured. Experimental tests on this <b>support</b> <b>arrangement</b> are compared to the finite element simulations...|$|E
