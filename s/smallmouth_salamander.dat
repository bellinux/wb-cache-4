40|$|Introduced {{species have}} {{become one of}} the most {{important}} anthropogenic impacts in aquatic ecosystems and are implicated in the declines of many native amphibian populations. Despite the effects of introduced fish species on amphibian communities, there is little information concerning the responses of amphibians following the removal of introduced predatory fish. We present results of a 4 -y field experiment designed to determine the amphibian community- and population-level responses to the removal of introduced predatory fish from two experimental ponds. We observed an increase in amphibian species diversity in experimental ponds following the removal of fish. We also observed temporal changes in <b>smallmouth</b> <b>salamander</b> (Amhystoma texanum) population dynamics. Although A. texanum size at metamorphosis was unaffected by introduced fish in experimental ponds, fish removal resulted in prolonged A. texanum larval period and improved reproductive success. We attribute these responses to increases in A. texanum larval densities, as we caught considerably more metamorphosed A. texanum juveniles from experimental ponds following the removal of fish. Collectively, these observations support previous studies indicating that introductions of predatory fish have adverse effects on amphibians at both the community and population levels. Furthermore, our results suggest that amphibian communities are capable of recovering from environmental perturbations...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that amphibian populations declining across the globe. Habitat loss {{is the primary}} cause of decline. The salamander family Ambystomatidae has experienced significantly more rapid decline than the average for amphibians. Coefficients of Conservatism (CoC) have been developed for amphibians in Ohio. These are based primarily on habitat requirements with high CoCs for amphibians with stringent habitat requirements (e. g. vernal pools associated with large, intact, undisturbed forest), and low CoCs for amphibians with less stringent habitat requirements. Genetic diversity in five species and one hybrid complex of ambystomatid salamander in southwest Ohio were examined and compared to their respective CoC. Less gene flow across inhospitable habitat and consequently lower genetic diversity in that species would be expected compared with a species with less restrictive habitat requirements, i. e. a lower CoC. Microsatellites were used to determine conformation to Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium expectations, allelic and genotypic differences between populations, and inbreeding coefficients Fis and Fst. Genetic differences between woodlots and between ponds within a woodlot were examined. It was found that, for different species in the same habitat, species with higher CoCs have lower genetic diversity than species with lower CoCs. It was also found that habitat quality influences genetic diversity in all species. In some habitats, the genetic diversity of all species in that habitat will be lower than that of the same species in a more suitable habitat. In some cases presence of the hybrid complex (kleptogens) appears to have negatively impacted species that act as a sperm donor to the hybrid complex. In some species (e. g. <b>smallmouth</b> <b>salamanders)</b> genetic structure can be seen in different ponds within a woodlot. In other species (e. g. tiger salamanders) no such structure appears. It was also found that a railroad track acts as a barrier to marbled salamanders creating two genetically distinct populations. It was found that maternal ancestor of the kleptogens, A. barbouri, also acts as a sperm donor but does not replace the A. laterale genome in the nucleus. In addition to species specific differences in genetic diversity, habitat quality, and presence of kleptogens also influence genetic diversity in ambystomatid salamanders...|$|R
