I'm afraid, however, we shan't induce you to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> long, <b>so</b> it's as well {{perhaps to}} settle our {{business}} at once. You would, however, greatly oblige your mother, and I'm sure I need not add, myself, {{if you could}} make your arrangements <b>so</b> as to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> till after Easter.

He's only a doctor, so I hope they won't think him worth exchanging. My uncle captured him {{last year in the}} FERDINAND privateer, off Belle Isle, and he cured my uncle of a r-r-raging toothache. Of course, after that we couldn't let him lie among the common French prisoners at Rye, and <b>so</b> he <b>stays</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> He's of very old family--a Breton, which is nearly next door to being a true Briton, my father says--and he wears his hair clubbed--not powdered. Much more becoming, don't you think?' ...|$|R

40|$|The Field Methods {{course is}} in fact a group work in which not only the class {{students}} and the teachers are involved, rather they get many other people involved in the work. So, I would say that though I have put my personal efforts in preparing this tome, the credit should go to all those involved in the work, those who helped us directly and indirectly. Our teacher Dr. Anvita Abbi should be thanked especially and profusely for making our field trip to Shillong <b>so</b> pleasant and <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> throughout the week we stayed there. We both enjoyed and partied and picnicked and walked through the clouds as if in a heaven or in a fairyland as our work went smoothly under her guidance. Special thanks to Dr. Awadhesh Mishra for taking all the pains to make us feel at home in Shillong. Frankie should be thanked first for promising that he would be available to give us the preliminary data to get us started. Without him we woul...|$|R
6000|$|Saturday, August 6. Called at the {{counting}} house of M. Tauchnitz, the celebrated publisher. An hour after, accompanied by Mrs. T., {{he came with}} two open carriages, and took {{us to see the}} city and environs. We visited the battle ground, and saw the spot where Napoleon stood during the engagement; a slight elevation, commanding an immense plain in every direction, with the spires of the city rising in the distance. After seeing various sights of interest, we returned to our hotel, where our kind friends took their leave. In the afternoon M. Tauchnitz sent H. a package of his entertaining English publications, to read in the cars, also a Murray for Germany. H. and I then took the cars for Halle, where we hoped to spend the Sabbath and meet with Dr. Tholuck. Travellers sometimes visit Chamouni without seeing Mont Blanc, who remains enveloped in clouds during their <b>stay.</b> <b>So</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> In an hour we were in rooms at the Kron Prince. We sent a note to the professor; the waiter returned, saying that Dr. Tholuck was at Kissengen. Our theological Mont Blanc was hid in mist. Blank enough looked we! ...|$|R
