5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone {{is a large}} <b>scale</b> {{air mass}} that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest <b>scale</b> (the synoptic <b>scale).</b> Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic <b>scale.</b>|$|E
50|$|The PAI has 22 {{non-overlapping}} <b>scales</b> of four varieties: 1) validity <b>scales,</b> 2) clinical <b>scales,</b> 3) treatment consideration <b>scales,</b> and 4) interpersonal <b>scales.</b>|$|R
50|$|The MCMI-IV {{contains}} {{a total of}} 30 <b>scales</b> broken down into 25 clinical <b>scales</b> and 5 validity <b>scales.</b> The 25 clinical <b>scales</b> are divided into 15 personality and 10 clinical syndrome <b>scales</b> (the clinical syndrome <b>scales</b> are further divided into 7 Clinical Syndromes and 3 Severe Clinical Syndromes). The personality <b>scales</b> are further divided into 12 Clinical Personality Patterns and 3 Severe Personality Pathology <b>scales.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to Leviton (1964), the scalation {{includes}} 21 rows of dorsal <b>scales</b> at midbody, 170-178/175-184 ventral <b>scales</b> in males/females, 62-71/58-63 subcaudal <b>scales</b> in males/females, and 9-11 supralabial <b>scales</b> {{of which}} the 3rd is the largest. Toriba and Sawai (1990) give 167-179/172-184 ventral <b>scales</b> in males/females, 56-70/53-63 subcaudal <b>scales</b> in males/females, and 9-10/9-12 supralabial <b>scales</b> in males/females.|$|R
5|$|PD {{invariably}} progresses with time. A severity rating method {{known as}} the Unified Parkinson's disease rating <b>scale</b> (UPDRS) is {{the most commonly used}} metric for clinical study. A modified version {{known as the}} MDS-UPDRS is also sometimes used. An older scaling method known as the Hoehn and Yahr <b>scale</b> (originally published in 1967), and a similar <b>scale</b> known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr <b>scale,</b> have also been commonly used. The Hoehn and Yahr <b>scale</b> defines five basic stages of progression.|$|E
5|$|The Enhanced Fujita <b>Scale</b> (EF <b>Scale)</b> {{rates the}} {{strength}} of tornadoes in the United States based on the damage they cause. Below is the <b>scale.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fujita <b>scale</b> and the Enhanced Fujita <b>Scale</b> rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) <b>Scale</b> was {{an update}} {{to the older}} Fujita <b>scale,</b> by expert elicitation, using {{engineered}} wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF <b>Scale</b> was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita <b>scale</b> would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO <b>scale</b> ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.|$|E

5|$|The initial <b>scale</b> was {{developed}} by Saffir, a structural engineer, who in 1969 went on commission for the United Nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas. While performing the study, Saffir realized there was no simple <b>scale</b> for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring {{the utility of the}} Richter magnitude <b>scale</b> in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1–5 <b>scale</b> based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the <b>scale</b> to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E
5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each <b>scale</b> contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each <b>scale,</b> to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the <b>scale.</b>|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature <b>scale</b> space. They observe that this <b>scale</b> space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a <b>scale</b> space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature <b>scale</b> space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{measured}} and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived bitterness {{is measured}} by the International Bitterness Units <b>scale</b> (IBU), defined in co-operation between the American Society of Brewing Chemists and the European Brewery Convention. The international <b>scale</b> was a development of the European Bitterness Units <b>scale,</b> often abbreviated as EBU, and the bitterness values should be identical.|$|E

50|$|Both cycloid and ctenoid <b>scales</b> are overlapping, {{making them}} more {{flexible}} than cosmoid and ganoid <b>scales.</b> Unlike ganoid <b>scales,</b> they grow in size through additions to the margin. The <b>scales</b> of some species exhibit bands of uneven seasonal growth called annuli (singular annulus). These bands {{can be used to}} age the fish. Most ray-finned fishes have ctenoid <b>scales.</b> Some species of flatfishes have ctenoid <b>scales</b> on the eyed side and cycloid <b>scales</b> on the blind side, while other species have ctenoid <b>scales</b> in males and cycloid <b>scales</b> in females.|$|R

5|$|Currently, {{solid-phase}} oligonucleotide synthesis {{is carried}} out automatically using computer-controlled instruments (oligonucleotide synthesizers) and is technically implemented in column, multi-well plate, and array formats.

With very few exceptions, the British usage and American usage are now identical.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the national meteorological services of each nation, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the United States Government.
