50|$|Automated {{systems are}} {{becoming}} more prominent. They have the potential advantages of relatively high precision, speed and ease of control, but tend to be significantly more expensive than manual systems. Hoists of various types (e.g., line <b>shaft,</b> <b>chain</b> motor, etc.) are used. A conventional counterweight system may be automated by the incorporation of a motor and controls, in what is commonly called a motor-assist system. By using counterweight in such a manner, motor sizes can be kept relatively small.|$|E
50|$|The {{input of}} the clutch is {{connected}} to the engine crankshaft while the output may drive a <b>shaft,</b> <b>chain,</b> or belt. As engine revolutions per minute increase, weighted arms in the clutch swing outward and force the clutch to engage. The most common types have friction pads or shoes radially mounted that engage the inside of the rim of a housing. On the center shaft there are an assorted number of extension springs, which connect to a clutch shoe. When the central shaft spins fast enough, the springs extend causing the clutch shoes to engage the friction face. It can be compared to a drum brake in reverse. This type can be found on most home built karts, lawn and garden equipment, fuel-powered model cars and low power chainsaws. Another type used in racing karts has friction and clutch disks stacked together like a motorcycle clutch. The weighted arms force these disks together and engage the clutch.|$|E

The pilot sits recumbent in a streamlined nacelle with an open side to provide cooling. The drive mechanism is a combination of pedals, a gearbox, drive <b>shafts</b> and <b>chains,</b> powering a 2.95 meter two-bladed propeller mounted concentrically with the boom.|$|R
50|$|Crusader III {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of the Mk. IV Liberty engine, fixing many of the reliability issues previously encountered. This featured the Mk. III engine's later updated water pumps along with a <b>shaft</b> drive replacing <b>chain</b> drive for the cooling fans.|$|R
50|$|Shaft drives {{operate at}} a very {{consistent}} rate of efficiency and performance, without adjustments or maintenance, though {{lower than that of}} a properly adjusted and lubricated <b>chain.</b> <b>Shaft</b> drives are typically more complex to disassemble when repairing flat rear tires, and the manufacturing cost is typically higher.|$|R
25|$|Factors {{which have}} been shown to affect the {{drive-train}} efficiency include the type of transmission system (<b>chain,</b> <b>shaft,</b> belt), the type of gearing system (fixed, derailleur, hub, infinitely variable), the size of the sprockets used, the magnitude of the input power, the pedalling speed, and how rusty the chain is. For a particular gearing system, different gear ratios generally have different efficiencies.|$|R
5000|$|Keiler {{is built}} on the M48 Patton medium tank hull. Developers removed the turret of the Patton and fitted the vehicle with a {{heavy-duty}} rotor-powered mine flail, a rapidly rotating cylinder mounted between two {{arms in front of}} the vehicle consisting of two <b>shafts</b> with 24 <b>chains</b> terminating in large metal [...] "feet". In traveling mode the mine flail folds over the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|From 1873 to 1883 Amédée Bollée of Le Mans built {{a series}} of steam-powered {{passenger}} vehicles able to carry 6 to 12 people at speeds up to 60 km/h (38 mph), with such names as Rapide and L'Obeissante. In his vehicles the boiler was mounted behind the passenger compartment with the engine {{at the front of}} the vehicle, driving the differential through a <b>shaft</b> with <b>chain</b> drive to the rear wheels. The driver sat behind the engine and steered by means of a wheel mounted on a vertical shaft. The lay-out more closely resembled much later motor cars than other steam vehicles. L'Obeissante, moreover, in 1873 had independent suspension on all four corners.|$|R
50|$|Excepting {{the case}} of {{vehicles}} with beam axles and vehicles having no suspension, in practice it is normal for inboard brakes to be mounted rigidly {{with respect to the}} body of the vehicle, often to the differential casing. This is done to move the weight of the braking mechanism from being carried by the wheels directly (unsprung weight), to being carried indirectly by the wheels via the suspension (sprung mass). This then necessitates a means of transferring braking torque from the brake mechanism to the wheel, which is capable of operating despite the relative movement between body and wheel. Driven wheels already have <b>shafting</b> (or <b>chains</b> in older vehicles) which serve this purpose so there is no penalty for them, but undriven wheels require a similar mechanism which is then called a brake shaft.|$|R
50|$|Prof. J. Ignacio Martínez-Artajo (1907-1984) from Universidad Pontificia Comillas (Madrid, Spain) made {{sketches}} of an adaptative rotary compressor {{in the mid}} seventies, {{which led to the}} construction of a railway model missing of proper rotor dynamic solutions. Lately, new researches were carried out by four researchers led by Dr. Gilles Saint-Hilaire, a thermonuclear physicist, consisting of members of his immediate family. The original objective was to make a turbo-shaft turbine engine where the compressor portion and the power portion would be in the same plane. In order to achieve this, they had to disconnect the blades from the main <b>shaft,</b> and <b>chain</b> them around {{in such a way that}} a single rotor acts as a compressor for a quarter turn, and as an engine the following quarter of a turn.|$|R
5000|$|Allard {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to a twin-engined Steyr four-wheel-drive prototype, of great complexity. [...] "All this leads to 9 litres of motor car and a very brave Sydney Allard surrounded by <b>chains,</b> <b>shafts</b> and engines." [...] The car featured a solidly-mounted rear axle to which he planned to mount American-type dragster slick tyres. This was an early indication of the influence of American drag racing on his designs. The car was never successfully run and soon abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda VF750F was {{a street}} bike {{designed}} by Honda from 1983-1985. It had an , liquid-cooled, V4 engine which sported dual overhead cams (DOHC). The V4's were started {{a year before}} with the 1982 Honda Magna VF750C and Sabre VF750S [...] but were adapted for the VF750F in 1983 by reducing the six speed transmission to a five speed because of the change from <b>shaft</b> drive to <b>chain.</b> This reduced the available space in the transmission thus changing to a five speed.|$|R
50|$|Miners at the pit would {{grab hold}} of a chain running {{the depth of the}} mine shaft and be hoisted 150 ft to the surface. On this day, eight miners clung to the chain. When 50 ft {{from the base of the}} lower part of the chain snapped, causing the miners to fall to the base of the <b>shaft,</b> before the <b>chain,</b> {{estimated}} to weigh 1 tonne, landed on top of them. All of them were killed instantly, except one, who died shortly after being brought to the surface.|$|R
50|$|At {{first he}} {{inclined}} to use gears. Then he discussed {{the problem with}} engineer Beauchamp Tower before the British Association meeting in 1872, and Tower suggested {{the use of a}} device that (as he remembered) was once used by Wheatstone. It was a chain running alternately over and under a sequence of pulleys on movable <b>shafts.</b> The <b>chain</b> was fixed at one end, and the other (free) end was weighted to keep it taut. As each shaft moved up or down it would take up or release a corresponding length of the chain. The movements in position of the free (movable) end of the chain represented the sum of the movements of the different shafts. The movable end was kept taut, and fitted with a pen and a moving band of paper on which the pen plotted a tidal curve. In some designs, the movable end of the line was connected instead to a dial and scale from which tidal heights could be read off.|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to turbochargers, superchargers are mechanically {{driven by the}} engine. Belts, <b>chains,</b> <b>shafts,</b> and gears are common methods of powering a supercharger, placing a mechanical load on the engine. For example, on the single-stage single-speed supercharged Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, the supercharger uses about [...] Yet the benefits outweigh the costs; for the [...] to drive the supercharger the engine generates an additional 400-horsepower, {{a net gain of}} [...] This is where the principal disadvantage of a supercharger becomes apparent; the engine must withstand the net power output of the engine plus the power to drive the supercharger.|$|R
5000|$|The first steam {{tractors}} {{that were}} designed specifically for agricultural uses were portable engines built on skids or on wheels and transported to the work area using horses. Later models used {{the power of the}} steam engine itself to power a drive train to move the machine and were first known as [...] "traction drive" [...] engines which eventually was shortened to [...] "tractor". These drive mechanisms were one of three types: <b>chain,</b> <b>shaft,</b> and open pinion. The open pinion became the most popular design due to its strength. Later improvements included power steering, differentials, compounded engines, and butt-strap boiler design.|$|R
50|$|As far as {{growth is}} {{concerned}} the material handling and conveyor system makers are getting utmost exposure in the industries like automotive, pharmaceutical, packaging and different production plants. The portable conveyors are likewise growing {{fast in the}} construction sector and by the year 2014 the purchase rate for conveyor systems in North America, Europe and Asia is likely to grow even further. The most commonly purchased types of conveyors are Line <b>shaft</b> roller conveyor, <b>chain</b> conveyors and conveyor belts at packaging factories and industrial plants where usually product finishing and monitoring are carried. Commercial and civil sectors are increasingly implementing conveyors at airports, shopping malls, etc.|$|R
50|$|Several {{competition}} {{versions of}} the 425 were built. In 1953 a racing version of the plunger-framed model was produced as the AWO 425 R. It was not offered for sale {{to the public and}} only 15 examples were built. Power output from the race-tuned version of the pushrod overhead valve engine was 24 bhp. A version with chain-driven double overhead camshafts appeared in 1955 and produced about 28 bhp. By 1958 Simson's racing team found it necessary to switch from <b>shaft</b> drive to <b>chain</b> drive, which meant that it had to develop a new engine as well. For the 1958 season the Simson single had a telescopic front fork and swingarm rear suspension.|$|R
50|$|Many people {{argue that}} Édouard Delamare-Deboutteville and his assistant, Leon Malandin had invented the first automobile.

The car had a front bench seat and a rear platform, four wheels, a transmission to the rear wheels by <b>chain,</b> <b>shaft</b> transmission and a differential. In 1883 Edouard Delamare-Deboutteville run his car whose engine was powered by gas, but the gas supply hose broke during this first trial, so he replaced the gas with fuel oil. In order to use this product, he invented a wick carburetor. This vehicle travelled {{for the first time}} on the little road from Fontaine-le Bourg to Cailly, Normandy in early February 1884. On 12 February 1884, he registered his design under patent number 160267.|$|R
50|$|The clutch and {{flywheel}} {{are mounted}} {{on the back of}} the engine block This part of the clutch is of aluminium and carries a friction surface of leather To make for a more gradual engagement a steel spring is set between the leather and the metal face. It is formed into a ring with projecting tongues which ac t as springs. The large spiral spring to hold the clutch in engagement is stationary. It acts on the fork imparting a sliding motion to the propellor shaft. A ball bearing takes the thrust between fork and the shaft. A long propellor shaft runs from the clutch to the gearbox's first motion shaft. This propellor shaft carries a flexible coupling and is splined to allow longitudinal movement together with the clutch. The gearbox is mounted between the back axle and the sprocket <b>shaft</b> for the <b>chain</b> drive.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} unusual in being an {{opposed piston engine}} where each {{horizontal}} cylinder contains two pistons, one at each end, that move in opposition to each other. Even more unusually, both sets of pistons drove only a single crankshaft; most opposed piston engines have a separate crankshaft {{at each end of}} the cylinder. The TS3 engine used a single crankshaft beneath the cylinders, each piston driving it through a connecting rod, a rocker lever and a second connecting rod. The crankshaft had six crankpins and there were six rockers. The engine was a two-stroke, compression-ignition diesel engine with uniflow-ported cylinders. Scavenging was performed by a Roots blower. which was mounted on the front of the engine and driven by a long quill <b>shaft</b> from a <b>chain</b> drive at the rear of the engine. Although the engines gained a reputation for good performance, this quill shaft was somewhat prone to breaking if over-worked.|$|R
50|$|Their tunnel {{began at}} the top of a chapel's clock tower and descended 8.6 metres (28.2 ft) into the ground using the shaft which {{contained}} the ropes and weights for the clock. They found that the weights which used to hang down the <b>shaft,</b> and the <b>chains,</b> had been removed. This left an empty shaft which extended from the clock to the cellars below. After the previous escape attempts by Cazaumayo and Paille, the doors (one on each floor) which had provided access to the tower, had been bricked up in order to prevent further escape attempts. However, by sealing up the tower the Germans had in essence provided a secure location where escape tunnel work could be done without notice. The French this time gained access to the tower from the attics, descended 35 m to the cellars, and began work on a horizontal shaft in June 1941. This shaft work would continue for a further eight months.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} part of the USQ Motorsport team entry in its first Formula SAE-A competition. The project aim is to design the drivetrain, brakes and wheels of the car which was the focus of {{developed}} in this project. The design must also be optimized to provide for a competitive racing car. The investigation into these areas starts with research into the possible systems available to be adapted to the racing car. The interfaces between each area of the racing car means working {{with other members of the}} team to decide on viable options is required. Teamwork is therefore essential for the success of the overall project to complete the construction and perform well at the Formula SAE-A competition. A design is developed for the drivetrain and detailed analysis of the design is conducted. The main component of the drivetrain is the centre shaft which is analysed to find the stresses and fatigue life. Associated components of the drivetrain such as rear sprocket, <b>chain,</b> bearings, half <b>shafts</b> and <b>chain</b> tensioner are also designed to complete the drivetrain assembly. The brakes and wheels have also started with background research followed by a detailed selection process to find the best option. Consideration is also required as to how all the components will fit together to provide a car that is well designed and has good performance characteristics. The finial construction and procurement of the components making up the drivetrain, brakes and wheels was on track for completion to enter the Formula SAE-A competition...|$|R
5000|$|The HM.14 was {{designed}} by French radio engineer Henri Mignet. It {{was the result of}} his ambition to design a safe aeroplane that could be built quickly and cheaply by any amateur familiar with simple woodwork and metalwork skills. It followed a progressive series of designs, of which the HM.8 monoplane was already successful as an amateur-built aircraft. On 10 September 1933, at the Bois de Bouleaux near Soissons, Mignet piloted the first flight of the HM.14. In the following months, he made many flights with progressive modifications to improve its handling and performance, totalling 10 hours test-flying time. He described the HM.14 as his Pou no.4, presumably counting from the HM.11, that featured a large pivoting flap between the fixed front and rear wings. The prototype HM.14 had a wingspan of 6 m. It was powered by an Aubier et Dunne 540 cc three-cylinder two-stroke motorcycle engine, producing about [...] at 4,000 rpm. The engine was connected to the propeller <b>shaft</b> via a <b>chain</b> drive with a 2.5:1 reduction ratio. Subsequent examples were built with many optional engine and wingspan variations.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front sprocket shaft was pressed against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus driving the sprocket <b>shaft,</b> the drive <b>chains</b> and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The front sprocket drive shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller {{to move away from}} the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|R
40|$|Design {{is the key}} {{activity}} in the generation of successful products. Without attention to the requirements and specification, generation and selection of a suitable concept and appropriate detailed design and manufacture, products {{will not be able}} to compete effectively in the market place. This book explores the process of design with specific emphasis on mechanical items. This includes consideration of the design and selection of components that involve relative motion to each other such as bearings, <b>shafts,</b> gears, belts, <b>chains,</b> dynamic seals, clutches and brakes. In addition a number of essential machine elements such as fasteners, springs, static seals, casings, sensors and actuators, which allow the implementation of useful devices, are included. The emphasis in the text is on the reader acquiring useful skills and developing understanding. Most applications of design do not result in single answers. This realistic insight has been recognised in the development of the material presented and many of the worked examples and worksheet questions do not have unique solutions. Instead a possible answer is offered to allow the reader to develop their understanding and insight and as confidence and abilities increase, alternative solutions can be explored. The book is supported, if adopted as a course textbook by approximately 2000 lecture slides, worked solutions for worksheet questions and a number of spreadsheets to speed up some of the analysis or design procedures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Increasing energy {{efficiency}} of the manufacturing process {{is one of the}} solutions to resolve the ecological issues, save manufacturing cost, and reduce environmental impacts. In crank <b>shaft’s</b> manufacturing process <b>chain,</b> the potential of energy saving is great due to the induction heating line and heat loss from the process. This paper proposes the method to increase {{energy efficiency}} of induction heating line which spends most of the energy in a whole crankshaft manufacturing process. To reduce the heat loss from work piece, an insulating system was designed through the analysis of heat flow. The optimization of the heating parameters was done based on the simulation model with the multi criteria optimization method. In addition, this work also addresses a concept of holistic optimization approach to decrease energy consumption in the manufacturing process of crankshaft. The optimization approach in conjunction with design of experiment, analytical method, regression, and the robust optimization algorithm was applied in order to systematically optimize manufacturing processes. The optimization process aims to identify significant process parameters, determine potential solutions, and obtain optimal parameters. The energy flow of sub-process, including heating line, shearing, and forging is carried out in terms of a holistic approach, i. e. in consideration of the interrelationship between energy consumption and relevant criteria (cycle time, manufacturing costs, product quality). The optimized results show that the induction heating line can increase 14. 8 % in energy efficiency, of which 9 % is due to the effect of insulating cover and 5. 8 % is due to process parameter optimization and the forging process chain can reduce approximately 10 % in energy consumption. This paper contributes to improve the energy {{efficiency of the}} crank shaft’s manufacturing process...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Wolverhampton April 2013 Abstract This thesis examines {{the development of}} health and safety in the British coalmining industry {{in the period of}} rapid expansion 1840 to 1913 through a case study of the Warwickshire coalfield. It will assess the contribution of the miner, the coalowners and the State to improvements to mine safety. Although historians have been attracted to this period of coalfield expansion, they have tended to concentrate upon the complex economics necessary for success or the fractious record of industrial relations, with health and safety marginalised to the periphery. They have also mainly taken their exemplars from the important coal exporting activities of the North-East and South Wales, together with the larger coalfields of Scotland, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. By studying the Warwickshire fatalities and comparing that experience with the neighbouring counties of the East Midlands and national data, this thesis will reveal how local factors influenced safety in the mines. The individual miner had little influence upon mine safety in the period 1840 through to the mid 1870 's when the sub-contracting butty system removed owners from the responsibilities of production. The establishment of a permanent Warwickshire Miners’ Association from the 1880 ’s, characterised by moderate leadership who sought to work closely with employers, gained for the Warwickshire miner superior earnings and conditions of employment, even when compared to neighbouring coalfields in the prosperous Midland Division. This undermines the national caricature of coalowners as brutal capitalists with little regard for their workers or communities where they gained their wealth. The results showed conclusively that it was not the mode of management but the size of the enterprise that was the dominating factor. Fatalities increased in the large deep mines that became more common {{at the turn of the}} century and were more susceptible to deaths from falls of coal and men crushed by wagons on the surface. The role of the State was somewhat patchy. Mine Inspectors could recommend that horses employed in oncost haulage should work in <b>shafts</b> rather than <b>chains</b> and that low tension batteries should be used to bring down coal, but owners were free to ignore this advice, with fatal consequences to the workforce. They were more successful in promoting the professionalization of mine management and at the turn of the century legislation was the dominant factor in the adoption of patent explosives to replace the use of gunpowder in Warwickshire mines. This thesis builds upon recent studies by McIvor and Mills which have sought to address this neglect of health and safety in the British coal mining industry. By approaching this through the study of a small coalfield that has largely been ignored by mining historians, it reveals how local factors influenced the contribution of the miner, the coalowner and the State to the problem of accidents and fatalities in the coal industry...|$|R
