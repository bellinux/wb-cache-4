2500|$|In March 2005, in {{reaction}} to Greenspan's <b>support</b> of President <b>Bush's</b> plan to partially privatize Social Security, then-Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid attacked Greenspan as [...] "one of the biggest political hacks we have in Washington" [...] and criticized him for <b>supporting</b> <b>Bush's</b> 2001 tax cut plan. Then-Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi added that there were {{serious questions about the}} Fed's independence as a result of Greenspan's public statements. Greenspan also received criticism from Democratic Congressman Barney Frank and others for <b>supporting</b> <b>Bush's</b> Social Security plans favoring private accounts. Greenspan had said Bush's model has [...] "the seeds of developing full funding by its very nature. As I've said before, I've always supported moves to full funding {{in the context of a}} private account".|$|R
50|$|Cato {{scholars}} {{were critical}} of George W. Bush's Republican administration (2001-2009) on several issues, including education, and excessive government spending.

50|$|President Bush himself, seen as {{the leader}} and face of the Republican party, was a large factor in the 2006 election. Exit polls showed that a large block of the {{electorate}} had voted for Democrats or for third parties specifically because of personal opposition to or dislike for Bush. The size of the segment that said it had voted specifically to <b>support</b> <b>Bush</b> was not as large. Opposition to Bush {{was based on a}} number of factors, these not limited to opposition to his Social Security privatization plan, the slow response of his administration to Hurricane Katrina, his perceived inaction in the face of and association with rising gas prices, and as mentioned above, his continued commitment to the war.|$|E
50|$|Trump {{had high}} poll numbers during the primaries. A survey {{conducted}} by The Economist/YouGov released July 9, 2015, {{was the first major}} nationwide poll to show Trump as the 2016 Republican presidential front-runner. A Suffolk/USA Today poll released on July 14, 2015, showed Trump with 17 percent support among Republican voters, with Jeb Bush at 14 percent. A Washington Post/ABC News poll taken on July 16-19, showed Trump had 24 percent Republican support, over Scott Walker at 13 percent. A CNN/ORC poll showed Trump in the lead at 18 percent support among Republican voters, over Jeb Bush at 15 percent, and a CBS News poll from August 4 showed Trump with 24 percent <b>support,</b> <b>Bush</b> second at 13 percent, and Walker third at 10 percent.|$|E
5000|$|Another Scripps Howard Texas Poll was {{conducted}} from August 12 to August 27, 1998. It indicated that 77% of likely voters <b>support</b> <b>Bush,</b> 20% favored Mauro, and 1% supported Libertarian candidate Lester Turlington Jr. About 10% were undecided and 2% didn't answer. Again, Bush's approval rating barely fell and was 74% of Texans remarked {{that he was}} doing a good to excellent job as governor. Allan Saxe, an assistant political science professor at the University of Texas said, [...] "Now he's ahead Bush by an awfully huge margin. If Garry Mauro can close that to a 10 to 15 percent difference by election day, it will be a symbolic victory. But {{it will be hard to}} do [...] - [...] a 50-point difference is a big one." [...] Among Hispanics, Bush led Mauro 51%-31%, down from 67%-20% in June.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout {{the entire}} campaign, George W. Bush led {{in the polls}} by wide margins. After Garry Mauro {{declared}} his candidacy in November 1997, a Scripps Howard Texas Poll of 793 registered voters showed George W. Bush leading by 68%-16%, with 14% undecided. George Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said, [...] "The philosophical differences between Gov. Bush and Garry Mauro are clear and stark. Gov. Bush is a conservative, as most Texans are, and Garry Mauro is a liberal." [...] In mid-June 1998, a Scripps Howard Texas Poll was conducted with George W. Bush versus Garry Mauro. The poll showed 70% likely voters <b>support</b> <b>Bush,</b> 17% favored Mauro, 11% were undecided, and 2% would vote for neither. Bush's approval rating was also virtually unchanged polling at 75%. In response to the poll, government professor at the University of Texas in Austin said, [...] "Gov. Bush looks to be unbeatable, but there's enough time for anything to happen. There is a slim chance for Mauro but still a real chance for him to reach voters with ad dollars and issue choices. It's just too early to call the November election in June." ...|$|E
40|$|Since the 2000 presidential election, voter {{education}} and mobilization have witnessed a renaissance in targeted contact and segmented messaging. Candidates, political parties, {{and interest groups}} {{have taken advantage of}} advances in electronic databases to divide and subdivide the electorate into different groups and have different messages and messengers for each subgroup of voters. This article takes up {{the question of whether or}} not personalized or segmented contact during a campaign is more successful at convincing voters than “generic ” contact or no contact at all. Using data from a national survey of Latino registered voters in 2004, the authors examine the impact of being contacted by a coethnic messenger on support for the Republican and Democratic Parties. While some previous studies have examined voter turnout or vote choice, this article examines the deeper implications of coethnic contact, including support for public policy and candidate favorability. The authors find that when Latinos were contacted by non-Latino Republicans, they were significantly less likely to <b>support</b> <b>Bush</b> and Republican issues, but when Latinos were contacted by Latino Republicans, they were significantly more likely to <b>support</b> <b>Bush</b> and Republican issues. Democratic contact did not have a significant effect on support for Democratic policy, which remained very high among Latino voters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Translocation and {{reintroduction}} {{of species}} {{back to their}} former range is an excellent goal but reintroductions can only be achieved successfully with extensive knowledge of the different factors controlling species distributions. This study investigates the factors controlling {{the distribution of the}} bush rat (Rattus fuscipes). The Sydney Basin Region of Australia contains core habitats that <b>support</b> <b>bush</b> rat populations but bush rats tend not to be found in habitats heavily modified by humans. The absence of bush rats in these habitats could be due to habitat modification, or due to the increased presence of an invasive competitor, the black rat (Rattus rattus). The first goal of this research was to identify habitat characteristics associated with high density bush rat populations. The second goal was to test if there is a negative association between the distribution of bush rats and a potential competitor, the black rat. To test for habitats associated with high density bush rat populations, habitats were surveyed over 22 sites in national parks surrounding Sydney. High and low densities of bush rat data were identified using the Wildlife Atlas. Field records of surveys covered 21 habitat variables. I found that the only significant habitat variable predicting the presence of bush rats was the presence of percent timber greater than 5 cm in the ground cover. To test negative associations between bush rats and black rats, I collected records from Living Atlas of Australia within the Sydney Basin Region. Records covered 39 areas where longitude and latitude bearings grouped to give individual trap lines over 30 years. I found that bush rats and black rats have broadly overlapping distributions. However, bush rats and black rats tend not to coexist in the same place at the same time. My results suggest that competition with black rats can limit the distribution of bush rats. My studies demonstrate that habitats with complex understory cover (fallen timber) and the absence of black rat competitors both promote the presence of bush rats in a habitat. Both habitat quality and invasive competitors will impact the success of reintroductions of bush rats within urban habitat fragments...|$|E
