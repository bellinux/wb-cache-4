5|$|At 02:30 on 26 March, the {{regiment}} {{set out from}} Dier El Belah towards Gaza. The division was to circle the town, cutting off any escape route east and provide a blocking force to stop Turkish reinforcements, while the 53rd (Welsh) Division and a brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division carried out a frontal assault. Positioned at the Humra mound in the east with the 4th and 11th Squadrons, {{the regiment}} was assigned to watch for Turkish reinforcement coming from Huj. The main attack was not progressing well, so the brigade, {{along with the rest}} of the division, was ordered to attack Gaza. <b>Still</b> <b>watching</b> out for Turkish reinforcements, the regiment was held in reserve. The brigade had made good progress and was inside the town when it was ordered to withdraw. Less the 4th Squadron, which was the division's rearguard, the regiment had returned to Dier El Belah by early the next day.|$|E
25|$|Jacobs {{wandered in}} {{northern}} California and Mexico {{for several years}} under several aliases, taking drugs and drinking heavily. He was almost captured once in California, but escaped by climbing out a window and escaping across a roof. Jacobs traveled to Canada, where his older brother was attending Simon Fraser University. The two did not meet often, {{in part because they}} looked alike but also because the FBI and Royal Canadian Mounted Police were <b>still</b> <b>watching</b> Robert in the hopes JJ would visit him. Jacobs first settled on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and worked at planting trees—donating most of his money to the building of a Buddhist temple on nearby Saltspring Island.|$|E
25|$|By June, Kanga Force {{was largely}} {{concentrated}} at Wau, {{although there were}} elements of the 2/1st and 2/5th spread {{out as far as}} Bulwa, and elements of the NGVR at Mapos. The NGVR was <b>still</b> <b>watching</b> the Salamaua sector from Mubo, whilst other elements were covering the inland routes from the Markham and Wampit Rivers. As Major Fleay attempted to juggle his forces and relieve the exhausted NGVR detachments, his orders from higher were clarified and work began on planning a number of raids in the area. At this stage it was believed that there were up to 2,000 Japanese troops at Lae and another 250 at Salamua. Against this Kanga Force had a frontage of 700 men, although only 450 were fit for battle. Additionally, the requirement to defend the numerous tracks through the Bulolo Valley meant that Fleay had even less resources to achieve his mission.|$|E

[...] With most of the security personnel <b>still</b> <b>watching</b> the gates per Mike Veeck's orders, {{there was almost no}} one guarding the playing surface. Soon, the first of what would be thousands of attendees rushed onto the field, causing Kravec to flee the mound and join his teammates in a barricaded clubhouse. [...] Between 5,000and 7,000people are estimated to have taken the field. Some climbed the foul poles, others set records on fire, or ripped up the grass. [...] The batting cage was destroyed; the bases were pulled up and stolen. Among those taking the field was 21-year-old aspiring actor Michael Clarke Duncan; during the melee, Duncan slid into third base, had a silver belt buckle stolen, and went home with a bat from the dugout. As Bill Veeck stood with a microphone near where home plate had been, begging people to return to the stands, a bonfire raged in center field.|$|E

2500|$|The whole force {{arrived at}} their {{positions}} without a hitch, {{and with the}} enemy <b>still</b> <b>watching</b> the moving figures and the numerous camp fires of the Japanese across the river. [...] It {{was one of the}} cleverest exhibitions of strategy displayed during the whole war. [...] The right column crossed the river before daylight, leaving a detachment at the camping grounds to keep up the camp fires; and all were now in position ready for the attack. [...] With the first rays of morning, the Chinese were on the alert, and opened fire with great bravado on the decoy troops left across the river. [...] This was to the Japanese the signal for action. [...] Scarcely had the smoke cleared away when the detachment which had occupied the position {{to the rear of the}} Chinese on the river bank was down on the insurgents with a rush. [...] The Chinese, too surprised to make any defence, were terror-stricken. [...] They jumped into the river, ran right and left, even on to the bayonets of their opponents. [...] Simultaneously, the second detachment began to climb the hill at the back of the fort of Hakkezan. [...] The surprised garrison poured a rifle fire upon them, but the detachment did not hesitate. [...] On the contrary, bayonets were fixed and a determined charge made, until the fort was entered, and the Chinese deserting the big guns still loaded, were climbing over the walls and plunging down the hillside in full flight.|$|E
