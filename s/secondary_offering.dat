40|$|We {{investigate}} whether {{the sale of}} secondary shares in the IPO process is affected by an issuing firm's market-timing and window-dressing activities. We find that <b>secondary</b> share <b>offerings</b> in IPOs exhibit positive autocorrelation, and the positive autocorrelation is mainly affected by the overall stock market return. Similar to the IPO wave, {{this finding suggests that}} favorable market conditions attract existing pre-IPO shareholders to sell their shares in IPOs and cause the clustering of <b>secondary</b> share <b>offering</b> in IPOs. In addition, we find that window dressing has a significant effect on both the probability of <b>secondary</b> share <b>offering</b> and the proportion of secondary shares offered in an IPO. The result is robust after controlling for firm age, industry affiliation, and other factors. Our result also indicates that the number of firms <b>offering</b> <b>secondary</b> shares in IPOs, the probability of <b>secondary</b> share <b>offerings,</b> and the proportion of secondary shares offered in IPOs are significantly lower in the Internet bubble period.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>offerings</b> (SOs) on the liquidity and trading activity of stocks outstanding. The results reveal that liquidity and trading activity increase after the execution of SOs. We observe that the offering discount is explained {{by the size of}} the offering and its retail composition. We have also shown that changes in liquidity and trading activity are explained by the retail composition of the offering, such that the choice of ownership structure is decisive in the level of liquidity afforded by SOs. The offering discount is one of the chosen methods of attracting small-scale investors and promoting share liquidity following these operations. <b>secondary</b> <b>offerings</b> (SOs), liquidity, trading activity, microstructure, capital structure...|$|R

A <b>secondary</b> <b>offering</b> is an offering of securities by a shareholder of the company (as opposed to the company itself, which is a primary offering). A follow on offering is preceded by release of prospectus similar to IPO: a Follow-on Public Offer (FPO).|$|E

5000|$|A {{secondary}} market offering {{should not be}} confused with a follow-on offering, otherwise known as a subsequent offering, or a dilutive <b>secondary</b> <b>offering.</b> In a follow-on offering, the company itself places new shares onto the market, thus diluting the existing shares. [...] "Secondary market offering" [...] can be understood as an offering on the {{secondary market}}, and is thus different from a <b>secondary</b> <b>offering</b> on the primary market — in other words, an offering following an initial, primary-market offering. A follow-on offering which is the second offering from a company can be understood as a <b>secondary</b> <b>offering</b> on a primary market, which is where the confusion between a dilutive (follow-on) and a non-dilutive secondary market offering possibly comes from. If a company were to make a third, primary-market offering, this would be a follow-on offering which is not a secondary market offering. [...] "Secondary offering" [...] as described in this article is an offering on the secondary market which is non-dilutive, and is thus not a follow-on offering.|$|E
