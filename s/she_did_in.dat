5|$|Carpenter {{supported}} {{the movement for}} the higher education of women, and had always {{supported the}} feminist cause {{but for most of}} her life would not do so publicly, believing that the unpopularity of the movement for women's suffrage might damage her educational and penal reforms. But <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> 1877, the year of her death, appear on a public platform in Bristol, supporting the Bristol and West of England Society for Women’s Suffrage. She was invited for an interview with Queen Victoria and Florence Nightingale at Windsor Castle in 1868.|$|E

5|$|SS Great Britain is {{a museum}} ship and former {{passenger}} steamship, which was advanced for her time. She {{was the longest}} passenger ship in the world from 1845 to 1854. She was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Great Western Steamship Company's transatlantic service between Bristol and New York. While other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a screw propeller, Great Britain {{was the first to}} combine these features in a large ocean-going ship. She was the first iron steamer to cross the Atlantic, which <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> 1845, in the time of 14 days.|$|E
5|$|By 1823 Cofresí was {{probably}} on {{the crew of the}} corsair barquentine El Scipión, captained by José Ramón Torres and managed by his cousin (the first mayor of Mayagüez, José María Ramírez de Arellano). Historians agree, since several of his friends and family members benefited from the sale of stolen goods. Cofresí may have joined to evade the authorities, honing skills he would use later in life. El Scipión employed questionable tactics later associated with the pirate, such as flying the flag of Gran Colombia so other ships would lower their guard (as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> capturing the British frigate Aurora and the American brigantine Otter). The capture of Otter led to a court order requiring restitution, affecting the crew. At this time, Cofresí turned to piracy. Although the reasons behind his decision are unclear, several theories have been proposed by researchers. In Orígenes portorriqueños Ramírez Brau speculates that Cofresí's time aboard El Scipión, or seeing a family member become a privateer, may have influenced his decision to become a pirate after the crew's pay was threatened by the lawsuit. According to Ursula Acosta, a lack of work for privateers ultimately pushed Cofresí into piracy.|$|E
5|$|In April 1979, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, {{a teacher}} from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship. They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, which <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980. The {{settlement}} included two houses, {{and financial support}} for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen. McCain's children did not attend, and several years would pass before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} season, Kommandøren served the tourist trade in Sogn, while she sailed the regular passenger/cargo routes {{during the winter}} months. Kommandøren was {{generally}} used as an express route ship, often carrying patients {{on their way to}} treatment. Amongst the cargo carried by was often live animals, including horses, cattle and sheep. During one of her trips, Kommandøren ran aground on 20 October 1900 near Tjugum in Balestrand. The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, like <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> September 1920, when she brought politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project. Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, Kommandøren provided transport support to a large-scale Norwegian Army field exercise in Western Norway. She was tasked with transporting troops from Gudvangen to Lærdalsøyri after the completion of the exercises.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Cortana is not {{explained}} in the video games, but in the Halo novels. Her first chronological appearance in the story is in , a 2001 prequel to the first Halo game. Dr. Halsey allows Cortana to choose which SPARTAN-II soldier to accompany on an upcoming mission; Cortana picks the Master Chief, whom she believes is her best match. Cortana makes a reference to this event via voiceover in Halo 3 during a cinematic before gameplay begins. Cortana and the Spartans are assigned a near-suicidal mission: to take the cruiser Pillar of Autumn to the home world of the Covenant, an alliance of alien races, and capture one of their Prophets to force a truce. Cortana's role is {{to act as a}} mission specialist, hacking the Covenant systems and piloting the captured Covenant ship. Before the mission, Cortana helps the Master Chief to survive the near-lethal exercises designed to test the Chief's MJOLNIR battle armor. Afterward, she plants incriminating evidence in the files of Colonel Ackerson, the ONI operative who nearly killed both of them, as revenge. When the Covenant attacks the planet Reach, one of the largest planetary military bases besides Earth, Cortana guides the Pillar of Autumn based on star charts on a Forerunner tablet, thus bringing them to Halo. During , Cortana serves the same role <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Halo: Combat Evolved, but her role is expanded such as showing her saving the Master Chief's life from a Flood Infection Form at one point.|$|E

25|$|In 1796, Dussek and {{his wife}} began having serious marital troubles. In an account of {{uncertain}} veracity, {{it was reported that}} Sophia, who {{had fallen in love with}} another man, asked Dussek for money to repair her harp. She then used the money to leave the house, removing her belongings in her harp case, and claiming to have left for dinner with a female friend. A suspicious Dussek went with his father-in-law to the man's house, where Sophia locked herself in. She and Dussek argued, and she cursed him, claiming to be pregnant by the other man. Dussek, relenting, promised her freedom to do what she wanted; this led to a reconciliation of sorts. It seems unlikely that Dussek ever saw Sophia and his daughter Olivia after he left London in 1799; Sophia had to wait until she knew Dussek had died before she could remarry, which <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> 1812.|$|E
