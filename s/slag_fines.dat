40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the properties of solid wastes coming from an industrial-scale pressurized entrained-flow gasifier, by means of a combination of techniques: elemental, granulometric and X-ray diffraction analyses, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The results are critically discussed in the light of the different regimes of char-slag micromechanical interaction and of the different phases that are established in the gasification chamber. The discussion allows to give useful insights concerning the properties and partitioning of carbon among the three main sources (coarse slag, <b>slag</b> <b>fines,</b> fly ash) of solid residues coming from the gasifier: in particular, differences between coarse slag and <b>slag</b> <b>fines</b> are highlighted, though these wastes are generated from the same main-stream. Furthermore, it is observed that residual carbon in slag granules is present in a segregated embedded form, while <b>slag</b> <b>fines</b> are composed of both porous (high-carbon) and compact (low-carbon) material.

40|$|Abstract Steel-slag is a {{residual}} {{product of the}} steel industry that has potential ability to pollute the ground water and soil containing heavy metals. To overcome this problem, {{attempts have been made}} for using the slag as substitute for both coarse and fine aggregates in concrete. The solidification process will prevent the metal components from polluting the water and soil. Test results on the mechanical properties of slag-concrete showed that while the compression strength of slag-concrete increased significantly as a function of slag-to-natural aggregate’s use, the tensile strength dropped accordingly. The substitution of fine-slag to Muntilan sand was even more negative, the compression strength decreased as a function of slag use.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} about the complex phenomenology associated with the interaction of a particle-laden turbulent flow with the slag-covered wall of an entrained-flow gasifier. Recent observations, indeed, highlighted that this phenomenology can have an impact on the global gasifier performance greater than that expected from previous analyses. The design of new generation of entrained-flow coal gasifiers aims at favoring ash migration/deposition onto the reactor walls, whence the molten ash (slag) flows and is eventually drained separately at the bottom of the gasifier. In terms of efficiency, the oxidation of the volatile compounds released around the particles depends upon its mixing with the fresh oxidant mixture. Therefore combustion efficiency is influenced by the spatial distribution of the particle phase, with an homogeneous distributions favoring a better mixing. From the observation that a significant number of coal particles can spent most of the time in the gasifier close to the slag layer, where usually their concentration largely increase, leads to the need to understand the effective conditions experienced before complete conversion. An experimental evidence of a picture for the fate of coal particles has been recently assessed by analyzing the chemical composition of samples of coarse slag and <b>slag</b> <b>fines</b> generated in the ELCOGAS entrained-flow gasifier located in Puertollano, Ciudad Real (Spain). Quantitative SEM-EDX analysis of the coarse slag revealed the presence of small marks with a significant carbon content as high as 48. 8 %- 54. 2 %. This fact can be explained by assuming the entrapment of not fully burned coal particles into the slag. The results of the SEM analysis performed on whole <b>slag</b> <b>fines</b> particles showed that the carbon content was larger than the value obtained from the inspection of coarse slag particles. This is particularly evident for porous particles where C-content ranged between 82. 3 % and 86. 5 %. A considerable amount of unreacted coal is therefore entrapped into the slag matrix. From this observations emerges that a certain level of spatial non homogeneity of the solid phase distribution exists. In a recently published study by Montagnaro and Salatino (2010), these data have been interpreted by assuming that different regimes of particles-slag interaction can occur: either char entrapment inside the melt or carbon-coverage of the slag may occur, depending on properties like char density, particle diameter and impact velocity, slag viscosity, interfacial particle-slag tension. Occurrence of char entrapment prevents further progress of combustion/gasification. On the contrary, if char particles reaching the wall adhere to the slag layer's surface without being fully engulfed, the progress of combustion/gasification is still permitted. The observed high rate of coal conversion can actually be explained only if this second regime establishes on the slag surface. The addressed considerations highlights the technological need to build up methods for the prediction of the mechanism particles clustering and segregation in condition representative of coal particle flying and converting into a gasifier. Actually a comprehensive numerical simulation of the whole range of spatial and temporal chemical and turbulent time scales involved in a full scale gasifier, is still unfeasible due to the high computational cost: the scales of turbulence involved in the gasification processes range from sub-micron scale up to the integral scale of a gasifier reactor chamber (of the order of tens of meters). To overcome this difficulty, the approach proposed in this study is based on the development of a multilevel approach [...] In a first level, the motion of particles representing classes of partially converted coal in a 3 -dimensional representation of the gasifier is modeled with a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approach [...] Turbulence of the flow field is described adopting the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approach, while particle motion is resolved with a Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) approach. The use of the RANS method for the gas phase coupled with the LPT for the solid phase in this analysis is twofold. Firstly it has been used to address the behavior of coarse and fine coal particles trajectories when subjected to a swirl motion which induced a turbulent field. This model, while avoiding the great complexity and computational effort required by comprehensive numerical CFD models of gasifiers already proposed in the literature, is sufficient to characterize the range of conditions, in terms of momentum possessed and direction, that the different particles show when approaching the gasifier walls. The second aspect concerns the identification of regions where different mechanisms for the coal clustering becomes foreseeable: distinct regions close to the wall have been identified: finer particles could be mainly responsible of particle layering near the solid walls as they, after their first impinging on the wall, assumes a pathway parallel to the wall; in contrast, larger particles continue to bounce over the walls along the whole length of the gasifier. The identification of these two different regions and the characterization of particle classes representative of partially burned coal particles, was the basis for the proper setup of numerical simulations based on a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach in two completely different configurations. This level aims at a detailed investigation of the mechanisms of slag-particle interaction. The first is a plane particle-laden channel flow, that well represents the main features of the gasifier regions where particles move parallel to the wall. The second is a periodic particle laden curved channel flow, that best represent regions close to the wall but dominated by the external swirling flow. For these two configurations the particle interaction with the slag has been treated as a rebound on a not perfectly elastic wall. A parametric study has been conducted obtaining results for different particle sizes (representing different particle inertia) and different momentum restitution in the particle-wall impact. Numerical multiphase simulations are based on the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach implemented in the OpenFOAM CFD framework. Both RANS and LES turbulence models are implemented for the gas phase. The equations of particles motion were solved via a Lagrangian particle tracking algorithm with the TrackToFace method. Simulations were performed involving a number of particles from 10 ^ 5 to 10 ^ 6, a level of detail that allowed to obtain a clear picture of the multiphase flow behavior responsible for char deposition phenomena. Numerical simulation results with the LES approach do confirm the establishment of a region near the wall slag layer (the dense-dispersed phase leading to the formation of the <b>slag</b> <b>fines),</b> in which particles impacting the slag accumulate to an extent depending on the system fluid-dynamics and on parameters such as particles Stokes number and restitution coefficient. However, particle concentration near the wall in all the simulated cases does not appear perfectly steady not evenly spatially distributed. Interestingly, the segregation of char particles near the wall is more evident for the curved channel flow geometry and is enhanced for coarser particles, making evident the role played by the effective impact with the slag not recovered by the simpler models adopted in the RANS simulations...|$|E
40|$|The slag tapped from AOD (Argon Oxygen Decarburization) {{converter}} disintegrates, sometimes, during cooling. <b>Slag</b> <b>fines</b> {{from the}} disintegration {{are difficult to}} handle and to use as materials for construction purposes. In our early research work, AOD slag samples were modified by agents containing B or P elements. Different slag cooling procedures were also used, including cooling inside crucibles after re-melting and granulation by water and gas. By the modification, the slag samples gained the volume stability and mechanical properties required for its utilization as construction materials. Different types of stainless steel slag from Outokumpu Stainless Company {{have been used to}} manufacture environmentally sound and ce-marked construction products. Fluorine leaching from some of the AOD slag samples were investigated. In some other steelmaking processes, such as hot metal pretreatment, secondary steel refining and the production of high alloyed steels, fluorite can be charged as a slag forming agent, with some F and CaF 2 existing in the slag. When these slags are reused as road construction or landfill materials, a potential fluorine contamination to the ground water may occur. The present research work is carried out regarding both the volume stability and F-immobilization for AOD slag samples. The studied slag samples consist of new ones from plant gas granulation tests and some old ones from our early studies. Compositions and cooling conditions are selected as main parameters for slag tests using laboratory equipment. Samples from the plant and laboratory slag tests are characterized by XRD, SEM and leaching with EN 12457 - 2 / 3. Formations of mineral phases for F-immobilization in the slag samples are also predict using FACTSAGE program. Results from the present study indicate that the chemical composition and cooling condition for a slag are the two important parameters to control F leaching. These two parameters should be considered together in an optimum way to treat the slag for fluorine immobilization. It may be possible, based on the results obtained, to develop some environmental friendly and cost effective methods for the stainless steel industry to treat the AOD slag. Some slag products with high volume stability and minimum F-dissolution may thus be obtained to use as construction materials for saving valuable natural resources.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of liquid}} slag in the mould {{is one of}} the key research areas of the continuous steel casting process. Numerical simulations of steel casting in the mould equipped with submerged entry nozzle, intended for slab casting, have been carried out within the study. For modelling the behaviour of the interfaces of the liquid steel - liquid slag - air system, the VOF method was employed. In the conducted simulations, seven different procedures for the discretization of the interface of individual phases were tested. The computation results have revealed that the “entrapment” of <b>fine</b> <b>slag</b> portions into liquid steel occurs in the system under investigation; the cause of this phenomenon is explicated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz theory...|$|R

The green high performance concrete mixtures were prepared using 10  % of micro silica as cement replacement, 30  % of copper <b>slag</b> as <b>fine</b> aggregate replacement and hooked end steel fibres were incorporated at 1. 0  % volume fraction. All the specimens were frozen and thawed for 25 cycles, following which the impact strength of the frozen and thawed specimens was determined. Due to the variations in impact test results, a reliability analysis was carried out using two parameter Weibull distribution and its Weibull parameters were determined using two methods viz., Energy pattern factor method (EFM) and Method of Moments (MOM). Furthermore, impact strength in terms of reliability was reported using the average value of Weibull parameters obtained from these two methods. The results revealed that impact resistance of GHPPC and GHPFRC specimens subjected to 25 cycles of freeze and thaw in water containing 3 % NaCl solution was significantly reduced.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{investigation}} {{in this research}} work is to maintain the eco-balance by preventing the open site dumping of the Blast furnace slag (BFS), a by-product {{in the process of}} cement production is an industrial waste, causing environmental pollution and prevention of sand mining by the replacement of <b>Slag</b> for <b>fine</b> aggregates in ferrocement. Sand mining has led to the danger of river-course change and causing floods. This replacement has been found to improve the strength characteristics of ferrocement and also makes it lightweight. This not only helps in construction of multi storied structures but also found to maintain thermal comfort. The main investigation is regarding the percentage replacement of sand by BFS and reinforcing with meshes. It is observed that the ultimate strength reaches a peak value and later decreases due to replacement of BFS. Marginal decrease in ultimate strength with increase in mesh content has also been observed. Further, with the cracks developed parallel to the mesh layers, the weak planes are generated along the mesh layer which has hastened the failure. The experimental results are analysed and a theoretical solution has been developed for the computation of stress corresponding to strain...|$|R

Two replacement ratio of binder were considered {{in this study}} and ten types of binder mix were designed to conduct experiment. And cementitious materials with self-healing capability were prepared in order to apply for theses mortars. Each specimen was manufactured into 3 cm diameter with 5 cm height in cylindrical mould. After demolding, specimens were water cured for 28 days. All specimens were immersed into 3 % concentrated solution for 60 days and solutions were replaced regularly in consider with loss of sulfuric acid concentration. Mass change of all specimens was measured after removing detached particles gently. From 60 days observation, it was shown that specimens with ACBFS performed high resistance to sulfuric acid attack compared to normal fine aggregates in same binder mix.

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{environmental}} protection agencies and the government are to seek ways and means to minimize the problems of disposal and health hazards of byproducts. Some of the industrial byproducts have been successfully used in the construction industry for the production of cement and concrete. Copper slag is one of the materials that is considered as a waste material which could have a promising future in construction industry as partial substitute of either cement or aggregates. Many researchers have already found it possible to use copper slag as a concrete aggregate. But not much research has been carried out concerning durability and corrosion studies of copper slag admixed concrete. This paper presents the results of an experimental study on various corrosion and durability tests on concrete containing copper slag as partial replacement of sand and cement. For this research work, M 20 grade concrete was used and the tests were conducted for various proportions of copper slag replacement with sand of 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, and 60 %, cement of 0 %, 5 %, 15 % and 20 % and combination of both (60 % sand + 40 % copper <b>slag</b> for <b>fine</b> aggregate and 85 % cement+ 15 % copper slag for cement) in concrete.

40|$|The study investigates use of {{dolomite}} sand waste as filler or/and sand material plus blast {{oxygen furnace}} steel <b>slag</b> as <b>fine</b> and coarse aggregate for design of high performance asphalt concrete. Both {{environmental and economic}} factors contribute to the growing need {{for the use of}} these materials in asphalt concrete pavements. This is particularly important for Latvia, where local crushed dolomite and sandstone do not fulfill the requirements for mineral aggregate in high and medium intensity asphalt pavements roads. Annually 100 – 200 thousand tons of steel slag aggregates are produced in Latvia. However, it has not been used extensively in asphalt pavement despite of its high performance characteristics. Dolomite sand waste, which is a byproduct of crushed dolomite production, is another widely available polydisperse by-product in Latvia. Its quantity has reached a million of tons and is rapidly increasing. This huge quantity of technological waste needs to be recycled with maximum efficiency. Various combinations of steel slag, dolomite sand waste and conventional aggregates were used to develop asphalt concrete AC 11 mixtures.
